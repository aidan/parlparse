I think the hon.

 My right hon. Friend is absolutely correct. I plan to meet the First Minister, the CBI and the Scottish Trades Union Congress in Scotland next month to discuss those and other issues. Further education colleges in Scotland support about half a million Scots every year, including in Lanarkshire. It is essential that those who are unemployed in Scotland, those who need retraining and those who need apprenticeships can gain from those apprenticeships, and that the necessary Government investment is put in place.

 My hon. Friend raises a very important matter. The UK Government are deeply concerned that as few people as possible should face the threat of repossession, and that is exactly why we have strengthened the level of income support for mortgage interest payments. That support is now available after 13 weeks rather than 39, and will cover mortgages of up to &#163;200,000.

One of the summit&#146;s major conclusions was that much more needed to be done, especially at the Scottish Government level, to free up funding for housing associations. The lack of funding is restricting and slowing down housing associations&#146; ability to build more affordable housing, whereas what should be happening is that that activity should be accelerating.

 It is something that we have discussed and will continue to discuss. It is clearly important to stimulate the housing market, especially social housing, throughout the UK, and that is why we have introduced packages to that effect in England and Wales already. It is important that there is an increase in the amount of social housing available in Scotland to meet the very high demand that exists already and to stimulate the housing market in general.</p>

 My hon. Friend has mentioned that a working party has been established to look at repossession protocols in Scotland, but that has happened four months after the UK Government took action. The process is much too slow, and home owners in Scotland do not have the same protection in the courts as their counterparts in England and Wales. Will my hon. Friend call in Nicola Sturgeon, the relevant Scottish Minister, and make sure that she addresses the issue as urgently as the UK Government are doing, so that the UK and Scottish Governments can work together in a joined-up manner?</p>

 My hon. Friend has a long history of providing support and advice for people with personal debt problems, but the momentum in Scotland for repossessions has been growing. For example, Mike Dailly of the Govan law centre has drawn to our attention the fact that the number of repossession proceedings in Scotland has increased rapidly. It is important that appropriate protocols are put in place at the earliest opportunity and without delay, and that the network of sheriff court advice centres is extended. At present, there are advice centres in only seven of Scotland&#146;s 49 sheriff courts, but it is important that people can get advice as soon as they face the threat of repossession.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is correct: Scotland is stronger because of the Union and the United Kingdom. There is remarkable pride and passion across Scotland about the enormous contribution made by Scots as part of the United Kingdom armed forces. We will continue to oppose plans by the SNP, of course.

 The hon. Gentleman is right about the importance of North sea oil and gas. I met representatives of the industry last week and, along with the Secretaries of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and for Energy and Climate Change, I will do so again in the next couple of weeks. It is crucial that we continue investment in the North sea, to access oilfields and gasfields that we have not got to in past decades; I am thinking in particular of the enormous untapped resource west of Shetland.

 As people begin to get worried about the rising claimant count, does my right hon.

However, those concerns are covered in Scotland by the national agreement for the engineering construction industry, or NAECI&#151;made by the companies and Unite&#151;under which the companies draw from within a 40-mile zone in Scotland. The concern in Scotland is that if workers were denied the right to work outwith Scotland, many with high skills would be unemployed.

It was a helpful and constructive conversation. It is clear that the workers are concerned because of the economic climate and are worried that European law is preventing them from having a level playing field when it comes to employment opportunities. It is essential that those workers are able to compete on a level playing field, that European law is applied equally and that British workers are able to compete for jobs in Britain. We make it absolutely clear, along with the companies, that that is exactly the situation that should and must apply in the UK&#151;and, in most cases, we believe that it does.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has pushed the matter for many years, since he was a local authority leader. The decline in mortgage lending is mainly the result of the loss of capacity in the mortgage market.

That is why we are saying that local authorities that already have the power to issue mortgages should be encouraged to do so, and why the Minister for Housing has announced a lowering of the standard interest rate. We are now considering what more we can do to help individuals and households meet their housing needs. I hope that the answer I give my hon. Friend on his 68th birthday is acceptable.</p>

A former chief executive of Northamptonshire county council left his job 18 months ago at the age of 52 with a lump sum payment of &#163;291,000 and a &#163;97,000 a year index-linked pension, which is costing the county &#163;600,000.

 The first thing I should say to the hon.

I hope that the Conservative party is not going to make the mistake of identifying one case as representative of what is happening to ordinary local authority workers who, as we found with the emergency services, do a good job when called upon to do so.</p>

 I am surprised at the Conservative attitude to public transport, particularly the need to improve bus services around the country. I believe that the new transport Act has been widely welcomed because it recognises that country buses in particular are a lifeline to many communities. The Act is about giving options to local authorities, not being prescriptive about what they should do. It is for local authorities to take advantage of the new powers. My hon.

The Leader of the Opposition and his shadow Ministers were given access to the Bank of England and to the Treasury to find out what was happening; unfortunately, a week later, they withdrew their support. I am very happy to work with all parties to deal with the problems we face. I am very happy to work with all parties so that we can have the fiscal stimulus that is necessary.

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90204-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09020464000161">This Bill is about advancing common sense and fighting bureaucracy. I owe its rather strange long title to my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), my friend and supporter of the Bill. There is, of course, a mild irony in the title because it is itself an exercise in bureaucratic speak. It resembles my favourite rule in my college library&#151;rule 6, which is that &#147;No one is to mark or deface any book or other property of the library&#148;, alongside which someone had added, very neatly in ink, &#147;Hear, hear&#148;!</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90204-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09020464000162">The formal intent of the Bill is to indemnify public servants, central government, local government and other public agencies from legal action if they had taken decisions motivated by common sense, whatever the rules strictly said. I shall come on in a few moments to the underlying thought, but at the outset let me first get three potential criticisms out of the way. The first is that what I propose is so self-evidently sensible that it is already part of our law and practice. It is true that there are common law precedents&#151;as well as modern practices such as that of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, which explicitly uses extra-statutory concessions that go beyond tax law&#151;but however sensible those measures are, they do not establish a general principle or cover every case. A second objection might be that the Bill in some way represents a charter for vexatious litigation and legal challenge, but I would maintain that the legal concept of responsibility is by now well established. My intention is to fight off unnecessary legislation, far from encouraging it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90204-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09020464000163">I imagine that it might suit some opponents of the Bill to paint me as some kind of anarchist, denying the proper function of rules in a modern society. It is, perhaps, rather unlikely that a former inhabitant of the Whips Office would undergo such a deathbed conversion, and I assure the House that I have not; but I think that even the best and most well-honed rule book must be interpreted in the light of the facts, if only because rules often clash with one another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90204-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09020464000164">That brings me to the substance of my case. There probably never was a golden age of balance between sensible rules on the one hand and the wise use of discretion on the other. I generally welcome the growth of judicial review since the second world war as a necessary curb on an over-mighty Executive and arbitrary decision-making processes. Nor is it wrong to ask for greater openness and transparency in our public affairs. However, all that can be taken to extremes, can exceed the bounds of common sense, and can actually harm us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90204-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09020464000165">The House will have noted that there has been a lot of talk about this issue recently, since the idea occurred to me but not, I think, because of it. Indeed, we have legislated, in the Compensation Act 2006, to try to curb the paralysis that threatened, for example, outdoor activities for young people when adult volunteers no  <br>

Incidentally, my Bill could be usefully adapted to include private sector employees engaged in the discharge of their duties, although it is not currently so drafted.</p>

They include the deterrent effect on decent public employees of the fear that any risk they might take could backfire if it were unsuccessful&#151;if something went wrong&#151;and, at the level of, say, a local planning authority, the fear that any decision, however sensible, might set a precedent for some other proposal.</p>

While it is always dangerous to comment on particular cases, I wonder, in the context of this week&#146;s events, how many decisions on school closures were made with an eye to the courts rather than in the interests of children and their families.

There are more police on the streets than ever before and there has been a 28.5 per cent increase in the police work force since 1997. The service now employs more than 235,000 people, which is an increase of 52,200 extra police officers and police community support officers. The number of staff officers is 140,539, which is an increase of 11.7 per cent. or 14,714 officers on the 1997 figure. Front-line police officers are supported by nearly 16,000 PCSOs and nearly 21,800 additional police staff, who are releasing officers for front-line duties.</p>

Gentleman will also know that that is a matter for discussion between the new commissioner and chief constables in neighbouring forces, to see whether they can come to an agreement about how to deal with the issue while they wait for the Police Negotiating Board to achieve a settlement.</p>

 West Yorkshire has benefited considerably from the additional police funding made available by this Government, but while tremendous strides have been made in improving the police funding formula inherited from the Conservatives, a gap remains between what West Yorkshire gets and what it would receive if it were fully funded under the formula. Can my hon. Friend give me a commitment that he will look seriously at how we can bridge that gap?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a reasonable point about his local force. From a national perspective, we have to try to ensure that the national funding formula is fair to all forces, and we have tried to distribute the pot of money available in a fair and reasonable way. That is why we have included a floor, so that no authority receives less than 2.5 per cent. If the formula were strictly interpreted, some forces would lose out. I know that because my local force in Nottinghamshire loses some money so that we can maintain the floor. However, that is necessary and proportionate from a national perspective.</p>

Those are the issues that we will need to look at in the review of the funding formula, and he is right to point out that, as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said, we need a formula that is fair to both urban and rural areas. We need to find a way of ensuring that the needs of the vast expanses with very few people in them are properly reflected so that they receive the level of police funding that they can reasonably expect. We will look into that, and I am grateful to him for raising the point.</p>

 My hon. Friend will know from his direct personal experience that crime is falling in Nottinghamshire and police resources are at a record level.

 I thank my hon. Friend and neighbour for those comments. I know that he and other colleagues in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and across the east midlands have campaigned long and hard for a fairer distribution of resources to forces in the area. It is a fact that the floor means that some forces do not receive the amount that they would if the funding formula were fully implemented. I have to say that of course the opposite is true: some forces would lose significant amounts of money were we to remove the floor. We are searching for a way to ensure that police forces in Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and the rest of the east midlands are funded as fairly as possible.

 Dorset police authority is a high-performing and efficient force, but it predicts that it will have to lose 43 police officers this year, even with the floor, which is very important to it. The authority is especially concerned about how bars are dealt with in the formula. Dorset has a high concentration of licensed premises, with up to 1,000 places, in just two major towns, with the rest of the county being relatively rural. The formula does not really provide enough funding to police those hotspots adequately, because it is based on an area average that does not work satisfactorily in Dorset&#146;s case.</p>

 The Minister makes a fair point about the need for balance in the national allocation. He knows that part of the allocation is based on the number of people coming into an area, and part of it on the number of residents. Can he assure us that the Department will take into account the underscoring of the population in areas where the Office for National Statistics figures for resident population are significantly behind the real numbers? London is an obvious case. There are far more migrants coming to London than the figures for the resident population suggest.</p>

Although overall numbers are important, it is crucial to make the best use of officer and staff time so that those people are in the right place at the right time to deliver for the public.

The British crime survey figures published on 22 January 2009 show that, according to interviews, in the year to September 2008 the overall level of crime is stable compared with that in the previous year.

Additionally, police authorities in England and Wales receive revenue support grants from local authorities. Overall, general grant allocations to police authorities were set out in my written ministerial statement of 21 January. Within the general grant provision for 2009-10, we have set a funding floor of 2.5 per cent.

There will always be a dispute over how far the needs-based funding formula should be allowed to prevail over the stability provided by the grant floor. My right hon.

Before the comprehensive spending review, we consulted on whether to put the funding back into the formula funding pot, but that could have had a major impact on grant distribution and we decided, on balance, to retain the status quo. That move was widely welcomed by many police authorities, particularly smaller ones that had come to rely on rule 2 funds, such as the rural police fund, as core funding. The position and implications will be reviewed in full before we make any further changes to the special formula grant.</p>

We have retained the crime fighting fund in its present form. That fund of &#163;277 million played an important part in supporting growth in police capacity between 2000 and 2004. However, since its introduction the story has moved on, with the employment of more police staff to replace officers in roles where constable powers are not needed and the engagement of police community support officers, who play an important role alongside police officers. The strictures imposed by the CFF&#146;s system of financial penalties had, by 2006, limited the flexibility of forces to engage the right people with the right skills in the right jobs. The Government therefore suspended the CFF criteria in December 2006, allowing local chief officers and chairs to develop the optimum work force mix without losing funding. The move ensured that decisions on the mix of police staff and officers lay where they should, with the chief constable. That was welcomed by the Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="90204-0005.htm_para15"><a name="09020464000221">There is clear evidence that a good number of forces are using their CFF freedom to release police officers for the front line, replacing police officers in back-office  <br>

functions with police staff when there is a clear business case that it is right to do so. In some forces, officer numbers are fewer than they were in March 2008, but the essential point is that the replacement of police officers in back-office functions has not had a negative impact on front-line capacity. In a good number of cases, it has increased front-line capacity. The most recent figures show that some forces have increased police officer numbers while others have decreased them.</p>

Home Office funding for neighbourhood policing, including PCSOs, in 2008-09 is &#163;324 million, an increase of 2.7 per cent. For 2009-10, funding has increased by a further 2.7 per cent. for each force to a total of &#163;332 million. A further uplift of 2.7 per cent. is planned for 2010-11.</p>

That is considerably fewer than in previous years, and most of the representations have to do with the future. For next year, we have again maximised the increase in general grant and ensured that all police authorities have received a guaranteed minimum increase in grant of 2.5 per cent. The delivery of efficiency and productivity gains, as well as prudent budgeting and making full use of available funding flexibilities, means that there is no reason for excessive increases in the police precepts on council tax. The Government expect an average council tax increase in England of below 5 per cent. Council tax in Wales is a matter for the Welsh Assembly Government.

do a very difficult and often very dangerous job on our behalf, and I pay tribute to their service. The police need resources from the Government, and indeed the taxpayer, to discharge their duties in upholding law and order. That is why this debate is so important to us all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90204-0005.htm_para22"><a name="09020464000229">Last year&#146;s crime figures showed that violent crime has risen by almost 80 per cent. in the past decade. Crime has not increased in every category in that period, but violent crime certainly has and that causes great concern to the public. In addition, the economic downturn has placed even greater strain on already tight police budgets. Sadly, the analysis from the Home Office that predicted a rise in crime as the economy worsened has been borne out by the latest quarterly crime figures. In the last year, burglaries have risen by 4 per cent., while fraud and forgery are up by about 16 per cent. and the number of street robberies committed at knife point have increased by 18 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90204-0005.htm_para23"><a name="09020464000230">This year&#146;s settlement is the second part of the three-year 2007 comprehensive spending review. Excluding additional grants for counter-terrorism and other specific grants, the police settlement increase will be 2.7 per cent. this year, as the Minister said. A total of 20 police authorities will receive the lowest increase, of 2.5 per cent., and the Minister mentioned that there was a bigger-than-average increase for the West Midlands authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="90204-0005.htm_para24"><a name="09020464000231">There is no doubt that the police grant settlement is extremely tight, as the Minister would be the first to accept. Last year, the Association of Police Authorities said that the three-year settlement was one of the &#147;tightest for many years&#148;. In its submission to the 2007 CSR, the joint APA and ACPO expenditure forecasting group said that there would be a funding gap, even with an annual grant increase of 2.7 per cent. The group&#146;s most optimistic assumptions suggested a funding gap by 2010-11 that would be in the region of &#163;660 million. Using less optimistic assumptions, the group calculated that the gap could be as high as &#163;996 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="90204-0005.htm_para25"><a name="09020464000232">The economic downturn has had an adverse impact on the financial position of police authorities. The collapse of Icelandic banks has wiped out about &#163;95 million of police authority reserves, according to information that I have received from the APA. Lower interest rates of course mean that there is less investment income for police authorities, and proceeds from asset sales are lower in a depressed market. The Gloucestershire police authority, for example, estimated in January that the current grant settlement and economic conditions mean that it could lose up to around 60 police officers and 28 PCSOs, as well as 50 police staff posts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90204-0005.htm_para26"><a name="09020464000233">The estimates used by the expenditure forecasting group assume that the police precept on council tax would increase up to that maximum of 5 per cent., but the Minister for Local Government announced in a statement on 28 November that seven police authorities, including Cheshire, Leicestershire and Warwickshire, would face precept increase caps of 3 per cent. in 2009-10. In his reply, I hope that the Minister will confirm that those authorities will receive less than the 5 per cent. precept cap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90204-0005.htm_para27"><a name="09020464000234">Of course, Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition oppose excessive increases in council tax, especially in these dire economic times. The Minister will be very well aware that some police forces with historically low police precepts believe that they have no alternative but to seek more revenue from local council tax payers. Does the Minister think  <br>

that in some police force areas there is a public demand&#151;not a councillor demand&#151;for an increase in locally funded police spending above the cap limit? Has he received any representations from members of the public along those lines?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90204-0005.htm_para28"><a name="09020464000235">In last year&#146;s debate, the Minister&#146;s predecessor said that he expected the 2.7 per cent. growth in the police force grant to apply to this year as well, and the Minister has confirmed that today. However, I should like to hear his views on the pre-Budget report statement of 24 November, when the Chancellor announced</p>
<a name="90204-0005.htm_brev0"><a name="09020464000660"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that the Government will now find an additional &#163;5 billion of efficiencies in 2010-11&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 24 November 2008; Vol. 483, c. 489.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90204-0005.htm_para29"><a name="09020464000236">On a point of clarification, will the Chancellor&#146;s demand for extra efficiency affect the 2.7 per cent. increase? I have seen minutes from Lincolnshire police authority and the Met that express the concern that they might be expected to find extra efficiency savings at short notice. Will the Minister clarify the position in relation to that efficiency target? The 2007 CSR set a target for police authorities to make 9.3 per cent. efficiency savings over three years, so will the Minister say whether police authorities are still expected to meet that target? Alternatively, is there a new target&#151;explicit or otherwise&#151;that he wants them to work to, as a result of the catastrophic downturn in the economy and in the fortunes of the Government finances since the CSR statement for the three-year period that we are currently in was made?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90204-0005.htm_para30"><a name="09020464000237">I should also like to hear the Minister&#146;s views on some other statements by the Chancellor, who recently announced plans to bring forward &#163;3 billion of capital spending to assist the economic recovery. How much of that accelerated capital expenditure has been channelled into the policing sector, in its widest definition? Many people in the police authorities believe that accelerated local investment could assist improvement in the police estate and also support the local construction industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="90204-0005.htm_para31"><a name="09020464000238">I turn now to some of the minutiae of how the police grant is distributed. The calculation is notoriously complex, and is based on five separate components. The first, the needs-based formula, is easily the most important and is otherwise known in the trade as the principal formula. Its main determinant is the projected resident population, which is then adjusted to take into account several &#147;police crime top-ups&#148; that adjust the main principal formula to take into account socioeconomic and demographic factors that may impact on crime levels. Those factors include how many licensed bars, people in long-term unemployment, daytime residents or residents in terraced accommodation there are in an area, as well as its population sparsity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90204-0005.htm_para32"><a name="09020464000239">Secondly, in coming to a grant settlement, the Home Office will also apply additional rule 1. I will not detain the House on the minute working of that rule, important though it is. It affects the grant provision for South Wales police and redistributes it to other police authorities in Wales.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/debtext/90204-0006.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para0"><a name="09020464000240">Thirdly, the Home Secretary will apply additional rule 2. In the past, the Home Secretary distributed specific grants such as the rural policing grant, the forensic grant and the initial police learning and development programme grant. Ministers decided to amalgamate those grants, so that police authorities would have more control over how a number of those  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="4 Feb 2009">

<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>4 Feb 2009 : Column 860</b><br>
funds were used; that was sensible. The distribution of those amalgamated moneys under the additional rule is determined by the principal formula. Fourthly, the Home Office will distribute specific grants. I will not repeat what the Minister said, but there is, of course, a separate pot for counter-terrorism. He also referred to the crime fighting fund and the ring-fencing of funds for neighbourhood policing, all of which we support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para1"><a name="09020464000241">Finally, the police grant floors are applied. The introduction of the principal formula in 1995 was designed to reflect the resource needs of police forces. However, to ensure that the introduction of the formula did not leave forces facing widespread financial instability, floors have been introduced. They guarantee that each police force receives a minimum percentage increase in the police budget, and we heard something about that from the Minister. Notwithstanding his statement, there remains serious concern among police authorities and police forces, in all parts of the country, about how the police grant formula is calculated; the Minister understands that concern because he is a well-informed and listening Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para2"><a name="09020464000242">The floors mean that forces cannot receive an increase below 2.5 per cent., even if the principal formula has determined that they do not require such a level of funding. Equally, a police force that should, according to the formula, receive a higher amount will have its grant scaled downwards. As the Flanagan report illustrated, using 2007-08 figures, that meant, at the extreme ends, that the West Midlands force had its grant scaled down by 11 per cent., or &#163;48 million in nominal terms. Bedfordshire received 6 per cent., and Thames Valley police 4 per cent.&#151;less than they would have done if the formula was applied in its raw form. The funds that are taken away from one force are given to another, and that has meant that some forces, such as Northumbria, have received over 12 per cent. more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para3"><a name="09020464000243">Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition welcome the removal of the ceiling, which the Minister&#146;s predecessor, the right hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), announced last year when he was Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing. However, I think that all of us&#151;this might even extend to the Minister, judging from his comments&#151;remain less than clear about the future for grant floors. It is worth reminding ourselves of what Sir Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s report on the future of policing said of grant floors:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para5"><a name="09020464000245">He was referring to the floors. He went on to propose the following:</p>
<a name="90204-0006.htm_brev2"><a name="09020464000663"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I think it prudent that, from that point on, there should be a staged relaxation of the &#145;floors and ceilings&#146; factors which dampen changes in allocations, possibly combined with special consideration for those few Forces which would face the most significant reductions in funding&#148;</p>

it avoided party politicking and cheap points. Neither he nor I indulge in that kind of business when we are talking about the serious matter of policing the United Kingdom. The report said:</p>

The Select Committee and Sir Ronnie&#151;an independent adviser to the Home Secretary&#151;think that it is a good idea. Where are we on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para9"><a name="09020464000249">In November, in a written ministerial statement relating to the settlement that we are considering, the Home Office said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para10"><a name="09020464000250">That is reassuring, but the House would be grateful for a bit more specificity on how far that review has gone. Will the Minister show a bit of ankle, to use a colloquialism, and share a bit more detail on how far he has got with that review? Will he say when we might expect an interim announcement on where the Government have got to? Again, this is not a matter of party politics; all of us with a concern about policing need to hear the Minister say more about the future for the formula on the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para11"><a name="09020464000251">With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say something about population figures, because I think that that is an area of technical inadequacy with which all Members on both sides of the House have problems. On 27 November 2007, the then Minister for Borders and Immigration, the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne), told the Home Affairs Committee that the funding formula used to allocate money to the police for 2008 to 2010 would draw on 2004 national population projections</p>
<a name="90204-0006.htm_brev5"><a name="09020464000666"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;simply because that is the best available data.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para12"><a name="09020464000252">Population projection figures form an integral part of the policing formula, as we all know, so is it really acceptable that the budget that we are debating is distributed according to a formula that is fed with data from 2004? I know that the Minister cannot wave a magic wand and get a sub-national version of a census for certain areas, or even a national census before the due date, but he might want to share some of the thinking about the inadequacy of the data, to which his former Home Office colleague, by implication, &#146;fessed up and drew our attention.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an issue that he knows affects my constituency significantly. The inter-census estimation of the population of Slough underestimates its population substantially. As a result, we, a multiracial community, are under-policed. Although the Minister has confirmed again that the money is in the budget, the situation is made worse by the fact that the south-east allowance is not being uprated because it is stuck in the Police Negotiating Board. Perhaps the Minister could, in his summing up, reassure places such as Slough that he will take into account all those issues to make sure that those places, which face real policing challenges, have enough money to deal with those challenges.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady. I have heard her talk in many forums, not least fairly recently on Radio 4, about her constituency and the problems that she outlines. She is a doughty and persistent debater on that point, drawing to the attention of Ministers what needs to be done for her constituency&#151;and there are others in the same position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para13"><a name="09020464000255">The second point that the hon. Lady raises is also tremendously important.

Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter). It was along the lines&#151;we have new information from the Minister&#151;that the PNB could be talked to by the Minister. I paraphrase his words. He undertook to have a word about what the PNB was doing in relation to the south-east allowance. Like the hon. Lady, I wonder whether the Minister could give us an update on any discussions that he or his officials have had since last Wednesday in relation to the PNB and the south-east allowance. That is hugely important for all Members in that region. I am grateful to the hon. Lady for reminding me of that point, so that I can remind the Minister of what he said last Wednesday.</p>

By &#147;particularly&#148; I mean that they have gone out of their way to send briefing to me on these issues, which other police force areas also face. The problem that they have is the gap between predicted and real population figures. Their concerns were drawn together in a presentation given by Chief Constable Grahame Maxwell to the Home Office migration impacts forum on 16 July 2008. There was also a report in <i> The Sunday Times</i> on 27 January last year, in which Kent police observed that the total additional cost caused by immigration at that time stood at &#163;34 million over the three years to that date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para15"><a name="09020464000257">The extra costs of immigration have not been fully recognised in the funding settlement.

Under a freedom of information request that I issued to forces in United Kingdom, among the 44 forces that responded, there had been a 63 per cent. increase in the cost to those forces of providing interpretation and translation services. In Kent, there had been a 30 per cent. increase, from about &#163;320,000 in 2003-04 to more than &#163;422,000 in 2007-08. In Thames Valley, there has been a whacking 127 per cent. increase in that period. In my constituency in Suffolk, there has been an 86 per cent. increase in translation and interpretation costs in that period&#151;from &#163;113,000 to &#163;210,000.</p>

The report, &#147;The changing demography of Cambridgeshire&#148;, September 2007, is published by Cambridgeshire constabulary. The methodology behind the funding formula will mean that an additional work load is not being taken into account when these grant moneys are calculated.</p>

Although the report acknowledged the cost to policing, it was not clear to me whether police authorities could apply for money from the new fund to mitigate the cost of immigration. That was until I heard the Minister&#146;s remarks earlier in today&#146;s debate. For the sake of clarity, can he explain how police authorities can apply for that money? Is there any limit on the amount they can apply for? When can they apply for it? What criteria need to be met? Above all, we need a clear statement of what the review status of the funding formula will be before the next comprehensive spending review starts its progress inside government. Will a new, more dynamic projected population methodology be utilised&#151;yes, no or maybe?</p>

There is the added cost of dealing with alcohol-related crime. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) on the Front Bench has done much valuable work in drawing attention to the huge policing cost of alcohol-related crime, as has the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, in the report to which I referred earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para28"><a name="09020464000270">The most recent British crime survey, from July last year, stated that 45 per cent. of all victims of violence described their assailant as being under the influence of alcohol at the time. There is a wealth of evidence from chief constables as well. Chief Constable Stephen Otter of Cornwall and Devon Constabulary, said that since 2004-05 there has been a</p>
<a name="90204-0006.htm_brev11"><a name="09020464000672"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;fairly significant increase in the proportion of violent crime where we can be absolutely sure there is an alcohol-related aspect&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para29"><a name="09020464000271">Indeed, a Cabinet Office review as far back as 2003 said that, on average, it costs &#163;59 more to process an arrestee who has committed an alcohol-related offence than a comparable arrestee whose offence is not alcohol-related. I am sure that the figure is a lot higher if the figures that we have all seen on the costs of bureaucracy and process are anything to go by.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para30"><a name="09020464000272">There is a problem with the 24-hour licensing laws. Is the Minister considering Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition&#146;s innovative, radical and much-needed call for discretion to be given to local authorities in new legislation so that they can decide how the 24-hour licensing rules are applied in their areas? The policing formula does not take into account the extra cost of officers trained by forces around London who move to work in the Met; that was the subject of our debate last week, and we have heard about the allowance for the south-east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para31"><a name="09020464000273">In conclusion, in its own right the grant settlement is tight, and we understand why. Given the additional pressures from the economic collapse that this country is experiencing, police authorities face and will face severe financial pressures if they just maintain the current levels of service to local people. We have to make sure that the current structure for distributing the police grant is robust and fair. As I hope I have made clear, there are serious concerns about how the funding formula operates. The review of the police funding arrangements in advance of the next comprehensive spending review provides an excellent opportunity to address the deficiencies, to which I and other hon.

agreed with almost everything that he said. Either I am on the wrong side of the House or he is; I cannot decide who is in the right place. On behalf of members of the Select Committee on Home Affairs who are not here, I thank him for his kind words about the Committee&#146;s report, &#147;Policing in the 21st Century&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para32"><a name="09020464000275">I have had conversations with the hon. Gentleman about the report; he told me that he had read it with great interest. I know that the Minister has as well, and we look forward to the Government&#146;s response and to the Minister&#146;s appearance before us to answer questions about it. There is absolutely no point in such kind words being said about the report, and its being generally well received by the Government and the Opposition, if our recommendations are not implemented. We look forward to that process happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para33"><a name="09020464000276">I repeat what I said in my brief intervention on the Minister. He knows that I am a great fan of his. Since he has taken on his portfolio, he has been very willing to discuss policing issues with all Members of the House, especially members of the Select Committee. The way in which the Government dealt with the whole process is a good model for the future. If I can be partisan for a moment, I should say that when the Minister announced that Leicestershire was going to be capped, there was great worry among Members from all parties from the city and county, who had been concerned about the possibility of the cap. The Minister for Local Government, who was here at the beginning of the debate, had meetings with those Members and the now Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, the police Minister&#146;s predecessor. The Minister for Local Government listened to our points about the special case of Leicestershire, and I am pleased to say that he accepted that case. Far too often, Governments make decisions and say that they want to consult but do not do so; this Government and these Ministers, however, have shown that they are prepared to consult and listen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para34"><a name="09020464000277">Leicestershire is aware that, in a sense, the party is over. There are no unlimited funds available for policing. I shall not repeat the statistics mentioned by the Minister and the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, but there has been a large increase in the police force budget in the past 10 years. There have been more police officers on the beat and more police community support officers&#151;a role that we invented. The increase has been extremely important and positive. The overall allocation this year is &#163;8 billion-plus and a few hundred thousand here and there, which is a huge amount of money. In Leicestershire, we welcome the 2.8 per cent. increase that we are to have, because that will allow us to continue the services that we provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90204-0006.htm_para35"><a name="09020464000278">I wish to make only three points during my brief contribution. Originally, I thought that this debate would last an hour and a half&#151;hence my glares at both Minister and shadow Minister. I then realised that there were another two hours to go. Madam Deputy Speaker, you will be pleased to hear that I am not going to speak for that whole period, because other Members wish to participate and I am sure that there will be a winding-up from the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para0"><a name="09020464000279">My first point is about alcohol-related crime, which the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds mentioned. I make no apology for repeating this point every time we  <br>

have a debate on policing. The hon. Gentleman gave the figure: 45 per cent. of victims of violent crime have said that the perpetrator&#146;s behaviour was either influenced by or had connections to the drinking of alcohol. If we talk to any police officer of any rank about what happens in town centres, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings, not only in big cities but in small towns, we will hear about the results of alcohol-related crime. Why on earth should we allow a situation to continue in which we know the cause of the crime and what is happening, and all we do is spend more and more taxpayers&#146; money on trying to address an issue that the Government can deal with?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09020464000280">I know that there have been a number of Government initiatives, and I welcome what the Home Secretary has said on many occasions about alcohol-related crime. However, the Government should go that little step further and try to do something more about the supermarkets. Why do I say that? The fact is that there is ample evidence to suggest that supermarkets are underselling. Pubs and clubs sell alcohol at a higher price. At this point, I am normally interrupted by my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan), who is chairman of the all-party beer group. He is not here, however, perhaps because it is lunch time and his group is meeting&#151;I do not know. I am casting aspersions on him, and I did not tell him that I would mention him. Anyway, he jumps up and defends the pubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para2"><a name="09020464000281">I want to ask what we are going to do about the very low prices for alcohol in supermarkets. That is a big problem. In its report, the Select Committee made specific reference to floor pricing, and we asked the Government to consider the issue. That may have been a recommendation; the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) has popped in and may remember precisely what we said. Nevertheless, we felt that floor pricing was the only way to stop people, especially young people, from going into supermarkets and getting tanked up on very cheap alcohol bought under the promotions that every single supermarket in the country is running at this very moment. If anyone leaves the Chamber now and goes to any supermarket anywhere in the vicinity of Westminster, they will see those promotions. Unless we deal with that issue, it will continue to be a major problem for this country.</p>

 I am grateful to the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee. As he will remember, the supermarket spokesmen who gave evidence to the Committee were defensive on that point. The right hon. Gentleman and I both said that the undercutting and the loss-leading sale of alcohol were extremely injurious&#151;particularly to young folk, including those in Leicester, East and Newark. Will he find out from the Minister exactly what has been done about the issue?</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I am sure that the Minister will have taken note and will respond. As yet, we have not received a full response from the Government on this issue; we hope that it will come shortly.</p>

police authorities all over the country. We know that he has to bargain and negotiate with the Treasury. How better to do that than with an array of statistics and initiatives that show that the Home Office is seeking to bring down the cost of policing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para4"><a name="09020464000285">My second point is about police pay. I am pleased with how the Government have handled this issue over the past few months. I never again want to be part of a demonstration where thousands of police officers, who do not have the right to strike, are forced to demonstrate against a Government who have worked with them in such close partnership over so many years. That was a terrible situation. I am glad that over the past few months the Home Office has begun proper and appropriate negotiations with the police and has given them not only a pay settlement that they deserve but the framework for dealing with these issues in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para5"><a name="09020464000286">On Saturday, I was present at a march with the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), when 100,000 British citizens marched through the centre of London. Police officers were there, although there were not a huge number. There was a moment during that demonstration when things nearly went wrong, when several young people, who are very passionate about the situation in Sri Lanka, decided to sit down on Westminster bridge and not move. The way in which the police handled that very difficult situation was absolutely superb. They persuaded the young people to get off the bridge and allow it to be reopened. That takes quality policing. In order to get quality policing, we have to pay police officers the amount of money that is appropriate to their skills. Please let us continue in that vein in future. Let us negotiate, so that we never reach a situation where they have to start demonstrating on the streets of London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09020464000287">My final point concerns new technology. I hope that the Minister will tell us a little about the legal action that the Home Office has instituted against the company that provided the so-called police portal, which, of course, does not work. We all want the computerisation of the police to happen. We would love to see a situation whereby the police in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire and the Metropolitan police were able to access one set of information through one police portal. I think that that was the intention of the National Police Improvement Agency, but it just did not happen. We have probably wasted a huge amount of money on this issue. I hope that the Minister will tell us what is happening, because it is important that we spend our money wisely, especially in the current economic climate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09020464000288">Our report mentioned several examples of where Government investment in new technology would make a huge difference not only to the overall cost of policing in future but, more importantly, to the efficiency of local police officers. That means investment in hand-held computers. At the moment, there are 20,000 such devices in the country, and the Government have committed &#163;75 million for another 30,000. However, the Committee says that there is no reason why every single police officer in the country should not have a hand-held device. The time savings are huge. When Bedfordshire police authority bought these devices for its police officers, the amount of time that they spent outside the police station increased, and the time that they spent filling in forms and doing paperwork decreased. The amount of time that they spent processing cases increased  <br>

as well. BlackBerry has told us&#151;I am not suggesting for one moment that we should go out and buy BlackBerry because it has given us this information&#151;that its research, which it presented to the Committee during our inquiry, suggests that if every police officer had a BlackBerry, it would give them an extra full hour of time outside the police station.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09020464000289">A lot has been said about the report by Sir Ronnie Flanagan, which is excellent; that is why the Committee adopted most of its recommendations. He talks about new technology and saving time by cutting red tape. Of course, Ministers always tell us that there is going to be a bonfire of red tape. Jan Berry has been appointed as the &#147;cutting of red tape&#148; tsar&#151;whatever her title is; bureaucracy tsar, perhaps&#151;and the Committee looks forward to examining her in the near future. The fact is that we need real progress on cutting bureaucracy. That is evident if one goes to any police station in the country and talks to any custody sergeant, as I did when the hon. Member for Newark invited me to visit Newark police station. I pay tribute to all the police officers there. Unfortunately, there was a minor mishap when I thought that a fridge was the place where they kept their lunch, but it was in fact the fridge for DNA samples. Even Back-Bench MPs make gaffes, not just Ministers and Mayors of London. We pay tribute to all that police officers have done and say to them, &#147;We want to increase your time outside the police station doing policing work.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09020464000290">I urge the Minister to take the plunge and invest in new technology. When the Government make that decision, please could we have central procurement, so that Lincolnshire police buy the same equipment as the police in Staffordshire, and the police in Staffordshire buy the same equipment as the police in Bristol or London? That would mean that we do not have problems about whether people are speaking to each other properly and appropriately, and passing on information. In many high-profile cases, especially concerning children, people talk about sharing information after the event inquiries have taken place.</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I apologise for interrupting the debate, but it is on a matter of the utmost national importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09020464000299">I would like to raise the issue of a judgment made at 1.45 pm today by Lord Justice Thomas in the case of Binyam Mohamed, a British resident currently being held at Guantanamo Bay who has made an accusation of British involvement in torture inflicted on him while being held in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Morocco. The ruling implies that torture has taken place in the Mohamed case and that British agencies may have been complicit&#151;but, most important of all, that the United States Government have threatened our High Court that if it releases this information the US Government will withdraw their intelligence co-operation with the United Kingdom on matters of security. The judge has ruled that there is a strong public interest that this information is put in the public domain even though it is politically embarrassing.</p>

<a name="90204-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="09020464000673"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is plainly right that the details of the admissions in relation to the treatment of Binyam Mohamed as reported by officials of the United States Government should be brought into the public domain...we did not consider that a democracy governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own officials...relevant to allegations of torture and cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment, politically embarrassing though it might be. We had no reason...to anticipate there would be made a threat of the gravity of the kind made by the United States Government that it would reconsider its intelligence sharing relationship, when all the considerations in relation to open justice pointed to us providing a limited but important summary of the reports.&#148;</p>

 This police grant statement comes in the second year of a three-year settlement, and in that sense it does not contain any surprises. It remains, however, as was pointed out last year, the tightest police grant settlement for a decade, and as the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities pointed out last year, there is a danger of an overall &#163;1 billion shortfall in police funding by 2011. One of the things that they referred to was not just the proportion of money coming from the Government, but the effect of the Government&#146;s constant rate-capping and direction on levels of council tax. The Minister and I debated that issue yesterday in a Public Bill Committee. A MORI opinion poll last year found that 87 per cent. of respondents said that they would be willing to pay more if it went towards direct local policing. Whether we would get quite the same response now that the recession is starting to build up is another matter, but, as we argued yesterday in Committee, that choice should be left to the local community and local police authorities under a directly elected system, rather than being decided by diktat by a Minister in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para16"><a name="09020464000306">All the points made in last year&#146;s debate remain accurate today, and I will not rehearse most of them in detail because they remain exactly the same. Last year, we discussed the amount of police time spent on paperwork, the increase in violent crime, the lack of adequate technology and the constant creation of new offences&#151;more than 3,500 since 1997. A number of those points have already been touched on in today&#146;s debate. On technology, the issue of hand-held devices that would save police time has already been raised. It surprises me that the staff who work for the council housing department in Chesterfield who do electrical repairs, plumbing and so on are all equipped with such devices, and they are all linked to the central control office through them. The logistics of everything they carry on their vehicles to repair council houses are logged and are readable in the central office in Chesterfield, so that when a call comes in for a repair it is not the nearest vehicle that is sent but the one with the right parts. If the staff of the council housing department can have that sort of technology, which makes them so much more efficient, flexible and cost-effective, it seems incredible that the police in Chesterfield cannot have the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para17"><a name="09020464000307">The Minister may well say later that pilot schemes are rolling out and developing that technology in various parts of the country, but like so many experiments with pilot schemes, we have to ask when that process becomes universal. It is proven technology, the benefits of which can be seen even in a council housing repair department. Why has it not been rolled out throughout police forces in the UK?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para18"><a name="09020464000308">As a side issue, the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), who chairs the Select Committee, mentioned central purchasing. Contrary to our debate in Committee yesterday, I do see an argument for a degree of central collaboration or direction in that case. One police officer whom I talked to in Chesterfield told me that many police forces buy varieties of motor vehicles because there is no custom-built standard for the British police, unlike the way in which American police forces tend to have a standard police cruiser. He told me that some of the computer devices provided for  <br>

use in cars cannot be mounted on the dashboard because there is such a mish-mash of purchasing policy. Vehicles are often too small and not suitable for such new technology. The delivery of technology raises some issues that need be considered, but it is such a basic process in this day and age, it is hard to understand why the technology has not been rolled out across all 43 police authorities.</p>

<p><a name="st_o138"><a name="09020464000309"><a name="90204-0007.htm_spnew11"><a name="09020464000851"><b>Mr. Coaker:</b>
 To nail this point about mobile information devices, I say to the hon. Gentleman that all Home Office-funded police forces in England and Wales, and all police forces in Scotland, have now received funding. We expect 30,000 hand-held devices to be in use by front-line officers in April 2010. Although the technology was originally being rolled out in phase 1, phase 2 is now online. Millions of pounds are being spent to do exactly what the hon. Gentleman suggests.</p>

<p><a name="st_o139"><a name="09020464000310"><a name="90204-0007.htm_spnew12"><a name="09020464000852"><b>Paul Holmes:</b>
 I thank the Minister for that clarification. It would be churlish to say better late than never, but none the less that is now on the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para19"><a name="09020464000311">On the constant creation of new offences&#151;3,500 or more in 10 years&#151;we are in the process of discussing the 66th Home Office Bill in this area, with the Public Bill Committee considering it starting last week, and it will create a variety of new offences. One proposal that was debated on Second Reading, and which I mentioned in Committee last week, is the fine of up to &#163;500 that is available for people found drinking alcohol in a public place where drinking is prohibited. The current Bill proposes to increase that figure to &#163;2,500, but as we clarified in Committee and on Second Reading, although the maximum fine is &#163;500 no one has ever been fined more than &#163;250, and very few have been fined more than &#163;100. That is symptomatic of a process where legislation is constantly used to grandstand&#151;to send messages in pursuit of media headlines&#151;but has no practical benefit to the front-line police officer. In fact, it can be quite the reverse if it is simply throwing extra regulation and paperwork at police officers on the beat, who have far better things on which to spend their time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para20"><a name="09020464000312">Legislation on cut-price alcohol sales in supermarkets, however, which the Chair of the Select Committee referred to earlier, would be a much more beneficial and effective process. Regrettably, however, such provisions are missing from the Bill that we are discussing in Committee. I have been on patrol with front-line officers and seen them dealing with the public effects of alcohol, and they would welcome the effects of such legislation far more than a measure that the Minister said was simply intended to send a message&#151;effectively, to get a headline instead of having a direct, practical effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="90204-0007.htm_para21"><a name="09020464000313">All of last year&#146;s debate remains relevant, although we do not need to return to two parts of it. The current Minister has not had to announce a cut in the numbers of police community support officers from 24,000 to 16,000, as was announced last year, and he has not had to take the flak for refusing to implement in full a police pay award. That happened last year, although officers remain demoralised and angry about it to this day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para0"><a name="09020464000314">What are the new issues that affect policing? The Association of Police Authorities observed that the next four years will be very difficult. It gave several reasons for that, one of which is the tight funding regime in place between now and 2011, which we knew about from the start of the three-year settlement last year.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="4 Feb 2009">

There may also be cuts after that; we cannot know for certain, but it certainly looks increasingly likely. We are told that many authorities and chief constables face stark choices over the next four years, including inevitable reductions in police officer numbers. We have seen that happen in some authorities already last year and this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para1"><a name="09020464000315">At the same time, however, with tighter, sometimes decreasing, budgets and a reduction in police officer numbers, there is a constant expansion in local demand and in the expectations of what the police can deliver. Some of that is a result of modern society. Today, almost universally, people have mobile phones, and they are much quicker to ring the police&#151;or their councillor or MP&#151;to make a complaint. They are much more likely, especially at odd hours of the day, to get on the internet and send an e-mail to all and sundry, including the police, councillors and the local MP, demanding action. In the past, they would have had to use a land-line to ring an office hoping to get someone on the other end, and a lot of people did not do that. The 24-hour media that we have these days constantly hype up crime issues, which creates a lot more pressure and expectation from below about what the police can do. Those rising expectations will only increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para2"><a name="09020464000316">The Government have the best intentions, which we support, but they are also increasing that pressure. For example, a welcome policy is the idea that everybody in a police beat area, usually corresponding to a council ward, should have access to a mobile phone number that should in theory be answered fairly promptly by the beat officer or PCSO who has that equipment. As that service becomes more publicised and available, it will inevitably mean far more calls from members of the public, putting more demands on the police. If the police cannot meet those demands, it will create a vicious circle of frustration, with the public saying, &#147;There&#146;s no point. The police aren&#146;t doing anything. They never answer.&#148; At a time when budgets are tighter, and when budgets and police numbers might fall over the next few years, there will be more and more pressure from the public for more action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para3"><a name="09020464000317">Another matter that we discussed in Committee yesterday was the community call for action, which was provided for in the Police Act 2006 and is about to be implemented. When members of the public know about that, they will beat a path to the door of their local councillor, whether for their parish, town, district, borough, city or unitary area&#151;the public do not draw such distinctions&#151;and say, &#147;I have heard that under the law, you have to take action if I raise an issue with you about vandalism, burglary, nuisance, speeding traffic&#148; or whatever. All those councillors will rush off to the appropriate bodies&#151;crime and disorder reduction partnerships, police authorities and so on&#151;saying that they want action. Many of them already do that. With tightening budgets and falling police officer numbers, what will often be the answer over the next few years? &#147;We haven&#146;t got the resources to deal with that.&#148; On top of that, we have increasing Government direction of national priorities and roles, which could clash with the requirement for police authorities to have regard to the views of the local community.</p>

 It strikes me that given the pressures that my hon. Friend has outlined, and the fact that a lot of people will sadly lose their jobs in the coming year,  <br>

there may be people who are confident, able and willing to be employed by police authorities as civilians, but who would not be willing to become police officers. They could help to do a lot of jobs, provided that the budgets were available.</p>

<p><a name="st_o141"><a name="09020464000319"><a name="90204-0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="09020464000854"><b>Paul Holmes:</b>
 Indeed, and over recent years a lot of authorities have brought more civilians in to release police officers from desk work and get them out on the beat. The more the budget tightens, however, the less possible that becomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para4"><a name="09020464000320">As we have heard, another factor to consider is population shifts, which may well worsen, especially those that arise from waves of migrant workers. When the EU enlarged recently the Government predicted how many people would come from Poland and various eastern European states, but their predictions were well under the number who came in reality. The Government said that they expected a lot of those migrant workers to come over here and work for two, three or four years to raise money, then go back to start their own businesses or when the economy changed, as in the case of the recession that is building up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para5"><a name="09020464000321">The speed of those population fluctuations caused major problems for councils, the health service, schools and the police. The then Police Minister, the right hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), said in last year&#146;s debate, &#147;Yes, that is a very good point, and we should look at it.&#148; The present Minister said the same this afternoon, so when will the action come? What reassurance can the Minister give that there will be fairly prompt action on a matter that has never been dealt with&#151;getting resources quickly to the police, councils, education authorities and others to deal with rapid population fluctuations? Those fluctuations often involve people who have English as a second language, which is another issue entirely. The police in Lincolnshire, for example, have been caused major problems by the soaring cost of their interpretation budget because of the eastern European groups who are working there in agriculture. There are also many such examples in urban areas, and various problems are developing.</p>

 That is a really big issue for boroughs such as mine as well as for rural areas, as my hon. Friend said. It would be really helpful if Ministers from the Home Office and the Department for Communities and Local Government said that they will take the new information from the Office for National Statistics and put a new, up-to-date system in place by the time of the next three-year grant allocation at the latest. We have not yet heard that, and it must be a minimum demand and expectation.</p>

Birmingham and London that have had problems. With rapidly fluctuating pupil numbers, it is difficult to get the money flowing fast enough to make a difference rather than provide it two years later. However, I hope that the Government will be able to take action on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para6"><a name="09020464000327">Another major issue is the levelling-off of police authorities&#146; potential to make cash efficiencies. The Home Office document &#147;Efficiency and Productivity Strategy for the Police Service 2008-11&#148; states:</p>
<a name="90204-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="09020464000674"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The financial climate of the next three years will be tougher and achieving significant cashable improvements in efficiency and productivity over 2008-11 will therefore be central to delivering the Police Service&#146;s mission of delivering community safety.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para7"><a name="09020464000328">However, the APA points out that in the past 10 years more than &#163;2 billion of efficiency savings have been made, most of which have been recycled into meeting new police demands and supporting the delivery of the service. However, it observes that that has become increasingly difficult in the past year or two, and that in the next few years it will become almost impossible for efficiency savings to be addressed directly to dealing with budget shortfalls. It states that</p>
<a name="90204-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="09020464000675"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the longer term prospects worsen considerably&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09020464000329">because, added to the factors that I have listed, the recession means that there will be a loss of interest income from investments, reduced proceeds from property sales and increased costs of imported goods. It gives the specific example that uniforms, which are generally imported, and some specialist equipment that is imported have already increased in cost by 30 per cent. in the past few months, due to exchange rate changes. The council tax base is nearly static due to continued capping, and the recession is creating more low-level crimes such as burglary, shoplifting, robbery and shed breaking. All those things cause increased demands on the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para9"><a name="09020464000330">The most recent quarterly crime statistics, and figures released following a freedom of information request by <i> The Independent,</i> show increasing crime&#151;a widely predicted result of the recession. On 17 January, <i> The Independent</i> gave the example of forces such as Greater Manchester, Suffolk, Gloucestershire and Cumbria, all of which had seen</p>
<a name="90204-0008.htm_brev2"><a name="09020464000676"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;increases of between 25 and 50 per cent. Lincolnshire police saw the biggest rise, a 97 per cent. increase in robbery between September and November&#151;the most recent three-month period collated by the force&#151;compared with the same three-month period the previous year.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para10"><a name="09020464000331">Those figures were more up to date than those that the Home Office released a month later, which raises the point that we have often made about the need for believable independent statistics. If the Government were to pass the responsibility for the figures entirely to the Office for National Statistics, that would remove all the questions about their validity and their early or late issuing for political reasons. The statistics that were produced, partly through a freedom of information request, showed a clear increase in crime at the lower level of burglary, shed breaking, robbery and so on, co-ordinating with the start of the recession. That was exactly what history told us was likely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para11"><a name="09020464000332">A rise in crime produces more work for the police and puts more strain on them.

Government funding for PCSOs, and for the substantial number of police who are funded by direct special grants rather than the general grant, remain in place after 2011, to which date it is guaranteed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para12"><a name="09020464000333">Secondly, the Government brought forward &#163;3 billion of capital spending to assist in economic recovery, but none of it went towards improvements in the police estate. We are told that the Government are preparing a further tranche of that funding as part of the forthcoming Budget. Do the Government have any further plans to release capital investment into the police estate? That would boost the construction industry, create jobs and, above all, take pressure off local police authority budgets where there are dilapidated police stations that need replacing and other facilities that need improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para13"><a name="09020464000334">The issues that we have considered so far apply generally to all 43 police authorities in England and Wales. However, some issues apply more to specific police authorities. For example, 15 police authorities&#151;just under 30 per cent.&#151;were affected by the Icelandic banking crisis. The outcome of the crisis and, therefore, its full impact, remains unclear and will be for some time. The increasing uncertainty and risk for the affected authorities is a cause of great concern, and the Government have provided support so far. Continuing Government support for repaying the loans involved is required, especially if repayment is delayed or money has to be written off as a result of what happened in Iceland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para14"><a name="09020464000335">Another much bigger and longer-running issue affects some but by no means all police authorities, and several hon. Members referred to it earlier. It is the formula for funding police authorities. To the Government&#146;s credit, after saying that they would tackle the matter in 1997 when they came to power, they eventually introduced a fairer funding formula nearly 10 years later. However, they told the worst hit authorities that it would be years before the underfunding was made up. Telling police authorities that they were underfunded by specific amounts but that they could not have the money caused consternation. As yet, no date has been set for ending the floors and ceilings mechanisms and the underfunding of so many authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para15"><a name="09020464000336">The Minister has already referred to the fact that all the police authorities in the east midlands, parts of which we both represent&#151;in Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, the Minister&#146;s area of Nottinghamshire and my area of Derbyshire&#151;are affected, as are many others throughout the country. He said this afternoon that the formula is being reviewed again for 2011 onwards. However, let us remember the history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para16"><a name="09020464000337">Before 1997, the shire counties that lost out worst from the funding formula had a long-running campaign&#151;the F40 campaign. In 1997, the Government said that they would review the position. In 2006-07, nine years later, they introduced the new formula but said that they could not provide the money that they admitted authorities needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para17"><a name="09020464000338">I shall be slightly parochial. Last year, Derbyshire was the fourth worst funded police authority in England and Wales. This year, it sank to third lowest, with only Suffolk and Essex in a worse position. Under the new, &#147;fair&#148; formula that was introduced in 2006-07, Derbyshire has lost &#163;16 million so far. The Government say that Derbyshire needs that money to provide adequate policing, but that it cannot have it. This year, Derbyshire will lose another &#163;5 million, and another &#163;5 million in the subsequent  <br>

year. That is equal to 3 per cent. of the force&#146;s entire budget every year and more than 160 police officers on the beat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para18"><a name="09020464000339">Derbyshire has had to plug the gaps in the underfunding by using its reserves, but they are coming to an end. In a year or two, there will be no more reserves to plug the gap in the funding that the Government say that Derbyshire needs, but that they will not provide. It is impossible to understand why the worst funded authorities in the country, some of which, like Derbyshire, have experienced the problem for more than 20 years, must bear the brunt of a tight police grant settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para19"><a name="09020464000340">Police officers and constituents in Chesterfield simply cannot understand that we are the third worst funded police authority in the country yet we must continue to be underfunded because of overall problems with the police grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para20"><a name="09020464000341">The Minister said that he had received only 15 representations this year&#151;far fewer than last year. Perhaps police authorities have simply given up because they meet the same stonewalling every year. Will the Minister offer any genuine hope to the worst funded authorities, such as Derbyshire, that all the unequal funding of recent years will end? After all, the councils and fire authorities that suffered from the funding formula have had their historic problem removed and levelled out much more quickly. Why are police authorities singled out to bear the brunt of what the Government admit was an unfair formula, saying that they should have more money, but that they cannot have it?</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the debate on the police funding settlement this year. I shall focus my brief remarks on my police force area of Dyfed-Powys.

Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams) initiated a short debate on the subject, and I am grateful for some of the assurances that the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell) gave in response to it.

In last Wednesday&#146;s debate in Westminster Hall, the Under-Secretary said that he had received no representations from the authority this year on the settlement. However, I assure him that Members who represent constituencies in the area have received strong representations.

Given the size of the police authority area, it is worth pointing out that Dyfed-Powys has the third smallest police force. That immediately poses a challenge to the chief constable of how to deploy personnel across such a vast area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90204-0008.htm_para23"><a name="09020464000345">Last week, in the Westminster Hall debate, the Under-Secretary described Dyfed-Powys police authority as well resourced. Like many hon. Members, I have a six-monthly night out with my local police. On a Saturday night, the police authority does not feel especially well resourced. All it takes in my police division of Pembrokeshire is one road traffic accident, a fight outside a local nightclub and one domestic violence incident for the force to start to feel stretched.</p>

On my most recent Saturday night with my local police, I witnessed the important role that not only special constables, who give up their time, but volunteers in the CCTV control centre, play. We want to encourage such volunteering. There are all sorts of benefits from engaging more civilian volunteers in police operations, but the police should never have to perceive volunteers as an absolute necessity for delivering policing at busy times such as a Saturday night.</p>

&#163;9.8 million, well above its target of &#163;7.3 million. The theory is that the force should be using those efficiencies to invest in, for example, protective services and other Government priorities. However, the force tells me that it has to use those efficiency savings just to maintain baseline services, and there is very little capacity to make improvements. The force has particular concerns about the expectations in the policing pledge&#151;about its ability, for example, to respond to emergency and non-emergency calls within 20 minutes on all occasions, and about the timescales in which victims of crime need to be informed. Being able to meet those expectations is challenging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para1"><a name="09020464000352">Several hon. Members have already mentioned the rural police grant. I would like to reiterate the points that have been raised. There is concern in Dyfed-Powys police force authority about the future of the rural police grant. I am not, perhaps, expecting the Minister to say any more about that than his colleague has already said in this debate, but I would like to impress upon him the needs of rural areas and the challenges that rurality throws up. If he cannot say what the future holds for the rural police grant, I would be grateful if he could give an indication of what his thinking is on how different aspects of rurality will be taken into account in the discussions and considerations about the future of the rural police grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para2"><a name="09020464000353">Let me return to my point about the liquefied natural gas terminals. There is significant concern about how well protected those facilities are. Just to remind hon. Members, in the years ahead the two LNG terminals will have the capacity to import 30 per cent.&#151;almost a third&#151;of the UK&#146;s entire natural gas requirement. They are clearly a significant piece of national infrastructure. I do not expect the Minister to comment on that in great detail, but concern has been communicated to me about a proposed reduction in the funding for officers engaged in security work at the port of Milford Haven. I do not want to speculate about why that might be so or about where else resources might deployed. However, if the Minister receives an application from the police force in Dyfed-Powys for additional resources to support the policing of the LNG terminals, I would ask him to look favourably on that request.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to speak in this debate, albeit only briefly. I commend the Minister on the fact that he has always been responsive to representations made to him about the police settlement. Indeed, I think that I am the third Member from the Dyfed-Powys police area to contribute to today&#146;s debate. We do so on the basis that we are very proud of our police force. The people who live in the Dyfed-Powys area are basically satisfied with the service that they get. They complain from time to time about police visibility, but we live in a sparsely populated area. It is a challenge for the chief constable to deploy his forces around that area to give people confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para3"><a name="09020464000355">However, the force does a lot of good. I attended an event last week at which awards were given to police officers, specials, police community support officers and back-room staff for the work that they had done in the Powys area. The citation on each award read &#147;For making Powys a safer place&#148;. That must be the aim of the police force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para4"><a name="09020464000356">The hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) raised a number of points, which I would like to reinforce. In a way, the representations that we are making today are not about the present police settlement, but about its future. Mention has been made of Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s report, which, if I understand it correctly, says that the formula must be adhered to more strictly. However, the fact that the funding for many Welsh police forces depends on exceptions being made to the formula, rather than on the formula being delivered right across the piece, is important. Indeed, if the floor&#151;the minimum of 2.5 per cent. of the settlement&#151;were not implemented for all four Welsh police authorities, there would be a loss to those authorities of &#163;15 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para5"><a name="09020464000357">I also want to mention the rural policing grant. The rule 2 grants make a contribution to the funding of authorities, but most of those grants are spread among all the police authorities, whereas the rural policing grant goes to only a limited number of authorities. That being the case, certain police authorities would suffer disproportionately if the rural policing grant were abolished or if the rule 2 grants were brought within the formula. If that happened, it would be difficult for Dyfed-Powys police to maintain the standard of policing that the people living in the area have come to expect. If we were to aspire to the same level of policing, there would be a huge increase in the precept, and in the council tax that people would have to pay&#151;and we know how unfairly council tax falls on the lowest paid in our communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para6"><a name="09020464000358">I want to comment on one other issue. At the moment, the area that I represent has only one set of custody cells for an area that extends for about 80 miles south to north and about 40 miles east to west. That means that putting somebody arrested in Llandrindod Wells into a custody cell requires a journey of at least 30 miles, which takes police officers away from their duties, just to take a prisoner from a police station without a custody cell to one with a good custody suite. It is important to make the appropriate capital investment in the infrastructure, so that the police can spend their time dealing with the issues that the public expect them to deal with, rather than having to transport prisoners.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making an important point about custody suites. We have a new all-singing, all-dancing custody suite in the Pembrokeshire division. However, officers have raised with me concerns similar to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, about how making arrests in different parts of the area now ties up an awful lot of police time. One of those concerns is that the new custody suite might create a disincentive to bringing into custody people who would previously have been taken into custody closer to where the offences were committed.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Both of us are making the point that investment in capital works&#151;such as new buildings and new custody suites&#151;can improve policing quite considerably, to an extent that would be noticed and appreciated by the general public. I am talking in particular about Llandrindod Wells, where there is a scheme for a new police station with custody cells and a magistrates court, which will be integrated with an ambulance station and a fire station, so that we can have all the emergency services co-operating as one.</p>

 This is a welcome opportunity to debate the police grant settlement, which forms about half of the police&#146;s funding, the rest coming from the local government finance system&#151;a combination of revenue support, non-domestic rates and council tax. There cannot be many MPs who are entirely happy with the Government&#146;s handling of the police pay settlement last year&#151;we all received a sizeable postbag on the matter&#151;because the Government clearly got it wrong, and Ministers probably regret the way in which they handled it at the time. The pay settlement has left a legacy of bitterness. I can still go into my local police station in Reading and see the posters on the wall that say &#147;Tough on crime, tough on the fighters of crime&#148;. I know that the Government have since tried to address the pay settlement, but the bitterness will remain for some time. What happened has been neither forgotten nor forgiven.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para8"><a name="09020464000363">I am delighted to have this opportunity to pay tribute to my local police force, the Thames Valley police, for its continuing hard work and good performance. This year&#146;s unremarkable police settlement reflects the overall spending review provision from the Home Office&#151;that is, no real-terms increase. This translates into a 2.7 per cent. increase in the general police grant for 2009-10. It is true that Thames Valley police is quite fortunate, because it is one of the police authorities to receive a higher police grant allocation, compared with other shire authorities. It will receive &#163;238 million this year, which equates to a 2.7 per cent. increase on last year&#146;s settlement. That is not one of the highest settlements, but, fortunately, it is not one of the lowest either. I am grateful to the Home Secretary, who recognises the importance and the position of the Thames Valley force, because of its close proximity to London, and has allocated funds accordingly. Despite that, however, there are certain issues that it will be useful for me to put on record today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para9"><a name="09020464000364">I have mentioned before that the Thames Valley police force suffers from considerable problems of officer retention. A major concern is that the Metropolitan police is able to pay its officers much more than Thames Valley police can pay its equivalent officers. The Met is also able to give its officers free travel within a 70-mile zone right around London. The south-east allowance, which was introduced a few years ago in an effort to curb a further manpower drain, has remained frozen, while the Metropolitan police&#146;s London weighting allowance has continued to rise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09020464000365">The incentive gap has therefore become wider, and it has become much more attractive for Thames Valley officers to move to London to improve their economic position. This is now causing a serious problem for the Thames Valley force. Its chief constable, Sara Thornton, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee  <br>

when it happened to be meeting in my constituency, said that she would be in favour of increasing the south-east allowance by &#163;1,000 a year to make it easier for officers living in the south-east not to get sucked in by the extra pay and free travel that they would get for working in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para11"><a name="09020464000366">I believe that the chief constable has since met&#151;and continues to have an important dialogue with&#151;the Home Secretary and the Minister for Policing, with the intention of introducing the flexibility further to increase the south-east allowance. In a debate in Westminster Hall last week, it became clear that Thames Valley police had the money in its budgets to fund that allowance and to make it available. During the debate, I think that the Minister said that an uplift in the allowance in the south-east would cost about &#163;20 million, and that he referred to a figure of about &#163;2 million to achieve the uplift in the Thames Valley police area. I hope that he will correct me if I am wrong.</p>

 I have not got the figures for the south-east allowances with me at the moment. However, I did say that the moneys in the budget for those allowances were not a matter of additional resource, which I think was helpful to the general debate. Perhaps the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) will verify that. I also said that this is not a ministerial decision; it is a matter for the Police Negotiating Board to come to an agreement with all the various bodies involved on how to resolve the issue. While I am on my feet, I should also like to say, in response to being asked to &#147;have a word&#148; about these matters, that it was not so much a matter of having a word; it is just that I saw this as a matter for the board and as a priority for it to resolve it. I know that that is what it is trying to do.</p>

 I thank the Minister for that intervention. I am absolutely delighted to hear him repeat that this is a matter for the Police Negotiating Board; that was stated last week and it has now been repeated this afternoon. I welcome that statement.</p>

I hope that that will go some way towards alleviating the problem of experienced officers being sucked into the London Metropolitan police area. I should like to make it clear that I am not advocating any additional grant resources to the Thames Valley, but if the force is to retain its best officers, it will need the Minister&#146;s support to try to resolve this situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para13"><a name="09020464000370">Its costs the Thames Valley police &#163;55,000 to train each trainee constable, but it has lost 242 officers in the past five years. It would be a drain on any force for those numbers to continue, and this issue is an increasingly difficult problem and a big financial drain for the Thames Valley force.

for police pay in the Thames Valley force that the chief constable is asking for, there also needs to be an agreement with the Metropolitan police that it will not poach significant numbers of police officers. That would be extremely welcome to the chief constable in the Thames Valley, and I am sure that the Minister will do all that he can to facilitate such an agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para15"><a name="09020464000372">I would like to raise a number of other financial issues, particularly in relation to population growth. The chief constable has raised significant concerns about the impact of population growth right across the Thames Valley, and I know from my experience of living in Reading for the past 25 years that the city has grown significantly in that time. Of course, more recently, immigration has added enormously to that population pressure. Several years ago, I was briefed by the police in Reading that much of the serious organised crime in Reading was run by immigrants, many of whom were in the country illegally. I would be interested to get an update on that from Thames Valley police, and to hear whether the Minister has any further information on whether there has been any improvement.</p>

<p><a name="st_o154"><a name="09020464000373"><a name="90204-0009.htm_spnew6"><a name="09020464000867"><b>Mr. Stewart Jackson (Peterborough) (Con):</b>
 My hon. Friend is making a strong and compelling case. Does he agree that the problem with the extrapolation of population statistics with regard to the funding formula is that they are based on out-of-date figures from 2004, and that those figures should have been updated before the comprehensive spending review? Does he agree that this is having a direct impact on front-line policing across the country?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I know that Slough has had many problems dealing with extra numbers and the resultant financial pressures put on many public services. No doubt Peterborough faces a very similar set of challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para16"><a name="09020464000375">The impact of population growth on police services needs to be recognised, so it is only right for the police authority to be consulted on major spatial plans, for example. Support to secure resources from the planning system to meet the costs of infrastructure development is also important for the policing of the expanding Thames Valley region. All that certainly needs to be looked at. We need to think about whether section 106 money should be used to help support the additional policing infrastructure that will be necessary in the years to come as the population expands. That is worth considering. I know that at this particularly difficult time in the middle of a recession, local authorities are going jealously to guard their income from section 106 money, so it is not going to be a particularly easy nut to crack if the Minister decides to go down that particular avenue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para17"><a name="09020464000376">With the current level of population growth, Thames Valley police estimates that their capital costs for new buildings and so forth will be about &#163;90 million&#151;just to keep pace with the level of services provided now. The chief constable has said that the force will have real problems trying to generate that level of capital receipts, so it looks as thought there might be another funding gap in the future. He also estimates that the number of staff, including officers, that Thames Valley will need will have to grow to about 1,200&#151;again just to maintain the current level of policing services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para18"><a name="09020464000377">I know that there is a link to population in the revenue support grant, but the floors and ceilings apparently mean that minimal additional revenue grant will be generated for the Thames Valley police. That needs to be looked into further. There are also other funding pressures. The Olympics, for example, is clearly going to suck in resources from the Thames Valley, and it would be interesting to hear the Minister explain how that extra resourcing might be handled and what sort of extra support a force such as Thames Valley will be able to get when it is going to have to provide so many police officers for the Olympics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para19"><a name="09020464000378">Counter-terrorism is another important issue. I cannot speak as freely as I would like on this occasion, so all I will say is that a significant threat still remains within the Thames Valley. I know that there is a specific grant for counter-terrorism, for which we are very grateful, but the pressure is likely to get much worse before it gets better. There is the potential for extremism in Reading, Slough, High Wycombe and other centres in the Thames Valley despite all the excellent work that goes on in those local areas to combat the threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para20"><a name="09020464000379">I have recently been critical of the detection rates of the Thames Valley police. It is actually one of the worst performing authorities in the country in that respect. We are not doing well, and that needs to be said. However, I say it as a friend, albeit a critical friend, of the Thames Valley police. The force is doing many things particularly well, but there is enormous room for improvement on detection rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para21"><a name="09020464000380">I would like to say that we have a particularly good team in Reading, made up of active, responsive and forward-thinking officers and I would like to repeat the praise I expressed in last week&#146;s Westminster Hall debate for Superintendent Steve Kirk, who does a quite outstanding job across my Reading, East constituency. I have also been very pleased by the roll-out of neighbourhood policing in my constituency. It has the potential to make a real difference over time, particularly if it is coupled with a drive to reduce red tape and bureaucracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para22"><a name="09020464000381">The impact of all the extra money that has gone into policing over the years has to some extent been dissipated because police officers spend less and less of their time on the street performing their front-line duties. There is way too much bureaucracy put upon police officers. I have heard that from them first hand. Like many colleagues, I have been out on my mountain bike with officers in Reading, East; I have been out in the town centre in a van, and I have spoken to officers. They have told me many stories. For example, I heard about an officer arresting a shoplifter at 9.30 in the morning and then having to write off the entire shift while he processed that one person through the system. There are, of course, many more such examples that I am sure colleagues could add. If we could sort out those problems, we could get more return on the investment we make in police officers. In turn, that would massively improve the prospects of neighbourhood policing making an impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90204-0009.htm_para23"><a name="09020464000382">As I said earlier, I am not asking for more money. I do not think that the Thames Valley police actually needs any more money today, but it may well need money in the near future. Any support in the particular areas I mentioned would, I am sure, be very welcome to the chief constable of Thames Valley police.</p>

Members will know that I have raised the issue on a number of occasions and that I was fortunate enough to secure a Westminster Hall debate in February last year on police funding in Peterborough and Cambridgeshire. Peterborough and Cambridgeshire, along with Kent and Lincolnshire, are in a parlous financial position. They urgently need a review of their formula allocation for the next financial year as well as, I would argue, a review for 2010-11.

In the northern basic command unit, incorporating my constituency, we have actually a seen a fall in the number of full-time equivalent police officers over the last six years. Indeed, the Minister provided that information in a parliamentary answer to me on 29 January at column 828W.

It focused on the specific demographic, social, economic and cultural changes that face the county over the next 10 years or so, including population changes, migration from both within and outside the United Kingdom, growth in higher education numbers, issues involving Gypsies and travellers, and tourism, which is, of course, a particular issue in the Cambridge area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09020464000390">Today, however, I wish to focus on the practical impact of migration&#151;specifically European Union migration&#151;on my constituency and throughout Cambridgeshire, its particular impact on crime and policing, and the financial impact that that will inevitably involve. I recently met a member of the police authority who explained to me that if a police officer in Peterborough stops an individual from, say, Lithuania or the Czech Republic in connection with the committing of a possible offence&#151;or, indeed, if that person has been the victim of a crime&#151;the need for translation and interpretation services can double or treble the time that it takes to process the individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para7"><a name="09020464000391">Cambridgeshire constabulary&#146;s recent briefing to the Migration Impacts Forum, published last month, illustrates the significance of that example. In every month of the calendar year to 31 December 2008, with the exception of January and June, more than 20 per cent. of detainees processed through the custody suite in the northern basic command unit were non-UK citizens. In the last year, across the whole force, 800 Lithuanians, more than 700 Poles and 300 Portuguese citizens have been processed, most of whom spoke little or&#151;usually&#151;no English.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para8"><a name="09020464000392">Use of Language Line, a telephone translation and interpretation service, increased last year from an average of 373 calls per month to 497 per month in the period up to November 2008. In the last financial year Cambridgeshire spent &#163;1 million on translation and interpretation services, whereas in 2002 it spent only &#163;224,000. Moreover, 50 per cent. of detainees questioned about drink-driving and disqualified driving offences in the northern basic command unit were non-UK citizens, while 84 per cent. of the 213 warrants issued by the magistrates courts in Peterborough for minor offences were issued for EU nationals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para9"><a name="09020464000393">Ministers have known for at least three years about the impact of large-scale immigration on policing but have failed to reflect it in their funding allocations, despite the promises to listen and act delivered by this Minister, his predecessors and, indeed, the Home Secretary during Home Office questions over those three years. I concede that this is, not to put too fine a point on it, more a cock-up than a conspiracy. I do not agree that it is necessarily an issue of whether a police authority is in a predominantly Conservative or a predominantly Labour area. However, Ministers are not listening. Despite visits to Peterborough and visits by delegations consisting of senior police authority members and the chief constable, nothing has been done. Indeed, we are going backwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para10"><a name="09020464000394">As I made clear in my intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson), these funding decisions are based on completely flawed population estimates, and Ministers have failed to act to correct them. On 27 November 2007, in evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, the then immigration Minister, the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne), said that funding to 2010 would continue to be based on 2004 sub-national population data</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09020464000395">That is not the basis on which to make these funding decisions, because the methodology and the data are flawed.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09020464000400">The House can imagine how resource-intensive that process was for a force that is already under-provisioned in terms of front-line police officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09020464000401">Even without those specific migration factors, Cambridgeshire will be struggling to deliver the police service that local people deserve and need. In 2007, the Association of Police Authorities estimated that the current comprehensive spending review funding regime would result in a funding shortfall across the country of at least &#163;831 million. In a report prepared for the police authority 18 months ago, the management consultants KPMG concluded on the basis of the Cambridgeshire constabulary&#146;s current work load that the county required at least an extra 100 officers. Let me put in context how badly underfunded my local constabulary is: just to achieve the average funding and provision of front-line officers for England and Wales Cambridgeshire would need at least 600 more police officers, at a significant revenue cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para18"><a name="09020464000402">Despite warm words from the Minister, who is an agreeable chap&#151;I think we can all agree on that&#151;and several deputations from the police authority and the chief constable, we are no further forward this year. The Government continue to undercount population numbers and to underfund core police service activity. Cambridgeshire is losing more than &#163;2 million per annum, which has a major year-on-year cumulative effect, as a result of the funding floors. The force has the fourth lowest number of police staff per head of population in England and Wales. The 2010-11 pay deals, amounting to about 2.5 per cent., mean that it will experience a real-terms cash decrease.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para19"><a name="09020464000403">I have not even discussed Cambridgeshire&#146;s capital programme. The &#163;1.5 million to be allocated to the force in the next financial year will be only just enough to cover the vehicle replacement programme; it will not cover other key projects, such as the rebuilding of police stations in Parkside, Cambridge and Huntingdon. We are not demanding extra funds for fashionable budget headings such as protective services and counter-terrorism, or the Olympics. Thank goodness, we do not have a major problem with knife crime, gangs and guns; we do, however, require fairness and equity.</p>

This situation is unfair, intolerable, iniquitous and ultimately unsustainable. It cannot go on. My constituents deserve better, as do those of other Cambridgeshire Members. I hope the Minister is listening, and that, for once, we have action and not just words.</p>

 This has been an interesting and informed debate. Several Members passionately expressed their feelings about policing issues, especially the current grant settlement. In common with many contributors, I would first like to record my congratulations on and praise for the work police officers do not only in my constituency, but across the country. It is always humbling to go out with the police and see the work they do at the sharp end, often in difficult circumstances. It is important to recognise that in the context of this debate, which, by necessity, focuses on funding streams rather than the practical work the police do throughout the country in protecting us and providing safety to the communities we represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para21"><a name="09020464000406">This debate has, of course, focused heavily on the grant settlement. It is important to recognise the changing funding arrangements and the shift in burden from direct central Government grant to local authority precept. In 1997, direct grant represented 85 per cent. of forces&#146; revenue, but in 2006-07 the figure had fallen to 60 per cent. Therefore, an increasing proportion of the funds going to our police forces is coming from council tax payers in our areas rather than from direct grant. It is important to recognise the amount of funding that is coming directly from council tax payers, rather than from central Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para22"><a name="09020464000407">There have been some good and important contributions to the debate, and I wish to place on record my congratulations to the Home Affairs Committee on the work it undertakes in putting a number of important issues into the public domain, and thereby informing the general discussion and ensuring that relevant matters are given the attention they deserve. The right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) raised some important issues&#151;for instance, alcohol-related crime, which he and I have debated on several previous occasions. I certainly recognise the link between alcohol and violent crime and the pressures our police forces have to withstand, and the difficulties and challenges they face, in the early hours of the morning. In that context, there is an issue to do with pricing, and the right hon. Gentleman covered it well in his contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para23"><a name="09020464000408">In terms of funding arrangements and the efficient use of resources, Government, and particularly Home Office, IT projects are of relevance. The right hon. Member for Leicester, East made an important point about the funding and status of the police portal and the dispute around the contract associated with that. I hope that the Minister will be able to shed some further light on those issues when he responds to our debate. Other IT projects also deserve further scrutiny, such as the Pentip computer system intended to register penalty notices for disorder and other policing matters, which is over-budget and running late. It is important that we get good value for money and that procurement issues are dealt with appropriately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para24"><a name="09020464000409">The hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) made important points on procurement and ensuring that we get good value for money and have efficiencies. I think that is recognised in all parts of the House, as is the importance of forces being able to share in certain aspects of procurement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para25"><a name="09020464000410">My hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) rightly highlighted the challenges facing many rural police forces, and in particular how population flows caused by tourism can have a big impact on the ability to police. The problems he raised to do with tourism and swells in population are shared by a number of police forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para26"><a name="09020464000411">The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) made the important point that we should recognise the work of those officers who ensure safety in our community, and he commented that his area of Dyfed-Powys had been made a safer place. He also said that we must look to the future, and at the review of the funding formula, to which the Minister alluded in his opening remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para27"><a name="09020464000412">My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson) highlighted the issue of officer retention and some of the challenges in terms of the relationships between police forces, particularly in the areas surrounding London. We look forward with interest to the continuing discussions of the Police Negotiating Board on south-east allowances, which is of direct relevance to a number of Members who have made contributions; the Minister mentioned this in his remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para28"><a name="09020464000413">My hon. Friend also made some important points about counter-terrorism and the Olympics budget. We look forward to receiving further details from the Minister on that budget. There are some scrutiny aspects that will need to be applied, and we need to have a better understanding of the Government&#146;s position and of the costs and impact all of this might have on police forces throughout the country and their budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para29"><a name="09020464000414">My hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) is passionate about the issues facing his Cambridgeshire area. His comments reflect those of the chief constable, Julie Spence, on the difficulties and challenges in respect of movements of population and whether the funding formula adequately takes them into account, particularly when it is based on information that dates back to 2004.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para30"><a name="09020464000415">Clearly, this discussion is part of a wider debate on the comprehensive spending review, and it is interesting to note that at the time when the first police funding grant was settled, Tim Brain, chief constable of Gloucestershire police and the Association of Chief Police Officers lead on finance, made the following prescient point:</p>
<a name="90204-0010.htm_brev4"><a name="09020464000682"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We don&#146;t all start on a level playing field, and some, possibly many, forces will have to continue to introduce planned cuts at a local level. Furthermore, the grant settlement will help maintain most aspects of &#145;business as usual&#146; but is likely to restrict key development.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para31"><a name="09020464000416">His comments then are equally relevant now in terms of some of the pressures and challenges police forces have to address and the fact that those challenges are changing and growing. We have heard about the pressures in relation to the growth of different communities and new communities arising, one of which is translation costs; according to Freedom of Information Act information, in the last financial year the cost to police  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="4 Feb 2009">

<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>4 Feb 2009 : Column 889</b><br>
forces throughout the country is about &#163;25 million. That cost has risen significantly in the past five years, probably by about two thirds. It is also worth remembering that additional policing pressures arise from this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para32"><a name="09020464000417">It would be useful to hear from the Minister about the context and framework of the review of the police funding formula. What will the parameters of that review be, and to what extent will his ambit take into account changes in population and the practical impact that has on police forces and how they manage their budgets? I hope he will be able to give more details when he responds to the debate, and to confirm the timing of the review, whether he expects to publish interim findings in respect of it, and how this will interrelate with the next comprehensive spending round. That will be important in informing the debate, and in explaining how things will link with the funding arrangements for the police as we move towards the next comprehensive spending review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para33"><a name="09020464000418">A number of different factors are putting increasing pressures on the police. As, sadly, we all know, there is a downturn in the economy, with an accompanying risk of an increase in volume-acquisitive crime. The Home Office appears to have recognised and accepted that this will lead to an increase in crime, although we are getting some mixed messages from the Home Secretary about whether she agrees with that perspective. I am thinking of the leaked memo that indicated that the Home Office was expecting a rise. Will the Minister confirm whether he agrees with the memorandum or with the view of the Home Secretary that there might not be such a rise? There are also other pressures&#151;not simply direct burglaries and frauds, which have been focused on, but emerging threats. He knows the interest that I take in the growth in cybercrime and internet crime&#151;the different types of emerging problems that are complex and technical and for which there have been few prosecutions under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. We need to address the reliance on forensics and how dealing with that type of criminality will need to feed into and inform future funding arrangements because of the additional pressures that it will place on policing; we need to respond to the changing nature of the threats that emerge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para34"><a name="09020464000419">The Flanagan review made an important point about the pressures on policing; it said that the current level of policing numbers was unsustainable. Notwithstanding the fact that police strength numbers remained flat, according to the last figures, will the Minister say whether he agrees with Sir Ronnie&#146;s view that police force numbers are unsustainable? If he does, will he say what assessment he is making of any reductions that might apply and how that fits into the context of the current settlement and, indeed, future ones?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90204-0010.htm_para35"><a name="09020464000420">This important debate has given many hon. Members the opportunity to highlight the financing challenges and problems that may be faced in ensuring greater safety in their communities. We look forward to hearing further details on the funding formula and on how the Minister intends to review and reform it to ensure that it provides for, and reflects the needs of, our communities and is responsive to changes in threat, in population and in need. We look forward to continuing the debate in the months ahead.</p>

 I thank all hon. Members who contributed to this debate for the informed and interesting way in which they made their points. I shall try to answer the questions that have been raised and deal specifically with some of the points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90204-0011.htm_para0"><a name="09020464000422">I agree very much with the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) about the fact that all of us should start these debates, as we have done, by paying tribute to police forces across the country for their work and the way in which they often put themselves in very dangerous situations to ensure public safety as far as they are able.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90204-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09020464000423">The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) again sought confirmation about capping. He will know that Cheshire, Leicestershire and Warwickshire were capped in advance for 2009-10, limiting their council tax increases to 3 per cent.&#151;that situation stays the same. They had 21 days from 26 November in which to appeal and none did so&#151;that was the point that my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) made; the approach we took significantly helped in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90204-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09020464000424">The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds asked what capital moneys had been brought forward. Capital moneys for Serious Organised Crime Agency and the National Police Improvement Agency have been brought forward, and they have been spent on helping with the current economic climate. He asked whether police authorities can apply for the migration moneys that I mentioned&#151;yes, they can. I want to spend a little time on this issue. We expect the Office for National Statistics to produce estimates of short-term inward migration by this summer, and we want to improve the population data informing the police funding formula debate. The review of the formula gives us an opportunity to try to address some of the issues raised by hon. Members from across the House. That review will enable us from the next comprehensive spending review round&#151;from 2011-12&#151;to move forward on that basis. That is where our intention lies. Meetings have started to be held on what changes we should be reflecting upon and, indeed, this afternoon&#146;s debate will help with that debate. All the issues such as how we better estimate population and the impact of migration will be included in our discussions, as will other matter that have been raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90204-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09020464000425">The hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) said that no change had been forthcoming. I know he could not help not being here earlier in the debate, but had he been here he would have heard that from April the migration impact fund will be available in Government offices for the regions; police forces, as well as other local service providers, will be able to apply for money to help them deal with some of the very issues that he raised with regard to Cambridgeshire. Cambridgeshire police authority will be able to go to the Government office for its region to put a case for receiving that money, as will authorities in other parts of the country.</p>

 It is also incumbent on Ministers to act responsibly. What I have said to the hon. Gentleman is that from April his local police force will be able to apply to the Government office for his region for funding. If we unpick the funding formula in the middle of a CSR round, although his force may get an extra few million, countless other Conservative Back Benchers and Members from all parts of the House will say that the Government have broken what they said they were going to do, which was to provide stable funding for the police service. That is why the Home Office has received limited representation about this funding round and why we have heard more concern about what happens in the next funding round&#151;that is what the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire was arguing about and it is what most other Members in this debate have discussed. They recognise that if a Government unpick a settlement in the middle of it, that causes instability and chaos. That is why we have not unpicked this one and why we are not going to do so.</p>

Friend the Member for Leicester, East raised the issue of new technology and we agree with him on it. He, like the hon. Member for Hornchurch, raised a specific point, and I should like to read out a reply so that I put it accurately. The police portal was a website providing a national communications channel. The main service was to enable the reporting of crime and hate crime online. Good use was made of it, but running costs increased as a result of technical problems. The Association of Chief Police Officers took the view that there was not enough demand to justify the increasing costs, so the scheme was discontinued. QinetiQ&#146;s contract was terminated by the NPIA in July 2007. QinetiQ then sued the NPIA and it countersued. These legal matters were resolved in November 2008 in a non-disclosed agreement. Some forces do have online facilities on their website to allow the reporting of crime.</p>

 We are debating the 2009-10 settlement for local government, the second year of the first ever three-year funding deal for councils. Through the Government&#146;s policy on three-year settlements, I have made certain commitments to local government. First, every council in every region will get an increase in its core grant in each of the three years. Secondly, total Government funding for councils in England rose by 4 per cent. this year, will rise by 4.2 per cent. next year and is set to increase by 4.4 per cent. in 2010-11. Thirdly, councils will have more freedom to take local spending decisions. By 2010-11, &#163;5.7 billion a year will have been mainstreamed into funding with no Government funding strings attached. Fourthly, councils will have more certainty about other funding, so in addition to the core grant, I am also confirming today the allocation to councils of 70 other grants from eight different Departments. Most importantly, I have given the commitment not to change my proposals on formula grant distribution, except in entirely exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90204-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09020464000447">Local councils therefore know what they will get, and they can plan and manage ahead.

shall also deal with how I expect councils to show&#151;and how they are showing&#151;that they can deal with the downtown. I am aware of such representations, not least from London councils, representatives of which I met face to face. Their first point, when I asked them about the apparent impact of the economic downturn on their councils, was that an increasing number of students were coming out of private school education and looking for places in the state school system. That was their top priority.</p>

 The Minister suggested that he was going to answer in terms of the decisions that he has made. We already know that the decisions that he has made will not help the situation. My colleagues and I from all parties around the capital are asking the Government to consider the case of primary school places in London. The change happened before the Government did all the work in preparation for the announcement. Changes within the settlement and the comprehensive spending review need to be made in year. Otherwise, there will be severe problems for many children and families across the capital.</p>

 One of the principal strengths of a three-year settlement, as well as the additional flexibilities that allow local authorities to identify the priorities or pressures in their area, is that the authorities are given the capacity to manage through that period. For that reason, I have not regarded the representations that I have received on the demand for school places as exceptional circumstances warranting an unpicking of the three-year settlement and undoing the stability and certainty that is at its heart.</p>

 One of the other unfortunate by-products of the current economic downturn is the fact that local authorities such as mine, Chelmsford borough council, are being adversely affected as the fall in interest rates has changed the income that they receive from savings. What advice does the Minister have for local authorities affected in that way? Clearly, the three-year settlement would not have taken that consideration into account.</p>

 That is one of the points that have been put to me, not least by the Local Government Association, as the hon. Gentleman might expect. The impacts and pressures of the economic downturn do not all go one way. Some costs are down considerably, reserves are up and with inflation set to be lower next year, the quantum of Government grant to local government is likely to go further. There are pressures on local councils, just as there are on central Government, but they do not all go one way. Councils have the capacity to manage their way through this period, not least because they now have a three-year settlement with extra flexibility as part of the funding. They know what they are getting and are able to plan ahead and make some of the difficult decisions that they face.</p>

 I am sorry that I missed the Minister&#146;s first words, but I rushed here as soon as I saw that he had started to speak. I think that there might not have been many representations because, with a fixed three-year settlement, local councils might have thought that they would not see much change. Does he accept the case put by inner London boroughs in the representations that he has received for a better allocation of money for social services and the care of vulnerable younger people? The figure that I have been given&#151;he can correct me if I am wrong&#151;is that last year &#163;370 million was transferred out of London to the rest of the country. While some local authorities now have 99 per cent. of their funding met, boroughs like mine get only two-thirds of what they need to look after vulnerable young people.</p>

 No, I do not agree.

Will this Minister do the same?

 My hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing is always helpful. The hon. Gentleman has just asked a separate and different question, but I can give him the same answer. It is yes, and not least because the national statistician has been leading a task force over the past year, with local government intimately and essentially involved. On 24 February, the Office for National Statistics will announce a package of improvements to the population and migration statistics that will give us a better base for calculations for any future financial settlement beyond this three-year period.</p>

 I have not yet considered that representation, or any of the others that we have encouraged from local authorities. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is linked to our review of the area cost adjustment, which is essentially the mechanism that he and his council&#146;s chief executive and leader are concerned about. The way in which it operates is not entirely satisfactory, and we looked at options before striking the present three-year funding deal with councils. We consulted on various changes to the mechanism but none was appropriate at the time, although we are looking hard for the sort of changes that may be appropriate in the future. The work that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s council, and others, are doing with departmental officials is extremely valuable, and I and other colleagues in government will take a hard look at it as we prepare the ground for any future finance settlement beyond the current three-year period.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, and I apologise for not being present for the opening of his statement. The concerns expressed by my hon.

It too is an outer-London borough that welcomes the review of the area cost adjustment, but we need to see the reality of that review before we get to the end of the three-year cycle. Ideally, Enfield council would like to make reductions in council tax, but the fact that the dampening effect takes &#163;5 million out of its hands means that that money cannot be passed on to the taxpayer.</p>

 I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s description of damping is quite correct. He might like to recall that it was we who introduced the damping floor into the local government settlement in about 2000. Before that, authorities such as his would face big reductions year on year. They faced volatility that was difficult for them to manage, and that certainly made it difficult for them to plan ahead. If his authority benefits from the floor, I have to say to him that without that floor, his authority would be entitled to a good deal less support for council spending and council services.</p>

The distribution of that formula or core grant to authorities will be as I proposed to the House in November. On top of that, specific and area-based grants take the total increases to &#163;2.97 billion, or 4.2 per cent., next year, and &#163;3.18 billion, or 4.4 per cent., the year after that. It is a tight but fair settlement. It is in line with what I announced in 2007, and every local authority will get an increase in core grant in each year in this three-year period. I am also confirming allocations for 70 other funding streams today, including 43 separate grants from six different Departments, which will be paid in a single sum each month under the new area-based grant system&#151;and central Government have attached no strings, in terms of how local councils decide to spend that money.</p>

 Actually, some of the significant costs for local authorities&#151;fuel and, in time, energy costs&#151;are going the other way. The pressures and economic trends vary in their effect on local authorities, but it is for local authorities to manage that. It is central Government&#146;s job first to give local government a sufficient settlement to enable it to provide the services that people need, and secondly to give it, as far as we can, the stability and predictability to allow it to do its job of deciding how to manage its budgets, including in this economic downturn.</p>

Hon. Members may know that we had concluded that there were errors in one of the three criteria that we used for eligibility&#151;the third criterion. Having consulted all authorities on our proposals to revise the third criterion, and having taken into account all the representations that we received, I am today publishing the working neighbourhoods fund allocations for 2009-10 and the indicative allocations for the following year. As a result of these changes&#151;I am sorry the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) has left the Chamber&#151;Enfield is now fully eligible for the working neighbourhoods fund, as is Lewisham. They will receive their full allocations in 2009-10.</p>

 It would be churlish of me not to give the Minister some credit, although I suspect that the remonstrations of the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) carried more weight than mine in the various meetings that took place. When the Minister speaks of the working neighbourhoods fund moneys and mentions a considerable number of London boroughs, is he not concerned that London boroughs are so disproportionately represented, with 24 out of 33 getting the floor of the more general funding? As the effects of the recession are likely to reach London and the south-east more quickly than other parts of the country, there are likely to be substantial problems, such as those that other London Members have raised in the course of the Minister&#146;s speech.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to pay tribute, as I do, to the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), who made a forceful case. She is very concerned about the most deprived areas of her borough and sees the funding as an important element of supporting those people, as long as the council makes the right decisions in investing in the sort of programmes that will help. However, the hon. Gentleman should not underplay the strength of his own representations. They certainly played a part in the decisions that I reached.</p>

I hope he will appreciate that. Moreover, formula grant is part of the total funding that a council will have available each year. As part of their budget planning, councils make their own decisions on council tax levels. In order to judge to some extent whether the core grants that we are providing are a sufficient part for London boroughs such as his, it is important also to look at the council tax levels that his borough and others set.</p>

 The funds will be distributed to authorities, whether county or district, in the same way as in June last year. My answer to his second question is no. One of the values of the scheme for local councils has been that central Government have not attached conditions or funding strings to the money. As I said, the money is available now to deal with the impact of the economic downturn on jobs and businesses in local areas. However, it will be for local councils to decide how best to spend any money that they receive as a result of this announcement and the allocations that I am making today; I hope that they will be able to do that in a matter of weeks.</p>

Making the relief automatic is not straightforward, not least because there is a difficulty in ensuring that the person liable to pay business rates on one property does not have a string of similar properties, thereby breaching the eligibility criteria for claiming the relief.</p>

Funding for free bus travel for 11 million pensioners and disabled people continues to be delivered through two routes: the core grant and the special grant that local authorities requested for last year and the coming year. There is no evidence that the total amount of additional funding that central Government are putting in to support this new entitlement, which we are keen that people have, is not enough, although some authorities have argued for a change in its distribution. I understand their argument, but I have to say that any change would upset the three-year funding certainty of the settlement.

assurances from one of his colleagues that they would reconsider the formula by which these figures were decided. Although I do not dispute that the overall figure for the scheme nationally may be sufficient, in the case of my two local councils and others in my part of the country it is woefully insufficient and is having a serious impact on their finances.</p>

 I well remember the meeting with Worthing council. I remember, too, that the figures that were set before me were essentially predictions and modelling about which nobody could be entirely certain, not least because of two main factors: first, how people respond to the fact that they can now travel for free anywhere they like on local buses; and secondly, the significant variations in how tough and effective councils have been in negotiating their contracts with local bus operators. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to send me updated figures that are based on actual spend and cost, I will be interested to look at them. However, it is now clear that moving administration of the free bus travel scheme to county level instead of leaving it in the hands of district councils such as his own will help to iron out some of these funding wrinkles. I can confirm to the House that the Government plan to consult on such a move within the next few weeks.</p>

 I want to probe the Minister&#146;s suggestion that studies were being done to work out the public&#146;s response to the availability of more free travel.

 We do not need studies, because we can look at what has happened during the course of this year. The hon. Gentleman refers to studies; I was referring to modelling that local government had commissioned to try to argue the case with central Government. Of course, one of the main results of the free entitlement is that more people travel on buses. That is why this year central Government are putting an extra &#163;212 million into the concessionary travel pot to ensure that we can cover the extra costs for the extra entitlement that people now have to travel for free on buses not only within their local council area but anywhere that they choose.</p>

That, combined with an extra &#163;8.9 billion over three years, and moving &#163;5.7 billion into general grants that are not ring-fenced, allows councils to spend money on what matters most to local people.</p>

They have money that is clearly at risk, but it is not lost, and I want to help to minimise the problems for those authorities. Having completed the consultation on draft regulations that I promised to the House in November, I will shortly lay them before the House so that they can come into effect in this financial year. The regulations will mean that the possible losses from Icelandic banks will not affect council budgets or council tax levels during the next year. Representations have been made to me by some authorities about the position of passenger transport executives, which would not be covered by the change in regulations I have proposed. Those are subject to a separate and more flexible financial regime, and unlike local authorities, they are already able to spread revenue costs between years without any Government action being needed.</p>

In December, the Audit Commission published its report &#147;Crunch time?&#148;, which confirmed that councils are generally prepared for the impact that this downturn will have on local services, and that their efforts to find efficiency savings will ensure value for money and minimise the impact on their budgets and communities.</p>

With the expected fall in inflation next year, Government grants will go further. Some council costs are already down, reserves are up and borrowing is cheaper. Keeping council tax down and maintaining improvements in services means being continually more efficient, and low tax does not have to mean service cuts. About a fortnight ago, I visited Newham, Greenwich and Hackney, and saw that it is possible to make that equation add up. In each of those three boroughs, I saw service improvements and further investment at the same time that council tax was frozen. Councils must strive to make every penny of public money go as far as it can. When everyone is tightening their belt, people expect councils to do the same.</p>

In Northumberland, as in the other eight areas where new unitary councils will come into place in April, the scope to manage difficult economic pressures is much greater than it is for those councils that are continuing without such restructuring and reorganisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90204-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09020464000520">The efficiency challenge for councils means that they need to find more than &#163;1.5 billion new savings every year. To put that into perspective, it is worth &#163;90 off the average band D council tax bill. For this year, councils are forecasting around &#163;1.1 billion of new savings, which is similar to those that they have achieved in previous year, but it is clearly not good enough now, and councils must do more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90204-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09020464000521">I believe that council tax payers should be able to see and challenge the value for money that their local authorities provide. Therefore, from this year, I will require councils to put on council tax bills standard information about the efficiency gains that they are making, and to give further detail in the accompanying leaflets.</p>

<p><a name="st_o226"><a name="09020464000522"><a name="90204-0013.htm_spnew12"><a name="09020464000939"><b>Robert Neill:</b>
 Can the Minister help me with two points? Will he publish the assessment of the costs that local authorities will incur? In an endeavour to lead by example, will he liaise with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ensure that each income tax and other tax demand contains a list of all the efficiencies that all Departments achieved?</p>

 There are all sorts of ways in which the efficiencies that Departments achieve are available for public scrutiny, as well as debate in the House. It will not surprise the hon. Gentleman to learn that the cost of such changes to council tax bills are relatively marginal and that I took them into account when reaching the decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90204-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09020464000524">Let me say something about council tax and capping, which, I know, will be unpopular and unwelcome in local government. We acted to protect council tax payers from excessive increases this year, and I will not hesitate to take tough action again, including requiring rebilling, if it is necessary to protect council tax payers next year. A combination of inflation-busting increases, which we have provided every year since 1997, to the Government grant to local government, and the threat of council tax capping produced this year the second lowest ever increase in council tax. At this time of economic downturn, councils should do everything in their power to keep council tax bills down and leave more money in people&#146;s pockets.</p>

 Many of us wish we could turn the clock back in so many ways. However, I do not regret my good fortune in taking on the job. When I did, local government was asking for greater certainty, stability, equity and flexibility in funding for local councils. With the three-year settlement, that is exactly what they got this year, and they will have it next year, too.</p>

Some significant costs are coming down, council reserves are up, and local government has a good track record to date on efficiency. The Local Government Association is confident that councils are up for the challenge of providing the services that people need at affordable cost. I, too, am confident that the settlement will enable councils to do that. I commend it to the House.</p>

 I thank the Minister, as I always do, for his care and attention in outlining the Government&#146;s proposals and the invariable courtesy that he shows the House in taking several interventions. That said, in some respects, the Minister&#146;s very reasonableness makes him a dangerous man because that reasonableness masks an indefensible case, which bears little detailed examination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90204-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09020464000530">Let us start, however, where the Minister and I agree. He is right that the three-year settlement is welcome. It is welcome right across the piece&#151;we on the Conservative Benches welcomed it, as did the Local Government Association&#151;and it makes good sense. He is perfectly right that the settlement gives certainty. It is implicit in what he said, although the Local Government Association would appreciate confirmation, that excepting some cataclysmic circumstance, he anticipates that the net third year will remain unchanged. Confirmation of that point would give the LGA the certainty that it wishes for&#151;and I see that the Minister nods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90204-0013.htm_para7"><a name="09020464000531">The downside is that the LGA knows that the settlement is bad news.

To that extent, the Minister was right when he said that the statement back in November does what it says on the tin, but it was not very good news for local councils and local council tax payers.</p>

I made the same comment, which he did not challenge, back in November, so nothing has changed in that respect since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90204-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09020464000534">It is also significant&#151;the Minister will recognise this&#151;that although we are in the middle of the three-year period, a lot has changed since the beginning of that period. Indeed, a lot has changed since November, and it has changed for the worse. The economic climate in which councils have to operate and in which council tax payers have to live has deteriorated. There is no getting away from the fact that that deterioration is the consequence of this Government&#146;s policies. The Minister is certainly consistent in his figures&#151;I recognise that&#151;so let me do him the compliment of being consistent in the judgment that my hon. Friends and I make about his statement. The settlement was a bad settlement for council tax payers in November&#151;I think I used the phrase &#147;a thoroughly bad settlement&#148;&#151;and it remains a thoroughly bad settlement for the rest of the three-year period.</p>

<p><a name="st_o233"><a name="09020464000535"><a name="90204-0013.htm_spnew19"><a name="09020464000946"><b>Mr. McCartney:</b>
 I thank little Tory for giving way to little Labour. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s party mantra is to cut public expenditure substantially. That was confirmed again in a debate on the economy earlier this week. If we are talking about the worst settlement in decades, can he tell us what further increases he is saying that the Conservative party would put back into local government?</p>

<p><a name="st_o234"><a name="09020464000536"><a name="90204-0013.htm_spnew20"><a name="09020464000947"><b>Robert Neill:</b>
 I will look the right hon. Gentleman straight in the eye, as I think I can&#151;at least we have both retained our hair in our political careers&#151;and say that the Minister answered that question when he said that efficiency and lower tax need not mean cuts in services. The Minister was right; indeed, Mayor Johnson in London and Conservative councils such as Hammersmith and Fulham are demonstrating precisely that point. However, it is perfectly reasonable for us to point out, in a spirit of constructive opposition, the concern that, even within the envelope of whatever settlement may be reached, there are areas where the system fails or does not work properly. However, I will turn to that point in a few moments, if hon. Members will bear with me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90204-0013.htm_para9"><a name="09020464000537">The effect of the figures that we have&#151;I hope that Government Members will remember this&#151;confirms what was said in the debate in November. The Minister talks about the record levels of grant given to local authorities. The reality, however, is that council tax, which is the bottom line that most individuals and families are concerned about, will have doubled under this Government&#151;that is, it will have doubled for families who are more hard pressed than they have been in many years. The figures, which have never been disputed, are as follows. From 1997-98, the first full financial year under this Government, through to this year, 2008-09, a band D council tax bill&#151;the standard measure normally used by the Government and all independent observers&#151;will have increased from &#163;688 to &#163;1,374. The Minister said that he wanted to act on evidence and facts, and there we have incontrovertible evidence and facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90204-0013.htm_para10"><a name="09020464000538">Against that background, the Minister will know that the chairman of the Local Government Association wrote this year to say that the association anticipated that council tax increases would be about 3.5 per cent. on top of that rise. The reality is that such increases are well beyond inflation, as the Minister himself concedes. Why is this happening? It is not through a lack of effort  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="4 Feb 2009">

<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>4 Feb 2009 : Column 907</b><br>
by the local authorities. It is because, at the end of the day, the funding settlement has not kept pace with the rising costs that bear down particularly heavily on local government. The Minister is a sensitive man, and he knows that the rise in council tax has repeatedly been flagged up in opinion polls and other evidence as one of the most significant concerns identified by individuals and families. This settlement makes things worse. If the Government want to have a joined-up set of policies, this is not the way to do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="90204-0013.htm_para11"><a name="09020464000539">This remorseless rise in council tax makes nonsense of the supposed fiscal stimulus that we saw introduced before Christmas. The anticipated 3.5 per cent. increase is actually less than the Government&#146;s anticipated figure of 4.5 per cent., which was hidden away in the small print of the pre-Budget report. It is thanks to local government, not the Government, that that figure is coming down. A 3.5 per cent. increase would take band D council tax bills up to about &#163;120 a month by April, and that would eat up much of the so-called spending power that the Government said they were putting back into people&#146;s pockets. They are giving with one hand and taking back with the other.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend also recognise that particular parts of the population have been hit disproportionately hard, not least pensioners in constituencies such as mine? About a third of the increase in their pension has been gobbled up automatically by the rise in council taxes, and they do not have an income that can rise to compensate. There is a double whammy, in that pensioners with meagre savings are now receiving less&#151;if any&#151;interest on those savings to make up the shortfall. Those people are suffering a real-terms decrease in their living standards.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that very cogent point. I have come across such circumstances in my constituency, as have many other Members in theirs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="90204-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09020464000542">The injustice being done to those pensioners is compounded by the complexities and difficulties that many of them face when negotiating their way through the system to claim council tax benefit. That is getting harder and harder, as I know from constituents and members of my own family who have negotiated their way through the system. The consequence is that, under this Government, the number of eligible pensioners taking up council tax benefit has fallen from about three quarters to a half. That is scarcely a record to be proud of, which, with respect to the Minister, makes it all the more ironic that he should say that the Government want local authorities to flag up efficiency savings on council tax bills. A little bit of flagging up of the Government&#146;s inefficiency in handling the council tax benefit regime might redress the balance somewhat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90204-0013.htm_para13"><a name="09020464000543">Those problems are compounded yet further. As the Minister knows, some of his cover was blown in the November debate. If we look at page 203 of the pre-Budget report&#151;a document that no one in the Government has so far sought to disavow&#151;we see that, in addition to above-inflation increases in council tax this year, which come on top of the doubling of council tax during the past 10 years of this Government, the report postulates a further council tax rise of 10.7 per cent. over the following two years&#151;2011 and 2012.

10.7 per cent. increase is postulated in the same pre-Budget report that postulates that retail prices index inflation will slip into a negative figure, giving a deflationary figure of minus 2.25 per cent. over that same period. If we put the two figures together, we can see the reality of the whammy that is going to hit people over that period.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That gives the lie to the weasel words we hear from other parties about their desire to protect council tax payers. There is only one sensible way to do that, and I urgently hope that councils of all political persuasions will, despite the difficult hand that the Government have dealt them, do their level best to keep council tax down and below inflation, where possible, in the knowledge that in due course we will work with them to freeze it.

 Funnily enough, and unhappily, I do not carry such a list with me on my mobile word processor. If the hon.

 I am always happy to be guided by you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90204-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09020464000564">What is apparent from this exchange is Labour Members&#146; sensitivity on the topic that we are discussing. The simple fact is that it is local government that is the most efficient part of the public sector and local government that is delivering the best to people, and it is central Government who are dealing local government an increasingly tough hand. I am afraid that, with all respect to the Minister, the settlement that he has confirmed today makes that position no better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90204-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09020464000565">The cumulative effect of the increases predicted in the PSBR document, which has not been sufficiently recognised by the public, leads me to revise one of my judgments. In November I said that this was a council tax bombshell, but I was wrong: if the Government were returned at the next general election, it would be a council tax bombardment that would continue for a number of years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90204-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09020464000566">Let me take the Minister up on another point. We have referred to the LGA&#146;s concerns about the settlement. The Minister used a formulation that he has used on a number of other occasions when he said that the grant was being increased by 4.2 per cent. He is clever with words, but&#151;I say this with every respect to him&#151;he will know that that is not quite how it works in practice. The 4.2 per cent. is the figure for all grants, but within that is the dedicated schools grant of about &#163;30 billion, which completely skews the figure. It is a huge sum over which local authorities have no discretion. If we take that figure out and look at the formula grant, which does give local authorities some ability to respond to changing circumstances, we are down to 2.8 per cent. That is why many local authorities are saying that the figure does not reflect the costs being imposed on them,  <br>

 The hon. Gentleman has given a figure of 2.8 per cent., but his own party&#146;s commitment&#151;the commitment of its shadow Chancellor and leader&#151;is to a rise of 1 per cent. A gap of &#163;240 million, not at some time far in the future but eight weeks from now, is what councils would be facing if the Conservative party were in power rather than us.</p>

 Not surprisingly, the Minister has not described the Conservative party&#146;s policy accurately. In fact, as he knows, that the Government have been a little economical with the actualit&#233;. The 4.2 per cent. figure is the convenient figure that the Minister will always use, but local authorities of all political persuasions, including the cross-party Local Government Association, maintain that 2.8 per cent. is the real figure. They also point out that including the dedicated schools grant is not an accurate means of assessing discretionary spend. The Minister has done that for obvious reasons, given his position, but it does not give us the whole picture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90204-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09020464000569">Can I also just point out to the Minister the second area of concern here? He makes something of having increased the amount of non ring-fenced grant, but at the end of the day, that is still just a drop in the ocean; some &#163;36 billion of the special grant remains ring-fenced. The bulk of it is still ring-fenced, so the amount of leeway for local authorities has eased a little, but not very much in the overall scheme of things. We are pledged to look at this again. Far too much of the expenditure outside dedicated schools grant is ring-fenced, and that gets in the way of local authorities&#146; ability to take appropriate decisions for their localities.</p>

 I am a little confused, and I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman can shed some light. Would a future Conservative Government give more money to local government in the support grant than the current Government are planning to give?

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s difficulty; he is probably as shell-shocked as I am that Wigan and West Ham United are in their current positions in the premiership. The Conservative position could not be clearer: we have spelled out that, for the first two full years of a Conservative Government, we will protect the interests of council tax payers by making a commitment that if a local authority is able to get its council tax increase under 2.5 per cent. we will match-fund it. We will, of course, work through the mechanisms by which we get to that, but that is the commitment, and it is plain enough. I will shortly come on to what we might need to do in future about a system that is increasingly creaking at the seams.</p>

<meta name="Date" content="4 Feb 2009">

into the system in the past 10 years? Does my hon. Friend have some plans for ensuring that that concern is resolved?</p>

<p><a name="st_o262"><a name="09020464000573"><a name="90204-0014.htm_spnew19"><a name="09020464000975"><b>Robert Neill:</b>
 I suggest to my hon. Friend that there are some solutions here. The Minister&#146;s review is welcome in so far as it goes; nobody would dispute that. However, many of us would say that it has been a long time in coming, because these issues have been raised by Members on both sides of the House&#151;the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) attended an earlier debate, and she has raised it on a number of occasions. We need to bring this matter to a head.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90204-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09020464000574">There are things that could be done. There is a broad point about the way in which the formula grant is calculated and distributed. The criteria, the operation and the various indices that give rise to the distribution of the grant, whatever its overall size, to individual local authorities have become so opaque and unreliable that it no longer has credibility either with the professionals or the general public. The persistent use of significantly out-of-date population data is one very glaring example, although it is not the only one; several authorities have raised concerns about the fact that it is possible to interpret the deprivation indices in a number of different ways that produce different outcomes for local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90204-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09020464000575">We ought to be doing two things. First, perhaps we should move to a system in which the criteria for the distribution of the grant are no longer set entirely within the Department without reference to any independent body. Australia has an independent grants commission, which plays a role. Ultimately, there must be parliamentary accountability, of course, but that is an interesting model. It would be perfectly plausible to charge such a body with a statutory duty to review and update the statistical information. Under the current system, the Government could, if they wanted, choose not to rely on the outdated census statistics, but to take on board a vast array of more up-to-date data, such as national insurance registrations and school registrations. The council in Westminster of my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) has collected and put forward such data to Ministers. The Government could change the information, even in the current system, but we could find an even better means of embedding it. The Government could act on those updated figures now, because that would require only a change to the regulatory environment, which could easily be achieved. That is the solution.</p>

<p><a name="st_o263"><a name="09020464000576"><a name="90204-0014.htm_spnew20"><a name="09020464000976"><b>Julia Goldsworthy:</b>
 The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) raised the problem that this matter poses for inner-city areas. Does the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) agree that it also poses problems for more rural areas, which may contain a large number of seasonal migrant workers and so demands may vary within the year? There is scope for huge demographic change because of other reasons. For example, in my constituency, the growth of a higher education institute has resulted in the 18-to-24 population increasing by 80 per cent. in just three years. The funding formula struggles to deal with all these things.</p>

that the Minister is taking this point on board, because many of us felt that when the Treasury was leading in this area it had a continuing reluctance to come to grips with the inadequacies of the situation. She is right to say that the problem applies across all types of authority, regardless of political or geographic circumstances. I hope that the Minister will come back urgently with the review. We will be constructive about that, but it may be necessary to go further&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o265"><a name="09020464000578"><a name="90204-0014.htm_spnew22"><a name="09020464000978"><b>Mr. Turner:</b>

 I have been pretty generous so far, so the hon. Gentleman will understand that I now want to make some progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90204-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09020464000580">All of what I have said comes back to a suggestion that the grant system is creaking to the stage where it is no longer credible. The other evidence of that can be seen in the floor system. The Minister makes the point about the protection of floors, but, in reality, when the floor system reaches a stage when about one third of all the larger authorities are on the floor, when about 24 out of the 33 London boroughs are on the floor, and when a range of types of authorities and about 40 per cent. of district councils are on a worse floor&#151;0.5 per cent., as opposed to 1.75. per cent.&#151;something perverse is happening. It leads me to conclude that the system has gone beyond its useful life and that we need a much more significant and thoroughgoing reform as to how distribution takes place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90204-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09020464000581">I noted, too, what the Minister said about looking at the operation of the area cost adjustments. I would welcome that, and again, I hope that he will use his good offices to impel some urgency into the matter, because it has been raised over a long time. It is not just about the operation of the grants for which his Department is responsible; one of the concerns that he will know has been raised both by the Local Government Association and by London councils is the lack of consistency between various Departments in the application of the ACAs. I hope that he will take that on board as a central point of the review, because I am sure that with political good will consistency could be achieved swiftly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90204-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09020464000582">My final point about the inadequacies of the grant formula relates to the peculiar results for local authorities of similar size and in similar, neighbouring areas. Let us consider a discrepancy in the formula grant in the west midlands. Solihull has a population of 205,000 and receives &#163;53 million. Walsall has a population of 253,000. I accept that it has some other social problems, so one might expect a difference, but it receives &#163;133 million, so the leap is so great as to be beyond credibility. The same applies closer to home for me, in the London boroughs. Bromley has a population of 300,000 and it receives &#163;64 million. The next-door borough of Croydon has a population of 340,000, so it should get a bit more&#151;but it receives &#163;116 million, so there is a huge difference. Those apparently perverse outcomes cause people to question the way in which this system works in practice. With respect, I must say that those issues have not been addressed by the statement that has been made, because they relate to systemic problems that the Government could have dealt with, but have not dealt with over a period of time. That leads to suggestions  <br>

that there is a degree of unjustified subjectivity in the operation of the system, and that needs to be dealt with if people are to have confidence for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90204-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09020464000583">The net result of all that is that burdens on the council tax payers remain. The Minister talks about the desire to reduce them, but we did not go too much into the costs of operating what remains an over-intrusive inspection and targets regime. We are told that we should be grateful that the new regime has reduced the number of national indicator sets to 198 or 195, but that is still a huge amount and far greater than is necessary. That amount still involves real costs for local authorities. The need to tick the boxes still forces distortions on local authorities. If the Minister is serious about giving freedom to local authorities, as I hope he is, he could cut back further on that distorting inspection and targets regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90204-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09020464000584">If we are to achieve what is required for local authorities and council tax payers, we will need to give them more leeway than the Government have given them. I hope that Ministers consider that point for the remaining year, although I honestly do not think that they will be in a position to do so for the next three-year spending round. The bottom line is that people are now really hard pressed. Local authorities are doing their best, but sadly their job is being made harder by what is happening. I hope that, as a matter of urgency, local authorities will do all that they can to minimise the rise in council tax, despite the rotten hand that they have been dealt. We will work with them constructively. I am sorry that, for all the fine words from the Minister, the settlement will not give local authorities the constructive tools that they need to deliver as they wish for their communities.</p>

 I welcome the settlement&#151;in the circumstances, it is an extremely good settlement for local government. It is as well to put on record the fact that this three-year settlement and the stability it provides are very important to local government. We will look back on it as a major reform by the Government that will continue to work in the future. Personally, I think that it should be a rolling settlement, so that in a three-year block we would have a two-year settlement with indicative figures for the third year, and in the third year the cycle started again. That is a refinement that we can work on in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90204-0014.htm_para11"><a name="09020464000586">It is worth recalling that in the years since 1997 every local authority has had a cash increase in the amount they receive from Government. When you remember what was happening in the late 1980s and early 1990s, you see that there is a phenomenal difference. I cannot understand how the Local Government Association can say that this is the worst settlement in decades. It clearly does not remember what happened in the 1980s and 1990s, when my local authority in Wigan experienced cuts not only in real terms&#151;below inflation levels&#151;but in cash terms. The money we received from the Government was cut by &#163;6 million, &#163;7 million or even &#163;10 million year after year under the Conservatives. How the LGA&#151;now Conservative led&#151;can claim that that was better than what we are getting now is beyond me.</p>

 There will always be such changes, and it is right to strike a balance between what local government has to pay&#151;through the local council tax payer who will receive the services&#151;and what the Government give in grant.

Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) was challenged not once but twice about what the Conservative party, were it in power, would do about grants to local government, but he could not make any commitment to more cash for local government from a Conservative Government.

We are suffering&#151;we are the ones who are paying for the fact that you are getting more money than you would otherwise be entitled to. That is important. I agree with the idea in principle. It is the right thing to do, because it gives local authorities the opportunity to make measured and manageable changes rather than the kind of changes that we would otherwise have&#151;the kind of changes that we were forced into in the &#146;80s and &#146;90s.

We are talking about local government and the services that it can provide for people. Those decisions are fundamentally political. The weighting given to each statistic will be a political decision.

head in a particular local authority will be a political decision. No matter whether the statistics are right or wrong, it is that political decision that will influence how much a local authority gets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09020464000602">The Government have struck a balance between achieving equity for places such as Wigan that are below target and managing the necessary reductions for those authorities that get more than the formula says. I welcome the reduction in the floor from 2.7 per cent. in 2007-08 to 1.75 per cent. now. Unless the floor is reduced to a fairly low level, authorities that are entitled to more money will never get it. The reduction needs to continue, and I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will ensure that it does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09020464000603">I shall give a couple of examples of what that means. If Wigan were to get its full entitlement, we would get an additional &#163;6.5 million in 2009-10, and an additional &#163;5.4 million in 2010-11. Obviously, that is &#163;1.2 million better than what we are getting now, but we are still four or five years away from achieving equity. Adding that up, we are talking about Wigan receiving a total of &#163;20 million or &#163;30 million in additional money over a number of years. I believe that this is very much a work in progress, and I urge my right hon. Friend the Minister to make sure that it continues in future settlements so that all local authorities get the entitlement that they deserve from the formula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09020464000604">I turn now to the important issue of revaluation. The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) said that the formula was creaking at the hinges, but I think that the problem is that the council tax itself is creaking at the hinges. I believe that the Conservatives designed it to be unfair, and one of John Major&#146;s few achievements from their point of view was to create the present unfair system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para7"><a name="09020464000605">The burden of council tax falls most on the poorest, and least on the richest. We need to change that unfairness, and I think that we missed a trick with the Lyons report. We should have gone for that, or some form of it, as I believe that a property-based council tax is the right way to go. Even so, we need something new and much more transparent that can be integrated with council tax benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09020464000606">The Nationwide building society and others can tell us how house prices have gone up or down, year by year and month by month. I cannot see why we cannot build a system in which property bands move on a three-year basis, for example, so that values are constantly changing. In contrast, the present council tax was valued in 1989 or 1990.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09020464000607">I want to touch on housing, which is an integral part of local government finance and services. The housing revenue account is under review, and that is long overdue. The Audit Commission said a number of years ago that it was unsustainable, and that is clearly true. Given that rent increases are running at 6.75 per cent. at a time when inflation is below 2 per cent., and that mortgages are coming down on a monthly basis, the disparity between council house tenants and the rest of the population is clear to see. I hope that the Minister and his Department will take that on board, so that the convergence with registered social landlord housing rents is delayed and the impact on council house tenants is reduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09020464000608">There are issues that we can deal with. If we put more money into housing, it will help the national economy, and help local economies even more. Housing repairs and maintenance, and house building, are labour-intensive, and we source most of the materials from the local economy. They have a massive impact on local authorities and economies. We should put money into that. If we put money into disabled grants, there would be a double whammy: that would not only help the local economy, but would allow people to stay in their own homes. If we allow them to stay in their homes&#151;that, as we know, is what the vast majority want to do&#151;it will reduce pressures on social services and on the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para11"><a name="09020464000609">The Supporting People programme that the Government introduced, and the money that they put into it, is hugely important to achieving those aims. Again, if we look at the amount of money that goes into that, and at the formula, we see that there are huge discrepancies between the money that local authorities should get and the money that they actually get. It suffers from the same problem as the local authority grant. The Department for Communities and Local Government needs to consider whether we can ensure that local authorities can meet people&#146;s needs, and can put the money to good use in the local economy. To take the example of Wigan, in 2008-09, we got &#163;7.2 million less than we should have done. In 2010-11 we will have &#163;5.4 million less than we should; that reduction is &#163;1.8 million less than the reduction in 2008-09, but it is still a significant figure. We could do with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09020464000610">When we talk about housing and the Supporting People grant, we also need to talk about the primary care trust. I know that that does not come under the heading of local authority funding, but it is an important issue. Often, local authorities and primary care trusts pool resources, grants and funding. The line between what the NHS provides and what the local authority provides is becoming increasingly blurred. Fights about who should fund what just allow vulnerable people to fall between the two. It is right that PCTs and local authorities should get together on that issue, as they increasingly do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09020464000611">I have explained why the Supporting People programme and NHS funding is important. The difficulty arises when a local authority such as mine is underfunded under the local authority grant, under the Supporting People grant, and in its primary care trust funding. That compounds the problems and makes servicing those needs extremely difficult. To give the example of Wigan once again, in 2009-10, our PCT funding will be 4.7 per cent., or &#163;25.5 million, below target. In 2010-11, we will have &#163;25.4 million, or 4.5 per cent., less than we should. That is a &#163;56,000 a year difference, under the final figures. I worked out that, on that basis, we will achieve our target on 14 April 6518 AD. I am not likely to be around then. It is important that we make progress on that issue because of the impact that it has on local government and the services that we provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09020464000612">The shortfall in those three programmes is &#163;36.2 million in one year. If we carry that forward year on year, we can imagine the difficulty that my local authority and primary care trust will have in providing people with necessary services. Those are not services that I have plucked out of the air; I am referring to services that demonstrably and measurably cannot be provided, or fully provided, because of underfunding. I know that  <br>

the Minister is aware of the issue because Rotherham, his local authority, is in a similar position; I think that the figure is &#163;35.8 million for Rotherham, whereas it is &#163;36.2 for Wigan, over the three years. He is well aware of the problems, and I know that he is working hard within both local and central Government to address those issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09020464000613">The public services that we need must be given those resources. On the Government formulas, the independent advice given by the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation for PCTs, and other advice given through local government, is that the money that we are talking about is the kind of money that is necessary to provide services that people in Wigan, Rotherham and other areas need. It is not a matter of shifting money from the south to the north. There are areas in London that require additional funding. It is not about towns <i> v. </i>country. There are country areas that require additional funding. It is about fairness, justice, equity, equality, and giving support to those who need it. That is why we on the Labour Benches came into politics, and why it is so important that my right hon.

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner). I have a great deal of sympathy with many of the points that he makes, because my local authority is also one that is near the ceiling and a long way away from its target funding, and it would benefit from the resources that it should receive, according to the funding formula. I also agree with the hon. Gentleman that it seems sensible to propose a rolling three-year budget that would provide stability, as well as extra flexibility to respond to the difficult economic situation.</p>

Ultimately, it is a very tight settlement and the Minister has been up-front about that. The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) pointed out exactly how tight the settlement is, once the schools grant is taken out. It will be extremely difficult for many councils.</p>

government officers, civil servants and Members of Parliament all bury their heads in it to try to understand it, but for council tax payers it is difficult to understand what services they receive in return not just for their council tax, but for the taxes that they pay. We all need to do more to illuminate the process and make it simpler to understand. It is important that the public should be able to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09020464000618">We have seen a fundamental change in the past year, and since the three-year settlement was announced. Despite the Government&#146;s claims to have boosted funding through measures such as LABGI, it is pretty much unchanged since the earlier announcement, and there has been no response to the economic crisis. The economic turmoil is creating extreme funding pressures and uncertainties for many councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09020464000619">The credit crunch has had a significant impact on councils&#146; income, not just from their fees and services, which according to the Local Government Association totalled &#163;11.5 billion last year, compared with the &#163;23 billion that they received in council tax revenue. A significant amount of councils&#146; revenues is received from charges, and the LGA estimates that that could fall by up to &#163;2.5 billion this year&#151;a substantial hit on funding, which may not derive from central Government grants, but will certainly have an impact on their cash flow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09020464000620">Councils have also seen lower income from their investments because of lower interest rates. Although the Minister said that as a result of those lower interest rates borrowing is cheaper, I wonder what assessment he has made of whether that borrowing is easier to come by, even if it is cheaper. Councils&#146; estimates of income from capital receipts have plummeted, which has not just impacted on their income, but is impacting on their investment programme. In spite of those pressures, there has been a significant increase in demand for services.</p>

<p><a name="st_o280"><a name="09020464000621"><a name="90204-0015.htm_spnew12"><a name="09020464000993"><b>Sir Alan Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</b>
 Before my hon. Friend leaves that point, may I draw attention to the impact of the unavailability of capital receipts from land sales on major proposals to repair and replace schools? That means that local authorities such as Northumberland continue to have a very high maintenance budget for schools such as the Duchess&#146;s school in Alnwick, because the capital to rebuild it is not available from land sales.</p>

<p><a name="st_o281"><a name="09020464000622"><a name="90204-0015.htm_spnew13"><a name="09020464000994"><b>Julia Goldsworthy:</b>
 My right hon. Friend makes an extremely important point. The lack of capital receipts impacts not only on capital spending but significantly on councils&#146; revenue commitments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90204-0015.htm_para22"><a name="09020464000623">Other things, outside the credit crunch, are involved. The whole baby P episode, for example, has resulted in additional demands and pressures on children&#146;s services. Furthermore, we still have to deal with the demographics of an ageing population, and that places additional pressure on adult services. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) cited other issues, such as the number of young people registering to transfer to primary schools. That is having a massive impact. During this debate, he told me that in the past year he has seen a 12 per cent. increase in primary school applications; that has a massive impact on a council&#146;s resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para0"><a name="09020464000624">As other hon. Members have pointed out, in addition to all that, councils are being asked to take on increased responsibilities. One of the most controversial has been the cost of concessionary bus travel, and there is a question about whether the grants given by central Government cover the costs. Also coming down the line is the roll-out of free swimming. In my local authority area, in Cornwall, we are worried about that because our population doubles in summer; a lot of holidaymakers will benefit from access to free swimming, but the council tax payers will have to meet the costs. There is increasing concern that such additional financial burdens are not being adequately funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09020464000625">Will the Minister provide us with information about how those pressures are impacting on councils and how councils are responding to them? I have seen anecdotal evidence of councils reporting recruitment freezes. Of course there will be further drives for efficiency, but I have heard that councils are using more temporary staff as a way of trying to keep cost pressures down. I would also appreciate the Minister&#146;s comments on whether he is aware of any potential plans for significant service cuts. Councils want stability, but they also want reassurance that the Government are sensitive to such rising pressures. Today&#146;s statement is a denial of some of the problems that many councils face.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making an excellent case about the pressures under which local authorities find themselves. She has talked at length about the economic problems that we face at the moment. What does she feel about the fact that local authorities have to take up the slack when other Government agencies have withdrawn from areas? I am thinking of jobcentre closures and so on. Local authorities now find themselves having to do the work of other Government agencies&#151;</p>

 Post offices are also involved, as my hon. Friend rightly says. Local authorities have carry other things because the other providers that were originally in the area have gone.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point, to which I shall come later. Although last year&#146;s pre-Budget report announced additional support for the Department for Work and Pensions for Jobcentre Plus, a lot of such pressures are now falling on local councils. Although increased support has been announced, its scale does not match the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09020464000630">I now turn briefly to councils&#146; exposure to the collapse of Icelandic banks. That issue has not affected all local authorities, but it has had a significant impact on a number of councils. Before Christmas, the Minister stated that councils would not need to make provision for any possible loss on those investments in 2009-10; I understand that there will soon be draft regulations for us to consider. However, it now seems clear that many councils do not expect to recover any of the losses for the foreseeable future, and that the process of recovering them will be protracted. Does the Minister accept that we need legislation to deal with the issue beyond next year? Councils would appreciate certainty about their ability to deal with the problems in the long term. Is the Minister seeking to give affected councils the powers to  <br>

capitalise their losses so that they can spread them over a number of years? That would be sensible, as it does not seem as if there will be any short-term resolution to the problem. Today&#146;s debate is an opportunity to try to address the issue, but it has been overlooked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09020464000631">Councils are not only impacted by the credit crunch themselves; they are already doing a huge amount to respond to it locally and to provide support for people who are struggling. I wonder whether the Government have missed an opportunity to make an announcement offering further support to councils in fulfilling this role. Business rate relief has already been mentioned. There has been talk about whether it would be appropriate to make that relief automatic, because a large number of small business that are entitled to it do not receive it. Surely every effort needs to be made to ensure that those businesses receive what they are entitled to. Why is the Department not following the lead of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, which has offered a great deal of flexibility to businesses in paying their business rates? If it were able to offer the same support to councils in terms of flexibility of payment, that could be handed on to businesses and more could be done to ease the burden of many small businesses locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09020464000632">On benefit advice and support, extra resources have been made available to the Department for Work and Pensions to the value of &#163;1.3 billion. There will be similar pressures on councils to deliver council tax benefit and housing benefit, yet they are caught up in the squeeze. I am not entirely certain that the levels of resource that the Minister has mentioned will be sufficient to meet that increase in demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09020464000633">Local authorities are in a good position in terms of being able to identify and deliver capital projects on the ground quickly, but I am concerned that projects are being held up. The private finance initiative is becoming more expensive and appears to be slowing down in some places, and capital receipts are not materialising to fund many of the projects that councils have been planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09020464000634">What more can the Minister&#146;s Department do to ensure that these projects can be delivered more quickly on the ground? Has he considered allowing councils to bring forward future capital allocations to get projects moving? Will he support the Local Government Association&#146;s recommendation to consider plans whereby councils would pool billions of pounds of existing investment to fund infrastructure projects and support the economy locally? What more can he do to help councils link in to other funds? In Northumberland, particularly in Morpeth, there are huge problems with the capital highway maintenance emergency fund following the huge problems caused by last year&#146;s flooding. That could not have been foreseen, but the council is concerned about its ability to provide match funding and the impact that doing so will have on other budgets. Is there anything more that the DCLG can do to link in with other Departments to ensure that these important projects happen?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing the Minister&#146;s attention to this, because he may be able to have a word with the Department for Transport. Only a third of the costs of emergency repairs to the highway system that was so devastated by the floods will be met by the central grant, because the local authority is expected to fund such a large amount from its existing transport grant, which is itself under pressure  <br>

 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. These are unforeseen events that the council has to respond to in the context of a very tight funding settlement. Any kind of flexibility from the Department, or anything that it can do to link up with the Department for Transport, would make a dramatic difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09020464000637">Those are all relatively minor proposals that the Government could bolt on to the existing funding arrangements. That is why I am disappointed that no such imagination has been used in this local government finance report. It is a shame that the Minister is not feeling bolder, because we have missed an opportunity to make much more fundamental changes that would give councils a much bigger role in responding to the economic crisis. The hon. Member for Wigan alluded to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para8"><a name="09020464000638">One of the key challenges is the lack of social housing. At present, councils are completely hamstrung in their ability to respond to that, and the situation does not change as a result of this funding announcement. Surely it would have made sense to link the publication of the report to an announcement on much-needed reforms to housing revenue accounts. This is an arcane system that prevents councils from using future revenue streams from rent to supplement and fund improvements to their council housing stock. Combined with freeing up councils to borrow prudentially, it could play a massive role in tackling the social housing crisis that we face. It would also be a much fairer way of using tenants&#146; rent, in stark contrast to the current system whereby some of the country&#146;s lowest earners are in effect paying a tenant tax that often ends up, almost in its entirety, in Treasury coffers. That is simply unfair. I know that the matter is under review at the moment, but given the economic situation, would it not have made sense to bring that review forward rather than delay it further, which I hear is likely? There was an opportunity for more straightforward and fundamental change, which appears to have been passed up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para9"><a name="09020464000639">One of the other issues arising from the report is capping. Early indications are that council tax increases for most councils will fall by about 3.5 per cent., but does the Minister have anything to say about the authorities that were capped last time? Does he have any comment on how they fared in the past year, and whether they look likely to be able to deliver within the range that he specified for this year? We are debating the funding formula for new authorities, which I understand has been agreed with those authorities, but I wonder about the impact of many of the efficiency savings that will arise from local government reorganisation in the longer term. By contrast, there will be costs involved in making some of these immediate changes, and I wonder whether that has been reflected in the allocations we have seen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para10"><a name="09020464000640">The Minister announced today that he would require local authorities to provide, in council tax bill statements, details of efficiency savings that they have delivered. Broadly, I welcome that. I wonder whether the Government will make equivalent information available, because a lot of local authorities are much better at delivering efficiencies than Departments are. I look forward to Departments providing readily accessible information in an equivalent way. Perhaps I can look forward to seeing on my P60 the efficiency savings that the Government have promised and delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para11"><a name="09020464000641">On a related point, an awful lot of public money is not spent by the local authority. Public money is spent locally that never ends up on any council tax bill, and is not part of any efficiency saving process. In the Sustainable Communities Act 2007, the Government made a commitment to produce local spending reports that would provide details of all public money being spent at local level, not just by organisations such as the NHS or the education authorities, but by the many quangos for which there is no direct accountability for how money is spent. I wonder whether the Minister has any plans to tie in his statements on delivering efficiencies with more transparency concerning the amount of money spent locally about which the public often know nothing. They do not know where it is being spent, let alone how effectively or efficiently it is being spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09020464000642">Last year, the Minister said that the settlement &#147;does what it says on the tin&#148;, and that this year would be a repeat performance. But the fundamental question remains: whether it is right to continue justifying the unchanging nature of the settlement in the light of such uncertain and unstable economic times. A judgment has been made that the assumptions behind the settlement are correct&#151;and that is where we disagree. My party&#146;s view is that such assumptions are wrong. Fundamental problems with the current funding arrangements have to be addressed, and as we face difficult economic times, the need to address those problems becomes more, not less, urgent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09020464000643">Although we welcome the review of the area cost adjustment, there are wider systemic problems that must be addressed. There is an urgent need to review the formula, and the floors and ceiling system must be looked at. The councils at the floor feel that they are falling further behind, while those at the ceiling that are trying desperately to catch up look as if they will never have any prospect of getting the funds that the Government&#146;s own formula says that they need. There is a need to continue to cut ring-fencing to free councils to raise and spend more of their resources locally. There is a need to recognise how completely inadequate the current system of local taxation is in providing a link for local taxpayers between the services that they receive and the tax that they pay. It must be recognised that the council tax continues to be an unfair burden for those on lowest incomes because it increases above inflation each year, and is paid out of people&#146;s disposable income. They really feel any increases that are made each year. The Government have completely failed to recognise those problems, let alone address them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para14"><a name="09020464000644">I got quite excited in the debate this afternoon because I thought that the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was going to announce some amazing brand-new long-term plan for what a future Conservative Government planned to do. Sadly, I was disappointed. The worst-funded authorities will be the least able to deliver what the Conservatives claim will be a council tax freeze. That means that those in the greatest need will be the least able to benefit. Their suggestion is not a long-term plan; it is a two-year proposal. That will hardly address the systemic problems that the hon. Gentleman himself identified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para15"><a name="09020464000645">We need not a one-off gimmick but fundamental reform, not only of the balance of what is raised and spent locally but of how it is raised.

 I start by reminding the House that I remain a county councillor on Oxfordshire county council. I do not wish to use this opportunity to engage in special pleading for the council, but that experience is relevant to how the settlement can be implemented and how past settlements have been implemented on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para17"><a name="09020482000017">For three of the four years for which I have served on the county council, I held a portfolio that was relevant to the debate. Its scope was to drive through efficiencies, make the council more effective and drive through business processes that would enable it to deliver on its financial commitments. I think that we did very well on that, removing several hundred posts from the establishment and introducing business processes in planning and budget management that I think would be the envy of many a multinational. We slashed office costs by creating a shared service centre, which works well and promised &#163;27 million of gross savings in the first seven years. We more than met our efficiency savings targets. However, any sense of pride in those achievements was tempered by the frustration of our expectations that we could, after coming to power with a radical agenda, make radical changes for the benefit of local people. Too often, those aims were frustrated by the way in which the Government perceived us as little more than their local executive arm and placed significant budgetary constraints on us, which reduced our options. The settlement perpetuates that, despite the Minister&#146;s words.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para18"><a name="09020482000018">From the outside, councils&#146; budgets may appear large. My county council has an annual turnover just short of &#163;1 billion. However, the amount of money to play with in terms of local choice is pathetically small&#151;only a few million pounds. At this time of year, when budget debates take place in council chambers, there is a common cry of, &#147;Why is so much time spent on so little money?&#148; It is impossible to adopt a distinctive political slant. The debate always happens because there is so little scope to alter funding objectives in the rest of the budget. There are two reasons for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para19"><a name="09020482000019">First, some spending could not be cut without catastrophic effects on services to vulnerable people. Secondly, a huge element of the budget is ring-fenced to ensure that it can be spent only to deliver the Government agenda. To add insult to injury, that agenda was often euphemistically expressed as &#147;shared priorities.&#148; I am not sure with whom we were supposed to share the priorities. For example, on highways, five were imposed and our &#147;sharing&#148; was restricted to one, which we had the option to create ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="90204-0016.htm_para20"><a name="09020482000020">Despite the Minister&#146;s comments, freeing up the ring-fenced council grants has not gone nearly far enough to bring back control to local councillors and provide that distinctive local feeling. The hard work of making savings and efficiencies was largely simply to stand still, as the cash made from efficiencies was soaked up by pressures from service needs, demography, which has been mentioned, or new impositions from central Government. Again, some of my hon. Friends referred to the latter pressure.</p>

judgment had to be made about whether the costs were worth while, especially given the bias in the programme against affluent areas such as my county.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09020482000022">In the current climate, there is a huge take-up of services, not all due to the recession. After the baby P case, there has been a 32 per cent. increase in the number of referrals. It defies belief that, with such a mountain of evidence, the Minister can still claim that there are no exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09020482000023">It is perhaps worth considering where the headroom&#151;the amount that we can decide how to spend to give some local character to a budget&#151;comes from. It does not come from what the Government describe as a generous settlement. The three-year settlement in my council was increased by 2 per cent., 1.75 per cent. and 1.5 per cent. The boasts about investment in local government translate as pure spin and hide the wide regional variations that occur in the settlement as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09020482000024">The boasts also hides the fact, which I raised in an intervention on the Minister, that the real inflation rate that councils face has been well over 5 per cent. It is made up of various elements, but energy costs incurred when energy bills were much higher are only beginning to come through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09020482000025">For the reasons that I have given, the headroom does not come mainly from savings, because they are used simply to stand still, nor does it come from excessive council tax rates. Being a good, Conservative county council, we have continued to put downward pressure on the rise in council tax in the three years that there has been a Conservative administration there. Often, however, a major element of financial stability has had to come from the strategic measures that the council has had to take&#151; for example in maximising its return on investments. It is no wonder that so many councils turned to Icelandic banks, relying on their interest rates in order to fund services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09020482000026">The amounts involved are not insignificant. In the past, those strategic measures could have accounted for as much as 1.5 per cent. of a council&#146;s total budget requirements. That is a phenomenal amount of money. In the current downturn, a council would be lucky if those strategic measures accounted for 0.5 per cent. of its budget requirements. That has a major impact, in terms of the need both to rethink the strategies for borrowing and to make reductions in the headroom&#151;and, therefore, the need to look to cut services or achieve further efficiencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09020482000027">I do not particularly want to conclude with an image of total frustration, but I am afraid that it is one that many councillors would identify with, owing to the way in which the Government have handled local government and the current settlement. They have eroded the chance to put a local face to local services, undermined local democracy and shown that they simply do not trust local councillors to make good local decisions. The Government have undermined good business practices by making it more difficult for councils to plan for the long term, because all the effort is put into meeting short-term Government targets, and they have imposed a ridiculous and meaningless burden of inspections, the likes of which they would not dare to subject themselves to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09020482000028">In one year, we had the unfortunate experience of having a full comprehensive performance assessment of  <br>

the council, as well as having to put all the information together for the Government&#146;s ill-conceived plans to try to encourage us to bring forward unitary proposals. Both sapped senior resources in the council to a quite unimaginable degree. The effect of that on how we took forward our plans was quite significant. Moreover, the Government have presided over a financing system that is so opaque as to be practically incoherent. Many councillors believe, I think quite justifiably, that its whole purpose is to maximise the opportunities for central Government to get their own way. It is time for the Minister to put forward some proposals that allow the people to whom councils are really accountable finally to make the judgments.</p>

 It is a pleasure to take part in this debate. There is a form of friendship among those who have spoken at the Dispatch Box about local government&#151;indeed, I hope that I can call the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill), who represents our Front Bench, two of my friends in the House.</p>

I was a bit surprised when she said that she was excited&#151;I wondered what I had missed in the debate so far&#151;but she managed to convey why she was excited. From that I took it that she was even excited by the prospect of our becoming the Government. I share that sense of excitement.</p>

Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner) reminded me of when I was the sponsor Minister for the city challenge project in Wigan. I would like to put on record how much I enjoyed that experience and how much I enjoyed working with the excellent Peter Smith in Wigan. That project was an attempt by the Government to be involved in supporting a local authority when times were difficult. In answer to the occasional jibe that is thrown in our direction about apparently being a do nothing Government at the time of the last recession, I would say that, as the hon. Gentleman will know, there was not much vested political interest in the Conservative party being heavily involved in Wigan through the city challenge project. We were doing it because it was the right thing to do at a difficult time, when we were affected by, if I may say so, a global change in manufacturing, for which we were blamed by hon. Members on the Labour Benches. It is an ill wind that comes round to see another Government being affected by what is apparently a global change and catching the drift of public discontent&#151;in this case, quite rightly.</p>

When I spoke from the Dispatch Box a couple of years ago, at the time of the first three-year settlement, I said that I welcomed the certainty that three-year settlements established. Since then, however, we have seen one of the problems with such arrangements. In a land where boom and bust no longer exist, a three-year settlement has some merit, because there is stability and we can plan. In the real world, where it turns out&#151;to the surprise of no one except the Prime Minister&#151;that boom and bust have not been abolished, the deficiencies  <br>

of a three-year settlement become exposed. The settlement is subject to pressures that no one could have imagined at a time when certainty was guaranteed. As we all know, those pressures come into the equation and cause difficulties, a number of which have been mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09020482000033">Investment income for local authorities, and income from property, searches and business rates constitute a relatively small sum compared with the overall settlement, but, because of the tightness of gearing in local authority finance, they actually constitute quite a significant amount. The pressures from these changes and the impact of the credit crunch on local authorities, which colleagues on both sides of the House have identified, are very real. The Local Government Association has published a series of figures, but I will not read them out because the Minister knows them well. Those new pressures have come into the equation, but some of our original concerns with the settlement, which my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst highlighted earlier and my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (John Howell) has just explained, are still in the system to cause concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09020482000034">For example, adult social services remain a worry for everyone in local government because we know that the inflation figures that the Government have calculated do not meet the needs of those who come into the system needing care. That is a source of concern whenever councillors get together. Will the Minister pay particular attention to the transfer of youngsters who have been in care and who, on becoming adults, have found themselves in a situation where provision has tended not to be made, over the years?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09020482000035">I recently visited Hinwick Hall, a special school run by Livability, the organisation that was put together by the merger of the Shaftesbury Society and John Grooms. It cares for a number of youngsters in a residential setting, but the teachers and parents involved are constantly concerned about what will happen to the youngsters when they finish full-time education and leave that environment to go back to their original local authority, because the necessary provision is so often not there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09020482000036">A growing number of youngsters are coming into that situation, and there will be a need for more provision, not less. I am not sure that the amounts already accounted for in the grant formula for adult social services will meet that need in the future. That will remain a concern for everyone. In relation to cash for highways, the inflation figures often outstrip the figures calculated by the Government. Public care costs, which a number of lawyers in my own area have mentioned to me, are also increasing, as my hon. Friend the Member for Henley has said.</p>

That applies to me as well. Some colleagues might remember that, before I went to Bedfordshire, I had a full head of hair, played football and all that sort of thing.

district council since this Government took office&#151;and the pressures now being created by the unitary process, which the Minister will understand very well. I have expressed concern in the past that the introduction of the unitary process involved a quick, late decision by the Government, which put extra pressures on the councils involved. Will the Minister reassure me that he will take a very close interest in the work of the excellent implementation teams in Bedfordshire and Bedford councils to ensure that, despite the difficult time scale, the process works?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para17"><a name="09020482000039">There was some disquiet locally when both councils announced quite small local tax increases this year. It had been hoped initially that quite significant reductions would emerge through the unitary process&#151;10 per cent. or 12 per cent. was quoted by the mayor of Bedford, but he recently had to announce that he was looking for a rise of slightly less than 1 per cent. That is very different from what was said previously, but I am sure that this is only the first stage and that savings will come from the unitary process as promised, particularly if both councils elect a Conservative administration at the first available opportunity. It is early days; I am sure that more will happen in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para18"><a name="09020482000040">I would like to take the opportunity to put on record my thanks to councillors who have served on the councils in my constituency that are going to form the unitary council&#151;on Bedford borough council, Mid-Bedfordshire district council and, last but not least, Bedfordshire county council, which will cease to exist in April after more than 100 years of service. Some sterling work has been done there by councillors and the council has largely been Conservative run through most of its history. In recent years, it moved from being a no-star council to a three-star council over a very short period: it became one of the fastest and best-improving councils in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09020482000041">I was reminded of that fact today when I attended the funeral of Councillor Phyllis Gershon who recently died in harness. She was 89 years old. I suspect that most Members think very fondly of some councillors for their extraordinary service. Phyllis encapsulated what local authority service really means: genuine commitment to an area; no side; no privilege; doing her work honestly and well. Many councillors have done that over the years and they are responsible, I think, for some of the Government&#146;s success in local government. They have helped the Government to meet targets that were difficult to achieve through Government Departments, and they have done so through the hard work and effort of local councillors. I hope that we would all give credit to them for that.</p>

 In the remaining moments available, I want to bring two or three particular issues to the Minister&#146;s attention. As far as the credit crunch in Bedford is concerned, figures from Bedford council show that it expects to lose about a third of its investment income this year. It used to bring in about &#163;2.6 million, but it will lose about &#163;900,000 this year&#151;quite an amount&#151;from the change in interest rates. If we add in the property, the searches and perhaps section 106, I am slightly surprised that with all that going on, the Minister thought that his original settlement could stay stable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09020482000044">Secondly, concessionary fares were highlighted by several Members. Bedford council reckons that it will  <br>

take a hit of about &#163;250,000 on those fares. The Minister is adamant that the overall figure appears to the Government to meet the needs imposed as more people take up the concessionary fare scheme, but many councils have denied that, so I genuinely ask the Minister to reconsider it at some stage. The tight gearing means that these amounts really count for local authorities. If, when the scheme is fully implemented and the figures come in, it turns out that local authorities have lost out significantly, will the Minister give a commitment to looking at it again and make some recompense?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09020482000045">Thirdly, Building Schools for the Future is important for Bedford council. I am pleased about the support it is getting from the Government, but the local education partnership and the financing of the programme have come in for criticism from all sides. I would be keen to know what the Minister includes in the figures for the future financing of the partnership under the new unitary council and how he believes it will be paid by council tax payers in the future. People fear that it could be a considerable amount. I know that the Minister has looked at it very carefully and I accept that this is good news for Bedford council and its schools in the future, but how it will be paid for is a matter of concern. If the Minister cannot address that issue today, perhaps he will do so on another occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09020482000046">Finally, on help for business, I recently had a meeting with the Sandy chamber of trade, which said that it had hardly noticed any difference as a result of the &#163;12.5 billion spent on VAT changes and that if that money had been put into reducing business rates for small businesses, it would have meant a great deal more. Perhaps the Minister will review this issue in due course and see whether better ways of supporting small businesses can be found than these VAT changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para23"><a name="09020482000047">We will always have debates such as this. The expectations of local authorities are very high, and the expectation of Government is very high. There will never be enough money to satisfy all the needs, no matter who is in office locally or nationally. The idea of the three-year settlement is good, but it has the flaws identified by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. I am sure that my hon. Friend, like me, looks forward to the occasion when he will sit on the other side of the fence and will have to put some of these difficult proposals into operation.</p>

 My hon. Friend clearly has the highest regard for the Minister, which I share.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para25"><a name="09020482000052">The debate gives us an opportunity to honour some of the leading lights in local government. I do not think that council leaders are ever given enough credit in the House for the work that they do. Among those whom I know or have encountered is Keith Mitchell CBE&#151;leader of Oxfordshire county council and a colleague of my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (John Howell)&#151;who since the Conservatives took control of the council at the most recent local elections has done an outstanding job in putting its finances in better order while improving services at the same time. I shall say more about that shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para26"><a name="09020482000053">I am also thinking of men such as Stephen Greenhalgh, leader of Hammersmith and Fulham council. I know that the Minister received a presentation from that Conservative council last week on the excellent work that it has been doing in reducing council tax while improving services. Then there is a man who, in my view, is not given enough attention in the national press: Mike Whitby, the leader of Britain&#146;s second city, Birmingham. He is a kind of pre-Boris Boris&#151;the first Conservative mayor of a big city for some years&#151;and he has been a superb leader of that city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para27"><a name="09020482000054">What unites the three gentlemen whom I have mentioned&#151;and I have mentioned those three merely because they are the ones whom I know best&#151;is a passion for the areas that they represent, and a passionate desire to give their council tax payers, the residents and the local population the best service possible. That, I think, goes to the heart of some of the frustration expressed by Conservative Members today about central Government&#146;s attitude to local government&#151;the stranglehold in which central Government hold local government, and the almost psychotic wish of central Government not to allow local government the flexibility to experiment or innovate. Local government is simply there as central Government&#146;s whipping boy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90204-0017.htm_para28"><a name="09020482000055">We see from the Government endless initiatives designed to catch headlines, particularly on issues such as free swimming, which concern me as a shadow Minister for Culture, Media and Sport, but also on issues mentioned by other Members, such as free local transport. The Government take the plaudits for those initiatives while expecting local government to pick up the bill. I suspect that the postbags of all Members in every part of the House will have been full of letters from constituents saying &#147;I heard this announced by the Government six months ago: why is the council not implementing it?&#148; We have to tell them that it is because, having announced it, the Government did not give the council the money.</p>

I must say that I think it is a good idea for council tax bills to contain details of the efficiencies and savings that a council has managed to come up with. I suspect that Hammersmith and Fulham council will do that without any impetus from Government, because it has a fantastic story to tell about the savings that it has achieved for local council tax payers. It is, however, mind-boggling hypocrisy that the Government patronise local government by saying, &#147;You will do this, and you will be made to be more efficient&#148;, but heaven forfend that local councils should push back and say, &#147;Well, how about putting some of the efficiency savings that central Government  <br>

Particularly for those watching outside the Chamber, there might be the feeling that here we go again&#151;that were there to be another Conservative Government, we might be in this Chamber in some years&#146; time with Labour Opposition Members complaining about the high-handed acts of central Government. However, I anticipate that there is on the Conservative Benches a genuine appetite for a change in the relationship between central and local government&#151;for more power to be pushed down to local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90204-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09020482000058">We have talked about my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor&#146;s commitment to freeze council tax in partnership with councils that will come to the table. The hon. Member for Telford (David Wright) is no longer in his place, but I would remind him that he can put Oxfordshire county council at number one on his list of councils that said they would come to the table for that council tax freeze.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90204-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09020482000059">We have also proposed referendums, so that if a council wants to increase the council tax above a certain level, the local people will have a chance to say, &#147;Yes, we approve of that spending; we think it is the right thing to do in the circumstances,&#148; or &#147;No, you&#146;ve breached your covenant with us; that level of spending is too high, so go back and think again.&#148;</p>

However, I believe that our party is on a journey to push power back to local councils. The reason for that is partly historical; we have been in opposition for 10 years, so our opportunity to exercise power has come at the local level. That has given this House outstanding Members of Parliament, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Henley and my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill), who is another outstanding local government servant. It has also given us outstanding council leaders and an opportunity to think and innovate.</p>

The increase in the budget from central Government is pathetic: it is 2 per cent. in 2008-09, 1.7 per cent. for 2009-10 and 1.5 per cent. for 2010-11. Those budget decisions were made by Ministers because Oxfordshire county council is, of course, a floor authority.

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90204-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09020482000065">Despite the constraints I have described, the county council continues to deliver value for money for local council tax payers. It has achieved efficiency savings of &#163;40 million, and it will be proud to put that on its council tax bills. It has reduced the rate of increase in council tax from 4.5 per cent. to 3.75 per cent., which is far ahead of its own target. My hon. Friend the Member for Henley alluded to the fact that it has achieved that through greater shared services. The council has other achievements: electronic social care records; the refurbishment of its offices; closer working between the special educational needs department and the primary care trust; putting in place, despite a lack of Government funding, new provision for post-16 SEN&#151;a campaign in which I was closely involved; free parking; and the refurbishment of Oxford city station. Of course, the crowning glory is the fact that it is the first county council to receive a corporate charter mark. I have no idea what a corporate charter mark is, but I am immensely proud that my county council was the first to get one.</p>

 Let me inform my hon. Friend of what a corporate charter mark is. I happened to be the councillor who thought of the idea of the council&#146;s going for it and then pushed it through. It is a statement to the people of Oxfordshire that the council takes its relationship with them seriously in terms of the customer service it delivers. The thing that excited me was the enormous enthusiasm of ordinary officers and officials in the county council for taking it up.</p>

The councils also have joint IT purchasing agreements with other local councils.

I should say that I am fully in favour of the concessionary fares. When I mentioned this in a debate last year, I was misinterpreted by irate pensioners who thought that I wanted to curtail their jaunts on buses. I had no such intention. If people want to take more bus journeys, that is fine. They are good for their health and I am fully in favour of that. However, if the Government are to be true to their word and fund the policy fully, the funding allocated between local authorities has to be fair.</p>

I will take up the Minister&#146;s earlier invitation to send him details, and I hope that he will meet another delegation. This year, Worthing faces another deficit of &#163;500,000, which is the equivalent of several percentage points on its council tax. The council would much rather have lower council tax and see that money spent on services. That is why the situation is so unfair and galling. In my part of the world, the high pensioner population creates extra demands. We have the highest proportion of over-85s in the country, at some 4.6 per cent., with the resultant extra requirements for expenditure&#151;which we are happy to spend.</p>

Our increase this year is 1.75 per cent., or an extra &#163;1.7 million. If one takes away the school spending, that equates to 4p a week more per resident per week for all services except schools over the next year, and the increase is even less next year. On the other hand, Dorset does not have the area cost adjustment and it will get a grant rise of 7.6 per cent. Its demographics are similar to ours.</p>

Its rise of 1.75 per cent. compares with a RPI figure of 3 per cent. The same was true last year: our grant increase was 2 per cent. with an RPI of 4.3 per cent. Those low rises are a direct consequence of changes made by Government to the grant system, removing funding from West Sussex and many other south-east authorities for the benefit of authorities in the north and midlands. If we had received an average grant settlement since 2003-04, when the Government changed the grant system, that would have produced an extra &#163;28 million per annum for the county&#151;enough to fund 700 extra social workers or to provide 1,680 residential care placements or more than 600 foster care placements. The impact of general inflation on non-school services alone is more than &#163;10.5 million this year, and we are getting &#163;1.75 million.</p>

 With the leave of the House, I want to respond to some of the points made in the debate. I had not quite expected to be called to speak just at that moment, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I am grateful to you for doing so. Let me pick up where the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) left off and say that I look forward to any further information that he chooses to send me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90204-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09020482000084">May I also pick up on the point of order made by the hon.

I am sorry that neither of the hon. Gentlemen is in the House to hear the brief update that I can give. They expressed concern about salt supplies in Gloucestershire. The Government, through the Government office resilience teams, are monitoring the situation very carefully with the prospect of bad winter weather later in the week in some areas of the country. The Local Government Association is working very closely with us and is brokering an arrangement that can ensure that the stocks of salt and grit in different areas can be best used and can be moved when required to the areas where the priorities are most pressing. That mutual aid arrangement involves not just local authorities and local highways authorities but the Highways Agency, which carries stocks of grit and salt. Such arrangements are now relatively common and relatively well proven to deal with a range of problems. Assistance from local government and other agencies, where necessary, is provided to those areas where the problems are greatest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="90204-0018.htm_para21"><a name="09020482000085">Such arrangements have worked well in dealing with other problems in the past. We are keeping a close eye on how the salt and grit supplies last, but at this stage I  <br>

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I am sure that all hon. Members will welcome that information and be grateful to him and his officials for taking the trouble to supply it. Have the highway authorities, the Local Government Association or his Department made any assessment of the total quantity of salt available in the country? What arrangements will be made for rural areas, where the danger is that roads may become impassable before the salt can be shipped in?</p>

 I do not have an audit of salt and grit stocks across the country, and I am not sure that it has been completed. The levels being held will depend on the preparations that local authorities have made, and on the amounts that they have deemed necessary to put on the roads in recent days. The Highways Agency has sufficient stocks that it has been able to make at least a day&#146;s worth available to local highway authorities. That is a valuable contribution to the arrangements that the LGA is helping to broker to ensure that salt and grit are where we expect the greatest pressure to be, or where the priorities seem most pressing. I hope that helps the House.</p>

He said that things had changed since the start of the three-year settlement, and it is certainly true that his party&#146;s promises about local government have changed. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> We are talking about funding for local government, and what has changed is that a Conservative Government would now make the limit to local government a rise of 1 per cent. in real terms above inflation. That compares with the 2.8 per cent. rise in real terms for the core grant that we are putting in place for next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="90204-0018.htm_para23"><a name="09020482000089">Moreover, if a Conservative Government were elected, the change that I have described would be introduced&#151;and felt by local government&#151;not in some distant future but after only eight weeks. Some &#163;240 million would be taken out of central Government&#146;s core grant to local government. It is really not good enough for the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst to suggest that somehow that could be dealt with through efficiency savings. They cannot be made in such a short space of time, so the Conservative plan can mean only one thing&#151;that the services that people need would be cut.</p>

 There is a bit of chuntering on the Opposition Benches, and I am not surprised, as Conservative Members do not like to be reminded that central Government funding for local government in each of the four years up to 1997 did not rise by an amount above the level of inflation, as it has done since 1997. Nor did that funding rise in line with inflation: instead, it fell by 7 per cent. compared to inflation in those four years&#151;a point of which my hon.

Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) about his policies on council tax. I understand why he shifted uncomfortably and chuntered rather vaguely for a while, as the shadow Chancellor is conning the public with his announcements and suggestions about a council tax freeze. For example, he said to the Conservative party conference:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/debtext/90204-0019.htm"/>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="90204-0019.htm_para0"><a name="09020482000094">but that was a con, as not all council tax payers&#146; bills would be frozen, only those in the areas taking part in the scheme. Moreover, how would the freeze be paid for? The Conservative leader has said that the money would be taken from central Government advertising budgets, but he has suggested that those same budgets would pay for other policies.</p>

 One of the Government&#146;s difficulties is that they spend so much time reading Conservative proposals that they never have time to do anything themselves. Does the Minister agree that the Institute of Fiscal Studies has confirmed that the Government are cutting spending by &#163;35 billion? Can he name a single Labour council that has ever cut council tax for its council tax payers?</p>

 When I spoke earlier, I named three Labour councils that are keeping council tax under control. Hackney, Greenwich and Newham are set to freeze council tax next year. One of those, Hackney, is to freeze council tax for a fourth successive year at a time when it is improving services, not cutting them; too often, cuts are Conservative councils&#146; method of keeping council tax pressures under control.</p>

 Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman would like to contrast the amount of grant received by those three local authorities with the average grant for Greater London authorities of all complexions. Secondly, will he confirm that regardless of whether something has changed since the last settlement, something has changed for him in the past three hours since he said &#147;low tax does not have to mean service cuts&#148;?</p>

 Low tax does not need to mean service cuts. It does not mean it in Hackney, Newham or Greenwich. The hon. Gentleman asked about the funding formula for those three councils; it is precisely the same funding formula that is applied to other London councils, and to all councils across the country.</p>

He was right to pay tribute to our council leaders. Many councils across the country are well led, and it is important that we make that point, irrespective of party. He described their passion for their area, and he is quite right. We see in the best of local government a commitment to the very best in public service. I am just disappointed that his contribution to the debate went downhill after that.</p>

Member for Henley talked about the settlement figures in Oxfordshire and took me to task on the figures for local government generally. The figures speak for themselves when it comes to investment and increased funding from central Government to local government. The distribution of the funding reflects the relative wealth of an area, and its ability to raise revenue locally in light of its council tax base. It also reflects the relative need and deprivation of areas. He complains that Oxfordshire is a floor authority that had a 2 per cent. rise last year, a 1.75 per cent. rise this year and a 1.5 per cent. rise next year, and then complains about the floor. I have to say to him that those rises are a result of the application of a formula that takes into account the relative wealth and needs of an area. Without the floor, which we introduced several years ago, Oxfordshire would be &#163;9 million worse off this year, so I am surprised that he does not welcome, rather than criticise, the floor.</p>

 I present this petition on behalf of many thousands of my constituents and my local authority, the London borough of Sutton. The petition seeks protection for garden land from the rapacious appetite of developers.</p>

It gives character to an area, it provides opportunities for leisure, and it is good for local wildlife. Once garden land is developed, it exposes the neighbourhood to greater air pollution from cars, increased risk of opportunistic burglary and a loss of wildlife habitat. The Government have at last announced a review of planning policy that designates garden land as brownfield land&#151;a long overdue review.</p>

 This petition is one of many involving Northern Rock shareholders. The issue is almost becoming an omnibus; there have been several such petitions, and I have no doubt that there will be more.</p>

The directors of Northern Rock, not its shareholders, led to the current situation. The shareholders are worried about how the valuation was done when the company was no longer liquid. They believe that that will lead them to suffer an injustice and unfairness. I have faith in the Government, who have tried to do the right thing by everyone involved in Northern Rock. Nevertheless, I have described the feelings of the petitioners. All they are asking for is fairness and justice, and no one in this place would want to object to that. I hope that the Secretary of State and the Government will take notice of what seems to me to be a heartfelt plea. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your consideration in arranging this spot for me under somewhat unusual circumstances.</p>

 I have been struck by a couple of political clich&#233;s in the past few days. One was the attempts by the Foreign Secretary and the American Secretary of State to outdo each other in singing the praises of the special relationship, whatever that may mean to each of us. The other was the comments that I read today, made by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), who referred to the claim that American intelligence would be withdrawn in certain circumstances in relation to Guantanamo Bay. I mention that because in military terms, American intelligence is sometimes an oxymoron, to put it mildly. Nevertheless, one needs to understand what both clich&#233;s imply when considering our role in missile defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90204-0019.htm_para30"><a name="09020482000139">We are at a point in time when we have a new American President, whom I shall pray in aid in the course of my speech. I urge hon. Members, and certainly the Minister, not to get too excited by President Obama. I would, if I may, refer him to page 309 of &#147;The Audacity of Hope&#148; to show how difficult it can be to appraise American intentions. President Obama is talking about the need to establish a consensus before the kind of precipitate action for which the Bush Administration became a byword is taken. He says:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/debtext/90204-0020.htm"/>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para0"><a name="09020482000140">I find that a rather disparaging comment. I think that it shows disdain, if not contempt, for the United Kingdom&#151;or perhaps he is just being absolutely honest. Nevertheless, it is the framework within which I believe that the new Administration will work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para1"><a name="09020482000141">I have spoken many times about missile defence; let me remind the House of what it is. It is a successor to President Reagan&#146;s strategic defence initiative&#151;star wars, as it was called. It was initially called, very tellingly, national missile defence, until even the Bush Administration realised that that implied that it was an American system for American defence&#151;as in fact it was&#151;and changed it to missile defence, often known by the acronym BMD: ballistic missile defence. The only way in which this could be introduced was by the Bush Administration being able to withdraw from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty, which they did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para2"><a name="09020482000142">The system is a highly sophisticated technological concept by which a missile, or projectile, is fired at a missile at one of several stages in order to take it out in the course of its flight. It has been likened to a bullet hitting a bullet at about 1,600 kph. Over the years I have conversed with people such as Ted Postol, who was the father of the Trident missile system, and Dick Garwin, who started his professional life as a weapons expert on the H-bomb. One would associate both those men, by their own admission, with the right of the political spectrum. They are hardly loony lefties, but they are united, along with many other members of the Federation of American Scientists, in one belief&#151;that this is a wholly impractical system. To my knowledge, it still has not been shown to be a proven way of intercepting offensive missiles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09020482000143">The question has often been posited&#151;and nobody has ever been able to reply to it&#151;&#147;What happens if a so-called rogue state holds one of these weapons and sends it into space, and the United States, or whoever, has some means, as the technology currently stands, whereby it could guarantee that it could knock it out, and that state, which is presumably sophisticated enough to do so, incorporates some kind of decoy into its missile? That is, as yet, a completely untested proposition. The tests to date have included decoys of a different sort&#151;homing devices that have enabled rockets to be semi-accurate. I can just see a rogue state putting a homing device into a rocket for us to knock out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09020482000144">President Obama has, in all fairness, expressed doubts about this. He has said that he wants to</p>
<a name="90204-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="09020482000218"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;ensure that it is developed in a way that is pragmatic and cost-effective; and, most importantly, does not divert resources from other national security priorities until we are positive the technology will protect the American public.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09020482000145">Will it work? Is it affordable? Those are very big questions that need to be answered, certainly in terms of our involvement, for reasons that I will come to in a moment. The truth is that we have fallen blindly in line behind this system with, in their different ways, right-wing Governments in the Czech Republic and Poland because of what is almost a paranoia fostered by what Eisenhower referred to as the military-industrial complex. Huge amounts of money&#151;hundreds of billions of dollars&#151;are invested in the development of this system, and that money comes from names that are familiar to those who have studied the trade in death otherwise known as the arms trade. They will not let go of their vested interest lightly .</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para6"><a name="09020482000146">There is no question but that there are dangers abroad in the world, but Members will recall the coining of the phrase &#147;the axis of evil&#148;. The No. 1 member of the axis of evil that had to be removed at one stage was Saddam Hussein in Iraq. That removal was predicated upon mythical weapons of mass destruction: many of us did not believe in them then, and we were shown to be right. The focus then moved to North Korea, which was launching missiles all over the place. We were told that North Korea was building up enough fissile material to create a certain number of bombs, and that the matter had to be resolved. There were threats of military action, but it all came down to negotiation. To bring things up to date, we now have someone else to demonise. We demonise Iran because it has a nuclear power programme. Doctor el-Baradei, who nobody believed when he said there were no WMDs in Iraq, has done a commendable job on behalf of the International Atomic Energy Authority in monitoring what is happening in Iran. With its launch of a satellite using its own missile, those who want to have someone to fear find it even easier to demonise it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09020482000147">As I said, President Obama seems at best equivocal about missile defence. People of some import within Europe, such as President Sarkozy, have dismissed the missile defence project as destabilising. It seems to be Governments of a certain persuasion in parts of the former Soviet Union&#146;s area of influence who have given any sort of support to missile defence.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend not share my astonishment that former Prime Minister Tony Blair said to President Bush that he could have missile defence in this country? Unlike what happens in Poland and the Czech Republic, there has so far been no substantive debate or vote whatsoever in Parliament on this matter. Does he agree that, at the very least, the matter deserves parliamentary scrutiny because of the implications for an arms build-up, or pressure in Russia for a rearmament programme?</p>

<p><a name="st_o329"><a name="09020482000149"><a name="90204-0020.htm_spnew1"><a name="09020482000289"><b>Mr. Kilfoyle:</b>
 My hon. Friend has pre-empted the kernel of what I am driving towards. If he will be a little patient, I shall come to that issue in some detail. But he is right to indicate that there has been great disquiet in the United Kingdom, and not always from the sources that we might expect. Some of us in this party are painted as taking a particular view on the different manifestations of militarism, but the Select Committee on Defence issued a report in January 2003 commenting on the modernisation of Fylingdales, which I visited at that time to see the new radar that was being installed. The project was going ahead&#151;that was a statement of fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09020482000150">The Select Committee noted:</p>
<a name="90204-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="09020482000219"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We deplore the manner in which the public debate on the issue of the upgrade...has been handled by the Ministry of Defence. It has shown no respect for either the views of those affected locally by the decision or for the arguments of those opposed to the upgrade in principle...We believe that it is incumbent on the MOD to publish as much of the detail of the request as it is able to. For example, more information could be published on the timescale for...its incorporation into the US missile defence system and how the system would be able to track missiles.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09020482000151">The Committee had real and practical concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09020482000152">Other comments of concern were also made. In November 2007, more than 110 MPs signed early-day motion 65. It was entitled &#147;Parliament and decisions over US missile defence&#148;, and it called upon the Government to arrange a full debate, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) said a moment ago,</p>
<a name="90204-0020.htm_brev3"><a name="09020482000220"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to allow hon. Members to scrutinise in public the US Missile Defence deployment plans in the UK.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para12"><a name="09020482000154">An open debate would have been the key to finding out what was going on. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) asked the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in a parliamentary question:</p>
<a name="90204-0020.htm_brev4"><a name="09020482000221"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;When does he intend to tell the House of Commons the nature of his discussions with President Bush about the possible deployment of part of an anti-ballistic missile system for the United States in the United Kingdom?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para13"><a name="09020482000155">A pretty straightforward question, I would have thought. Unfortunately, once again, what we all believed at the time to be a commitment by the then Prime Minister was just smoke and mirrors. He replied:</p>

At the moment, those discussions are at a very preliminary stage, but it is important that we have them with the United States to see what options are available for this country and whether ballistic missile defence would be good for us or not. It is entirely sensible that we have those discussions&#151;obviously they are on a confidential basis, but as soon as we have something to report we will do so.&#148;</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) on obtaining this Adjournment debate on a matter of considerable interest to many people, as he rightly said. He speaks not only from deep conviction on the subject, but from a long-standing involvement in it. Indeed, I have noticed his early-day motions and the other initiatives that he has taken to draw public attention to the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para37"><a name="09020482000180">It often happens on these occasions that the Minister replies to the Member who has secured the debate by reading a written statement. That can sometimes lead to the two individuals speaking past each other, so it might be more helpful in the time that I have to try to focus on the questions that my hon. Friend asked. Before I do so, however, let me say two things briefly. First, there is an illusion, which I wish to lay to rest, that the Government have a plan to deploy interceptors&#151;an anti-ballistic missile system&#151;in this country. We have no such current plans. That is an error in the early-day motion to which I have referred and I hope that I can lay it to rest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para38"><a name="09020482000181">Secondly, let me explain what national missile defence&#151;or international or anti-ballistic missile defence&#151;is about. If my hon. Friend went to Fylingdales, he would see a radar picture on a screen of the upper atmosphere and the surrounding areas of space over quite a large section of the northern hemisphere. He would be able to see all the various objects in that space, including satellites and the launches of commercial satellites, all of which we will have been notified of, which can be tracked through that system. Occasionally he might also see a meteor or something exciting of that kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="90204-0020.htm_para39"><a name="09020482000182">However, if one fine day&#151;well, it would not be a fine day; it would be a day of horror&#151;an unidentified flying object appeared on that screen and the computers calculated from its trajectory that it was heading for us, there would be nothing practical that we could do about it, and that has been true for decades. It would be possible to notify the Vanguard submarine currently on patrol and to notify the Prime Minister, but nothing could be done. We would simply have to sit and wait to see whether that day was the day of Armageddon. Anti-ballistic missile defence provides an alternative to that. It provides the possibility of doing something about that object, which might be a rogue missile from a rogue state or an error&#151;one does not know. That is the difference between having an anti-ballistic missile system and having no such system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="90204-0021.htm_para0"><a name="09020482000183">Let me go through the points that my hon. Friend raised. First, he talked about the effectiveness of the system and said that it was not proven. The system is  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="4 Feb 2009">

<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>4 Feb 2009 : Column 950</b><br>
not proven in the sense that there is a great deal of technical work to be done on it. He mentioned electronic counter-measures and decoys. Without going into sensitive areas, let me assure him that all those issues are being addressed. All I can say is that up to now&#151;this information has been in the public domain&#151;there have been quite a number of firings by the Americans of their anti-ballistic missile systems. There have been 47 successes so far, as against 37 failures. The system is certainly making progress, so any assumption that it is technically non-viable would be a rather rash one to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="90204-0021.htm_para1"><a name="09020482000184">My hon. Friend asked whether the information from the radars at Fylingdales to which I have referred and the information from the satellite sensors being downloaded at Menwith Hill is available to our authorities and the Americans at the same time. The answer to that is simply yes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="90204-0021.htm_para2"><a name="09020482000185">My hon. Friend raised the attitude of Russia. Russia&#146;s attitude is difficult to understand. As he knows, the intention of the United States&#151;this is the matter currently under discussion with Poland&#151;is to site 10 interceptors in Poland. Under the strategic arms reduction treaty, Russia has the right to 1,600 delivery systems&#151;that basically means missiles&#151;and, if I remember rightly, up to 6,000 warheads. It is inconceivable that 10 interceptors could make the slightest difference to a country with 1,600 missiles or thereabouts and a great many more warheads to deploy. That is not an argument that can be taken seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="90204-0021.htm_para3"><a name="09020482000186">I agree with the suggestion that my hon. Friend rightly made that there could be a great deal of sensitivity in Russia about a country that was a satellite of the Soviet Union and, for a century and a quarter before 1917, part of the tsarist empire and that is now, thank heaven, part of the European Union and NATO, getting involved in a close, collaborative, strategic defence relationship with the United States. I agree that that might well touch sensitive nerves. Whatever Russia&#146;s attitude is, however, it is not based on a rational calculation of the potential impact of those interceptors in Poland on anything whatever to do with its own missile or second-strike capability. I think that we can lay that one to rest as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="90204-0021.htm_para4"><a name="09020482000187">My hon. Friend asked about the legal basis for Menwith Hill. I can tell him that a legal agreement under which American personnel have worked in Menwith Hill was signed, I believe, in 1955. I might not have got the date absolutely right, but it was certainly in the &#146;50s. That agreement was introduced under the status of forces agreement that we signed with the Americans a few years earlier, at the beginning of the constitution of NATO. That agreement is still in place; it has never been rescinded. We do not need to sign an agreement with the United States every time we have a defence co-operation arrangement or every time we exchange information, which we do the whole time, I am glad to say. Our symbiotic relationship with the United States is the basis of a large amount of British national security. We share a lot of information and we have a very productive and important relationship, which is a great national asset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="90204-0021.htm_para5"><a name="09020482000188">My hon. Friend also asked me whether I believed that we should divert resources from our core defence budget to missile defence. We are not doing that, and the incremental costs involved in putting the new equipment into Menwith Hill and Fylingdales were met entirely by  <br>

the United States, so that issue has not arisen. As I have already told him, there are at the present time no plans to site an anti-ballistic missile system in this country, so that question does not arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="90204-0021.htm_para6"><a name="09020482000189">My hon. Friend asked me whether we joined the rest of NATO the other day in welcoming the Russian Government&#146;s statement that they no longer intended to deploy missiles in Kaliningrad. Of course we welcome that; I can give him that assurance. He also asked whether the Government agreed with a particular survey. My answer is the one that I think he will have anticipated. The Government do not make it their business to agree or disagree with a survey, which is simply a series of questions. Of course, the Government listen to these surveys and take account of them, however, and I take on board what he has told me about that particular one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="90204-0021.htm_para7"><a name="09020482000190">Finally, my hon. Friend asked me about Parliament. Naturally, Parliament has had several opportunities before this evening to debate the ballistic missile defence issue. The last occasion was, I believe, 8 May last year,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="4 Feb 2009">

<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>4 Feb 2009 : Column 952</b><br>
when we had a debate on defence in the world. The Government have made a commitment that, if we should take a decision to locate an anti-ballistic missile system with interceptors in this country, there would certainly be an opportunity for Parliament to debate the matter before we did so. However, I can assure my hon. Friend that no such decision has been taken and none is in prospect at the present time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="90204-0021.htm_para8"><a name="09020482000191">I think that our time is up, but may I once again congratulate my hon. Friend on his success in pursuing this cause with his characteristic tenacity? My colleagues and I remain entirely at his disposal, either for future occasions on which we can debate this matter in Parliament, or if he wants to come to see us privately to talk further about it.</p>
