 I entirely agree. It is pleasing to see that many, if not all, further education colleges now hold celebration evenings and events during the year. Last week, we had an enormously successful apprenticeships week in England. That was a particular opportunity to celebrate the success of people who have achieved real and valuable vocational qualifications. I am pleased that as a result of actions taken by party political colleagues north of the border, there is now&#151;rather belatedly&#151;to be added investment in the apprenticeship programme there; more young Scottish people will be able to celebrate success in apprenticeships too.</p>

 Many FE colleges structure courses to be compliant with the 16-hour rule that normally operates in respect of JSA. In addition, as part of the package of new measures, those providing the courses, totalling more than 70,000 places, to be available to those who have been out of work for six months, will be required to show that they can run them so that a person can start training while continuing their job search&#151;and, when they get into work, carry on with their training.

During the recession of the late &#146;80s and early &#146;90s, many companies thought that the training budget should be the first thing to go. I believe that that attitude has changed. Many companies have to make hard-headed decisions, but there is a much more positive commitment to maintaining such investment. That is why the Government are maintaining investment in skills and rejecting the advice of the Conservative party, which would cut my Department&#146;s budget by &#163;610 million.</p>

 I do not believe that there is much hard data on this, but I can confirm that there is an issue in more rural areas, where there is likely to be fewer large employers and less heavy industry, so perhaps there is less of a tradition of apprenticeships. To tackle that, we are developing and extending group training associations and what we call apprenticeship training associations, which are different types of confederations and sharing systems for apprenticeships, so that the smaller businesses that are more likely to be found in rural areas are able to provide apprenticeships. When the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill is passed and we have a National Apprenticeship Service, one of the first things it will do is go out into the harder-to-reach parts of the country, to spread the word and the practice of apprenticeships.</p>

 On this occasion, the right hon. Gentleman is a little premature. When the system began in 2006, 7,100 students from the EU were entitled to loans. He will understand that those students do not graduate until this summer, and will be eligible to repay from the spring of 2010. Some students dropped out while on courses, and many of them are on other courses and below the threshold. Many of them are back in their European countries on other courses and below the threshold. That leaves a small number of students, and I can confirm that nine are being chased through the courts.</p>

 As my right hon.

A spokesman for the Student Loans Company has said that it does not write routinely to addresses provided. That is surprising. I believe that it is a warning of a much bigger problem to come when more EU students graduate. Does the Minister not think that the problem was predictable and avoidable?

As I have said, the 70 per cent. figure is plain wrong. Most of that 70 per cent. is made up of students who have changed their courses, dropped out of courses, are still in education and are certainly beneath the threshold. Most of those students do not graduate until the summer of this year and, as he would expect, the Student Loans Company is putting in place everything it can to ensure that we chase down those students when they graduate.</p>

 So far the Government have not been convinced that we would be better off with a national bursary scheme, because it would be hard to determine how it differed from the national system of student financial support. Universities enjoy freedom and flexibility in determining their bursary schemes, although the schemes must be agreed with the Office of Fair Access. I have no doubt, however, that the operation of such schemes is one of the issues that will examined when the review of fees and financing is launched later in the year.</p>

 Although there is good practice and much is being learned at universities throughout Britain, the Department may be interested in a specific example arising from my involvement with the university of Glasgow. When people were encouraged to provide more scholarships, especially for disadvantaged students, it became clear that many of those who might be considered eligible to donate were put off by the very word &#147;scholarship&#148;, assuming that it was necessary to be extremely rich to provide a scholarship or endowment. In fact the donations can be quite small, but they can make all the difference&#151;particularly to a potential student from a disadvantaged background in, say, the city of Glasgow who might otherwise not go to university.</p>

 That is an interesting point. We are always willing to learn from good practice wherever we can find it.

They are examining ways they can proactively seek out such students&#151;who may intend to go to university, but not to apply for places at the research-intensive universities&#151;and encourage them, by means of summer schools or other such activities, to consider studying at such universities.

 As we often celebrate in this House, we have a world-class higher education system in this country. One of the reasons for that is that I do not run the universities and I do not make such decisions about individual universities. I think that that is a shared view across the House. The truth is that these decisions&#151;which often give rise to local, and sometimes even national, concerns&#151;are decisions that must be taken by the universities themselves in developing their own priorities and sense of mission. I do not believe that our university system would be better off if central Government were to begin to dictate to universities which departments they should or should not close. Occasionally, the funding councils will rightly step in with strategic funding, as they have done in the past to sustain physics departments, but that is different from my stepping in on decisions made by Liverpool or any other university, which will inevitably make changes to their pattern of courses and investment over years to come.</p>

 Does the Minister share my concern at the performance of the Learning and Skills Council in cancelling the proposed redevelopment of Cheadle and Marple sixth-form college and, furthermore, in leaving 900 students without their education maintenance allowances in January of this year?

 Although I do not think that the structure of community colleges could be easily imported into our system without enormous disruption and relocation, there are elements of the community college system that we could build into it effectively, particularly&#151;although not only&#151;the ability to progress from vocational qualifications to vocational education at a higher level. In a recent speech to university vice-chancellors, I made it clear that we need to do more of that in the future. From what I have seen of US community colleges, they have strengths in that area.</p>

on Tuesday 31 March. We will none the less proceed with our Opposition day debate on the economy next Wednesday. Can the Leader of the House confirm that the Chancellor will be at both debates?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90312-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09031256000174">May we have a statement from the Government on the purpose of Select Committees? Yesterday, the Liaison Committee published its annual report into the work of Select Committees, which stated that the already over-stretched state of the Committee machinery was being exacerbated by Committees&#146; being too large and by the establishment of too many Committees. Will the Government once again explain why they have just created a further eight new Committees, at least two of which, as we learned from points of order on Tuesday, did not even manage to hold their first meeting as they were supposed to? Does that not speak eloquently of the total uselessness of regional Select Committees?</p>

There is still no indication from the Government about what they plan to do about the vulgar encampment and constant megaphone bellowing in Parliament square, which is a permanent national embarrassment. When can we expect such a debate or statement? Rather more importantly, will the Leader of the House join me and others in condemning the ignorance of those protesters in Luton who did everything they could to spoil what should have been a day dedicated to honouring the British soldiers who have put their lives on their line to do their duty under threat abroad?</p>

Ministers are accountable to Parliament, especially on the spending of money. This appears to be unacceptable behaviour from the Secretary of State and brings her and this place into disrepute. Will the Leader of the House convey to the Secretary of State the displeasure of the House and seek a full apology from her along with the information to which hon. Members are fully entitled?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="90312-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09031256000177">Does the Leader of the House think that she has given enough time for the Welfare Reform Bill on Report, given the ferocity of the amendments that have been tabled to it by her Back Benchers? On Monday, the Department for Work and Pensions was subjected to the attentions of some furious protesters, including an organisation known as Feminist Fightback. Given that the Leader of the House has been pictured before wearing a T-shirt bearing the inscription &#147;This is what a feminist looks like&#148;, might we assume that she, too, took part in that protest?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90312-0004.htm_para18"><a name="09031256000178">Even though, perhaps surprisingly, that event was not covered by the <i> Daily Mirror, </i>in the course of this week the Leader of the House has been. May I congratulate her on being the centrefold of that newspaper on Monday? In the past, she has said that she thinks that Prime Ministers&#146; wives ought to buy their clothes at Primark; now, she says that she &#147;loves stilettos&#148; and that she shops in Primark herself. I am more Savile Row, I have to admit&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> But not stilettos. Might we conclude that this is preparation for her becoming Prime Minister?</p>

 Perhaps I may start by thanking the hon. Gentleman for the correction that he has made in respect of Lord Myners. The hon. Gentleman has acted appropriately: he said something, it was pointed out that it was wrong, and he has come to the House at the next opportunity to put it right. I thank him for that, and I think that he has done exactly right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90312-0004.htm_para22"><a name="09031256000183">The hon. Gentleman asked about the debate on the economy. Since the credit crunch began to take effect as a result of the global financial crisis, this House has had the benefit of constant accountability on the economy through oral statements, Bills, questions raised with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister, and topical debates. It is for the Opposition to choose the subject of an Opposition day debate, and for next week&#146;s they have chosen the economy. It is for the Government to determine which Minister to put forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90312-0004.htm_para23"><a name="09031256000184">The Liaison Committee&#146;s report pays tribute to, or at least acknowledges, the Government&#146;s concern to provide greater accountability to the House. As for regional Committees, we think that it is important that the massive agencies with big regional reach which are making a huge difference in every region by injecting capital and improving skills, are properly accountable to the House. The spate of what I would call misleading points of order implied that there was something untoward about the first set of regional Committee meetings. That is absolutely wrong: the normal process is that, when members of a Committee are selected&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It is not the case that they did not turn up. When members of a Committee are selected, it is for the most senior to arrange with the Clerks when the meeting should be held. Most of the meetings have been held this week: some will be held today, and the remaining one or two will be held next week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90312-0004.htm_para24"><a name="09031256000185">The regional Committees will go ahead with their work of holding regional agencies to account for the hundreds of millions of pounds that they spend, and I suggest to Opposition Members that they join that work. They too should be concerned about the Highways Agency, the Learning and Skills Council and the strategic health authorities, all of whose actions should be scrutinised at regional level as well as on the Floor of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90312-0004.htm_para25"><a name="09031256000186">The hon. Gentleman asked about the encampment in Parliament square. There will be Justice questions next week, and I suggest that he raise the matter then, when will hear what the plans are to deal with it.</p>

Gentleman raised the point about the shameful demonstrations in Luton, something that I think everyone in the House is concerned about. The local people wanted to welcome the troops back, and I think that we all agree that the counter-demonstrations were deplorable. I think that we all feel struck by the contrast between the freedom of speech that allows people to demonstrate and the conditions in those countries where our soldiers are fighting for democracy, freedom of speech, peace and security, both in the region and in the world.</p>

Obviously, the Department wants to answer parliamentary questions and be accountable for its spending.

I have always thought that it is a bad thing for a child to be brought up in a house where no one works. That is not just a question of income: it is important for children to see their parents getting up and going out to work every day. That is how children learn that they, too, will be in the world of work when they grow up, not simply expecting to live off benefits. So not only is the work that arose originally from the new deal for lone parents&#151;which involves more help, more child care and more training for lone parents to get into work&#151;good for their household budgets, but it is good for the children to see that people go out to work, rather than live off benefits.</p>

No trade union health and safety representative should find that, as a result of speaking up on behalf of their colleagues, they are on a blacklist and are never able to work again.

 May we have a debate about the dramatically revised estimates by the Government of the costs and benefits of the Climate Change Act 2008, which were sneaked out this week, even though the changes are greater than the cost of bailing out several failed banks? The Leader of the House will remember that the Government were forced to revise their original figures, when I pointed out that they showed that the potential costs were twice the maximum benefits&#151;the first time that the Government have ever urged us to do something which, on their own figures, would make matters worse. As so often on climate change, where the facts are out of line with the theory, they change the facts, and after five months of revision, the figures have emerged from the massage parlour with the costs doubled to &#163;400 billion, but to ensure that this time the benefits are in excess, the Government have increased their estimate of the benefits by a factor of 10, from &#163;100 billion to &#163;1 trillion.

 Regional newspapers are very important indeed. Local and regional newspapers are trusted to provide useful information for people locally&#151;yes, including the <i> South London Press.</i> Like Guardian Media Group, they have been hit by a change in the way in which people get information, with more people getting information over the internet, and by a fall in business advertising. The matter has been raised with me by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey). It is important that the local and regional media do not jump the gun, diminish their capacity, and close down important newspaper titles which are well respected and very important in local areas. If they have immediate cash-flow problems, they know that they can go to HMRC and defer their taxes. The Government can provide other help. We do not want them to make short-term decisions that result in the long-term loss of important local news media.</p>

 I fully support the views expressed by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell). There is a crisis in local radio and local newspapers. Last week, inadvertently, I associated Silk FM with Guardian Media Group, which was inaccurate. I had been ill-informed, and I have apologised to Guardian Media Group. This week, Guardian Media Group announced the closure of all its local newspaper offices in Wilmslow, Accrington, Salford and Macclesfield, making a very large number of journalists redundant and taking local news away from an area where that newspaper has been printed for 198 years. That shows the seriousness of the issue.

 In 2007, I had the privilege of going to Afghanistan during the Royal Anglian Regiment&#146;s operational tour. I was also at Pirbright barracks when one of its companies returned from tour. It is truly a great regiment, which has shown outstanding bravery and professionalism over the years. So I was appalled at the demonstration in Luton this week; we will not, of course, see those same demonstrators protesting about the many thousands of Muslims who have been killed by the Taliban and al-Qaeda.

 In November last year, I commissioned an urgent inspection of children&#146;s services in Haringey following the failure of agencies in that borough to intervene decisively to protect a little boy.</p>

I also asked Lord Laming to provide us with an independent progress report on child protection across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para4"><a name="09031256000310">Lord Laming has today published his report. I have laid a copy of it before the House, with my reply to him, which sets out the Government&#146;s immediate response. I can confirm that: we will accept all Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations in full; we are taking immediate action from today to implement them; and we will set out our detailed response to all 58 recommendations before the end of next month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09031256000317">The report makes a series of detailed recommendations to ensure that best practice is universally applied in every area of the country, to improve local accountability and to provide more support for local leaders and for the front-line work force. None of Lord Laming&#146;s proposals alone could have prevented the death of baby P, but together they add up to a step change in front-line child protection, because no barrier, no bureaucracy and no buck-passing should ever get in the way of keeping children safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09031256000318">As Lord Laming recommends, we will now establish a new cross-Government national safeguarding delivery unit both to support and challenge every local authority and every children&#146;s trust in the country as they fulfil their responsibilities to keep children safe and to drive continuous improvement in front-line practice across all services.

sector and will provide an annual report to Parliament, including on the implementation of Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para13"><a name="09031256000319">To guide the unit&#146;s work I am today appointing Sir Roger Singleton, the former head of Barnardo&#146;s and a leading expert on child protection, to be the Government&#146;s first ever chief adviser on the safety of children. Sir Roger will advise us on how to update and strengthen our statutory guidance for front-line staff to make it absolutely clear to every agency and every practitioner what they need to do to keep children safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para14"><a name="09031256000320">Lord Laming also recommends that full serious case reviews must remain confidential to protect vulnerable children and ensure the full co-operation of all witnesses. We will strengthen the independence and quality of serious case reviews. The unit will monitor their implementation to ensure both that lessons are learned and that public executive summaries are full and comprehensive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para15"><a name="09031256000321">Effective child protection depends critically on strong local leadership and accountability, so that everyone is clear about who must do what to keep children safe. We are already legislating in the House to ensure that every local authority has a statutory children&#146;s trust board to improve all the outcomes for children and young people. We will strengthen the role of the local safeguarding children board both to make it, in effect, the local watchdog for the protection of children and to hold the children&#146;s trust and local agencies to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para16"><a name="09031256000322">We will set out in the revised statutory guidance our presumption that all local safeguarding children boards will have an independent chair. We will also set out that the director of children&#146;s services and the lead member for children&#146;s services will always be members of both the children&#146;s trust board and the LSCB, and that the chief executive and leader of the council will be required to confirm annually that their local arrangements comply with the law. Because keeping children and young people safe is everyone&#146;s responsibility, we will open the child protection system up to greater public scrutiny by ensuring that two members of the general public are appointed to every local safeguarding children board in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para17"><a name="09031256000323">When children are at risk, it is the skills, confidence and judgment of front-line professionals that make the biggest difference. As Lord Laming says:</p>
<a name="90312-0007.htm_brev5"><a name="09031256000979"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Every day, thousands of children are helped, supported and in some cases have their lives saved by these staff&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para18"><a name="09031256000324">But he is also right to say that</p>
<a name="90312-0007.htm_brev6"><a name="09031256000980"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;rather than feeling valued for their commitment and expertise, professionals across these services often feel undervalued, unsupported and at risk.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para19"><a name="09031256000325">That has to change. That is why the Health Secretary and I have set up the social work taskforce, which will now take forward Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations on the training and professional development of social workers. I have already asked the taskforce to review the effectiveness, the procurement and the IT used in integrated children&#146;s systems, which it will report on next month, so that social workers can keep detailed records of their cases and spend more time with vulnerable children.</p>

We will also expand the graduate recruitment scheme and attract qualified social workers back to the profession and ensure over time that all practitioners can study on the job for a master&#146;s level qualification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para21"><a name="09031256000327">Because we must do more to support leaders across children&#146;s services, I am also today accepting proposals from the chief executive of our leadership college to expand its remit, to introduce a new leadership programme for directors of children&#146;s services from September and to create a new and accelerated programme for those with the greatest potential to become future children&#146;s service leaders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para22"><a name="09031256000328">Lord Laming also identifies further recommendations for the health service, the police, the family courts and the inspectorates. I can tell the House that the Health Secretary is today announcing a new programme that will provide additional support and development for health visitors. The Home Secretary will now take forward Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations further to improve the skills and capacity in child protection in the police. In line with Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations, the Justice Secretary is announcing that Mr. Francis Plowden will carry out a review of court fees in care proceedings. If there is evidence that they are a barrier for local authorities when deciding whether to proceed with a care order for a vulnerable child, we will abolish them. And, with Ofsted already strengthening its inspection process and introducing unannounced inspections every year for front-line social care practice in every area of the country, the inspectorates will respond to Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations by the end of April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para23"><a name="09031256000329">In its annual performance assessment, Ofsted rated safeguarding services in 101 out of 150 local authorities as good or outstanding. But where children are not being kept safe, we will act. In December, eight local authorities were judged inadequate in their safeguarding of children. We immediately sent in our intervention experts to assess the situation in each of them. As the House knows, Haringey has already submitted its action plan to Ofsted for evaluation. Improvement notices and additional support are now in place in Surrey, Birmingham, Essex and West Sussex, and independent performance reviews are under way in Reading and Wokingham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90312-0007.htm_para24"><a name="09031256000330">The Minister for Children, Young People and Families and I are particularly concerned about the serious weaknesses identified in Doncaster. In recent weeks, we have commissioned an independent performance review, which has concluded that, despite significant investment over the past year and some progress, urgent improvement is still required. On Tuesday, the Children&#146;s Minister met the leaders of Doncaster council. Using powers in the Education Act 1996, the Children&#146;s Minister has today written to the council giving it a formal direction immediately to appoint Mr. Tony Elson to chair an independent improvement board that will report directly to Ministers, to submit an improvement plan to be approved by the new board and to co-operate with my Department to bring in a new senior management team to take over the leadership and management of Doncaster children&#146;s services as soon as practicable.</p>

Should not that shift in culture mean a significant extra investment in a universal health visitor service? Lord Laming argues persuasively that the role of health visitors is crucially important. He points out that an evaluation of 161 serious case reviews showed that nearly half the children who suffered terrible harm were under one year of age but only 12 per cent. of them were subject to a child protection plan. Many more of those children at risk might have been identified, if we had a truly universal health visitor service supporting children from birth. Will the Secretary of State now offer his support for the proposals put forward by the leader of my party for an expansion of the health visitor service to make it truly universal?</p>

It exposes the problems with the current level of bureaucracy, but far too often falls back on recommending more bureaucracy as the answer.</p>

The lessons of the past year are clear: buck-passing and back-covering cannot come ahead of protecting vulnerable children.

 I appreciate the careful way in which the hon. Gentleman has responded to Lord Laming&#146;s conclusions. I shall respond to his points, and I reassure him from the outset that the new national unit and the appointment of Sir Roger Singleton is not just another quango and another adviser. This will have a real impact on the translation of best practice into common practice in all areas of the country. As the hon. Gentleman reflects on the proposal, I hope that he will be able to support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para1"><a name="09031256000348">Let me deal with his points in turn. On officials in Haringey, as the hon. Gentleman will know, it was my decision in December to remove the then director of children&#146;s services from her position, but the issue of the appointment of staff, their terms and conditions and their continuing appointment is a matter for Haringey council, not for me. These matters are with Haringey at the moment; the council is going through the proper processes, so it would not be wise for me to comment now on the stage they have reached with different officials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para2"><a name="09031256000349">The hon. Gentleman asked me about court fees. I think I set out clearly the reason why we are having a review. It is made clear in Lord Laming&#146;s report that there is no evidence to suggest that court fees have led to any change in the number of referrals to the courts. In fact, over recent months, there has been a substantial rise in referrals. As I have cited in the House before, the president of the Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services has said that it is aware of</p>
<a name="90312-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="09031256000986"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;no circumstances where a local authority would put court costs as a consideration ahead of the needs of a child&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para3"><a name="09031256000350">We will carry out the review and look carefully at this issue, but unless we can demonstrably show that that statement is absolutely true, we will abolish court fees from the beginning of the coming financial year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para4"><a name="09031256000351">On the issue of process and targets, we are going to look very carefully at the national targets in our indicator set, which Lord Laming asked us to do, but I urge Conservative Members to be very careful about how they proceed here. We have made substantial progress since 2004; in that year only half&#151;51 per cent.&#151;of all initial referrals of children at risk were assessed within seven days, whereas the latest figures show more than 70 per cent. doing so, which is a substantial difference. The focus on quick assessment happened because of the targets. It is important that we do not use wrong targets or targets that distort, but it is also right to have rapid assessment of children at risk. I would like to go even further on that, so it will be looked at very carefully by the social work taskforce.</p>

report by the end of April. We are going to move quickly. Only last week, I was in Derby talking to social workers in that city, where I heard their concerns about ICS and saw it operating in practice. I know that many authorities in the country are finding that that system is actually leading to more effective and efficient decision making, speeding up the way in which they can comprehensively get on and do their work. I do not want to throw out the baby with the bathwater here, which is why it is important we do this properly. The social work taskforce will take this forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para6"><a name="09031256000353">There is often confusion between the common assessment framework and integrated children&#146;s systems. In my experience and from what I hear, CAF processes are working well around the country, but if the hon. Gentleman has a different view, I would be happy to hear more about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para7"><a name="09031256000354">On the issue of health visitors, it is right to have significant investment, and we have put significant investment into our health system. In fact, my right hon. Friend the Health Secretary is announcing today that, as we prefigured in the child health strategy a few weeks ago, there will be a significant increase in the number of health visitors. I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that we will ensure that that happens, but I have to say to him that absolutely the wrong way to do it would be to cut the Sure Start budget, which is there to ensure early intervention and protection of children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09031256000355">The fact that many children who come to harm are not known to the authorities should be addressed by our children&#146;s centres. To cut children&#146;s centres&#151;to be honest, to cut the children&#146;s budget more widely&#151;would be absolutely the wrong thing to do. I ask the hon. Gentleman to have a word with the Leader of the Opposition and suggest to him that he may need to realign his thinking on that particular point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para9"><a name="09031256000356">The hon. Gentleman has been consistent in his view that serious case reviews should be published. He has also been consistently isolated in holding that view. Not only Lord Laming, but the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the Children&#146;s Commissioner, as well as pretty much every expert in the field, disagree with him. They all agree that a public, fully comprehensive executive summary, alongside a confidential full report, is the right way to go. The hon. Gentleman&#151;probably badly advised&#151;dug himself into a hole on that issue in the first few days when it came to light. I say to Conservative Members, &#147;Sometimes, if you get it wrong, just change your mind. You are absolutely wrong on this particular issue.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para10"><a name="09031256000357">That takes me to a wider issue. As Lord Laming&#146;s report says&#151;there is a widespread consensus that is reflected across the country, across experts and across professionals&#151;the 2004 Every Child Matters framework is the right framework for child protection. Our challenge is to implement it effectively in every area. I know that the hon. Gentleman does not agree, and therefore disagreed with the idea of Lord Laming being asked to produce the report in the first place, but again I say to him, &#147;Read the report, reflect and think again.&#148; I do not think that to go back on the 2000 reforms would be the right thing to do and, with the exception of the Conservative party, neither does anybody else.</p>

First, one notices that Lord Laming is frustrated when he says, &#147;Now just do it.&#148; He thought that in his first report. If we are just going to do it, many of the things in the statement are part of just doing it. Furthermore, just doing it also means a lot of resource implications.

We all said, &#147;We must have more social workers, more training of social workers and more training in multi-agency working. Six years on, and nine and a half years since the tragic death of Victoria Climbi&#233;, it is significant that the first recommendation of Lord Laming&#146;s report refers to national leadership, which is quite an indictment after all these years. I might justifiably ask the question, what training will there be for Ministers and senior civil servants in multidisciplinary working?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para18"><a name="09031256000368">I welcome today&#146;s statement on Doncaster, but reflect on the fact that, since 2004, there have sadly been seven deaths of children. I also welcome the national safeguarding children unit. I have two questions. Will early intervention be an integral part of the work of the unit&#151;which is all important if we look beyond the deaths to the wider issue of child abuse, with so many children being affected&#151;and will serious case reviews be reported through the Select Committee in the way that the NSPCC requested, in a biennial report drawing out lessons from serious case reviews?</p>

There is a place for considering the role of scrutiny in local government, as well as that of lead members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para20"><a name="09031256000370">I would like what has happened with adult social services to be taken on board in relation to the reorganisation and children&#146;s services. We give somebody one and a half jobs, and then put adult social services on the side. Vulnerable children become vulnerable adults, and I understand that 15 authorities are pulling adult social services back, but one at least has a very low rating. Lord Laming has one paragraph on that matter, which should be looked at as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para21"><a name="09031256000371">There have been a number of U-turns, which I welcome.

I want to be reassured that we will no longer hear of heavy case loads for social workers. How can newly trained social workers do their work with heavy case loads and limited supervision? I really feel that we have reached a point where a lot has been done, but there is so much more to do. There has to be genuine commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para24"><a name="09031256000375">It is important to recognise that there has been substantial improvement in child protection in many areas of the country. The fact that we have more than 100 authorities that are good or outstanding is good news, but it is important to say that it is not yet good enough. It is no good having good practice in some or many areas. We want the best practice in all areas. That is our challenge and what Lord Laming drives us on to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para25"><a name="09031256000376">I must also say to the hon. Lady that there is a real commitment from central Government, not just from my Department but from the Health Secretary&#151;who was previously the Secretary of State for Education and Skills&#151;the Home Secretary, the Justice Secretary and others, to work closely with the national unit to ensure best practice everywhere. I take her point that we need to do more, but the new unit is a step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para26"><a name="09031256000377">On scrutiny, the hon. Lady is right. As I said in my statement, it is important that we open up the arrangements for child protection to wider public scrutiny. The local safeguarding children board should therefore become the watchdog for child protection, and it is important that lay members of the general public sit on that board. Effective and proper scrutiny of what is happening should be provided not only by the House but by local councils around the country. If we need to do things to improve that, and to improve training for members involved in scrutiny, we are happy to consider that as part of our work on statutory guidance in the coming weeks. That is the best way to ensure the fresh pair of eyes at local and national level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="90312-0008.htm_para27"><a name="09031256000378">I agree with the hon. Lady that it is important to focus on the training, progression and numbers of social workers, but also on their pay and morale. It is concerning that these days we do not keep social workers in the profession in the way that we keep teachers in teaching. That is partly because we do not currently have a proper way for social workers to progress and develop in their professional understanding without moving out of social work practice into management. That is why the advanced social worker status is very important.</p>

Lord Laming said at his press conference this morning that we must move away from a situation where the most junior member of staff feels the full weight of responsibility for child protection, and that is right. Front-line social workers deserve not only better support and challenge, but understanding and engagement from management throughout social work, up to director of children&#146;s services level.

 As I pointed out in my response to the Opposition spokesman, there is a widespread consensus on the importance of the Every Child Matters reforms in the 2004 Act, but regrettably the Conservative party is outside that consensus. As Lord Laming says, there is no doubt that bringing such services together under one local authority department has provided a more integrated approach to support children. It is clear that we have further to go, which is why we will ask the National College for School Leadership to expand its remit to support directors of children&#146;s services.

in respect of safeguarding children? Will he also answer the question that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) asked him about training and national leadership, and will he seriously consider submitting himself, his ministerial colleagues and senior officials in his Department to the training he expects others to undertake?</p>

 I was clear that supporting the training of leadership, management and front-line social work is a priority. I do not claim to be able to second guess that professional judgment and professional leadership, as these are people who have studied and have had experience on the front line for many years, but of course it is important that we at the national level play our proper role to make sure that local leaders and social workers can do the difficult job that they are asked to do. I would also say to the hon. Gentleman that it is important that we as a House recognise not only the challenges we face for the future, but the substantial progress that has been made since 2004. Lord Laming is clear about that, and all of us in this House should be clear about it today.</p>

 Does the Secretary of State accept that the best time to safeguard a child is in the generation before that child is born rather than immediately afterwards, by ensuring that when potential parents are babies, children and young people they have the appropriate social and emotional bedrock to be able to grow up and be parents? Will he therefore support alongside a late intervention policy, an early intervention policy, so that we not only continue to swat mosquitoes, but drain the swamp?</p>

 I am not sure that I am fully happy with my hon. Friend&#146;s last analogy, but I agree with what he says about early intervention and prevention. It is vital that that is central to the thinking of our children&#146;s trusts and safeguarding boards, and of professionals throughout the country. It must also be central to Ofsted&#146;s thinking&#151;and it is very important that Ofsted responds properly, as I am sure it will, to all the recommendations in this report. There is a real responsibility on Ofsted to make sure that it is also inspecting that there is sufficient capacity and leadership to have effective early intervention and prevention. As my hon. Friend says, that is, in the end, the only way to make sure we can both genuinely keep children safe and allow them to fulfil their potential.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Would it be in order for me to use this opportunity to apologise to the House, as I believe I may have breached the new rules on the use of Commons dining facilities in relation to political fundraising? I hosted a lunch for a leading charity in a Commons dining room on 19 October 2007. I have written a full explanation to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, asking for his advice and for him to take whatever action he considers appropriate. However, it is my understanding that he can neither give me advice nor investigate this matter at my instigation, and this may raise an issue that the House would wish to consider. I wish to acknowledge that although the new rules were not fully in force at the time, it was a mistake for me not to have taken proper advice at the time, so I apologise without reservation to the House for any breach of the rules, and I will place a copy of my letter to the parliamentary commissioner in the Library.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="90312-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="09031256000989"><ul><p class="tabletext">That this House takes note of the 30th, the 36th, the 39th to the 41st, the 43rd to the 49th, the 51st and the 57th Reports of the Committee of Public Accounts of Session 2007-08, and of the Treasury Minutes on those Reports (Cm 7493, 7522 and 7545).</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para0"><a name="09031256000428">As ever, I am delighted to open this debate on the work of the Public Accounts Committee. In January 2002, in my first contribution as Chairman, I said that our duty was to act as the parliamentary laymen and women who hold the mandarins to account. As a Committee, we retain a unique relationship with the civil service. We ask the questions our constituents would ask if they were in our place. We do so without fear or favour, and without political rancour, and always for a positive purpose. In short, we promote and protect the interests of taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09031256000429">In the subsequent seven years of my tenure as Chairman, I do not think there has been a more important time than the present to prod, press and pursue those who run our public services, to make sure they get the most bang from our buck. I do not consider us remiss when the loudness of our own &#147;bang&#148; startles the occasional permanent secretary. It is, after all, a milder form of shock than Voltaire&#146;s original observation that we kill an admiral from time to time &#147;pour encourager les autres&#148;, although judging from his occasional comments on the social background of those before us&#151;especially those in uniform&#151;the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) might, perhaps, not be averse to such a punishment occasionally being dealt out to senior mandarins.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09031256000430">While I am following a French theme, hon. Members may be aware that my views on the malevolent economic climate recently led one of our national newspapers to compare me with a great historical figure. Unfortunately, that figure was Marie Antoinette. I am therefore relieved that the word &#147;guillotine&#148; has a slightly different meaning in this place from that which it had in revolutionary France. I am bound to note, however, that spiralling national debt was one of the sparks that ignited the French revolution. I do not think it a party political point to suggest that our own growing fiscal predicament should spark&#151;indeed require&#151;another kind of revolution: a genuine upheaval in the delivery of public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para3"><a name="09031256000431">In a recession, the demands on public services grow, and in this recession the public purse continues to slake the seemingly unquenchable thirst of the financial sector. Even should the Government be proved right and economic spring begin to bloom next year, there will be no escaping tough fiscal choices. To meet the expectations of those who fund and use public services without adding to the burden of debt, we need more than incremental reform; I believe we need a Whitehall revolution. It is in this context that we consider the work of the Committee today. In my view, it makes our work all the more relevant and all the more important. Our recommendations contribute to reform; perhaps our deliberations can help to stimulate this revolution in Whitehall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09031256000432">I want to focus on a few central themes. Some unkind critics say that much of what is said by Members in this place is spoken with one eye on tomorrow&#146;s headlines.  <br>

However, when I say I want to talk about efficiency and financial management, I am sure Members will recognise that I must be motivated by more than the allure of an increased public profile. I doubt that this report will figure much in the tabloids tomorrow, but that does not mean that it is not important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09031256000433">I also want to touch on a third, more specific issue arising from the Committee&#146;s work&#151;how the public sector works with the private sector. Such worthy topics are meat and drink to members of the Committee and, indeed, to the Minister herself. True efficiency is about delivering more out for the same in, or the same bang for fewer bucks. It must be the engine of our Whitehall revolution&#151;at the top of every public servant&#146;s agenda. When people have to tighten their belt and watch the pennies, they expect the same from their own Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09031256000434">I acknowledge that there has been progress in parts of Whitehall in improving efficiency and the effective delivery of Government programmes. I believe that I am less at risk than some in seeing some green shoots here, although in this case they are of reform, not yet, I fear, of revolution. I am happy to celebrate&#151;we have mentioned this before but it bears repeating&#151;the example of the work to update Jobcentre Plus offices. Given that it is one of the biggest public sector construction projects the UK has seen in recent years, we might have been forgiven for fearing the worst, but this tough project was delivered on time and within budget. It is worth dwelling on why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para7"><a name="09031256000435">The project demonstrated the value of continuity in leadership, the importance of experience and the benefit of engaging local staff throughout a change programme. Members might think that I am attempting to lobby for them, or even myself, in celebrating the benefit of age and experience, but between them the senior management team that oversaw the Jobcentre Plus project boasted more than 100 years of front-line operational experience. They had all started from the very bottom, as clerical assistants. They knew how to run projects. There is no question but that the knowledge and savvy that this brought contributed to their success. We all know that the right team with the right skills on the right project can make all the difference. There is no need to throw endless sums of money at a project to make it work. What is needed is the right mix of experience and know-how, and, of course hard work. Whitehall needs to let those with the skills get on and do their jobs properly, and there is no reason why these projects&#151;even IT projects&#151;should not be run successfully.</p>

Does he share my frustration at the fact that the good practice that we do see in the PAC&#151;we do not see it very often&#151;is not shared across Whitehall?

system for offender management was published. That is another disastrous project. In answer to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, we can help. I went out of my way on Monday in our Committee to congratulate Mrs. Lesley Strathie, who worked her way up from the bottom of the civil service and ran the Jobcentre Plus projects that we have helped to launch into the stratosphere. She is now chief executive of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs&#151;an absolutely top job in Government. I think it is still the case that, with the exception of Mrs. Strathie&#151;I may be wrong&#151;there are no other permanent secretaries who have actually run projects. There is no great mystery about this. We should reward public servants for delivering projects on time and on budget.</p>

We have to reward civil servants who perform properly&#151;yes, even with bonuses&#151;and we have to be prepared to move sideways or even dismiss from their posts civil servants who do not deliver because, ultimately, the public suffer. In that regard, the intervention made by the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) was a very important one.</p>

 I totally agree. It is typical for civil servants to be moved sideways if there is some terrible problem that they have been involved with. However, I wonder whether, in addition to the rewards that my hon. Friend is suggesting, there is a much more structured way of improving in-service training and skilling for existing civil servants, and of improving the training of new civil servants, so that those already in-post can benefit while in-post from the skills training they clearly need, and the necessary skills can be introduced in the core training.</p>

 Yes, we need a much better developed training system for civil servants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para9"><a name="09031256000441">I have discussed the issue with Gus O&#146;Donnell, the Secretary to the Cabinet, whom I have great confidence in and who is trying to change the whole culture of Whitehall in terms of training and a more professional approach. We must create almost a convention within Whitehall that someone who gets to the very top as a permanent secretary who advises Ministers must have run a project successfully. That is what happens in the private sector. People do not get to the very top of the private sector in an industrial company simply by advising the chairman or the chief executive on policy; they get there by delivering a successful project on time and on budget.</p>

 Is not one of the lessons to be drawn from the roll-out of the Jobcentre Plus office network shown in the response of the head civil servant to the point that I made about the social origins of her staff? As page 17 of the Committee&#146;s report shows, she responded by saying that only one of the top 23 members of staff in her department had come from Oxbridge. This is undoubtedly the most successful department that we have ever come across in terms of rolling out successful projects. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that there could be anything more than a coincidence there?</p>

Unfortunately, my Committee has found that excellence across the board still remains elusive. Let us take one example&#151;the Committee&#146;s report on the Department for Transport&#146;s initiative to share with its seven agencies a central unit of corporate services. The project was dreamt up as an efficiency drive aimed at saving the taxpayer &#163;57 million by 2015. Sadly, what followed was an example at risk of ridicule, rather than a shining example of revolution. This &#147;inefficiency&#148; initiative managed to cost the taxpayer an extra &#163;81 million, and on occasion the swanky new system took to communicating in German&#151;not so much &#147;Yes, Minister&#148; as &#147;Jawohl, Minister&#148;.

 Probably, yes. Rather than obtaining the benefits of German efficiency, the Department for Transport lumbered itself with inefficiency in German.

 To be honest, I do not recall&#151;we have 60 sessions a year; other members of the Committee are here&#151;but at a guess, none, despite the staggering failure in project management. A project that was supposed to save some &#163;50 million actually wasted &#163;80 million. I think we were told, as we always are, that we are not entitled to pursue civil servants by name, and I do not think it right that we should. My father was a civil servant and I have a great sense of the ethos of senior civil servants. It is not for us physically to pursue, persecute and crucify them, but I do think that it is for the civil service itself to take to task people who are responsible for such a catastrophic failure.</p>

than it might have been otherwise. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) said, that is usually the way of the civil service&#151;people are never sacked, but sidelined. Traditionally, the deal in the civil service has been that people do not get bonuses, but they do not get sacked. It is a job for life, but people do not get paid terribly well. As a House, we have to think about the matter much more than we do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para13"><a name="09031256000453">The financial rewards at the top of central and local government are very high. Permanent secretaries earn a minimum of &#163;140,000 a year and their salaries can go up to &#163;220,000 a year, and many civil servants earn far more than that because they are on bonus-related schemes. The whole culture of Whitehall is changing, and perhaps the traditional way of doing things&#151;that civil servants are never sacked&#151;has to be thought about again by the Government, but it is for them to make up their minds on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para14"><a name="09031256000454">We looked at a project run by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and the nine grant-making organisations it sponsors. We found that it spent a hefty &#163;200 million to administer and pay out just &#163;1.8 billion in grants without efforts to benchmark the grant makers&#146; way of doing things against each other, or against other ways of working elsewhere, which we might have expected. The Department could have no idea of how other grant-giving organisations operate or of what the costs were. Ordinary times would require greater focus on efficiency than is evident from those examples, but today we face extraordinary times. I am concerned that, far from driving true efficiency in the everyday business of Departments, circumstances may be leading us to institutionalised inefficiency. Spending taxpayers&#146; money is what Governments do, but we know that spending money is the easiest thing in the world; getting something practical for it is much harder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09031256000455">We have seen before that it is easy to increase spending rapidly on a service. We saw that as we drew up numerous PAC reports into the NHS and the Rural Payments Agency. We make no comment on or complaint about the increase in spending&#151;that is not our job. Too often, the rush to spend has been unaccompanied by any insistence on improved efficiency. When new money is put in, the taxpayer is entitled to expect identifiable improvements in productivity on the front line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09031256000456">As the Government bring forward spending plans to try to counter the recession&#151;the Department for Transport is one of the bodies most involved&#151;we must be vigilant in guarding against waste, and we should try to ensure that the efficiency gains we have achieved so far are protected as spending increases rapidly. There should be a forensic efficiency assessment of every proposal to buy now what was expected later. Accounting officers should be certain of the costs and benefits of moving money around, and we expect to see evidence that they have adopted the most efficient solution, not leapt at the most convenient spending opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09031256000457">With so many pressures threatening efficiency, the public must be able to have faith in the savings claimed. The Committee has had to express scepticism over claimed efficiency gains in the past&#151;I put that point to the Prime Minister myself, in the Liaison Committee. Our 2007 report cast doubt on the reliability of 74 per cent. of the savings claimed. I am not going to go into  <br>

that again, and I have welcomed the fact that Departments&#146; claims will now be subject to the independent scrutiny of the National Audit Office, which is very good news. I am pleased to say that the Treasury has already promised to take into account associated increases in costs elsewhere before proclaiming efficiency gains. That is becoming more and more important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para18"><a name="09031256000458">As well as external scrutiny, the civil service needs far more internal challenge to how things are done&#151;a point emphasised by the recent National Audit Office report &#147;Helping Government Learn&#148;. In Departments&#146; thinking, the question &#147;Is this the best way to do it?&#148; seems only to arise late. One of the challenges for my Committee is to help to shake Whitehall free from the mentality, wherever it remains, of, &#147;This is the way we work because this is the way we've always worked&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para19"><a name="09031256000459">True efficiency will not be achieved without an ongoing revolution in financial management in the public sector. We have seen some improvements in that area, too. I welcome the increase in the number of qualified finance directors sitting on the boards of Departments. Today, I note at last that that includes the Department with the biggest asset base: the Ministry of Defence, which now has a qualified finance director&#151;we have campaigned for that for years. However, that should be set in the context of a general lack of financial know-how among staff, who are not finance specialists. It simply cannot add up that the financial skills of the people who spend public money are not up to scratch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para20"><a name="09031256000460">The Committee&#146;s report on managing financial resources highlighted the disturbing truth that only 20 per cent. of Departments base their policy decisions on a thorough assessment of the financial implications of their proposed actions. Departments will not get true efficiency unless they know the true cost of what they propose, and factor that into their decisions. It is all too easy to predict the results of that gap in financial skills. Things are better now, but in two successive years the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs budgeted to spend more than it had been given by the Treasury. Anyone with experience of managing a household&#146;s weekly account knows that that would lead to disaster. If, halfway through the year, a Department has to invest creative energies in juggling funds to try to stretch its budget, or to make cuts to its planned programme of work, that can only be counter-productive and harm the delivery of public services. I am sure that the Minister will agree that it is not for the Treasury to pull Departments out of the mire of their own making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90312-0010.htm_para21"><a name="09031256000461">My final theme reflects an environment in which revolution is already upon us, whether we like it or not. The days when the public sector designed, developed and delivered public services in splendid isolation are gone. Engaging with the private sector requires different skills and brings different risks. Public sector officials must have their eyes wide open to profiteering, and their commercial acumen honed by experience, especially in today&#146;s environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para0"><a name="09031256000462">It is not only in setting out the terms of a contract that we have seen problems. The Committee&#146;s report on changes to operational private finance initiative contracts showed that whether a PFI contract represents value for money for the taxpayer depends not just on the terms of the original deal, which is what we may have put emphasis on before, but on how the contract is managed over the   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="12 Mar 2009">

next 20 to 30 years. Unfortunately, we found that many public sector authorities are not doing well enough in managing PFI deals once they are up and running, and too often that is down to the familiar problem of a lack of commercial expertise. If one adds to that the results of an NAO survey which found that more than 15 per cent. of PFI projects examined are not managed on a full-time basis&#151;unbelievably&#151;the whole thing can start to look somewhat amateurish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09031256000463">In this case, as elsewhere, there are some green shoots. The Committee found much to laud in the Highways Agency project to introduce a better motorway communication system, delivering up-to-the-minute information for motorists. The small black cloud on this particular horizon was that it took five years to negotiate a deal that the agency had expected to be tied up in just two. But the agency was determined to sign the deal only&#151;and this is good news&#151;when it had set out exactly what it wanted at a price it could afford, and it successfully did so, which meant that it remained within budget and got the project delivered on spec and in good time. I do not know whether those involved went to Oxbridge, but they did it. In signing the agreement, the agency was also successful in passing many of the risks of the project over to the private sector contractor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09031256000464">Before I close, I want to take a moment to consider the broader implications of our reports for the scale of private sector involvement in public services in the current financial climate. In our last debate, I queried the level of debt being built up under PFI. It is staggering. There are 630 signed PFI projects, with a further 110 in the pipeline, amounting to hundreds of billions of pounds, but only last week the Chief Secretary to the Treasury announced that the embattled financial markets can no longer support these new deals, which is worrying, frankly. The Government will now act as banker to themselves, changing the balance of risk in deals, and with an uncertain exit strategy. Let us remember that the point of PFI was that we would get projects delivered on time and on budget, and that the risk would be passed to the private sector. We are now in an uncertain world. That is a sign of how revolutions have unforeseen consequences, and it will require the very best commercial skills to manage the risk to the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09031256000465">It is not for me, as Chairman of the Committee, to cheer or decry any particular measure. The Government have a perfect right to do anything they like&#151;well, within reason. However, my Committee will, I hope, continue to be the taxpayers&#146; conscience, reminding Ministers and officials&#151;should they ever need such a reminder&#151;that the test we apply is not simply, &#147;Can you spend?&#148; but rather, &#147;Can you spend wisely?&#148; I think that the work of our Committee is held in high regard, and that all its members would agree that we are privileged to serve on it. Our impact is the result of the hard work and commitment of all Committee members and I thank them for their dedication. In particular, I would like to thank the my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) who has left the Committee since the last debate. I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) who, I am sure, will bring much to our deliberations. As ever, I would like to thank our clerk, Mark Etherton, and the Committee staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09031256000467">I want to thank, too, the current Comptroller and Auditor General, Tim Burr, for his efforts and his support for the Committee during his tenure and for taking on the National Audit Office on an acting basis at a difficult time. Last month, the Committee held its first ever pre-appointment hearing in its 150-year history with the Comptroller and Auditor General-designate, Mr. Amyas Morse. Mr. Morse, I am pleased to say, will be the first ever chartered accountant to hold the historic post of Comptroller and Auditor General. I pay tribute to Nick Macpherson, the permanent secretary to the Treasury, Tim Burr and Andrew Likierman, the new chairman of the NAO. We have worked together to make what I hope is a good choice. The Committee had no hesitation in declaring its confidence in Mr. Morse&#146;s suitability for the role and we look forward to working with him from the summer. I hope that the changes in the NAO&#146;s governance arrangements will also soon be put on a firm statutory base and we look to the Minister to try to make progress on that.</p>

I believe that that makes the role of the Committee even more important. That role is not simply to scrutinise spending, nor is it solely to terrorise witnesses. As I said seven years ago, we do not want to be just an undertaker. We are, I believe, a practical force for good, trying to suggest how things can be done better. Taxpayers and officials both benefit when action is taken to give impact to our recommendations, when they are acted on promptly and when, once the Government say to Treasury Ministers that they have to do something, they actually do it. In our hearings and in our speeches in this debate, we can encourage the revolution in the delivery of public services that hard times require.</p>

downs, but now that I have been on the Committee a little longer it is possible to discern common patterns in many of the problems that we face. Each report is exciting and seeing that it is implemented is important and interesting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09031256000473">A common pattern emerges from the bunch of reports that we are dealing with today and from our work over the years. It is useful to discuss that. One thing that emerges, for instance, is the constant desire of this Government&#151;and of most Governments in the populist climate in which we operate, where every Government want to show that they are in command of the problems, that they are dealing with the problems as they arise and that they are responding to public pressures&#151;to change and to pull everything up by the roots and put it back again in a different order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09031256000474">That constant pressure to change causes many of the problems, because administration, proper financial controls and efficiency need a settled routine. Instead, we constantly change things. The Jobcentre Plus change commented on by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson), which was implemented by people who knew the business, who had grown up in the department and who had the skill to do it, has been very successful. Other changes have been a good deal less successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09031256000475">While we are chopping and changing, the constantly grinding Gershon process of efficiency savings is working away in the Departments producing other changes. Those changes are often counter-productive. We saw in the Rural Payments Agency the consequences of the Gershon efficiency savings. The agency had shed staff who were to prove vital when it came to dealing with the rural payments, which was a big change on a huge scale with which the agency was not capable of dealing. It had to bring back the staff who had been got rid of because of the efficiency changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09031256000476">We are seeing that problem now in the Valuation Office Agency with the argument about the business rates for port businesses. The VOA, which has been shedding staff due to the grinding away of efficiency savings, is effectively understaffed and did not carry through the necessary assessments of individual port businesses in 2005. Port businesses have been getting bills in 2008 and 2009 requesting back-payments going back to 2005, which they cannot pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09031256000477">The Committee does not consider the constant process of economies, cuts and staff reductions produced by the Gershon efficiency savings. We should consider it as an overall subject. We should consider not just the burdens of change that Governments introduce so regularly but the effects that the grinding down of numbers has on the efficiency of the Departments. There are spectacular examples, such as the RPA and the VOA. Indeed, in Jobcentre Plus there were plans to shed large numbers of staff later this year, but at a time when the recession is producing far more work in Jobcentre Plus, more staff now have to be hired.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09031256000478">The constant process of pushing staff numbers down and then responding to emergencies by bringing people back is a very unsatisfactory method of proceeding. The Committee could consider the process as a whole, and it is a common pattern that we need to investigate. The constant changes lead to gross inefficiency and they are not based on any reliable estimate of the costs.  <br>

For example, the 14-to-19 education and qualification changes that were examined in one of the reports have been launched into with no assessment of the costs. Local providers have been left to devise their own systems, sometimes in consultation with the industries concerned about what the qualifications should be and sometimes without consultation. Each provider is going down its own path with no overall estimate of the costs of the change and of what should be done financially to make it work effectively. A substantial change has been rushed into without adequate assessment and without the provision of funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09031256000479">We have produced a report on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Functions and agencies have been handed to DEFRA, but it has not been provided with the proper management ability, particularly when it comes to financial management. As the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) said, there is a dearth of financial experience and expertise in many of the Departments. The Treasury is trying to control things from outside, but it is the internal financial controls that are so important. In DEFRA, those controls have clearly been inadequate. It has been given extra agencies and functions and has faced crises that have led to increased spending, particularly those produced by emergencies such as flooding and by the rural payments fiasco. Those crises have resulted in haphazard economies and attempts to grapple with the situation without proper effective financial controls or financial expertise in the Department. Departmental change has to be backed by proper financial management, but we are not providing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09031256000480">The second common pattern that I want to emphasise&#151;unfortunately there is not much scope for doing so in the reports that we are dealing with today&#151;is the obsession with employing consultants. We employ them for every problem that comes up, and the resulting bill is enormous. Overall, it amounts to &#163;70 billion or more, but the assumption is that the necessary expertise is no longer available in the civil service. Matters that could and should be decided by advice from within the Departments concerned, and by proper planning by them, are now decided by consultants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09031256000481">The normal practice of consultants is to tell us what we want to hear. They wrap it up with statistics and managerial formulae, but they do not offer value for money. That is another common pattern that the Committee should keep an eye on.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the discussion about the use of consultants is often very general and that it needs to be more specific? Of course there are cases in which consultants have been used when they should not, but if one wants to build a motorway one does not consult only those civil engineers who are on the books. One hires them in when one wants to build the motorway, knowing that the rest of the time they will be employed on building a bridge in Saudi Arabia, or something else useful. Is that not a better way of using public money than employing people on the books full time?</p>

more experience or expertise than the Government Departments responsible for any particular service. It is the general use of consultants that causes the problems.</p>

 Where did my hon. Friend get his figure of &#163;70 billion for Government spending on consultants? For the record, the amount is &#163;900 million.

 I have remembered what I wanted to say. The hon. Gentleman mentioned that people in government feel more secure if they have a consultants&#146; report. Does he recall the case of the Criminal Records Bureau and Capita? Bids were made by Capita and PricewaterhouseCoopers, but there was a difference of &#163;150 million between them. The Department concerned commissioned PA Consulting and paid it &#163;300,000 for an assurance that both bids were compliant. They were, but that was because the terms of reference were drawn so loosely that almost any bid would have been compliant. Not only was that &#163;300,000 completely wasted, but it gave false and misleading reassurance to that Department.</p>

 I am dimly aware of that case. It casts a comic light on the whole procedure, but I am concerned about the rush to employ consultants without checking whether people in the Department can do the work. The problem is that we seem to need to reassure ourselves of the value of any change by getting it authenticated in a consultants&#146; report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09031256000491">We need tighter management, so that those firms of consultants that have failed, or whose reports have proved inadequate, are excluded from future contracts. That lack of control is another problem but, although I have spent so much time talking about consultants, it is not a matter that appears in any of the reports that we are dealing with today. I shall therefore move on, delicately and gently, to another common obsession&#151;the private finance initiative, which our Chairman mentioned in his speech.</p>

Schools for the Future, and others&#151;are crumbling because of the credit crunch, with the private sector no longer able to provide the necessary credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09031256000493">This is an emergency, and it is interesting that the Government have said that some projects will be paid for out of the public purse. In my view, that is what they should have done in the first place. In this country, the PFI amounts to a sort of outdoor relief for capitalism: we shove money into the pockets of the private sector, at no great risk to it or benefit to us. The one benefit to the Government is that the use of PFI keeps projects off the public sector borrowing requirement. If we had been willing to defend borrowing and accept a higher PSBR, we could have done everything more cheaply and efficiently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para23"><a name="09031256000494">However, PFI is a fact of life. Our report on it dealt with the need for proper project management in the service or sector where the contract work is being done. Again, the Treasury has failed to provide advice&#151;to local government, for example, or the NHS&#151;about how a project should be managed, or to ensure that a proper manager is in place to control the contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para24"><a name="09031256000495">When one looks at PFI contracts, one finds all sorts of excesses, such as the management charges that are imposed, for instance when a PFI contract is transferred to a special-purpose vehicle, or when services are provided. One of the more ludicrous examples was the charge for replacing light bulbs. How many PFI contracts does it take to change a light bulb? At the present rate, we might need another PFI contract to find out, but the imposition of management charges in an unsupervised and uncontrolled manner is a way for companies to extort money from a contract. The lack of specific management control by the recipient of a project, and of specific advice from the Treasury about how the project should be managed, is leading to waste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="90312-0011.htm_para25"><a name="09031256000496">That brings me to another common failing: the inability of Departments to deal effectively with business or organised unions and pressure groups. For example, the management of health service contracts for GPs resulted in their being made much wealthier, but there was no dramatic improvement in the service provided to patients. We are now trying to catch up by asking GPs to provide more services and to open for longer hours, but the contract should have provided for such things in the first place.</p>

Fortunately, we are now committed to dealing with tax havens and I am glad that the Prime Minister has made that a central issue. For many years, we have told HMRC and Treasury Ministers that the issue needs to be dealt with, and they have said, &#147;Very interesting. That&#146;s slightly shocking. Thank you for the information.&#148; We have gone away, and nothing has happened. Now, it will be a front-line issue. Jersey and Guernsey are already saying, &#147;Well, we are not tax havens. We&#146;re just rather nice islands, with a pleasant existence and a low-tax regime, so please don&#146;t call us tax havens.&#148; It is a big issue.</p>

What we came across in the report on large companies is that Revenue staff are comparatively underpaid and under-skilled in dealing with the large teams that big businesses and tax consultants can mobilise. They are always leaping one step ahead in developing new devices, and the Revenue is lumbering slowly behind. It now proposes to bring back retired staff and put them into service again, but the problem is one of building up the expertise, paying them sufficiently and keeping them, given all the poaching done by the accountancy houses and big business. It is unsatisfactory&#151;this, too, comes from the customs and excise report&#151;that the means of bringing in the tax are less well developed than the procedures for spending it.

We are making posthumous changes. We are successful in individual reports, but we need to look at the common patterns of failings that produce such reports, because it has become clear over a long period that there are common patterns and that they should be dealt with as a pattern, rather than as specific issues.</p>

That move did me absolutely no good in terms of my promotion prospects in the party, but none the less there is a virtue in being right.</p>

I have got a lot of time for the Financial Secretary; he is a rational, reasonable person, who always responds to the points made and never makes forensic, rhetorical or unnecessary points. He made one very good point in the context of this debate. He said that, in a time of recession, when the call goes out for fiscal stimulus and big public spending, it is more important than ever to get value for money for public expenditure, and he is dead right on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para7"><a name="09031256000507">The Government should see the Public Accounts Committee not as an occasional irritant, but as a useful ally, particularly in the eternal quest to get public money spent effectively. That can be done. It is not necessarily the case that the private citizen spends money effectively, as hon. Members will find out if they study any shopper&#151;my wife or whoever&#151;nor is it necessarily the case that the public servant spends money profligately. However, it is the case that public servant lacks some of the incentives that a private citizen has to husband resources. Perhaps that is where a theme comes into the PAC. We have all picked out that no one seems to suffer, particularly when money is spent unwisely or when there is simply a bad project.</p>

In many environments, not necessarily with that project, people seem to acquire bonuses irrespective of their actual performance or efficiency. In other words, there seem in Whitehall to be few disincentives for poor performance. That is our concern. Incidentally, there are not simply few disincentives; there are many expensively acquired alibis for poor performance&#151;they are called consultants. Now, as hon.

I was informed that the bulk of them are lawyers and that very few of them have pertinent experience in construction. I should have thought that Building Schools for the Future would naturally be a magnet for people with some kind of construction experience. However, I am genuinely far from believing that public servants do not want to get things right, and far from believing that they do not get satisfaction from getting things right.

eluded not just this Government, but many Governments, is the secret of encouraging optimum performance in public service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09031256000510">There is quite a good example in our report on NHS general practitioner contracts. Most people recognise that most GPs do a reasonably good job, but they also recognise that there is scope for progress. The Government and the Department of Health wanted GPs to work harder, more effectively and, in particular, proactively, so that we had a national health service that promoted health, and not a national sickness service that dealt with the problems when people suffered from ill-health. On the face of it, the method that the Department pursued did not seem wrong. In GP practices, good behaviours were incentivised under the quality and outcome frameworks. GPs were relieved of some of their load&#151;out-of-hours work was taken off them&#151;but the result of that plan was far from satisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09031256000511">There was a huge cash bonanza for practice doctors, but not, sadly, for the doctors employed by the practice or for nurse practitioners. That was slightly depressing; in a sense, one would expect doctors to reward those who had helped them to get the marks, the rewards and the funds. There has been a boost to preventive medicine, and I do not dismiss that altogether. Clearly, there are certain effects that we are yet to see&#151;there may be benefits to people having their blood pressure taken more regularly and the like. Unquestionably, though, one result of the changes was a rickety out-of-hours service. In sum, the quality and outcomes frameworks that the regime imposed on the doctors undoubtedly got things done that needed to be done, but to be absolutely frank, they also got things done that were simply rewarded. The Government were genuinely surprised by the volume of things that were rewarded that were done, and by the cost of that. When they got the bill, it took them aback.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09031256000512">What we are proving, I guess, is that micro-management has good and bad effects. One could say, &#147;Well, what would be the alternative? Should the Government just let things go on as per usual?&#148; Incidentally, I recently discussed with a panel of British Medical Association people what alternative they would have put in place. What they said is quite salutary and worth taking on board. They said that it is healthy to assume a degree of professional pride rather than venal self-interest. If we assume one or the other, we are likely to get it. If we assume that professionals will behave venally, after a while they will be insulted by how they are treated, and they will behave differently as a result. The people from the BMA said, and I agree with them, that professionals are not opposed to benchmarking, transparency or peer comparison; all those things work as incentives for good, professional practice and are probably sufficient in themselves, without duress. Professionalism is not to be equated with self-interest or an absence of self-improvement, and it is certainly not to be identified with that phrase, &#147;the producer class.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09031256000513">On the out-of-hours service, which we also looked at in our report, a different route was taken. GPs have been replaced by businesses, or the curiously named social enterprises, which are supposed to be slightly better than businesses, although I have never seen an adequate definition of a social enterprise. I refer to companies such as Serco, which is probably better known for running trains than for running aspects of the  <br>

health service. Those businesses are commissioned by primary care trusts. In other words, they are answerable to quangos&#151;inexperienced, recently set-up quangos at that&#151;which are answerable in turn to the regional health authorities or the Department of Health, but certainly not directly to the people whom they serve. As a result of the way in which the contract was set up, they were given insufficient funds, because costs were deliberately underestimated. That was done for a particular reason&#151;no one wanted the GPs to opt out and back out of the deal. The money was to come from the GP pot. Had the bodies taken more than was needed, or more than the GPs were prepared to bear, there would have been a problem. Across the country, the record shows that PCTs are now having to find extra money to deliver a satisfactory out-of-hours service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09031256000514">The result is unquestionably fewer tired doctors, but it is also more difficulties in communication between the out-of-hours service and GPs. As I have said, there are cost pressures on providers and PCTs, and we have, essentially, a more remote service. If I may make a constituency point, that is certainly true in my area, where much of what is happening appears to be driven by cost. The process has certainly not been consulted on, and it has certainly replaced a superior service. Current provision is failing to integrate with the previously excellent, but now demoralised, district nurse service. In other words, our research and our reports tend to show that throwing out the professionals does not necessarily increase efficiency, value for money or quality of service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09031256000515">I shall conclude on this point, because there is something that the Government can learn and are learning from it. A Hegelian dialectic is being played out in government. We once used to think that professionals and public servants do their best and should be left to their own devices to do their best. That was, in a sense, the thesis. We replaced that with the new Labour view that public servants need to be challenged, outsourced, bound to targets, incentivised, micro-managed, plugged into commercial values and, if that does not work, exposed to competition. That was the antithesis, so to speak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09031256000516">The evidence suggests that we may gradually be arriving at a satisfactory synthesis, where the public servants and the professionals simply need to have a structure put in place in order to see professional judgment and experience rewarded and encouraged. That is not what happened in the case of the doctors&#146; contract, and it is not what happens time and again, but anything that the PAC can do to facilitate that process is more than welcome.</p>

but the agencies for which that Department has responsibility. Increasingly, common themes emerge about which we have particular concerns, yet the same themes recur in subsequent reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09031256000519">We take a Department-by-Department approach, but sometimes one wonders whether there should be not only a cross-departmental approach but a cross-Government approach to the commonly recurring problems, some of which are systemic within a given Department, and some of which may be systemic within the functioning of Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09031256000520">It is easy to say that the workings of Government should seek to reflect the efficiency of the way in which the commercial sector works outwith Government. But having entered the House 17 years ago from a business background, including working for some years in a manufacturing company, I have learned that it is wrong to assume that everything that one sees put into practice outside this place can be transposed to the workings of a Government Department. That is not to say that Government Departments and those who work in them cannot learn a great deal from commercial operations in the areas where we have identified repeated problems, not least in the management of the Government&#146;s operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09031256000521">As a personal observation, when one comes into the House of Commons&#151;especially if one is fortunate enough, as I was in the early part of my political career, to be involved for a period in government as a junior Minister&#151;a big difference is that decision making is so much slower in government than it is outside. Anyone who has worked in a large corporation, as I have, or even in the small and medium-sized enterprises that we often pick as exemplars of how to do things, knows that the route by which key decisions are made is usually so much more transparent. It is so much easier to identify where the decision-maker is, and getting a decision to deal with problems or to initiate a project is so much faster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para21"><a name="09031256000522">It is tempting to say that decision making will inevitably be slower in government, because a legislature is involved; issues might require primary legislation for policy to be drafted, and the procedures of Parliament must be put in place before action can be taken. All those are self-evident reasons as to why things are slowed down. However, such considerations do not always apply, certainly not in respect of the National Audit Office reports that the Public Accounts Committee examines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para22"><a name="09031256000523">I venture to suggest that one of the ways in which the Committee could help the Government is to look more broadly across the whole range of reports that we produce&#151;within a given year, say&#151;and make recommendations in respect of the systemic problems and weaknesses in how various management systems operate. The Government could accept that as a means of resolving such problems across Government, rather than just dealing with how those issues have affected a particular project or report. Management is a broad concept, so in talking about it I should clarify the areas of management where the PAC reports could help. Previous speakers in this debate have already touched on those areas, and they are certainly issues on which we repeatedly touch in our Committee inquiries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09031256000524">There is the question of IT. So many problems have come from how IT systems have been commissioned, implemented and subsequently managed in practice. A previous speaker mentioned commissioning and whether consultants are needed. Whether we are talking about a procurement project, the commissioning of a service or a change in how an internal Government function works, before consultants are brought in it is important for the Department to be crystal clear about what it is commissioning. It may not have the internal technical expertise to know exactly what is required, and the appropriate consultant would be expected to help on that. However if something&#151;particularly something technical or complex&#151;is being procured, it is important that there should be access to people who can define the issues as accurately as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para24"><a name="09031256000525">In the broader sense of project management, and particularly as far as IT is concerned&#151;some IT systems used in government are particularly complex&#151;it is important to get the commissioning and procurement right. Before the green button is pressed and the work starts, it is important that the detail has been considered. Occasionally, I get the impression that the process is speeded up to fulfil a Government pledge or commitment related to policy. We can think of many examples, but I will not go into detail, although the Department for Work and Pensions and other such Departments have certainly produced classic examples. In many cases, it would have been better to have trialled a system for a lot longer before rolling it out more broadly, with all the problems that that involves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para25"><a name="09031256000526">There are many reports on the tangible procurement side&#151;not least, as others have mentioned, involving the Ministry of Defence. It is a sorry experience to have to look repeatedly at defence procurement and see not only the money wasted&#151;that is almost certainly one of the consequences&#151;but the difficulties caused for those in the field serving as military personnel when the projected procurements overrun. If such procurements overrun on time, they almost certainly overrun on budget. That goes for just about all procurement projects, whichever Department they are in. If there is a significant overrun on time, there is inevitably a significant overrun on the initial costings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para26"><a name="09031256000527">Some of the problems could be addressed if there were not only departmental but cross-Government examination of how the Government manage projects. We see in some of the reports before us fundamental problems that, although it is easy to say so with the benefit of hindsight, could have been addressed.

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para27"><a name="09031256000528">There is always somebody who is responsible for a project.

However, in any system of management, there is always somebody in charge&#151;there is a cascade system. I would be nervous of any system or project in which one could not readily identify the person who was in charge, whatever the level at which the project was being addressed. I say to the Minister that that is a fundamental point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para28"><a name="09031256000529">Of course, there are excellent systems in place to help with project management, but what is important is the combination of the people and the system.

how under-management, and not having somebody who is known to be in charge full-time, can cause problems to everyone else in the cascade needed to deliver the project on time, probably including external agencies. I know that it is an old clich&#233;, but I remember from a previous existence that projects overrun and become late one day at a time. If there is an overrun of one or two days somewhere in the process and nobody is alert to that or does anything about it, it is easy for the project to overrun by three or four days further down the track, in which case the overrun becomes weeks then months. As we have occasionally seen in our Committee inquiries, a project can sometimes overrun by years, which can have consequences for all sorts of important things associated with the project. In particular, as far as the Committee is concerned, such overruns affect value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para29"><a name="09031256000530">I suggest to the Minister that at a low level within Departments, when anybody initiates a procurement, commissions a service or makes any change that requires management involvement, there seems to be a lack of anyone asking what the consequences will be for value for money. That should be at heart of projects such as commissioning and procurement, but somehow they are all done before people look at whether there has been value for money, as though that is something accidental that is bolted on right at the end. That is the wrong way to look at it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para30"><a name="09031256000531">It is too simplistic to say that competitive tendering is, of itself, the answer. We have seen a huge lack of competitive tendering in some Departments and some projects. It is, of course, a good thing and should be done, but it does not necessarily guarantee value for money when a project is eventually delivered. All sorts of things can happen between a tender being submitted and accepted and a project&#146;s final delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90312-0012.htm_para31"><a name="09031256000532">There is much to learn not only for the outcome of the 14 reports, but for the Government. I hope that my colleagues on the Committee will forgive me for repeating points that I have made previously, but I find myself constantly asking permanent secretaries and others the same question. The time that elapses between the NAO producing a report, which the Government see in draft form some months previously so they have a good idea of any criticisms or recommendations for improving Government efficiency, and permanent secretaries appearing before the Committee means that they inevitably say, &#147;We&#146;ve got that in hand now. We&#146;re already doing that.&#148; Occasionally, I ask, &#147;Were you doing that before you saw the NAO report or have you done it since?&#148; Sometimes, they say honestly that they have done it only since reading the NAO report and at other times, as happened on Monday, that they were already alert to the problem and were doing something about it. It is not a bad thing if an NAO report acts as a trigger for a Department to take action to improve its performance. I say to the Chairman of our Committee that perhaps we should meet every day and get the NAO to produce more reports.

takes an NAO report to flag up the reason for a problem and the possible remedy. One hopes that it would be picked up internally and that the Treasury, witnessing repeated poor management, poor systems and systemic problems across Government, would initiate some sort of oversight and consider how it could help to alleviate some of the difficulties.</p>

 The hon. Lady is making a series of pertinent observations, which I think stem from her experiences in government as well as on the Public Accounts Committee. Perhaps one example of the sort of approach that she suggests is the creation of the Office of Government Commerce, which did not exist 10 years ago and was established precisely because of the continuing systemic problems with procurement that kept coming up, not least in front of the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee. That has led to considerable improvement in the structure of procurement and, increasingly, the outcomes. I hope that that will happen more in the future.</p>

 I appreciate the Exchequer Secretary&#146;s remarks, which are welcome. Being responsible for overview and able to initiate change in systems is important. However, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, initiating change once it has been identified is dreadfully slow.</p>

For a long time, schemes have existed whereby civil servants go to work in industry, and people in industry work in the civil service. That is a good idea but, by itself, it is not the answer. The PAC has been concerned about a matter that is now being rigorously addressed&#151;the lack of accounting qualifications among senior personnel in Departments, not least among accounting officers. It seems so fundamental that one wonders why we did not realise that it was a genuine problem some years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90312-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09031256000537">It is perhaps wrong to blame civil servants who have been asked to carry out a specific task for which they have not got the experience and qualifications, when it all goes wrong. I am not saying for one minute that they should not be rewarded for good work or that there should not be recriminations if people foul up, as in any other walk of life. However, the Government need to look at the changing skills that are required of the civil service and incorporate more of them into the initial training, particularly for those who enter through the fast-track system and whom one hopes will later become our senior civil servants. They also need to look at in-service training to ensure that we do not ask people to do jobs for which they are not equipped. When that happens, it is not uncommon for people not to know who is in charge. I am always nervous when I look at a situation and find it hard to identify who is in charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90312-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09031256000539">The work of the PAC is immensely important. The Government spend many billions of pounds and run vast public procurement contracts. Enormous quantities of our constituents&#146; money are spent. Ensuring that that money is spent wisely and without waste is vital. The work of the Public Accounts Committee, which is to conduct, in effect, retrospective audits, is all the more important precisely because Parliament no longer does its job of&#151;to use the quaint phrase&#151;approving supply properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90312-0013.htm_para4"><a name="09031256000540">Sure, we vote on estimates and Budgets and we have that ritual called Budget day, but that does not amount to proper scrutiny of how the Executive spend taxpayers&#146; money. Indeed, it took almost a whole year for some Members of this legislature to realise fully what was in one of the Budgets when it came to 10p tax rates. This House rubber-stamps Government expenditure; we no longer control it. This House approves Executive expenditure more in theory than in practice. As I read through the list of PAC reports, I reflect on how once this House properly scrutinised how the Executive use taxpayers&#146; money. There was once genuine scrutiny.</p>

 It is not my job to defend them, but to be fair to the Government, they are developing the &#147;line of sight&#148; programme, which will give greater clarity about estimates and how the Government spend money. That is surely a desirable development, which we can all support.</p>

<p><a name="st_o267"><a name="09031256000542"><a name="90312-0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="09031256001318"><b>Mr. Carswell:</b>
 Absolutely. I welcome any initiative from any part of the House&#151;this is a cross-party issue, not a partisan one&#151;to ensure that this legislature is better able to hold the Executive to account on how they spend our money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90312-0013.htm_para5"><a name="09031256000543">Once upon a time there was genuine scrutiny. Indeed, as some people may know, a war was once fought over the extent to which the House was able to vote to approve supply and Government moneys. However, this House has slowly but definitely lost its power to oversee how the Executive spend our money. The quango state, on which the PAC produces so many of its reports, is in effect beyond budgetary scrutiny. Retrospective audit on the PAC is pretty much all that is left.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90312-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09031256000544">Belying each PAC report and the National Audit Office reports on which we comment is a profound question: why is our legislature now so supine and spineless? Why is our legislature not able to do a better job of scrutinising how the Government spend money? Instead of conducting merely retrospective audit, why does this House not properly scrutinise forward spending proposals? The failure of this House to oversee Whitehall budgets properly makes the work of the PAC vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90312-0013.htm_para7"><a name="09031256000545">My second point concerns what I see as a pattern in those 14 reports. The PAC produces a vast number of reports. Each week, it seems, we produce a report. Sometimes, scarcely a day goes by when I do not switch on the radio to listen to the &#147;Today&#148; programme and hear my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) talking about one of the reports. It is great that we produce so many reports, but to what effect are they produced? We give permanent secretaries a hard time and we can huff and puff, but the waste and the catastrophically inept project management and public procurement continue.</p>

It has almost become a clich&#233; for the Public Accounts Committee to produce reports criticising such procurement that catalogue incompetence and failure, yet nothing happens. On the basis of my short time serving on the PAC, I suspect that there is a more profound reason for that failure, and it is this: when big government and big business meet, we get corporatism, and we find that taxpayers&#146; money is siphoned off for their convenience rather than that of the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90312-0013.htm_para9"><a name="09031256000547">If the supplier is constrained in any market, the seller is by definition allowed to set the terms of trade.

That applies whether we are talking about big defence procurement contracts or the Warm Front scheme: it is the same story, the same pattern of corporate government constraining supply.</p>

 I am and always have been a staunch advocate of off-the-shelf defence procurement. I believe that we do not have a choice between spending on the building and supply of British equipment paid for by the British taxpayer in the UK or paying a little less by buying overseas&#151;ultimately, it is a choice between whether we have the equipment or not. Too often we spend tax pounds on defence, which does not actually result in the equipment that our armed forces so desperately need. That is the price of protectionist procurement, and I am very much against it.</p>

 I personally believe that we could get better bang for our buck if we spent more of the &#163;34 billion that we spend on defence on buying the best equipment for our armed forces, sourced from wherever in the world. By buying protectionist equipment, we deny our armed forces the equipment they so desperately need in Afghanistan and Iraq. I have spoken in the House before about the high price I believe our armed forces pay for that. Protectionism may be in the interests of a few corporate suppliers and a few defence contractors, but it is not in the interest of taxpayers or, ultimately, of our armed forces.</p>

 It is not just a choice between buying American and buying elsewhere. As we saw with the Chinooks, we can buying elsewhere, but what so often happens in the Ministry of Defence is that our own civil servants then gold-plate it. As a result, eight Chinooks have been sitting on the ground unused for eight years. We made the decision to buy American; let us buy off the shelf and get them flying.</p>

To stay with the theme of defence procurement, if it had been possible for the PAC to recommend a P45 for the particular officials who oversaw the Chinook fiasco, I do not believe that it would have dragged on for so many years. For all the reports produced on the Chinook affair, I am not aware that a single civil servant has been fired, but I believe that some of them should have been.</p>

I believe that we need to give Committees like the PAC and others the power to veto or ratify departmental budgets. If we did that, we would be able to do something about waste before it happened, not simply pass comment on it retrospectively. Until then, in the spirit of the television shows &#147;Yes Minister&#148; or &#147;The Thick of It&#148;, officialdom, Sir Humphrey Appleby and the civil servants will continue to run the show, however ineptly. Ministers will continue to be little more than departmental mouthpieces, occasionally even apologists. The PAC will continue to fume, huff and puff. Unless and until the House has Select Committees with the power to oversee appointments and budgets in Whitehall, we will continue to produce excellent reports, but nothing will fundamentally change.</p>

 The work of the Public Accounts Committee is immensely helpful and constructive, and we do a good job.

I want to make all the usual comments about how wonderful the staff are&#151;blah, blah, blah. Everybody says these things. On occasion, we mean them.

It is entirely possible for us to ensure that we make criticisms of the Government and how the machinery works without lapsing over into simply using those criticisms to gain party political advantage. We have not always managed that, although it is all too easy for some to see any criticism whatever of the Government as partisan and something that ought to be opposed.</p>

of their comments. That perhaps took things to an extreme, but it is possible to be extremist in the other direction. That means identifying every error in the Government procurement machinery as an opportunity to argue that the policy itself is invalid, inappropriate or incorrect.

 I was going to restrict myself from that particular area. I do not take the view that attitudes to the royal household are a party political matter. While this is an immensely valuable opportunity for us to raise those matters of value for money&#151;those who have been paying attention may have identified my views&#151;I do not see the issue as central.

In particular, I pay tribute to Opposition Members, who could easily lapse into making that mistake, and to the Chairman, who has in general managed to avoid that difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="90312-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09031256000564">However, we face genuine problems in how we present criticisms of the Government and the language that we use. Many of our arguments about how Government procurements or decisions have been progressed are quite complicated and in many ways quite dull. They do not provide a soundbite or a snippet, whether for the &#147;Today&#148; programme or something else. There is always a balance to be struck between being inflammatory to attract attention&#151;if people do not do that, they do not get any coverage&#151;and being worthy and boring, and therefore not achieving very much.

One of my favourites has been referred to, and I am glad that it is a growing interest of some other Members, who obviously spot a dripping roast when they see one. I have also been particularly interested in the social origins of senior members of the civil service and other Government Departments. We all welcomed the information from the Ministry of Defence that the Army has the worst record in this regard, with about 90 per cent. of top generals coming from that narrow band of educational experience&#151;public school, and mostly Oxbridge as well, if I remember correctly.

I remember receiving an astonishing response relating to the shared services centre being set up by the Department for Transport for the Department and its agencies. At the time when we investigated the matter, the establishment of the centre, which had originally been going to save us  <br>

&#163;57 million, was going to cost us &#163;81 million. The Department told us that it would not actually cost us that amount, because it would take action to reduce the figure. No one was dismissed as a result; I believe that people moved on. The point has already been made about careers possibly being slightly blighted, but there was not the degree of accountability to which others have referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90312-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09031256000578">Another issue that interested me was the NHS pay modernisation scheme, when GPs&#146; mouths were stuffed with gold. As the debate proceeded, what was increasingly noticeable was the contrast between the extent to which partners in general practices had hoovered up as much of the available money as they thought they could possibly get away with, and the amount that they were giving to their staff. If I remember correctly, the salaried GPs received 3 per cent. increases over a period of two years&#151;although it may have been one&#151;while some nurses&#146; salaries actually fell. As far as I know, those facts were not picked up anywhere else in the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90312-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09031256000579">In the light of those examples, I have some sympathy with the views of the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) about the need to hold the Government to account. However, some of his statements have led me to conclude that he is a true zealot when it comes to open markets. I see that he takes that as a compliment, but I have not finished my point yet. He confessed that he would be perfectly happy to see shipyard orders going abroad and believed that all British defence orders should be opened up to international competition, notwithstanding the impact that that would have on jobs in the United Kingdom. His clear expression of that view gives us some understanding of why he speaks from the Back Benches rather than the Front Bench. I am quite sure that it is not the view that will be expressed shortly by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands), although I will happily give way to him if he wishes to assure us otherwise.</p>

 I do not believe that protectionist procurement necessarily leads to that result. All the evidence that we have received over a period in relation to urgent operational requirement contracting suggests that British defence industries can respond speedily in providing equipment when it is needed urgently by our forces in the front line, and when that has not been possible, the Government have always been perfectly willing to go abroad to pursue the very point that the hon.

I have no doubt that we would have been able to buy some of the ships that we have more cheaply had we bought them abroad, but that would have destroyed our capacity to purchase them in the United Kingdom in the future. There is always a balance to be struck between savings now and retaining capacity for the future, which is what the defence industrial strategy is all about&#151;but I am happy to let the hon.

 Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that one reason why there has been such a big increase in the use of urgent operational requirements to procure is precisely that the armed forces find that by procuring through urgent operational procurements they are free from any of the protectionist constraints inherent in the defence industrial strategy?</p>

<p><a name="st_o284"><a name="09031256000585"><a name="90312-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="09031256001335"><b>Mr. Davidson:</b>
 No, that is not my view. Most of the urgent operational requirement contracts have arisen because the armed forces are in new environments and they discover that they have urgent operational requirements for particular pieces of equipment. They did not envisage having an urgent operational requirement for a piece of equipment until they found that they needed it, otherwise it would have been in the system already. I know from provision made from plants in my constituency that the forces have been genuinely astonished about what they found they needed, as they thought they had equipment that was entirely satisfactory. As I am sure we are all aware, the stuff that is necessary for fighting on the north German plain is not necessarily the same stuff that is needed for fighting in the mountains of Afghanistan; even some of the materiel that was necessary for Iraq is not adequate for Afghanistan. Therefore, it is changes of environment that produce urgent operational requirements; I would have thought that was blindingly obvious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90312-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09031256000586">Let me return to the point about the hon. Gentleman being a zealot and joining the PAC as a member of the Tory Taliban. There is an issue to do with the extent to which Members sit on the Committee to paddle their own canoes and pursue their own private obsessions&#151;the extent to which they are there to judge whether a Government decision was right in the first place&#151;and the extent to which they are there to judge whether that decision, having been made, has been implemented correctly. It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman has got himself on the wrong side of that balance. It is not our job as PAC members to decide whether these contracts should have been thrown open to competition across the world; it is our job to decide, the Government having made such decisions, whether a contract has been implemented as speedily, accurately and well as it should have been. I look forward to the PAC Chairman ruling the hon. Gentleman out of order on a number of occasions in future, since the Chairman&#146;s predecessor did that often enough to me&#151;in another direction, politically speaking.</p>

That was most clearly expounded when we were discussing the management of expenditure in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It was revealed that the culture in some sections of the Department was always to assume that they would underspend, and that therefore they could over-order on the basis that there would then be a rough balancing-out. That is very much a case of amateur night, and is entirely indefensible. Should not the Treasury have been pursuing that, as I presume that it is the Department that supervises such matters&#151;when it is not covering up whether or not it knows whom it employs and what their educational qualifications and social backgrounds are? Perhaps the PAC ought to return to such questions of culture in a more systematic way. I very much welcome the fact that the Chairman  <br>

has been taking us down the road of undertaking thematic explorations, in particular in relation to project management. Once we have made more progress on that, we ought to pursue the issue of changing culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90312-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09031256000588">I shall now turn to the report, &#147;Meeting needs? The Offenders&#146; Learning and Skills Service&#148;. It was revealed that in some policy areas there is a lack of provision and of delivery of service. We ought to have some system of passing that on to the appropriate committee. It is not our job to pursue the extent to which there continues to be a low level of literacy and numeracy among prisoners, or the extent to which the Prison Service&#146;s need to move people around the estate means that their opportunities to learn are constantly disrupted. It is perhaps our job to identify that difficulty, but I am not quite clear what the mechanism then is for the concerns that we identify and express to be passed on to someone else, and for us to be sure that they are picking them up. Select Committees focus on major issues, and relatively small issues such as that might be swept up in an overall look at the Prison Service, for example, or at adult literacy. The question of the balance between moving prisoners around the system and the education and training opportunities that we offer them does not then get picked up on. I wonder whether the Chairman of the Committee could reflect on that and provide some possible solutions for the future.</p>

We heard the long litany of what I regarded as exploitation of the system by barristers, who were clearly bleeding the system white. That reminds us that being involved with the private sector is not always a route toward enhanced efficiency. Some elements of the private sector are in many ways far more inefficient and self-serving, and far less controllable or demonstrably operating in the public interest than sections of the public sector. There is the assumption that says, &#147;Private good, public bad&#148;. Anyone who looks at the way that barristers operate&#151;simply gouging the public sector&#151;cannot doubt for a moment that there is a very strong argument for such sections to be examined more fully by us.</p>

 In that particular case, was not the problem that the department did not get the fees agreed with barristers in advance? Rather, it waited until afterwards, without any idea of what the bill was going to be. So although I agree with the hon. Gentleman that barristers made a lot of money out of that, at the heart of the report is the view that the department was at fault.</p>

 I have some sympathy with that perspective, but it is a bit like saying that the foxes will always raid the hen coop and it is the farmer&#146;s fault if he does not fence in the chickens. If the premise is that barristers are generally thieves&#151;that, given any opportunity, they will lift the silver, that they cannot be trusted to bill fairly, and that therefore it is the fault of the department in question if it has not nailed them down beforehand&#151;then yes, that is fair.

I started the day reeling under the impact of the National Offender Management Service information system report published by the NAO. Although that report is outside the scope of this debate, as we have not even had a hearing on it, many of its themes are relevant not only to the reports before us today, but to the Committee&#146;s work in general. The National Audit Office, together with the Office of Government Commerce, agreed in 2002 a list of eight of the most common causes of project failure. The first was the lack of a clear link between the project&#151;whatever it was&#151;and the organisation&#146;s key strategic priorities, including agreed measures of success. The second was a lack of clear senior management and ministerial ownership and leadership&#151;we certainly saw that in the case of the Rural Payments Agency, and in that of the shared services report from the Department for Transport. The third was a lack of effective engagement with stakeholders&#151;we have seen that in many reports. The fourth was a lack of skills and a proven approach to project management and risk management. The fifth was too little attention to breaking down the development and implementation of projects into manageable steps. The sixth was that the evolution of proposals were driven by the initial price, rather than by considerations of longer-term value for money, especially the delivery of business benefits. The seventh was a lack of understanding of and contact with the supply industry at senior levels of the organisation, and the eighth was a lack of an effective project team working with the clients, supply team and supply chain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90312-0014.htm_para15"><a name="09031256000607">The report published this morning happened to touch on almost all those factors, in full or in part, but they are common themes we see again and again in different reports. One thing that I hope the Minister will find time to do is to address the role of the Office of Government Commerce in scrutinising and challenging the management of Government projects and in ensuring that Departments are steering projects properly, because I do not think that there is nearly enough evidence to convince us that the system is working properly. The OGC gives advice, for sure, but time and again that advice is put to one side or ignored.</p>

the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West described as being seen to be rather dull in some cases, but which are incredibly important for the successful delivery of projects&#151;are tattooed on the eyelids of new entrants to the civil service so that they understand as they join that effective project management and focusing on outcomes are important from that moment on. They need to understand that the civil service is not only about policy advice but, as the Committee Chairman said earlier, about successfully delivering projects. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90312-0014.htm_para17"><a name="09031256000609">Our report on the roll-out of Jobcentre Plus speaks on that theme. As was mentioned earlier, the key staff included Mrs. Lesley Strathie, who is now chief executive of HMRC and who started as a clerical assistant in 1974. I was very pleased, as it was a point that I made in the Committee, that one of the recommendations of our report noted the need to focus on the fact that key leadership roles should be taken by people with significant front-line experience who had started at the bottom. The three witnesses had a total of 112 years of experience between them, and because they had started at the bottom, as the poor bloody infantry, they were going to ensure that no project was imposed in a way that could not work at grass-roots level. That was welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="90312-0014.htm_para18"><a name="09031256000610">That goes back to the Fulton report and the way its proposals were eventually defeated by William Armstrong, who was then head of the civil service, ensuring that the generalist stream of the civil service remained on top. That has been a 30 or 40-year failure across successive Governments, and I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s comments on it. I think we are now getting a little more expertise. I always read the CVs of our witnesses, and more and more of them come from the private sector, or have at least some private sector background, which is interesting.

David Green, QC, was hired to be director of the prosecutions office, not because he had management experience or knew how to run a budget or how to procure and deliver an IT system, but because he was one of the leading criminal barristers in this country specialising in Revenue work. That was an ideal background for somebody to become director of the Revenue and Customs prosecutions office. He is a leading silk in his area, but that does not mean that the Treasury or civil service, in giving him the responsibilities of an accounting officer, which include ensuring that there is probity in the use of public money and that the proper systems are in place, can assume that a man who is extremely talented in his field will have the requisite expertise in what one might call general management. I asked Mr. Green whether he was familiar with the Treasury document on the responsibilities of an accounting officer, and he said that he had been given it and that he had been on a training course. I asked how long the training course had lasted, and he said, &#147;Half a day.&#148;</p>

Perhaps it is a consequence of the fact that more people from different backgrounds are coming in from outside the civil service, but it is something that it is important to bear in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09031256000613">Finally, I want to focus on the comments made by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) about the use of consultants. A lot of flannel is talked about this subject. I have an interest, in that many years ago&#151;in the mid-1990s, when there was a Conservative Government&#151;I was employed for two years by the trade body representing the consulting industry. I remember someone who worked for one of our member firms saying that he was looking forward to a Labour Government being elected, because that would mean more work for consultants. I asked why that would be, and was told that consultants always get more work whenever there is change. Of course, there has been a great deal more work for consultants since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09031256000614">The public sector needs to be very careful about when it uses consultants. Of course, consultants have been used for a variety of purposes in many of the reports before us. We should not dismiss the possibility of  using them, but nor should we assume that we must use them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09031256000615">There are three classic reasons for using consultants&#151;first, because they have an expertise unavailable elsewhere: secondly, because a temporary shortage needs to be filled on an interim basis; and thirdly, because an independent view is required. Those three reasons always apply in the commercial or private sector, but in the public sector one would hope that the independent view came more often from the civil service. However, the knee-jerk tendency that emerged under the previous Conservative Government, and which has continued under this Government, is to reach for consultants. That is because they provide an external and apparently independent endorsement of something that Ministers do not have the confidence to take forward solely on the basis of civil service advice.</p>

We must be very careful about that, but we must also recognise that there are plenty of occasions&#151;and I mentioned the building of motorways&#151;when one would want to employ someone on a temporary rather than permanent basis. When we do that, however, we must make sure that the proper skills are transferred.</p>

In the negotiations that have to take place, a big company can tell the Government that it is able to put 1,000 people on the project, with the result that civil servants are reassured that it has the necessary clout.</p>

There is almost a kind of oligopoly at work, and if we are not careful it can shut out the smaller and more agile suppliers that may be able to provide taxpayers with much better value for money.</p>

Future, which raises another issue about consultancy, on which I will finish. We had that hearing only a few months ago, so the issue is not yet before us in a Treasury minute. The average salary of the employees of Building Schools for the Future is &#163;85,000, which is pretty high. It has 111 employees. Hon. Members might think that the reason why they have high salaries&#151;indeed, this is the reason given&#151;is that they are all specialists and therefore such salaries are needed to attract them.</p>

Yet since that body has been established, it has spent nearly &#163;6 million on consultancy. In the past year alone, it has spent &#163;750,000 on consultants and, when asked about that, those involved said, &#147;Oh, that&#146;s mostly for lawyers.&#148; Why are the schemes so complex that people cannot bid for them without enormously thick contracts? The average cost of bidding for a Building Schools for the Future contract is about &#163;1 million, which, admittedly, is a lot less than the cost of bidding for a PFI hospital, at &#163;11 million, but that goes back to the point about oligopoly&#151;people are possibly being shut out, and the Government, on behalf of taxpayers, must always be aware of that.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to respond to this afternoon&#146;s debate, which has been of extremely high quality, and to pay tribute to the work of the Public Accounts Committee and its scrutiny of public finances. The debate has provided ample evidence of the value of that work, which is spread across a pretty dauntingly wide field, as shown by the reports. It has also provided an opportunity to hear from its estimable Chairman&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)&#151;whose opening remarks provided an impressive analysis of the lessons to be learned from the reports.</p>

very proud of their public accounts committees. Many Commonwealth countries have sought to adapt their parliamentary systems over time. Nigeria, for example, has moved to a presidential model, with a Senate and a House, and Ghana has introduced primary elections and a President. However, both proudly retained their public accounts committees. In the Nigerian Senate, the public accounts committee there ranks after only a very busy ethics committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09031256000632">When I was in Ghana last month, I gave a training course to the excellent centre-right party, the New Patriotic party, which has just entered opposition after eight years in government. Ghana is now setting the pace for Africa, having made a second transition from one democratically elected Government to another. During my training course, I asked the assembled new MPs whether they could list the benefits of being in opposition, and one of the very first responses was, &#147;Now at least we control the public accounts committee.&#148; That goes to show to what extent our Westminster Committee has provided the model for many public accounts committees across the world. It is the model for similar committees in Canada, India, Hong Kong and other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09031256000633">In his speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough set the debate in its proper context. The Government&#146;s fiscal position is precarious and worsening. It is imperative that we find better and more efficient ways to provide public services if, as he said, the expectations of those who fund and use them are to be met. I noted with interest his appeal for revolution. He may not think of himself as a predictable revolutionary, but I can think of few more agreeable companions on the barricades come the reforms ahead. He was right to acknowledge that some good work is already being done by the Government on some of the issues that have been raised, if not nearly enough and not always at the pace that we would like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09031256000634">There is a danger in these debates&#151;and, I am sure, in the work of the Committee&#151;that we focus only on the bad practice that emerges from the pages of the Committee&#146;s reports, and ignore achievements and progress; that point was well made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson). He was right to say that Committee members should not be afraid to hold the Government to account; that is different from making a partisan attack. That sums up the attitude of the Committee. If I may say so, the Select Committee on which I sit&#151;the European Scrutiny Committee, which is ably chaired by the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)&#151;follows a similar approach. The Committee&#146;s criticism and probing is not necessarily taken as a partisan attack.</p>

Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) drew on her experience as a Minister and a member of the Public Accounts Committee in highlighting how slow and complex decision making can be in government. She urged that at the very beginning of the process, particularly for some contracts, someone should ask, &#147;Is this value for money?&#148; That is extremely important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09031256000637">My hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) followed a more thematic approach, and notably considered the role of the Office of Government Commerce in steering projects through once they are approved. Again, he focused on IT projects and the Government&#146;s pretty poor record in delivering on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09031256000638">One particular theme that emerges from the debate is that Government Departments need to elevate purpose over process. Too often, the best way to achieve a result is left unexamined, and talented people are forced to muddle on in the way that the departmental bureaucracy prescribes. That is not efficient, and it does not give value for taxpayers&#146; money. The lesson of the Committee&#146;s work is that there is far more value to be had for our money than we are getting at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09031256000639">I should like to mention individual reports. I hope that I will be forgiven for turning first to those that relate directly to the work of the Treasury. One of them is &#147;Managing financial resources to deliver better public services&#148;; it is one of those slightly vague-sounding titles, but I found it particularly fascinating. I thought it staggering that 60 per cent. of Departments do not automatically include a full financial appraisal when producing policy proposals for Ministers and board members. Worse, as other hon. Members have mentioned, only 20 per cent. of Departments produced a thorough assessment of the financial implications of a policy at the time when Ministers are asked to take a decision. The Committee report is surely right to suggest that that should be obligatory if Ministers and board members are to assess value for money. I am pleased that the Government have accepted that recommendation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09031256000640">We also learn that half of all boards are not getting information in a form that they can use. The Government indicate only that joint financial and performance information will be provided to &#147;a greater extent&#148;. I shall be interested to hear the Minister expand on that point in her response to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para22"><a name="09031256000641">Despite resource management improving, it is troubling that so many Departments are not getting proper value out of their balance sheets, and that 19 per cent. rate themselves as very weak in that area. The Government need to do more to ensure that failing programmes are not allowed to stagger on consuming funds, but are wound up promptly and efficiently instead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para23"><a name="09031256000642">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough on a notable success that the Committee has had under his chairmanship. I refer to his campaign to make sure that all finance directors are financially qualified. I understand that fewer than half had a relevant qualification when he began raising the issue five years ago, but that now we are approaching 100 per cent. That is robust common sense, and I hope the Committee has equal success with its recommendations for adequate financial training for other staff as well.</p>

with the situation that would have pertained if the council had continued increasing the tax take at the same rate that it inherited. What the House might not know is that the council has managed to reduce its work force by some 18 per cent. in three years through efficient management and the contracting out of services. I do not believe that a single employee has been sacked, other than a set of political advisers. I am sure that if the PAC were constitutionally able to do so, it would benefit from receiving the same presentation, as would Treasury Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para26"><a name="09031256000645">At the same time, the Audit Commission has increased the rating for my council&#146;s services to a maximum 4 stars in its comprehensive performance assessment, and resident satisfaction with council services has increased from 53 per cent. to 64 per cent. in just two years. That shows that it is perfectly possible to get more while spending less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para27"><a name="09031256000646">On the subject of PFI projects, the ground has, of course, shifted somewhat since the Public Accounts Committee produced its recommendations, given the Government bail-out of projects in recent weeks. I am not sure whether I understood the points made by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) when he described PFI as outdoor relief for capitalism. A number of Committee members made various points about the report, including the Chairman about the lack of financial expertise on PFI projects and the ongoing discipline in monitoring the deal during the life of the project, which is so necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para28"><a name="09031256000647">With reference to the Committee&#146;s excellent report, I was particularly struck by the number of projects that were not subject to competitive tendering. Only 29 per cent. of the projects worth more than &#163;100,000 were tendered, and I would be interested to hear in the Government&#146;s response whether and how they will seek to raise that percentage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para29"><a name="09031256000648">A number of Members mentioned the report on DEFRA. I found the lack of expenditure controls in DEFRA pretty frightening. The point was mentioned by the Chairman and by the hon. Members for Great Grimsby and for Glasgow, South-West. The findings were that the Department had poor contingency planning and an absence of a culture of tight financial management. Moreover, the Department has had budget problems for two years running, and little seems to have been rectified since the 2006-07 budget outturn. The Committee also pointed to an unwillingness to tackle budgetary problems within the Department&#146;s management board. This is pretty damning stuff, and again I would welcome the Minister&#146;s comments on whether DEFRA has corrected those faults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para30"><a name="09031256000649">On the Jobcentre Plus network report, all hon. Members have been affected by the closure programme. Many of us, like the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, initially found it odd that the Government decided to close half of the country&#146;s jobcentres at a time of rising unemployment. The national claimant count in January was some 1.97 million, up 483,000 on the year before. The claimant count in my constituency has risen as fast as the national average, even though I already represented more unemployed people than any other Conservative MP. Locally, the number of claimants has risen from 1,974 to 2,572&#151;up 30 per cent. in just one year.</p>

Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon), the Committee has shown its worth on the restructuring of the Jobcentre Plus network by giving praise where praise is due. It seems that the whole project is delivering savings of about &#163;135 million a year, although its break-even point will not be reached until 2012-13. Nevertheless, I would welcome from the Minister her views on the lessons to be learned from the positive aspects of the project and how they might be applied to other rationalisations in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para32"><a name="09031256000651">The final report that I wanted to highlight is about shared services in transport. That has made for less happy reading. The Chairman said that it was one of the worst cases of project management that he had ever seen. He highlighted its almost comical failings, one being that the new IT system started to communicate in German. Although it is a transport project with German content, it did not offer us any kind of Vorsprung durch Technik&#151;a point also highlighted by the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West. The project has been a monumental failure at a cost of &#163;80 million. Nearly a year after the scheme was supposed to be operational, it is still not functioning properly. The &#163;80 million wasted could have made a nice starting contribution towards building a high-speed rail network, for example. I know that that would be welcomed by my constituents, among many others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para33"><a name="09031256000652">To conclude, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said, the Committee is looking for more bang for the buck. Especially given our massive public deficit&#151;&#163;100 billion or more, and rising&#151;we desperately need more careful control over our public finances. My hon. Friend said that we must be vigilant in guarding against waste, that spending taxpayers&#146; money is what Governments do&#151;probably never more so than under this Government&#151;and that spending money is the easiest thing in the world, but getting something practical for it is harder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90312-0015.htm_para34"><a name="09031256000653">I congratulate the Public Accounts Committee and look forward to reading and commenting on, and perhaps even responding to, its reports in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09031256000657">In the battle to get maximum value out of public money, we all share the same aim. It is important that we highlight and reward good practice in debates such as this as well as pointing out where things have gone wrong. That gives Departments a much greater incentive to do well and makes them more likely to try new things without being too defensive in the battle to get value for public money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09031256000658">On the Committee&#146;s 57th report, the hon. Gentleman and many other Members asked whether any officials had suffered any detriment as a result of what happened in the shared services project and the propensity of the IT to converse in German. I understand that some officials were dismissed. Hon. Members expressed doubt that that happened, but I will ask the appropriate Minister to write in more detail about the aftermath of the pretty sorry tale covered by the 57th report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09031256000659">My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) made a characteristically enjoyable speech. He ran through a range of issues, including the current matter of the Valuation Office Agency and its port ratings. He made a rather overblown&#151;and, he admitted, personal&#151;estimate of &#163;70 billion as the amount of consultants&#146; fees paid. I was happy to tell him that the figure actually fell by 31 per cent. to &#163;903 million of Government spend this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09031256000660">The hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) commented, as an ex-consultant, that not all consultancy spending is bad and that some of it can in fact be very productive. He made the accurate comment that consultants are sometimes engaged out of confidence and a well focused approach to procurement and project management, and sometimes as a crutch to shore up confidence in a rather false way. It is important that we continue to make progress on the use of consultants and ensure that they are used appropriately and because they are needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09031256000661">The Office of Government Commerce has established a consultancy value programme, which is a cross-departmental, collaborative programme aimed at deriving greater value from our use of consultants. We have also implemented the recommendations of the National Audit Office and the Committee on the matter. That is one of the ways in which we have managed to achieve that 31 per cent. decline in consultancy spend. I trust and believe that because we have developed a standardised business case process, those approving consultancy spend can be assured that it is adding value. We have also introduced schemes such as skills transfer to ensure that there is not an unhealthy reliance on the expertise of consultants. I therefore feel that we are in a much better situation in that regard than we were a few years ago.</p>

 The Exchequer Secretary has mentioned 31 per cent. twice. Does that represent a decrease from a recent high or a decline over the course of the Government&#146;s tenure? Expenditure on consultants has dramatically increased since 1997.<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090401/corrtext/90401c0001.htm#column_8MC"><i> [Official Report, 1 April 2009, Vol. 490, c. 8MC.]</i></a></p>

 The figure relates to the last Public Accounts Committee and National Audit Office report on the matter, which was published in 2001-02. I make that clear so that hon. Members are not under the wrong impression.</p>

<p><a name="st_o306"><a name="09031256000664"><a name="90312-0016.htm_spnew2"><a name="09031256001357"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b>
 The organisation that we are considering&#151;namely, UK Government&#151;spends &#163;600 billion in total. Of that, they spend &#163;2.5 billion to &#163;3 billion&#151;0.5 per cent.&#151;on consultancy, which is less than many private organisations and certainly less than FTSE 100 companies. They probably spend considerably more than 0.5 per cent. on what one might call outside help. We should stop banging on about consultancy in an ill-informed way and try to analyse some of the problems with the management, procurement and purchasing of consultancy to ensure that what is bought is worth while, and that, if it is not worth while, we do not buy it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o307"><a name="09031256000665"><a name="90312-0016.htm_spnew3"><a name="09031256001358"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 I am not going to argue for more consultants from the Dispatch Box, but we should use consultancy services in government, when appropriate, and ensure that, if we use them, we get the best value from them and that they are not used as a sort of prop to allay individual project directors&#146; worries about whether they are doing the right thing. That is all we can do from the centre, and, to be fair, the consultancy value programme, which is driven by the Office of Government Commerce, has been doing that. I hope that that will create a position whereby we can be much more confident that consultancy spend is undertaken for the right reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09031256000666">Some of the hysterical media coverage that we get, which assumes that any amount of consultancy spend is wrong and a waste of money, is not helpful in fostering circumstances in which those responsible for introducing consultancy work feel that they can do it without being subject to public criticism. For example, the recent screaming and inaccurate headlines in the <i> Daily Mail </i>about &#163;7 billion a year spent on consultancy firms were unhelpful. I therefore agree with the comments of the hon. Member for South Norfolk about the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para8"><a name="09031256000667">A theme of the debates is that the Committee&#146;s considered recommendations about procurement, project management and delays in introducing IT systems have not been implemented and that, consequently, Departments repeat the same mistakes. My right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) made that point with some frustration in an intervention, and the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) returned to the matter more than once in her contribution. It is a source of frustration to anyone who has been involved in that aspect of parliamentary scrutiny, including me as a member of the PAC when in opposition and now on the Treasury Bench. There must be a way in which to ensure that best practice is spread more effectively and appropriate lessons are learned. Again, that is a matter of training, as the hon. Lady pointed out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para9"><a name="09031256000668">The hon. Lady also asked about skills training for the civil service. The civil service has the &#147;Professional Skills for Government&#148; programme, which gives high  <br>

quality training and is tailored, when appropriate, to provide procurement and project management skills to ensure the availability of the skills needed to deliver good value for money for public services. Again, the hon. Member for South Norfolk made similar comments, which I endorse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para10"><a name="09031256000669">On good practice, I was pleased to read the Committee&#146;s report on prison procurement, which was published only two days ago. The report demonstrated that the Prison Service has managed to implement a new strategy for procurement following a critical report from the Committee in 2003. The service has introduced a centralised and professionalised procurement team supported by five regional procurement teams in a new information technology system that was successfully phased in and that worked when it was turned on. As far I can tell, the system did not communicate in German or any other language apart from English.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para11"><a name="09031256000670">As a direct result of the Prison Service responding to the Committee&#146;s wide-ranging representations, the quality of goods and services procured has improved and &#163;120 million in cash has been saved over five years. I welcome the praise that the hon. Member for Gainsborough lavished on that example of successful change management. He is often on the radio criticising, and quite rightly, but it is important that he also gives praise where praise is due, and in this instance it certainly is due. I understand that the Prison Service procurement model is to be used throughout the Ministry of Justice, with the prospect of further savings. It is precisely that kind of positive approach and successful implementation that we want to spread throughout government at all levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09031256000671">That news also comes on the back of the positive report on Jobcentre Plus. That report was much commented on by my hon. Friends and by Opposition Members, particularly with respect to the observation that those who were responsible for implementing the successful changes in Jobcentre Plus had behind them a lot of operational experience at the front line, which they brought to bear on the decisions that they made. That observation should not go unnoticed by senior managers in the civil service as they contemplate what works and what is likely to increase the chances of success in any change project.</p>

<p><a name="st_o308"><a name="09031256000672"><a name="90312-0016.htm_spnew4"><a name="09031256001359"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b>
 I am delighted to hear the Minister say that that observation should not go unnoticed by senior managers. What will the Treasury and the Cabinet Office do at the centre to ensure both that notice is taken of it across the service and that active steps are taken to spot people with talent who have not come up through the fast-stream route?</p>

<p><a name="st_o309"><a name="09031256000673"><a name="90312-0016.htm_spnew5"><a name="09031256001360"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 I agree that that is precisely what needs to happen. At the suggestion of hon. Members at the previous occasion when we held this debate, I agreed to write to every permanent secretary asking them to look at the Committee&#146;s report on Jobcentre Plus and act accordingly. That is the kind of thing that I can do as a Minister who is not directly responsible for day-to-day management decisions in a Department. I also know that there is a great deal of awareness at the permanent secretary level of the success that has been enjoyed in this instance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09031256000674">I want to respond to the questions that the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) asked about the out-of-hours contract and the Hegelian dialectic. We had revolution from the hon. Member for Gainsborough and an Hegelian synthesis from the hon. Member for Southport. As always, this is an interesting time to debate the Public Accounts Committee&#146;s reports, and we are even adding a dash of philosophy just to keep ourselves more interested. The hon. Gentleman asked about the out-of-hours contract. He is right that the new contract initially pushed up GPs&#146; pay, but since then costs have been held back to achieve compensatory savings. More importantly, Health Ministers now have much better control of doctors&#146; pay. They commission services and get what they pay for, which is value for public money. Despite a wobbly start, the overall impact of the changes has been positive, now that there have been further shifts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para14"><a name="09031256000675">I welcome the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) as a new member of the Committee. He has been called a zealot by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson). The hon. Member for Harwich expresses himself with a great deal of ideological certainty and belief. I am sure there will be many vigorous debates and moments of conflict and clash on a Committee that is not usually known for that kind of approach. I know that the hon. Gentleman will enjoy his time on the Public Accounts Committee, as those of us who have been fortunate enough to serve on it in the past inevitably do. I welcome him for the first time to these debates and I certainly hope that it will not be the last time he contributes to our debates as provocatively as he wishes to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para15"><a name="09031256000677">My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West commented on the number of senior Treasury civil servants who have Oxbridge and public school backgrounds. I have to admit that I do not know the answer. I was interested in what my hon. Friend had to say about it and I will look further into the responses he received to his letter and see whether we can get him a more forthcoming one. <i> [Interruption.]</i><i> </i>I was just about to say that it should not be assumed that just because my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West has a particular view of people with public school or indeed Oxbridge backgrounds, there must be something wrong with those people. Speaking as an ex-member of St. John&#146;s college, Oxford&#151;actually, I am sure that one is a member of St. John&#146;s for life&#151;I certainly have many happy memories of it. <i> [Interruption.]</i><i> </i>Yes, I am sure that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) does, too, but perhaps the less said about that the better!</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para16"><a name="09031256000678">My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West raised two further points. He asked about the 40th report, which is on the management of expenditure by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. I hope I can reassure my hon. Friend that since the report was published, we have seen systematic monthly reporting of the Department&#146;s financial position to the management board and a new system of portfolio management through senior responsible owners of programmes. There is a refreshed financial management improvement project, which is delivering more effective and focused financial management across DEFRA, including of relationships with the delivery agents. Many might think that that should have been in place as a matter of course, but we can at least be relieved that it is in place now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para17"><a name="09031256000679">My hon. Friend also asked about the report on the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office. He is right that the system as described was open to exploitation. He did not complete the story, however, as the accounting officer has instituted a new system of control and achieved enormous improvements in efficiency in respect of public spending since that difficult start, which the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton also mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para18"><a name="09031256000680">The hon. Member for South Norfolk asked about the Fulton report and the appropriate balance between generalist and operational effectiveness and experience in the civil service. I suspect that this is a slightly less class-confrontational way of getting at the same issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West in his efforts to find out the educational background and experience of top-flight civil servants. As change management and the experience of delivering change in already complex existing organisations goes higher up the scale in terms of the Government&#146;s requirements, it becomes increasingly important for senior civil servants responsible for managing Departments in new and fresher ways to look into this balance. The hon. Member for South Norfolk has hit on an issue that ought to be thought about a great deal more than perhaps it has been. Settlements such as Fulton and Northcote-Trevelyan&#151;which is another, even older one&#151;still influence the civil service. We need to look at all those things in the light of the 21st century, rather than the 19th. He makes perfectly reasonable observations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para19"><a name="09031256000681">I want to say a few things about some of the more technical issues that have been mentioned, perhaps in passing. I am happy to announce that the last piece of the jigsaw in the Government implementing our response to Lord Sharman&#146;s report on audit and accountability in central Government is now in place. Hon. Members will be aware that, until recently, the Comptroller and Auditor General was not eligible to audit non-departmental public body companies, but provisions in the Companies Act 2006 clear the way for him to do so with effect from financial year 2008-09. There are separate provisions for profit-making and non-profit-making companies, but happily they are now in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para20"><a name="09031256000682">The Comptroller and Auditor General now has public audit responsibility for 26 non-profit-making NDPB companies. I understand that 24 companies, which are either profit making or have profit-making subsidiaries, have also agreed to come under the auspices of the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para21"><a name="09031256000683">I share the Committee&#146;s disappointment&#151;this is a point that the Chairman of the Committee brought to our attention in his opening comments&#151;that the implementation of the new governance arrangements for the National Audit Office has been delayed, along with the constitutional renewal Bill. However, the Public Accounts Commission has seen the draft provisions in near final form and the Treasury is ready to proceed as soon as a decision is taken on the Bill&#146;s timing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para22"><a name="09031256000684">I welcome other progress in this area, such as the appointment of Sir Andrew Likierman as the new chair of the National Audit Office and of Mr. Amyas Morse as the new Comptroller and Auditor General. The hon. Member for Gainsborough told us about the selection panel, which he chaired, and expressed his confidence in the choice that has been made. The formal appointment of Mr. Morse will follow, through a motion in Parliament. I am glad that he can take up his appointment on 1 June.</p>

The Committee gauged Mr. Morse&#146;s views on a wide range of issues. I note that he has ambitions for the NAO in improving the efficiency, cost efficiency and functional efficiency of government. We share those ambitions and I welcome the fact that Mr. Morse wants to work with Departments and the Treasury to progress that. Progress and a push from the NAO, as well as from the Treasury, have a good record in achieving change, which we all wish to see.</p>

I hope that that responds to some of the worries expressed by the hon. Member for Harwich, and it recognises the point made by the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="90312-0016.htm_para27"><a name="09031256000689">The proposals in the memorandum will result in a simpler system, with a single set of numbers, which is more transparent, more comprehensive and easier to use. It will improve public debate and understanding through enhanced parliamentary scrutiny of Government. I believe that the proposals are fully consistent with Parliament&#146;s wishes. We would welcome Parliament&#146;s agreement to the detailed proposal by the summer recess, so that we can start implementing the new arrangements from 2010-11.</p>

On behalf of the Government, I also thank Tim Burr, as the hon. Member for Gainsborough quite properly did in his opening remarks. Mr. Burr has displayed impressive abilities as Comptroller and Auditor General, not least because he took on the role on an interim basis pending the appointment of a successor. He commands the respect of the Government, and all in the House, as he has guided and led the National Audit Office through that period of transition. We need the National Audit Office to hold the Government to account, and Mr. Burr is courageous in ensuring that that continues. I wish him well for the future.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to spend three or four minutes thanking all those who have taken part in what has been a good debate. It is always pleasant to take a three-hour break from the normal partisanship of the House, and try to get to grips in a completely non-partisan way&#151;not mentioning the political debate at all&#151;with how the public sector works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="90312-0017.htm_para0"><a name="09031256000693">I am grateful to all those who have taken part in the Back-Bench debate, which was opened by my friend the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). He is such an honest man that when he came forth with a figure and it was proved wrong, he just admitted that it was his own concoction. I wish we were all so honest when we made mistakes in this place. He made a serious point that the trouble with Whitehall is that there is no settled culture&#151;not just continuous policy changes, but a continuous driving through of Gershon, which makes it difficult to get to grips with efficiency savings. His wise words should be remembered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="90312-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09031256000694">The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh), who is a valued member of the Committee, made one of the great understatements of the year&#151;that public servants lack the incentive of private citizens in husbanding resources. You can say that again. We do our best to try to help public servants to be just as good as private citizens in husbanding resources. His wise words about the GP contract will be engraved in the heart of any future Government in dealing with a powerful public sector trade union, which is all that the British Medical Association is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="90312-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09031256000695">I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) for her contribution. She made an important point about the problem of change continually recurring, and project management. We have made a difference, as the Exchequer Secretary mentioned, in trying to ensure that all finance directors are professionally qualified. I have tried to make the focus on project management a theme of my chairmanship. I believe that so many of our mistakes are made because we drive through change too quickly. I say to the Exchequer Secretary that we try to have a balance and give praise&#151;we are not just Jeremiahs. My press release on the roll-out of prison procurement this week was very laudatory of the Department. Where such procurements work well, they are delivered slowly, with piloting, and are not continuous changes. My hon. Friend&#146;s point about the need for more training is important.</p>

He reminded me of my early days as an ardent Thatcherite. All I can do now is go to bed with the collected speeches of Sarah Palin&#151;not a very thick volume. My hon. Friend keeps us all on our toes, and it is good to have him on the Committee. He made the point that when the oversight of Parliament has become so weak in respect of the whole budget process, the audit process is even more important. That is why the Committee&#146;s work is so important.</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. May I refer you to a written question in column 1124W of volume 463 of <i> Hansard</i>? It was asked on 25 July 2007 by the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who I see is present, and concerned the possibility of the Youth Parliament using this Chamber. The reply given by the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), who was then Deputy Leader of the House, stated that the matter would be referred to the Modernisation Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90312-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09031256000702">Although the motion that I assume a representative of the Government is about to move is not irregular in the procedural sense, it is clear that the Government have failed to honour the commitment that they gave the House, because the matter has not been put before the Modernisation Committee. I therefore wonder, Madam Deputy Speaker, whether you feel that it would be more appropriate for the motion not to be moved until the Committee has had an opportunity to consider the matter.</p>

 Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I have been a member of the Modernisation Committee since its very first meeting, in the last half of 1997, and I can vouch for the truth of what has been said by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight). The question of using this Chamber&#151;uniquely&#151;for a meeting of the UK Youth Parliament has never been discussed. I fervently believe that if the policy was that it should be referred to the Committee, and if that was stated by a Government Minister&#151;the Deputy Leader of the House&#151;that commitment should be honoured before the matter is put before the House as a whole.</p>

In addition, every single political party has found that the number of young people getting involved has fallen. One of the significant innovations in the past decade to try to redress some of these issues is the creation of the United Kingdom Youth Parliament. Those who originally thought of creating it had a brilliant idea, and it has made a significant difference on two levels. First, in terms of youth organisation in every constituency, it has led to the positive development that many young people are now actively involved in discussing the major political issues facing the country, instead of just going along to a youth club and playing ping-pong. It has given a structure for the National Youth Agency.</p>

 Can the Deputy Leader of the House explain the Government&#146;s thinking over the last week in putting this motion at the end of business, when it could not possibly have been debated? This is an important issue. Why was time not provided? Why were the Government forced, by Members objecting every evening, to have to find time?</p>

 Clearly, there are priorities, and although making sure that as many young people feel engaged in the political process as possible is a very significant priority for the Government, whether the Chamber should be allocated to the UK Youth Parliament is probably not as important as some of the issues that people were calling on my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House to allow time for debate on. However, there would have been debate yesterday if the hon. Gentleman and some other colleagues had not forced debates on issues that they then chose not to vote on.</p>

Unless I have been misled by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan), the shadow Leader of the House, the matter has not been discussed with him and he has not been consulted about it, because he told me this only yesterday.

I say to the hon.

 If the hon. Gentleman feels I have slighted him in any way, I do apologise; I would not ever want to do so.

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90312-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09031256000738">The important issue before us is that the UK Youth Parliament has developed a growing sense of self-confidence as an organisation, and many of the young people involved are from a wide variety of backgrounds, which has been significant in itself. It is interesting to note the breadth of backgrounds of the young people who take part. In the last Youth Parliament, 53 per cent. of its members were women, 47 per cent. were male&#151;obviously&#151;2 per cent. had disabilities and 21 per cent. were from black and ethnic minority groups. That is considerably higher than for the nation at large, and considerably higher than in this Chamber. In some senses, it was great to see when those young people were sitting in the House of Lords the breadth and diversity that was shown in that Parliament. Sometimes, I wish that we could mirror that diversity in this Chamber.</p>

 Can my hon. Friend explain to me why there was apparently no opposition when people from the Youth Parliament were able to sit in the House of Lords? Is that giving some primacy to that Chamber, in the sense that it seems to be more representative than this one? That fills me with alarm.</p>

 I was about to move on to the fact that last year, the UK Youth Parliament was allowed to use the second Chamber, the House of Lords. It was interesting that there was remarkably little opposition of any kind, in a Chamber that is often considered rather more hidebound by tradition than this one. The young people were really struck by the privilege of being able to do that, and took part with enthusiasm. The Lords Speaker, who chaired the debate herself, said:</p>

 I invite my hon. Friend to reflect on his exchange with the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack). The last recorded policy of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition on reform of the other place was for a 100 per cent. elected second Chamber. Are we to conclude that should there be a Conservative Government, and should there be a 100 per cent. elected second Chamber, the UK Youth Parliament would be thrown out and not ever have another opportunity to debate in that place?</p>

The first concerned recycling and their environmental campaign, which received 490 votes. The second concerned a national public transport concessionary card for young people under the age of 18, which received 425 votes. The abolition of university tuition fees received 252 votes, and they also considered the matter of fair and accurate representation of young people in the media, lowering the voting age to 16 and having one single age at which young people are deemed to become an adult. These were adult debates.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman knows I do not agree with him on this point. He advances arguments as to why the proposal for the Youth Parliament to sit in this Chamber might be beneficial to it and to the cause of getting young people involved in Parliament.

 I was going to come to some of the restrictions that I think will be important if this sitting were to happen, as we have not put them all in the motion. I have spoken to the shadow Leader of the House and I think it would be fair to put some matters concerning how the event would proceed on the record. For instance, I think it would be inappropriate for anybody other than Mr. Speaker to sit in the Speaker&#146;s Chair. Similarly, it would be inappropriate for the Mace to be in place. I think that the session should be chaired by a senior Member of this House as opposed to any other person. The normal rules of the House should apply in terms of parliamentary language, dress code, mobile phones and the one issue that particularly worried the shadow Leader of the House&#151;namely, whether students would be chewing gum or not. It is important, too, that the broadcasting rights would remain with us, as would control over how the session would be broadcast. The fact that the debate in the House of Lords was broadcast on BBC Parliament gave an enormous sense of occasion to the young people, which is something that could never be achieved in Committee Room 14, which is a far clumsier environment and in no sense has the same cachet and significance as this Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90312-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09031256000755">We would, of course, be able to ensure that access to other parts of the House was restricted so that all security issues were covered. As the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West has just said, this would be a one-off. If hon. Members wanted to return to the issue thereafter, it would be for them to do so. The other most important and significant point is that this would happen on a non-sitting day.</p>

 I do not think that this is a party-political issue. This should be something that unites all those who want to ensure that young people have an opportunity to take an active part in modern British politics and to value the British parliamentary tradition. All too often, the young people who do get involved in politics have nothing to do with that tradition because they are engaged only with single-issue campaigns. I think that allowing them to use the Chamber has a significant value, and I am certain that any referendum of young people in my constituency of Rhondda&#151;or in that of my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House&#151;would show them to be surprised to hear Members of Parliament say that only they can ever be allowed to sit in this Chamber.

 It need not be broadcast live; I believe that it was not on the last occasion. There are other issues, such as access and the use of any Galleries.

for the next decade on the subject. There is a point at which we have to stop consulting and start deciding. Perhaps one of the Government&#146;s besetting faults is that sometimes they consult for too long and do not decide sufficiently.</p>

 That is not unfamiliar when it comes to matters in the House, and as we keep on saying, it is unfortunate. I hope that the day will arrive when there is machinery to allow the various parties to be consulted properly about the business of the House in advance of its being placed before them. We could then organise our affairs efficiently and effectively, people could have time to discuss what needs to be discussed, and time would not be wasted on what does not need to be discussed. That, however, is a matter for another day; what I am talking about now is the opportunity for the UK Youth Parliament to use the Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90312-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09031256000829">I said that I respected the view contrary to mine. I do; Members should not be insulted or assumed to be an irrelevancy because they have strongly held views on this subject. They adduce two arguments&#151;neither of which I agree with, but which are respectable. The first is almost theological: it is about the sacred nature of the Chamber, and the notion that it is consecrated by its history and traditions and that nobody under any circumstances should be allowed to violate the holy of holies and sanctum sanctorum that is the House. I understand that position, but do not agree with it. As far as I am concerned, this chamber becomes the Chamber of the House of Commons when the Mace is in position, the Speaker or Deputy Speakers are in their seat and the House is sitting. I am sorry, but the rest of the time it is a building with great history, but it is just a building. There is a distinction between the House when it is sitting and otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90312-0019.htm_para9"><a name="09031256000830">The point is understood by almost every other legislature in the world. I am a Member of the British Parliament, but I have sat in seats in the Assembl&#233;e Nationale, the Bundestag and the Chamber of the House of Commons of Canada, which is similar to this Chamber. I have sat in the Lok Sabha in India and in a whole host of examples of the Sobranije or Majlis across eastern Europe and central Asia. There has been no intrinsic problem with my doing so. I do not believe that any one of those legislatures believes that its sovereignty or traditions were destroyed by my sitting in one of its seats for a few moments.</p>

Parliament will use the Chamber for one occasion and one occasion only, that will be the decision. If we decide at a future stage that it was a great success in building confidence in and understanding of democracy in this country among the young, as it was in the House of Lords, we may repeat the experience.

The people who attend that meeting sit in the chamber of Wincanton town council once a year.

In fact, the proposal has come not from the Executive but from an all-party Select Committee that includes the hon. Gentleman. It was agreed to without a vote in 2004. Recommendation 9 in &#147;Connecting Parliament with the Public&#148;, the Modernisation Committee&#146;s first report of Session 2003-04, stated:</p>
<a name="90312-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="09031256001004"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We believe there is a case for reconsideration of the long-standing convention that only elected Members of Parliament may ever sit in the Chamber, which is in contrast to the practice of many other legislatures&#148;.</p>

 I will give way to the right hon. Gentleman in a moment, but I believe that he was a member of the Modernisation Committee at the time. We debated the matter at length and heard compelling evidence from the youth development officer at Lewisham council, the parliamentary education service and the UK Youth Parliament. All our witnesses said clearly what a fantastic opportunity it would be for young people to come into this Chamber&#151;the cockpit of the mother of Parliaments&#151;and be treated with maturity and respect, not patronised in the way that they have been in some of the contributions that we have heard. Of course the UK Youth Parliament is capable of a mature, sensible debate. Its members are the future citizens of our country and deserve to be treated with respect. That is what is intended in the motion.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has a point, but it is not relevant. On a point of order, I raised a written question, which was tabled in 2007&#151;some three years after the report from which he quoted&#151;and the reply that the then Deputy Leader of the House gave was that the Leader of the House &#147;will be raising&#148;&#151;not &#147;has raised&#148;&#151;the issue with the Modernisation Committee.

 That does not alter the facts of the case. It is a question of how many Tory backwoodsmen can dance on the head of a pin. They will use any procedural ruse to prevent the matter from being put to a vote, because they know perfectly well that they would be defeated and the UK Youth Parliament would have an opportunity to debate here.</p>

 I express my views with conviction&#151;whether that constitutes apoplexy is a matter of individual judgment. If the proposal had come forward as a recommendation for the Modernisation Committee, I would not have supported it. As my right hon.

 I think that we are witnessing the first tremors of apoplexy from the hon. Gentleman. The minutes of the report that I cited clearly show that the membership of the Modernisation Committee in 2003-04 included him. The report includes recommendation 9 about reviewing the case for reserving use of the Chamber for elected Members of Parliament, and the minutes also show that there was no Division. It is therefore disingenuous for members of that Committee to claim that the matter was not discussed and that they sought to oppose the recommendation.</p>

I am sad when young people are patronised and an organisation as worthy as the UK Youth Parliament is traduced in the way that some hon. Members have tried to do. The UK Youth Parliament is an excellent institution. I grew up in the &#146;60s and &#146;70s, when young people were energised by the political process. A lot of us feel despair at the lack of turnout and engagement among young people in the party political process and in the general political process. For us, as a Parliament, to be shutting our doors on a small group of young people who wish to participate and engage in our democratic process is disgraceful.</p>

 I have another problem for Opposition Members who feel that their traditions, their security or even their very being would be threatened by some young people meeting once a year in this place. The records show that the House authorities have identified the fact that asbestos exists in this building. As you will be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, they have been considering the possibility of relocating us across the road&#151;I think to the Queen Elizabeth centre&#151;while the work takes place. I am afraid that the traditions of this place may yet be subject to health and safety legislation. When we are away and the contractors are in this place removing the asbestos, goodness knows, treason may happen.

In the few minutes before I conclude, I want to give those in the UK Youth Parliament a voice. We have been talking at them, rather than about what they might do, what they might get out of the experience or what they might feel. Let me read into the record what the chief executive of the UK Youth Parliament said only a couple of days ago. He is a gentleman called Andy Hamflett and he gave evidence to the Speaker&#146;s Conference in Parliament, highlighting how politicians could be doing more to reach out to young people. Speaking about the Speaker&#146;s Conference, Andy said:</p>
<a name="90312-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="09031256001005"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It was a fantastic opportunity to celebrate the great work that Local Authorities and young people undertake as part of the UKYP partnership...Many ideas were discussed, but for me the unifying theme was that young people from diverse communities often feel disconnected from Parliament because they cannot see role models representing them in the House. They need to see people like themselves in representative positions to believe that it can be done.</p>
</ul><a name="90312-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="09031256001006"><ul><p class="tabletext">I therefore made the point that if Parliament really wants to open its doors to young people, a very simple first step would be to allow Members of Youth Parliament to sit in the House of Commons chamber. It would be the perfect opportunity for young people across the country to see the fantastic diversity of Members of Youth Parliament, and to inspire them to take their own steps to get involved in politics and decision making.&#148;</p>

He was, I think, a leader writer for <i> The Times</i>, as well as being my British constitution teacher at school&#151;we did not have politics in those days. He spotted in me and in other young people in our class an interest in the world around us, and he sought to develop and inspire it. He ensured that we came to the Chamber of this place, where I was privileged to see Barbara Castle tearing into the industrial relations legislation of the time. My teacher also took me to see Ralph Miliband at the politics society at Kingston; he nurtured my interest and my passion. I have to say that he, as a democrat, would be spinning in his grave if he had to listen to some of the arguments being put forward today to shut young people out of this place. We should be doing everything we can to inspire the next generation of democratic representatives. We should vote in favour of this motion, because it is called progress.</p>

 I think that the hon. Gentleman rather likes it&#151;being rude, that is. He bemoans the fact that the UK Youth Parliament does not stretch to every community in the country, which is true, but I would have thought that the opportunity to sit in the House would make it far easier for the Youth Parliament to spread across the whole country and to recruit more members, including in his constituency.</p>

 I do not share that view. One thing that worries me about the debate is that so far there has been no mention whatever of the amendment, which has been selected by the Chair. The amendment states that the UK Youth Parliament&#151;</p>

 I was shoulder to shoulder with the hon. Gentleman on the Modernisation Committee when we wrote the report recommending that we consider using this Chamber for young people to debate, set in the context, if I may remind him, of supporting citizenship education in this country. I know that he is about to say, &#147;Let&#146;s put them Upstairs in a Committee Room,&#148; so let me put the following argument to him. The youngsters of the Youth Parliament debated in Committee Room 14 and performed in an exemplary way. They were rewarded by next being able to debate in the House of Lords, where, as we have heard, they also behaved in an exemplary way. What is wrong with now rewarding them with the pinnacle of our Parliament, being able to debate in this Chamber?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman always expresses his arguments in a most persuasive and constructive way, but he and I differ. I believe that either Committee Room 14 or the Grand Committee Room would be ideal chambers for the Youth Parliament to meet in and to have debates. Let me pick up the moving remarks of the Liberal shadow Leader of the House, who said that nobody is more loyal to this Chamber and believes more strongly in its integrity and that of the House than him. Looking at him eye to eye, let me say that I do not think anyone could fault my support for the Chamber of the House. In recent times, almost my sole raison d&#146;être for remaining in this place has been to restore to the House more authority over the conduct of its business. For that reason and my total commitment to the integrity&#151;and, yes, sovereignty&#151;of the House, I take the position that I do.</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) is basing his excellent speech on the assumption that that is the case, and my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope), who has not yet moved the amendment selected by Mr. Speaker, obviously believes it to be the case.

 I am very grateful for this opportunity to raise an issue that is of enormous importance to my constituents: the flooding that we in Somerset repeatedly experience, and most recently over the Christmas period and early in the new year. I was a victim myself, as I have already told the House; my car was washed away with me in it. That was a rather unpleasant experience, and it is not one I would care to repeat. Others, however, had much more serious experiences. Unfortunately, an elderly gentleman died in his car in similar circumstances in my constituency, and many people&#146;s houses were flooded, and a substantial number of them have not returned to their dwellings even now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="90312-0021.htm_para7"><a name="09031256000938">Somerset is a wet county. It is a very green county, but the reason is that it rains a lot. We recognise that floods have always been a part of Somerset life. Indeed, the centre part of Somerset, what is now called the Somerset levels, was once the great mere&#151;a large inland lake, since drained, but which reverts to a flooded condition for large parts of the winter months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90312-0021.htm_para8"><a name="09031256000939">More recently, we have seen a repetition of flooding beyond the normal seasonal flooding. Often, it is not directly from watercourses but is surface-water flooding, which is of concern. Frankly, it is stretching the resources of people who live in the county and the services that deal with them to the limit. I visited the villages of Queen Camel and West Camel when they were flooded. I went to Marston Magna, which is not in my constituency but that of my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), where the pub was flooded and cut off. I have since been to the parish councils to talk about flooding in Bridgehampton and in Ilchester Mead, which is close to the A303. There were serious flooding incidents in Ash and in Martock. Over this weekend I am visiting Stoney Stratton, where a very serious flash flood is still causing concern, as it has not been properly addressed by the local authorities. Some 30 cars for sale at a garage in a village called Anchor Hill, in Holton, were lost as a result of flooding from the watercourse there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90312-0021.htm_para9"><a name="09031256000940">So these are serious matters for my constituents, and I want to set out some of the arguments for further action, some of the things that have already been done in Somerset that are good role models for elsewhere, and some of the areas where a combination of Government, local government, the Environment Agency and other agencies can make a significant difference. Of course, we look at all this in the context of what the Pitt review had to say about dealing with flooding in areas such as ours. I hope that much of what I say will be consistent with that view and with the Government&#146;s view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90312-0021.htm_para10"><a name="09031256000941">Let me give a specific instance that I raised with the Secretary of State during questions to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: the flooding of the Countess Gytha school in Queen Camel. It has repeatedly flooded and its pupils have repeatedly needed to be evacuated and moved into alternative accommodation. I was on hand when temporary classrooms were put in to replace the flooded ones over the Christmas period, but what is clearly needed is for that school to be  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90312-0021.htm_para11"><a name="09031256000942">The problem will be the capital programme and using the money made available through the schools programme to bring forward a project that is not currently a high priority within that programme. I asked the Secretary of State whether he could bring to bear any pressure on his counterparts in the Department for Children, Schools and Families to make a temporary arrangement for the county council in order to enable that. I have yet to have a formal response to my letter following my question in the House, and I look forward to that. I impress upon the Minister that this is a matter of great urgency for that community. Somerset county council is doing what it can within its resources, but it would like to make a move next year and it probably needs Government help to do so. I wonder whether there is any way of unlocking that money. It seems sensible in any case that we deal with facilities such as schools and make them flood-resilient as a matter of public policy. That issue has perhaps not yet been properly addressed within Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90312-0021.htm_para12"><a name="09031256000943">My second point concerns the desperate need for proper maintenance and drainage works across the county. I say that not to criticise the work of the Environment Agency or the county council, but simply to say that the present facilities&#151;the storm drains and drainage ditches&#151;are insufficient to meet what appears to be the need. No amount of wishing new construction will make the difference needed. A step change in facilities is needed to remove surface water effectively and efficiently to prevent some of the flooding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90312-0021.htm_para13"><a name="09031256000944">The problem is often exacerbated by blockages in existing drains and ditches, which is where the issue of maintenance comes in. I know that the Environment Agency and drainage boards are aware of that issue, and would like to make further progress, but as always, we come back to resources. Because we are dealing with a large rural county with an awful lot of watercourses, it is hard to stretch the resources sufficiently to make a difference. I am convinced that if we had proper dredging of some of our rivers and proper clearing of debris and strengthening of banks on some of the smaller tributary streams, it would make a substantial difference to the way in which we deal with these matters. This is where the Pitt review proposals come in, and it is how we arrive at a common view of where the priorities lie. We might then try to unlock perhaps a little more resource than there is at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90312-0021.htm_para14"><a name="09031256000945">Somerset has been knocking on the door on this matter. We recognise that the Government have, inevitably, been looking at areas that were seriously affected last year, and I do not criticise them for that. Gloucestershire and Kingston upon Hull were clearly areas of priority, but I think that Somerset is as well. We did not feature in that particular incident&#151;almost uniquely. It was unbelievable that we had major flooding incidents all across the country but that they did not affect Somerset. That was a reverse of the normal state of affairs, but simply because we missed out in that case, it does not mean that we do not have significant problems, which I would like the Minister to address.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I know that the debate is on Somerset, so I shall be careful about what I say. In the proposals to deal with flooding in and around the River Severn, the idea of the barrage as a flood prevention measure has been floated&#151;I use that word carefully. Would he agree that while there may be arguments for the barrage&#151;I do not agree with them&#151;they should be separated from the issue of flooding? Flooding should be dealt with in its own right and the barrage should be put on a separate pedestal and dealt with differently.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman up to a point. The situation in the upper reaches of the Severn is different from that of Bridgwater bay and the Parrot basin. I cannot categorically agree with him because a barrage would be a contributing factor&#151;it would essentially act as a flood barrier at high tide for the River Parrot and its tributaries. I cannot entirely go along with his point, although I agree that they are separate issues and that we should not confuse the two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="90312-0021.htm_para15"><a name="09031256000950">On the point of maintenance and physical works, I should mention the important role of accurate surveying, and I do so not least because there is an important company in my constituency&#151;Fathoms Ltd of Langport&#151;with which I have had dealings in the past, and which employs experts in this field. It can make a significant contribution.</p>

 There is a major housing development taking place in Norton Fitzwarren on the edge of Taunton at the moment, but it is dependent to a large extent on flood alleviation schemes so that new residents are not exposed to the risk of flooding.

Friend agree that it is absolutely essential that the Environment Agency ensure that the developers are vigilant in taking every measure to reassure people who are moving into housing of that type, and people who already live there, that the necessary flood alleviation work is taking place?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, although I do not know the details of the Norton Fitzwarren scheme&#151;I do know Norton Fitzwarren. The solution can be found on several different levels. We should not take floodplain that is necessary for water retention, we should ensure that flood alleviation schemes are in place to protect the development in question and we should make the houses resilient and build them so that they are resilient.</p>

I am a strong supporter of whole-river-catchment processes. We experimented with one some time ago&#151;I was involved with the county council&#151;with the River Parrot catchment area. We need to look much more holistically at whole-river-catchment processes. We need to find ways to retain water effectively and to prevent flooding at source in a much more effective way than we do at the moment. I am convinced that is the sensible way of managing river basins and I hope it will be given proper precedence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para0"><a name="09031256000954">My next point is about resilience. Somerset has been very good and there are some lessons to learn from the area. I invited the Secretary of State to come down to Somerset and I extend that invitation to the Under-Secretary. We have learned from hard lessons and the villages that are most prone to flooding have developed community ideas to provide resilience for individual houses, as well as ways of preventing the ingress of water and of making the houses resistant to water damage once water comes in. Those ideas are being spread as best practice not only in those communities but across all communities in Somerset. A lot can be done in that area that is not being done at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para1"><a name="09031256000955">We need to recognise that the community response is an important factor. We need to identify people who have particular skills who can respond. One of my neighbours has a 4x4 and he is a member of a scheme whereby when there is bad weather, such as in the snows a few weeks ago, he is called in on a cascade system to ensure that doctors, nurses and ambulance personnel can get to people through the snow. That is a wonderful scheme and it is the sort of thing that we should be encouraging and doing more formally, so that we identify people with particular skills and ensure that they are available to help the community at the right time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para2"><a name="09031256000956">There are also basic things that parish councils can do, which work much better when they are localised, such as ensuring that they have warning systems. They know who the vulnerable people are, so they can immediately give support. There are systems that can tell people about likely flooding even more effectively than the Environment Agency provisions. That is partly a matter of making individual forecasting more accurate to a very precise location, but it is also about ensuring that people know about the forecast. For instance, one could get the fire brigade to drive through the village at night with the siren going, so that the warning does not rely on there being a phone connection or whatever and so that people are aware that there is danger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para3"><a name="09031256000957">It is about the simple things. I lost my car in my village under a railway bridge that flooded in the dark much more deeply than I had thought. If there was a flood gauge under that bridge, which often floods a little, I would have known immediately as I approached the bridge that there was deep water. However, I did not and it is very hard to judge, as the Minister will know, when it is dark. I have been encouraging parish councils, when they have known areas of likely flooding, to put up flood gauges. It is a simple thing to do and it is very helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para4"><a name="09031256000958">It is also a matter of design, to return to the point that I made in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne). Sometimes, elevating a house when it is being built by about 3 ft makes all the difference between that house&#146;s flooding and its never flooding. It is very simple.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para5"><a name="09031256000959">My final point is about inter-agency co-operation. I think that we are beginning to get that between the Environment Agency and local authorities. May I suggest one more agency that needs to be involved, which is the Highways Agency? One of the chief problems with flooding in my area, believe it or not, is the A303, a major trunk road that was designed to carry cars and lorries&#151;although it was not designed terribly well for that purpose&#151;but was not designed to prevent flooding. The result is that in some places it acts as a dam and in  <br>

others it lets water through. That water then goes over large conduits and into water courses that cannot cope. We need co-ordination and understanding of those processes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para6"><a name="09031256000960">If I had time, I would also deal with insurance. It is a key matter, but many people in Somerset are finding it increasingly difficult to get repeat insurance. We have addressed the problem locally with insurance companies, and I know that the Minister has also been doing work in that area. I should like to hear what he has to say.</p>

 I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) on securing this Adjournment debate. He spoke in a measured and well informed way about matters of concern nationally, but he also brought his local knowledge to the debate. He gave very good local examples of how agencies respond to these problems, and of how people work together. I challenge those who say that community spirit no longer exists to examine what is happening in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para7"><a name="09031271000002">At the outset, I should like to extend the House&#146;s sympathy to all the people around the country who have been affected by flooding. It is personally devastating and, as happened in the constituency of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, it can also lead to fatalities and injuries. Our thoughts go out to everyone affected, but there are things that we can do. In this debate, I hope that I can respond to the points that the hon. Gentleman made, and articulate what more can be done. Flooding is a major problem for him and his constituents, and for people around the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para8"><a name="09031271000003">The hon. Gentleman said that he has had experience of flooding from rivers and as a result of surface water drainage. I have met several people who have gone through the trauma of flooding that has hit their properties and families, and in that context it is worth mentioning the Queen Camel school. I will not bore the House by going through the long history of that site&#146;s inadequate flood protection, but I will make sure that my colleagues in other Departments are aware of the problem. Like the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents, I want it to be solved. I note what he said about relocating the school: he knows that that is not in my gift, but I will make sure the matter is brought to the attention of other Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para9"><a name="09031271000004">The Government fully recognise the importance of the effective management of flood risk. Based on the Pitt report, and on the experience that we have gathered as a result of some traumatic experiences over the years, we know what we need to do. The simple statistics show that we have increased investment in flood risk management to &#163;650 million this year, a figure that will rise to &#163;800 million by 2010. We have more than doubled the amount of investment from the level of the late 1990s, and it will reach a record of &#163;2.15 billion over the next three-year spending commitment period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para10"><a name="09031271000005">I know that the House will welcome that, but there is more to be done. We must tackle issues to do with structure and organisation, and we must also look at what we can do, both nationally and with local input, in making choices on the ground. However, the investment that we have made in the past three years has helped to reduce flood risk significantly for more than 125,000  <br>

homes. Over the next two years, we hope to offer an improved standard of protection against flooding and coastal erosion for 145,000 more homes. We always base such figures on risk assessments, and that total will include 45,000 homes at the highest and most chronic level of risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para11"><a name="09031271000006">There are various flood defence schemes in Somerset, and the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency of Somerton and Frome has received some flood defence grant in aid in the past. He will know about the work on the dam at Bruton, and about the schemes at Ilminster, Langport and elsewhere in the county, but&#151;of course and as always&#151;more needs to be done. Currently, we are developing a long-term investment strategy for flood and coastal erosion. It will look at the long-term funding needs and pressures for the next 25 years. That has to be the way forward. The strategy will also consider how the greatest value for money for the taxpayer can be achieved in delivering such investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para12"><a name="09031271000007">Let me turn for a moment to the floods and water Bill. Our intention is to present the draft Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny and consultation within the next couple of months. The draft Bill is our opportunity jointly and collectively to consolidate the existing legislative framework, which is complex and unclear. It will allow us to bring together the regulatory regimes on flood defence and coastal erosion and to ensure&#151;the point that the hon. Gentleman was making&#151;that a co-ordinated approach is delivered on the ground. It will clarify roles and maximise joint working between all bodies, agencies and communities involved in flooding and coastal erosion. It will help to ensure effective protection on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para13"><a name="09031271000008">Of course, we recognise&#151;I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does so, too&#151;that we have gone past the old shibboleth; it is simply not beneficial or practical to protect every acre of land and every inch of coastline, particularly as climate change increases storminess, wave heights and incidents of extreme heavy rainfall. So our focus rightly must be on the assessment and management of the risk. It must be on balancing likelihoods and consequences and ensuring that the considerable investment of taxpayers&#146; money is used to best effect. So where investment is made, it must be done in return for significant reductions in the likelihood and consequences of flooding. It must take place where the greatest benefits can be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para14"><a name="09031271000009">Let me in the time available turn to one helpful aspect: local levy funding. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and I are interested in the approaches that can maximise not only what the Environment Agency and others can deliver, but what can be delivered in addition on the ground. Where a scheme may not meet the national priorities for funding, it may be identified as a priority by the regional flood defence committees, which can use local levy funding. For example, in Shepton Mallet, where a proposal for work on a critical watercourse did not have enough economic benefits to meet the national funding criteria, the proposed flood defence scheme is being considered for funding using Wessex flood defence committee&#146;s local levy funds of approximately &#163;1 million to &#163;2 million. The scheme is currently at the feasibility study stage, and it is hoped that the design will be finished next year  <br>

and the construction completed in the following year. That is a good example of how real additionality can be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para15"><a name="09031271000010">Let us turn to an example of a scheme with low benefits. Queen Camel has been mentioned. Some cases do not match the criteria. For example, recently in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency, the benefits were low in Queen Camel. Following flooding in 2000, there was a proposal for a flood storage scheme that would have protected 27 properties. That scheme was brought forward for discussion. It would have cost about &#163;8 million and provided for a one-in-25-year level of protection. On that basis and against the criteria, it was deemed not to be economically viable. That does not make it easy for the people who are on the receiving end, but I think that the hon. Gentleman will understand me when I say that we must act on the best assessment of risk and the best analysis. What else can be done?</p>

<p><a name="st_o502"><a name="09031271000011"><a name="90312-0022.htm_spnew0"><a name="09031271000024"><b>Mr. Heath:</b>
 We can argue elsewhere about the appropriateness or otherwise of that scheme. I am concerned however that some of the risk analysis is now out of date. One-in-25-year events are now one-in-three-year events. One-in-100-year events are now one-in-twenty-year events. I wonder whether we are keeping pace with what is happening to our climate and environment.</p>

 That is a valid point, and what we introduce in the floods and water Bill, or whatever it will be called, will address not only some of the structural issues but the long-term funding issues, as well as how we get the balance right in using national taxpayers&#146; money to deal with what are deemed strategic, high-importance and high-risk areas and what element of that can be delivered either through additionality or otherwise. There are some interesting discussions to be had with some local input, because alternatives are sometimes close by.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para16"><a name="09031271000013">In the past couple of years, we revisited the criteria for agricultural land. I know that this will not satisfy everybody, but the value or premium put on agricultural land for reasons of food security was looked at, and it was enhanced slightly. It will always be a case of balancing considerations such as the number of houses and the value of properties and businesses concerned. There is a balance between defence of a particular part of the coast, or a particular water catchment area, and defence of something elsewhere. That is tricky, I know, but I think that we are heading in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="90312-0022.htm_para17"><a name="09031271000014">I mentioned the issue of what else can be done, apart from the floods Bill. One aspect to consider is property-level flood protection. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has announced the establishment of a property-level flood protection grant scheme, which stands to benefit properties in high-risk areas that are not protected by a community-level scheme. The scheme is run by the Environment Agency. It is open to local authorities to apply to it, on behalf of communities. The Secretary of State announced in December that &#163;5 million will be available to spend on that measure. I understand that the Environment Agency has already been engaged by Somerset county council to consider a future application. I cannot make any comment on that, but it is good to see applications coming forward, including from Somerset.</p>

flooding is as low as possible, and the water courses issues are an important aspect of that. The Environment Agency routinely considers dredging and vegetation clearance from water courses; it prioritises those issues.
