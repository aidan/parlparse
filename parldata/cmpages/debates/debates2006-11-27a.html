It is estimated that around half of pensioners living

that, last year, the Pension Service visited more than 1 million
people, and is calling 5,000 people every week. Take-up has increased
from 74 per cent. to 81 per cent. When we came to power, there
were3 million pensioners in poverty, but now there are fewer

that means-testing will fall to less than 30 per cent. by 2050 under

narrow the funnel of doubt, as it is described. We have published
information on our website, which everyone can look at, setting out our

more effective at modelling the impact of the state second pension, and
that our reforms will result in less than a third of people being

the Liberal Democrats&#146; policy is a fantasy, because it would put
5p on income tax. According to the 2005 figures, however, about half
those receiving means-tested benefits are receiving disability benefits

50. An enormous amount is being done to support such people in their

we have further to go in supporting the ever-increasing number of those

new deal 50-plus, which is supporting such people and giving them the
chance to get back into work. It has enabled some 160,000 job entries

over-50s. That reinforces the need to support more people, especially
those who are inactive and perhaps locked into a culture of benefit
dependency through incapacity benefit, half of whom are over the age of
50, and emphasises why we need to continue the roll-out of pathways and
seek support across the House&#151;which we have had so

a simple and positive answer to it. I have been approached by many
people over 50 whose skills have become redundant, but they have to
languish in unemployment for six months or take a cheap, badly paid job
that does not use their potential skills. Will the Government consider
introducing a scheme that would reskill people more quickly, so that
they are not out of the labour market for such a long time or forced to
take low paid, unskilled
work?</p><p><a name="st_o77"><a name="0611275000121"><b><a name="61127-0003.htm_spnew5"><a name="0611275000490">Mr.

the new deal 50-plus is that the vast majority of those aged over 50
find work in the first six months. The new deal is aimed at tackling
and eradicating long-term unemployment in the 50-plus group and among
young folk. However, we continue of course to listen to representations
and will pay close attention to the report by Sandy Leitch on the
future skills agenda.</p><br>

additional costs and impact of disability on an individual. They take
close cognisance of an individual&#146;s circumstances. The most
severely disabled people receive an additional &#163;7,000 a year in
recognition of the extra costs they face. Some 60 per cent. of those
who receive the DLA and/or attendance allowance are aged over 60 and
automatically receive a winter fuel payment. The DLA is regulated out
over a 52-week period to take account of those costs that occur
regularly for disabled people, whereas the winter fuel allowance is an
annual payment at a particular time of year to assist with the pressure
of fuel costs in the winter. The two examples are not

This statement provides a factual account of the circumstances
surrounding the death of Mr. Litvinenko on 23 November 2006.
There is, as the House will know, an ongoing police investigation, and
I know that the right hon. Gentleman appreciates that, for obvious
reasons, I am limited in what I can say to ensure the integrity of any
judicial process. My right hon. Friends the Foreign Secretary and
Secretary of State for Health and I have co-ordinated the

incident.</p><p><a name="stpa_o3"><a name="61127-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0611275000170">In the late
afternoon of Thursday 23 November, the police confirmed with the Health
Protection Agency that a significant quantity of the radioactive
isotope polonium-210 had been found in Mr.
Litvinenko&#146;s urine. The material was identified following
extensive tests by forensic toxicologists. In response to this finding,
the police liaised closely with experts to search for any residual
radioactive material at a number of locations in
London.</p><p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="61127-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0611275000171">The police have
now confirmed that traces of polonium-210 have been found at certain
locations, including the Itsu sushi restaurant at 167 Piccadilly, in
some areas of the Millennium hotel, Grosvenor square and at
Mr. Litvinenko&#146;s home in Muswell Hill, London. Tests
are continuing at a number of locations. The police are continuing an
extensive examination of CCTV footage to trace possible witnesses, to
examine Mr. Litvinenko&#146;s movements at relevant times,
including when he first became ill and to identify people whom he may
have
met.</p><p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="61127-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0611275000172">Following
the confirmation of the presence of polonium-210, the Health Protection
Agency investigated clinical areas at Barnet hospital and University
College hospital. One area in the intensive care unit remains closed at
University College hospital. All other areas at these hospitals are
functioning as normal on the advice of the Health Protection
Agency.</p><p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="61127-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0611275000173">The Health

November to contact NHS Direct, where further advice is available. In
addition, the chief medical officer, ProfessorSir Liam
Donaldson, issued advice to GPs and hospitals on the risks and clinical
implications of exposure to
polonium-210.</p><p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="61127-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0611275000174">NHS

the Home Secretary has said, the death of Mr. Alexander
Litvinenko occurred in suspicious circumstances. I assume that is why
Cobra was convened last week or over the weekend. There are grounds to
suspect that this was a particularly cruel, protracted and unpleasant
assassination, and Mr. Litvinenko, his family and his
associates all believe that he was the victim of a Russian secret
service assassination attempt. It is far too soon to know the truth of
that, but I would not in any event expect the Home Secretary to comment
on that. However, what appears to be known, as I think the Home
Secretary has confirmed, is that Mr. Litvinenko was poisoned
by a dose of polonium-210, a synthetic radioactive isotope. That raises
a number of issues about how such material is obtained as it is made by
a sophisticated technique normally available only to Governments, about
the technical sophistication involved in transporting and delivering
the material undetected and, in particular, about the knowledge
required to calculate the dose sufficient to kill but low enough to
make detection difficult, as it was in this
case.</p><p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="61127-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0611275000180">That, in turn,
means that it is incredibly important to resolve the question of
whether the Russian state was involved. If it was&#151;given that a
British citizen who had been given asylum and was therefore under
British Government protection may have been murdered on British
soil&#151;that has enormous implications for the relationship between
the United Kingdom and Russia and implications, too, for other
&#233;migr&#233;s in the United Kingdom who are opponents of the
Russian Government. If the Russian state was not involved, that raises
the almost equally disturbing prospect that such sophisticated
capabilities are available to criminals in the United Kingdom and
possibly therefore to other groups.</p><p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="61127-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0611275000181">The House will understand that,
for reasons of law, diplomacy and, indeed, other proprieties, there are
limits on what the Home Secretary can say. He has already told the
House that the Government have sought the co-operation of the Russian
Government in pursuing these inquiries. Will he tell us the extent of
that? Will that allow state employees with diplomatic immunity to be
interviewed? Will it allow access to Russian citizens who may have
entered or left the United Kingdom recently? Will it allow the UK
police to have the right to interview other Russian citizens such as
the associates of Anna Politkovskaya, the journalist who was murdered
recently and who appears to have been an associate of Mr.
Litvinenko? Have the Russian Government undertaken to co-operate in all
such inquiries?</p><br>

that traces of radioactivity have been found in three or more separate
locations around London. I could not quite keep count as the Home
Secretary was speaking; it think it is more than three. That is clearly
a matter of concern to ordinary members of the public who may have
visited one of those locations. Will he confirm what I understood him
to be saying&#151;that the three who have so far been kept in because
they are showing symptoms are only possible and not likely contaminees?
Will he also tell the House what action has been taken to protect the
safety of the public further and, in particular, when in this process
the Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response at Porton Down was

Reid:</b> Let me go through the questions in the order that
the right hon. Gentleman raised them. First, I urge caution on everyone
not to get ahead of ourselves or, in particular, the police
investigation. Cobra was not called because there was a suspicious
death. The police&#146;s original position, when Cobra was first
called, was not a suspicious death, but an unexplained death. I put
that on the record as a matter of fact. Nevertheless, it was
sufficiently concerning, not least from the point of view of public
health, to bring together the cross-governmental agency that deals with
these issues.</p><p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="61127-0004.htm_para13"><a name="0611275000184">Secondly, I caution everyone
against assuming that the police have yet said even as much as that
they believe that Mr. Litvinenko was killed. The police have
been very careful in the words that they have used. They have said that
they are dealing with a suspicious death and that is the basis on which
they are making their investigations, but they have not ruled in or
ruled out anything, and therefore it would be premature to go ahead and
speculate on any particular lines of investigation, including those
that may become necessary, with anyone outside the country. As far as
the preliminary contacts with the Russian Government are concerned, as
I explained, we have made it plain to them that, if it were required,
we would expect them to give us all possible assistance. As far as I am
aware, they have indicated that that would be the case.</p><p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="61127-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0611275000185">On the premises that the right
hon. Gentleman asked about, in several areas of the Millennium hotel,
in the restaurant itself, in Mr. Litvinenko&#146;s home
residence and in several other premises, we have found some
indications, to a greater or lesser extent, of radiation. I should
explain to the House that the nature of this radiation is such that it
does not travel over long distances&#151;a few centimetres at
most&#151;and therefore there is no need for public alarm over the
fact that radiation may have been found, since there is such a short
distance encompassed in its effect distance, as it were.</p><p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="61127-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0611275000186">A small number of people out of
the 500 or so who have contacted NHS Direct through the appeal from the
Health Protection Agency have described symptoms that have merited
further investigation by tests. Obviously that figure can change from
time to time as people phone in and indicate their own position or ask
questions. As of this morning, the number was very small&#151;less
than five. If there were any significant

range over which the radiation would operate is small; it is in

a Conservative Treasury will achieve: real value for money for the

be a financial services Bill, too. In addition, today we are publishing
our document on long-term challenges facing the British economy. What
was remarkable about the shadow Chancellor&#146;s speech was that
none of those long-term challenges was addressed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="61127-0007.htm_para4"><a name="0611275000333">We will face the global
terrorist challenge by enhancing security. We have doubled the security
budget from &#163;1 billion to &#163;2 billion.
<i> [Interruption.]</i> I am happy to give way, if any hon. Member can
point out that that is not the case. Let us have no more talk about the
Home Office budget. The security budget is doubling, and the Home

because we intend to meet our commitments to security.</p><p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="61127-0007.htm_para5"><a name="0611275000334">The second
challenge is how to meet the demands of global economic restructuring.
We must do so by entrenching our stability. That is why the statistics
Bill will continue the process that we started with the Bank of England
and the competition authorities, and continued with industrial
policy&#151;the process of making policy independent of Government.
We will out-innovate our competitors if we pursue the science,
technology and skills strategy that we are putting forward.</p><p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="61127-0007.htm_para6"><a name="0611275000335">We must meet the environmental
challenge by taking action on climate change, hence the climate change
Bill that we will discuss in the House. However, we must balance what
we can do nationally and what we can do internationally. I should tell
Opposition Members that the environmental challenge will require a
degree of European co-operation, and that is no part of their policy at
the moment. If we are to meet the challenges of the future, we must
respond to rising individual aspirations and to the yearning in our
communities for greater
cohesion.</p><p><a name="st_o210"><a name="0611275000336"><b><a name="61127-0007.htm_spnew25"><a name="0611275000631">Mr.

public expenditure. I can confirm not only that we have doubled the
security budget, but that we are considering a single security budget.
I can also confirm that we have spent &#163;5 billion on Iraq and
Afghanistan. To continue the support of our armed forces, I am making
available extra money for operational needs. We are setting aside

are likely to be responsible for half of the world&#146;s growth in
the next 10 years. There has been a 400 per cent. increase in the
number of unskilled workers in the industrialised economy. China and
India charge wage rates that are only 5 per cent. of those of the
United Kingdom, and they are therefore making large numbers of the
world&#146;s unskilled workers unemployable or redundant. That is a
major social, as well as economic, challenge, and that is why we have
set up a number of reviews, led by prominent business men and women in
this country.</p><p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="61127-0007.htm_para8"><a name="0611275000339">Our

more money for the police who should have higher basic salaries, more

money to invest in drug rehab, more money for what are called

they will bear down on spending; and it ends up in what happened after
1992. It ends up not in tax cuts, but in 22 tax rises; it ends up not

acceded to his new post. I note that he is receiving at least some good
advice, because I see that quite a few of my policies and speeches
appear in his after a short time lag. Most recently, my 10-point plan
on debt reappeared as the Conservatives&#146; six-point plan on debt.
I had been puzzled as to what was wrong with the other four points
until I worked out that they all related to problems concerning
mortgages and repossessions, which may be an area of policy over which
the Conservatives wish to draw a

&#147;feckless tossers&#148;. I thought perhaps that, with my
advancing years, the problem was that I had lost my schoolboy sense of
humour. However, having tried the words out on various age cohorts

about them either.</p><p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="61127-0008.htm_para10"><a name="0611277000004">As
far as the Chancellor is concerned, I realise that the boxing metaphor
is getting a little bit worn. He may recall in a way that is perhaps
not terribly helpful to him that, before Lennox Lewis came along,
British heavyweight boxers were notoriously ineffective. Indeed, they
eventually earned the nickname of &#147;horizontal
heavyweights&#148;. That is how they tended to appear on the canvas.
However, after an hour of Punch and Judy politics, the Chancellor has

me return to the issue of stability. The Chancellor is absolutely
right&#151;and this is a sensible place to start&#151;to say that
we are in a successful economy and that we should be proud of that. I
have never quite understood why the Conservatives have such difficulty
saying that and claiming some of the credit, rather than arguing that
we are in a constant state of economic collapse. The British economy is
in good shape and, as the International Monetary Fund said recently,
our rate of growth is somewhat above the G7 average and certainly more
stable. The issue is not whether that happens&#151;it clearly is
happening&#151;but whether it can be sustained. The question is
whether the growth that we have at the moment is sustainable or more
similar to the experience that we had in the 1950s, which I grew up
with as a teenager, when we also had more than a decade of stable
growth, low unemployment and low inflation. However, we were building
up imbalances in the economy and they eventually spilled over in the
form of balance of payments crises. We cannot have them any more
because we have a floating exchange
rate.</p><p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="61127-0008.htm_para13"><a name="0611277000009">None
the less, serious imbalances are building up in the British economy and
it will be a major challenge for the Chancellor and whoever succeeds
him to deal with them. One of them relates to public expenditure, which
is growing significantly faster than the British economy. We have no
quarrel with the increase in public expenditure that has
occurred&#151;or much of it; much of it has been valuable&#151;but
there is an issue of sustainability. The other big challenge is that of
personal debt.</p><p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="61127-0008.htm_para14"><a name="0611277000010">On
public expenditure, the Chancellor challenged the Conservative
spokesman about some of his spending commitments, and he was right to
do that. However, the Chancellor is also making major spending
commitments that will be difficult to sustain over the difficult
periods ahead. Public expenditure will not be able to grow much faster
than the British economy over the next
period.</p><p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="61127-0008.htm_para15"><a name="0611277000011">I want to take

started his speech by referring, I think with some pride, to the
spending that the Government were undertaking on what he called

perspective on that, because we regard the &#163;4 billion spent on
that war as having been wasted. He may say, &#147;That&#146;s water

Chancellor committed the Government to spending an extra &#163;100
million on reconstruction. One might say, &#147;Fine. That&#146;s
good. Whatever our views on the war, surely we are in favour of
reconstruction.&#148; I am challenging that. I do not know whether
the Chancellor is aware, but a few weeks ago, the Iraqi Government
committed themselves to the latest big tranche of spending: a total of
$40 billion, which is more than&#163;20 billion, in
reparation payments. That is Iraqi oil money. It is not being used for
reconstruction or to raise standards for people in Iraq; it is being
used to pay reparation for damage supposedly incurred in the first Gulf
war. Much of it is going to Kuwait, not just for the damage that was
inflicted by Saddam Hussein but for continuing penalty payments.
Bizarrely, much of it is going to private companies such as
Halliburton, Bechtel and even Kentucky Fried Chicken. They are being
paid compensation for profits that they lost as a result of the first
Gulf war. My question to the Chancellor is: why should the British
Exchequer&#151;the British taxpayer&#151;be plugging holes in the
Iraqi budget when the Iraqi Government are making those enormous,
obscene payments? There is no
justification.</p><p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="61127-0008.htm_para16"><a name="0611277000012">Let
me take another heading under the issue of security. The National Audit
Office recently produced a compilation of defence estimates: the 20
biggest projects under the Ministry of Defence&#151;20 big projects
costing &#163;20 billion. It was subsequently presented by Lord
Drayson as a great success story. However, it emerged from the analysis
that the projects were collectively&#163;2.6 billion
over-budget and cumulatively 36 years behind schedule. Clearly, if
there is going to be a tightening of Government spending, some of that
stuff will have to be looked at. We have argued, for example, that some
of the third tranche of the Eurofighter project, which is estimated to
cost &#163;16 billion&#151;although we do not really know, because
the figures have been concealed under commercial secrecy&#151;has to
be scrapped. The Government are going to have to face up to that too.
Sooner rather than later, we want an analysis of where that spending is
going.</p><p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="61127-0008.htm_para17"><a name="0611277000013">To take another
set of spending commitments, I have recently been trying to trawl
through parliamentary questions about what is happening in relation to
Government computer projects. The projects currently in operation that
I have had a reply about&#151;about half&#151;have a cumulative
overrun of 47 years. The overrun costs are enormous. Much of that
expenditure has to be analysed critically. We would question the
usefulness of continuing to press ahead with the full NHS IT project at
a time when the NHS budget is under a great deal of pressure.</p><p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="61127-0008.htm_para18"><a name="0611277000014">We have had a debate about the
principles of the ID cards scheme. The Home Secretary referred to it in
his contribution to the debate on the Queen&#146;s Speech. However,
we need to ask questions about the costs and who will pay for the
scheme. The Government have never properly answered that. It has always
been understood that as long as the scheme was voluntary, it would be
paid for by user charges. However, when the former Home Secretary, the
right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke), was in
post, he indicated that when the scheme became compulsory&#151;as it
would in the next Parliament&#151;it would be made free or would be
heavily subsidised at a cost of somewhere between

the Prime Minister&#146;s energy report, which was published by the
Cabinet Office in 2003, was an admirable summary of all the issues
involved in energy policy. It covered the ground well. Security of

The report came to the conclusion that new nuclear power was
unnecessary. A year later the policy changed and we now have an
open-ended commitment to supporting new nuclear power. Again, it is
unclear how that will be funded. Much of it will happen through the
charging policies of the electricity utilities. The Government appear
to have entered into a new set of commitments in relation to
decommissioning and, possibly, the acquisition of land for the new
plants to be established. Again, that has to be factored into public
expenditure.

unrealistic and the considerable limitations in the project management
skills of Mr. Ken Livingstone have been exposed. When the
Chancellor signed up to an open-ended public liability commitment, as
is required by the International Olympic Committee, why did he not
check the costs? What is his estimate of the public liability and,
especially, of the element of that liability that will fall on the

from the very beginning, but we wished to be constructive and wanted
the Olympics to succeed. Clearly, however, we must be prudent about

spending growth, the other element of unsustainability in the economy
relates to personal debt. We have had a remarkable recent trend of
consumer expenditure running ahead of the growth of the national
economy in every single year. One of the consequences of that has been
that the savings ratio has fallen from 10 per cent. to less than 5 per
cent. A further consequence has been the substantial build-up of
personal debt. The aggregate figure, which is about 150 per cent. of
income, is the highest in the developed world by a long way and the
highest in British history. Much of that has been necessitated by the
enormous boom in house prices, with 85 per cent. of that debt secured
against houses. Of course, much of the problem is a matter between
private borrowers and private companies, rather than a matter for the
Government, but the Government could and should be doing many
things.</p><p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="61127-0009.htm_para1"><a name="0611277000022">Over
the years, the Government have talked about promoting generic financial
advice, but very little has happened. They have talked about financial
education, and although a little bit is happening as part of maths
education, we have seen little else. There seemed to be possibilities
for debt pooling, but that has not happened on any scale. We are now
faced with a possible collapse in the insurance market for mortgages,
which would expose many people to vast liabilities and possible
repossession owing to the failure of the market. The Government should
be focusing on those matters, but they are
not.</p><p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="61127-0009.htm_para2"><a name="0611277000023">In the last part
of my speech, I wish to refer to big, long-term issues, which, if
properly handled, could take us very far forward. The first such issue
is the response to Stern. The Government were fortunate to have access
to Nick Stern, who is probably one of the really outstanding economists
in the world. His analysis is outstanding and recognised
internationally. The Stern report came up with several clear
conclusions: action is needed urgently; action is needed initially in
the developed world; and we in this country have responsibility for
sharing the lead on that action. In due course, we will have a system
of internationally traded permits at the European and global levels,
but in the meantime, national policy will largely focus on taxation. We
have led the way in that debate, and the Conservatives are following,
although it is unclear exactly what they are advocating.</p><p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="61127-0009.htm_para3"><a name="0611277000024">We have a difference with the
Government, however. It may be an artificial disagreement, but I hope
that in the course of this debate it will be clarified. The Government
have criticised us, and the Conservatives, for arguing for
environmental taxes on the grounds that there is a fundamental
incompatibility between raising taxes to change behaviour and raising
taxes to raise revenue. I ask the Chancellor to reflect on something
that I am sure he would consider a success, the climate change levy.
The levy has undoubtedly had a significant effect in reducing carbon
emissions; there are good independent academic studies to support that
assertion. It has also raised in total about &#163;4 billion in
revenue, which has been fed back in tax cuts elsewhere.

conclude with a few words on Turner and pensions. There is a broad
consensus on the overriding architecture. We all accept that there has
to be improvement in the basic system of state pensions and it has to
be offset by delayed pension ages. We all agree that there needs to be
a new system of state second pension provision with employer, employee
and Government support. Our disagreements are partly about
timing.</p><p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="61127-0009.htm_para5"><a name="0611277000026">We take the
view that it is unnecessary to depart from Turner&#146;s
recommendations. The Government seem to have brought forward by five
years the later retirement age and postponed by five years the age at
which people will be entitled to earnings linking with their pension.
Of course there are costs involved in that, and there are tough choices
to be made. We believe that the Government have ducked some of those
tough choices in failing to deal, for example, with the issue of public
sector pensions. We also disagree with the Government&#146;s decision
to depart from Turner&#146;s conclusions in respect of women, or more
generally the citizens&#146; chest for
pensions.</p><p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="61127-0009.htm_para6"><a name="0611277000027">The big
philosophical disagreement, however, is about the role of
means-testing. We take the view that the longer the postponement of the
improved state pension, the greater the number of people who will be
sucked into means-testing over a long period, and that will have very
damaging economic consequences. The Government, and particularly the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, of whom I have asked
questions on this matter several times, believe that there is no
significant disincentive effect from a marginal rate of tax and benefit
withdrawal of 40 per cent., but we believe that there is. We find
itvery difficult to square the Government&#146;s relative
agnosticism on this question with their insistence that they must
retain a system of 40 per cent. tax relief for high earners. If
incentives work at the top end of the scale, why do they not work at
the bottom? If incentives are important in saving for pensions, why are
not the Government much more concerned about the damaging impact of
means-testing?</p><p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="61127-0009.htm_para7"><a name="0611277000028">The
Chancellor will shortly have the opportunityto present his
pre-Budget report. It could be an opportunity for crowing and
displaying self-satisfaction, and he will be entitled to a certain
measure of that, but I hope that, in the national interest and in the
interest of his own credibility as Prime Minister, if that is what he
becomes, he will start to acknowledge that there are very serious
problems of imbalances in the British economy which will have to be
addressed, and that there are big long-term challenges in environmental
taxation and pensions policy which the Government are so far
ducking.</p><p><a name="st_o241"><a name="0611277000029"><b><a name="61127-0009.htm_spnew1"><a name="0611277000063">Mr.

those who have seen their occupational pensions disappear in recent
years and are looking for help to remedy that. I do not think that they
would have been much cheered by some of the scenes that we saw earlier.
It was difficult to be impressed by the shadow Chancellor, who gave a
characteristically public school debating speech. He is not here, but
my advice to him would be to adopt a rather different tone if he wants

say that although it is good that we are all getting exercised by
Farepak, giving a day&#146;s salary and participating in other

dealing with people who have tried to do everything right. They have
tried not to run up debts, including credit card debt, and have sought
to save in the safest way possible. One lady said to me, &#147;You
may think it silly that I did not just put the money into the bank and
get some interest on it, but I know that had I done so I would have
taken that money during the year.&#148; These are the people with
whom we are dealing, and they are asking how companies, banks and

what they are going to do about it, both in a rescue sense and, more

group is made up of all those people, possibly numbering up to 120,000,
who lost some or all of their occupational pension scheme when schemes
wound up between 1997 and 2004. This case has now been exhaustively
analysed by the parliamentary ombudsman, so we have no excuse for not
knowing the facts. An inadequate regulatory framework enabled events to
happen. People thought that the final salary pension schemes were safe,
as they had been told endlessly.</p><p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="61127-0009.htm_para15"><a name="0611277000045">Indeed, the
previous Conservative Government took action after the Maxwell case,
which affected some 30,000 people. At that time, we put together a
compensation package that provided almost total compensation within
weeks. After that case, the Pensions Act 1995 was enacted, setting in
place a regulatory structure with minimal funding requirements and so
on, which effectively told people, &#147;Your final salary pension
scheme is safe&#148;. As the parliamentary ombudsman has shown us,
official literature told people that that was the case. In fact, they
were not safe, and thousands of people who did nothing wrong but
believe the assurances they were given have lost the whole of their
lifetime pension savings. Of course they ask, like the Farepak
customers, &#147;How could this have happened? We did everything
right&#151;we did everything that we were told to do. We were
prudent. We saved&#151;we invested in our pensions&#151;and this
has happened.&#148; Of course they ask the Government to put together
a compensation package, as happened in the case of Maxwell, and then
want them to take steps, as they already have, to ensure that this does
not happen again.</p><p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="61127-0009.htm_para16"><a name="0611277000046">As I
understand it, the Government have a twofold response on why they
cannot do what is sought. First, they say, &#147;It&#146;s not
entirely our responsibility.&#148; The answer to that is that no one
has said that it is entirely the responsibility of the
Government&#151;by that I mean the previous Government and this
one&#151;but the fact is that they put in place the regulatory
framework within which such schemes operate, they said what would
happen when they were wound up and what the order of priority was, they
put in a minimum funding requirement, and they put out leaflets telling
people that the schemes were safe, guaranteed and protected by law. It
is therefore not surprising that people now say: &#147;You have an
obligation to do something about the collapse of these schemes and the
collapse of our entire pension
savings.&#148;</p><p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="61127-0009.htm_para17"><a name="0611277000047">The
second argument that the Government use is that it would be
extraordinarily expensive to provide a compensation package for those
affected. I understand why they should say that&#151;there is an
argument about what the figure really is&#151;but I do not want to be
detained by that point. My point is that it is a curious argument that
says that if the figure were less and fewer people were affected, it
would not be so difficult to remedy the injustice, which the ombudsman
found be at least partly a consequence of official maladministration.
It is a curious argument that says that because the problem is serious
and significantly affects large numbers of people it cannot be
remedied, whereas if it were a smaller problem it could be remedied.
That cannot be a tenable position to hold. I hope that the Government
are still in discussions about this and that they will seek to build on
the financial assistance scheme that they have already introduced in
order to provide more effective assistance for these people, because
whoever is culpable for what has happened, they certainly are
not.</p><br>

been dogged for decades by our inability to think other than in the
short term or to think outside the box of normal tribal, adversarial
party politics. That is why we have a pensions system of such
complexity, with bits added on but no fundamental reform. There was a
nice moment in the 1950s when the Labour party had proposed a
comprehensive pensions scheme called the national superannuation
scheme, causing the Macmillan Government to reflect on what to do in
response. Macmillan wrote to his

goes against the grain and cuts against the culture, but it is
something that we must do. I give the Government credit for
establishing the Pensions Commission and the other reviews to try to
enable us to deal with such issues in a rather more sensible and
long-term way than we have done before. If we do that, we bring credit

that it was going in the wrong direction and becoming less
tax-competitive. Were I giving such a presentation today, I would
conclude that we are now not tax-competitive enough. How many more
companies need to say that they are thinking of going offshore before
the Chancellor and the Economic Secretary will do something? Have they
considered what has happened in the case of Shell, which has decided to
put everything into Holland? Do they realise that Holland, let alone
Ireland, is now more tax-competitive than Britain? Will they understand
that Ireland has been growing three times as quickly as the United
Kingdom on this Chancellor&#146;s watch? The main reason for that,
which he does not wish to accept, is that Ireland has set much lower

has it taken almost 10 years for the Government to realise that we have
a transport crisis in this country? It is no good their saying that
there was not enough investment in the railways 35 years ago. There has
not been enough investment in any kind of transport for the last
decade. It was this Government who cancelled the road schemes. It is
this Government who have come up with no new main rail scheme at all:
they merely finished off the channel link that we had already
introduced. It is this Government who have not come up with any new
tube line, unlike the last Conservative Government, who initiated a
major new line. Absolutely nothing has been happening on this

transport.</p><p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="61127-0010.htm_para2"><a name="06112715000021">I
think the Government have now realised, after nine years or more, that
our big problem is a shortage of transport of all kinds. It is no good
taking the route suggested by the Deputy Prime Minister, who said that
the problem could be dealt with by our switching modes&#151;making it
very difficult for people to drive around in their cars and vans, so
that they would go shopping by train and transport their goods as rail
freight. Given that the railways account for only about 6 per cent. of
journey miles undertaken, even if the Government could double their
size that would deal with only a couple of years&#146; increase in
travel in a strongly growing economy. The Government must realise that
while we need more railway capacity, we also need much more road
capacity. If the Government wish to be serious about reducing carbon
emissions, they must understand that making traffic flow more swiftly
is a way of doing that. The main problem of carbon emissions for road
transport is the number of cars, lorries and vans that are stuck in
traffic jams, thus creating a great deal more
pollution.</p><p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="61127-0010.htm_para3"><a name="06112715000022">Another
problem is that the Government heap regulation upon regulation on our
poor economy. That is why the trend rate of growth in productivity and
output per head is slowing under this Government: the extra burdens of
tax and regulation are proving too great. It is why we have lost more
than a million manufacturing jobs on the Chancellor&#146;s watch so
far. The Chancellor never bothers to tell the House about that figure,
although he used to be very interested in manufacturing job losses when
he was in opposition. He always told us that he would follow a policy
that changed all that, but in many ways his record is far worse than
that of previous Governments, with over a million jobs gone and all
those interventions&#151;all the extra regulation and

that they will act at some point, but I believe that since the Prime
Minister announced his initiative a further 5,000 regulations have been
added to the statute book. I do not suppose the Minister can recall the
names of any of the regulations that the Government have struck off, so
few and so unimportant were they. We need the Government to do
something like what the Dutch have done. They have in place, and
working very effectively, a system of cutting the regulatory burden

pain of the heavy energy-using industries, whose representatives have
been coming to this House for many months to lobby MPs of all political
persuasions. The price of energy in Britain is far too expensive
compared with places such as Holland, let alone lower wage areas of the
world. That is why we are losing big new investments such as that in
extra steel capacity. Such investors would rather go to a place like
Holland where the gas supplies are more reliable and the price is a lot
cheaper than here in the United Kingdom.</p><p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="61127-0010.htm_para7"><a name="06112715000026">On this Government&#146;s
watch, we have in terms of energy gone from being a relatively low-cost
country to being a high-cost and uncertain supply country. On this
Government&#146;s watch, we have had no proper response on how they
will fill the gap as and when the nuclear power stations have to be
retired, and as the easy supplies from our sector of the North sea
dwindle or no longer meet the requirements of our gas-using industries,
homes and offices.</p><p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="61127-0010.htm_para8"><a name="06112715000027">We
desperately need policy now from this Government on energy, but all we
have had is a weak statement of intent and an expression of the wish to
consult and have another public debate on the nuclear issue. We are
beyond the point where we need a debate; we are at the point where we
need regulatory decisions and other decisions from the Government, and
ways in which the private sector can then get on and make the necessary
investments.</p><p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="61127-0010.htm_para9"><a name="06112715000028">I suspect
that the Economic Secretary to the Treasury is already thinking that he
can now add up some figures to show that what is wanted is more railway
investment, more road investment and more energy investment and that
that can all be put down to the public sector. But please will those on
the Treasury Bench be a little less juvenile on this occasion? Most, if
not all, of that investment could be put in through private sector
activity. We know that people want to spend more on transport. We see
them spending fortunes on private transport. They spend a great deal on
new vans, new cars and new lorries because they feel that that is the
only option that they have for many of their journeys and business
tasks. They are prepared to spend, but the Government have to grant the
planning permissions, create the framework and provide the rules for
infrastructure investment, because infrastructure is important, and
there is a need for it to extend across the country, which obviously
affects interests around the country.</p><p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="61127-0010.htm_para10"><a name="06112715000029">Investment in energy should
come wholly from the private sector. Why is that not happening at
present? Because the Government are not giving a certain sound on the
trumpet in respect of how the rules will be worked out, what the
pricing mechanisms will be, which planning permissions will be
available and which technologies are favoured. It is up to the
Government to make clearer sounds, and private investment will then
follow.</p><br>

moments in the Chancellor&#146;s speech came when he said that he was
going to tell us something about improving skills in Britain, but he
then went off on yet another rant about some statement made by some
Conservative Back Bencher, which obviously fascinated him rather more.
It would have been good to have heard from the Chancellor about what he
is going to do about the5.3 million people on benefits, many
of whom would like, or need, jobs. We know about the unemployed; we
have already heard in this debate about the plight of the unemployed
and rising unemployment. But there are many other people, such as those
on single-parent benefit and disability benefit, who would like jobs of
a kind, and who could make a contribution, but they are not managing to
get those jobs.</p><p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="61127-0010.htm_para12"><a name="06112715000031">We
are told that the Government wish to do something about that. What are
they going to do about it? Ten years on, have they yet found the magic
key to the door? Will they do something to improve the quality and
attractiveness of vocational skills? Will they get rid of some of the
awful bureaucracy that stands between the employer and the potential
student and the vocational training course? Will they do more to
strengthen the vocational strand for 14 to 16-year-olds in schools? A
few schools are doing well&#151;as is one in my
constituency&#151;but others have not copied what they do or followed
on from that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="61127-0010.htm_para13"><a name="06112715000032">When
will the Government do more to help higher education? We have some very
fine universities in this country, and they remain high up in the world
league tables, but the Chancellor must have noticed that Harvard is
getting into a league of its own, given the amount of money it raises
and its success not only in attracting money, but in investing that
money very well. I suspect we in Britain need to freshen-up the range
of tax reliefs to private donors to universities, because we need to
strengthen the voluntary principle and the endowment funding of our
universities; that is falling a long way behind the levels of private
endowment that the leading US institutions enjoy.</p><p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="61127-0010.htm_para14"><a name="06112715000033">Why does that matter? It
matters because if people want to have a top university, they have to
be able to pay top dollar to get the best brains to become faculty
members. If they wish to have a top university, they need to attract
the most talented students from anywhere in the world, and some of them
come from very poor families, and if they can offer bursaries,
scholarships, travel grants and so forth, that helps to attract such
talent.</p><p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="61127-0010.htm_para15"><a name="06112715000034">Will the
Chancellor also have a word with the Home Office about such
people&#146;s access to visas? Genuine students have difficulties in
getting visas to enter our country, which puts them off and means that
they would rather go to the United States of America. For example,
there can be difficulties in them getting a visa for one year of
working after they have graduated in Britain&#151;because they wish
to get the experience as well as the academic
qualification&#151;before they go home, where they wish to go. The
Government could take an interest in practical measures and in doing
something, if they were not spending all their time reading
Conservative websites and Back-Bench Conservative Members&#146;
speeches.</p><br>

Scotland is a much more attractive part of the United Kingdom to live
in than most others. Although the south-east has a growing economy,
there is congestion and young people working in professions such as
teaching and social services and in the more minor professions, which
do not pay the large wages that the City pays, cannot afford to buy a
house. In Scotland, however, we have got the balance right and growth
has been steady. There are people in my constituency who are in work,
education or higher education and were not when the Conservatives were
in power. That slow, steady growth has meant that we have not had the
boom and bust in the housing market that England experienced. We should
be proud of what has been achieved. I know that my hon. Friend thinks
that independence for Scotland would mean a new start and that things
would be completely different, but, as an economist, I disagree. The
parameters of this growth are based on a United Kingdom economy, not on
a small economy and country of 5 million people, most of whose large
companies are located elsewhere.</p><p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="61127-0010.htm_para23"><a name="06112722000010">What could

approach and take the issues on board. Let us have a serious debate,
unlike what we heard earlier in response to the Chancellor&#146;s

that the economy is on a stable trajectory, and that it is not

know that when we add a service charge in a restaurantwhen
paying by credit card or cheque, it does not go to the person who
served us. By law, it belongs to the proprietor. The reality is that
regulation 31(1)(e) of the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999,
which were passed by this Labour Government, says that any money paid
through the payroll&#151;be it a gratuity, a service charge or a

through the payroll, so that they can be charged to the minimum wage.
It also says that if a tronc&#151;in other words, a kitty&#151;is
paid through the payroll, that counts toward the minimum wage too. I
have been to restaurants in Glasgow and in London with very expensive

about that, they said, &#147;Yes, it does&#151;and it is part of,

to do something for labour&#151;for the least well paid in this

Currently, British workers are being laid off and taken back on as
agency workers, with no right to holidays, sickness pay or a pension,

worker is not an employee: they are not employed by the agency or by

what exactly has the Treasury been able to seize from those suspected
of involvement in terrorist activity? The true figure, as revealed
following patient detective work by my hon. Friend the Member for
Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), amounts to only &#163;476,000
since 2002. That figure compares with some $200 million frozen by the
American authorities. The Treasury&#146;s effort is tiny by
comparison. Its dragnet has caught minnows, not sharks. It has also had
significant holes in it. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping
Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) pointed out, Abu Hamza&#151;now,
happily, convicted of terrorist offences&#151;whose assets were
supposed to have been frozen, was able to transfer ownership of his
home to his son, allowing his family to play the property market. How
could Abu Hamza do that? It was because of a loophole that the
Government had failed to address. The initial order, introduced in
2001, froze only funds, not assets. No change was made in that order
until last month, just as the news of Abu Hamza&#146;s situation was
breaking in the newspapers. The loophole existed for four years and
allowed someone convicted of terrorist offences to play the property
market with public
money.</p><p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="61127-0011.htm_para18"><a name="06112715000073">Another area of
profound concern was reported in <i> The Sunday Telegraph</i> yesterday.
The European Union has stepped in to prevent the details of bank
transfers being released to the US authorities when they fear that
those transfers may materially affect terrorist activity. The European
Union has ruled that privacy must come before security, but it will
allow those same bank transfers to be scrutinised for taxation
purposes. The Chancellor, in his speech on 10 October, stressed that he
and Hank Paulson, the US Treasury Secretary, would take proactive steps
to ensure that no regulation came between us and our security. Why are
those EU regulations still in place, despite the Chancellor&#146;s
brave words? In those three specific areas, the Treasury has not dealt
effectively with terrorist financing, despite the Chancellor&#146;s
putting the subject at the centre of his pattern of activities for the
year.</p><p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="61127-0011.htm_para19"><a name="06112715000074">In his speech,
the Chancellor raised other real concerns about the way in which
terrorism thrives as a result of the activity of extremist
organisations. In a speech to the Foreign Policy Centre earlier this
year, the Prime Minister pointed out that the threat that we face is
not just physical but ideological. That ideological threat is rooted in
the particular twisting of Islam known as Islamism, which has been
propagated by organisations such as the Muslim Brotherhood. That
organisation has a UK branch known as the Muslim Association of
Britain, and it is the UK branch of the organisation known in the
Palestinian territories as Hamas. However, there has been no effective
scrutiny by the Government or the Treasury of the Muslim Association of
Britain&#146;s activities or funding.</p><p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="61127-0011.htm_para20"><a name="06112715000075">Crucially,

under the control of a man who was responsible for praising suicide

charity in this country was identified as having direct links with
Hamas and terrorist fundraising. That charity is Interpal, which had
been investigated by the Charity Commission. However, John
Ware&#146;s report revealed new, troubling details, including the
fact that one of Interpal&#146;s trustees, Mr. Ibrahim
Hewitt, was appointed by the Government to their &#147;Preventing

have asked the Charity Commission to look again at Interpal&#146;s

eventually published, the Charity Commission is given new powers to
investigate proactively groups that spread terror and proselytise for
extremism, under the cloak of charitable activity?</p><p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="61127-0011.htm_para23"><a name="06112715000078">To be fair to the Government,
two charities have been interdicted following action by the Treasury:
Sanabel and al-Haramain. Those two charities are significant, because
both are Saudi-based. In the United States Senate, the senior senator
for New York, the democrat Charles Schumer, pointed out that
Saudi-sponsored activity was responsible for the hijacking of moderate
Islam and the spread of fundamentalist doctrine in schools, mosques and
prisons. In a submission to the US Senate, Steven Emerson has pointed
out the way in which organisations use the cloak of charitable activity
to proselytise for an extremist agenda. In many cases, they choose to
work through the direct funding of
mosques.</p><p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="61127-0011.htm_para24"><a name="06112715000079">There are
some 1,600 mosques in Britain, most of them exemplary houses of
instruction that provide spiritual nourishment to our fellow citizens,
and that teach them in a tradition that all of us would think
admirable. However, there are mosques&#151;some with direct
relationships with Saudi Arabia&#151;that do not cleave to the
moderate mainstream path taken by the majority of British Muslims. I
shall mention two of them. One subject of concern is the East London
mosque, which is one of the largest in Britain. Its president, Dr.
Muhammad Abdul Bari, is the chairman of the Muslim Council of Britain,
but the speaker invited to open the mosque, Sheikh al-Sudais, had
preached sermons in his native Saudi Arabia in which he described
Jewish people as pigs and monkeys. He has called Hindus
idol-worshippers to whom it would be wrong to speak sweetly. That is an
example of Saudi influence raising profound concerns.</p><br>

even more profound concern arises in connection with the plans, in east
London, for the erection of the largest mosque&#151;indeed, the
largest house of worship&#151;in the country. It is intended to
accommodate between 40,000 and 70,000 worshippers, and it is estimated
that it will cost between &#163;100 million and &#163;300 million.
The mosque, which is being built by an organisation called Tablighi
Jamaat, raises profound concerns, not least because that organisation
has been described by French intelligence as an &#147;antechamber of
fundamentalism&#148;. Two of the 7/7 bombers had direct links with
the Tablighi Jamaat mosque in Dewsbury. Richard Reid, the shoe-bomber,
had links with the organisation, as did John Walker Lindh, the
so-called American Taliban. How can an organisation that, according to
the Charity Commission, records an income of just &#163;500,000 a

sincere in his determination to combat terrorism and root out the
extremism that sustains it, but unless he shows a greater degree of
urgency in dealing with the problem, and a greater attention to detail
when matters are brought before Ministers, and unless he empowers the

insecurity and pressures on the demand for low-cost social housing

perceived race to the bottom caused by the deregulation of labour
markets, and driven by patterns of migration. The third is access to
quality health care, partly as a consequence of primary care cuts.
However, the overriding element contributing to insecurity is the
community&#146;s inability to comprehend the sheer velocity of change
caused by patterns of migration to our borough. That raises big issues
of public policy, resource allocation and the economics of the
Queen&#146;s Speech, as set out today.</p><br>

interested in the independent statistical system, and I am keen to
raise a few issues on class, migration and race. I regularly ask the
Office for National Statistics what the population of my borough is,
and it regularly tells me that it is 164,000, and has been since 2001.
Our borough has the lowest-cost housing in Greater London, and as a
consequence it exerts a magnetic pull, in terms of migration within the
city&#146;s boundaries. In addition&#151;this is a classic hallmark
of patterns of migration to cities&#151;migrant communities have
moved into the lowest-cost housing market in search of low-cost
housing. The cumulative effect is that the population is growing
dramatically, but that occurs off the radar of public policy-making,

formula.</p><p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="61127-0012.htm_para4"><a name="06112715000085">The only
statistical series that begin to catch such movements of people are the
education rolls. From 2003 until 2005-06, the story shows that the
white population in our community was dropping by about3 or 4
per cent. a year. If there was a pro rata effect across the whole
borough, whose population is between 160,000 and 170,000, the change in
ethnicity&#151;from white, indigenous English to black African
families&#151;would be between 4,000 and 5,000. Analysis of the
education rolls shows an expansion in the head count of the population,
too.</p><p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="61127-0012.htm_para5"><a name="06112715000086">There are
massive movements of people in terms of both the qualitative make-up of
the community and the total head count, yet the state is attached to a
census formula that gives a completely different picture of the
communities we represent. That has huge implications in communities
such as mine, where there are enduring inequalities in health and
access to public services, as well as long-term legacies owing to
poverty and social immobility. The population is growing faster in real
terms than the state is refinancing public services. As a consequence,
we can make a strong case that things are in decline in real terms,
because the social wage is in decline, especially when analysed
alongside the effects of patterns of migration and labour market
deregulation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="61127-0012.htm_para6"><a name="06112715000087">It will
be interesting to see whether the independent statistical system will
be able to grapple with such issues in future. I realise that there are
the beginnings of a central locus of analysis in relation to the future
comprehensive spending review, but I want to throw out a few questions
about how we can reconcile that with the real-time demographic picture,
especially in the poorer urban communities that take the strain of
massive population flows. How can we adjust public policy making so
that we go with the grain of those movements rather than simply
offering diminishing returns in our understanding of, and investment
in, those communities, because of the increasing rupture between the
formal apparatus of state decision making and the reality of population
flows?</p><p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="61127-0012.htm_para7"><a name="06112715000088">ONS analysis

some examples of the effects of labour market movements to show why
such policies would be important in helping communities such as mine.
As I said, there has been a massive change in the qualitative make-up
of the population, as well as the total number. Many new residents are
employed by employment agencies, which has caused real pressures at the
bottom of the labour market. At one of my surgeries a few weeks ago,
the first case involved some residents who came to see me about east
European gang workers being paid &#163;15 a day on a public contract.
As that is substantially below the minimum wage, they were rightly
concerned about the consequential effects on broader labour market
conditions in the
area.</p><p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="61127-0012.htm_para9"><a name="06112715000090">The fifth case
involved a roofer whose hourly wage rate had dropped &#163;2.50 in
six months. The penultimate case that night was a guy who wanted to
know what I could do about the shed opposite his house. I found out
that the person had put a cooker in the shed at the bottom of his
garden and rented it out to eight east European guys who were
hot-bedding in it. They were in a labour gang employed on contracts in
the local community.</p><p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="61127-0012.htm_para10"><a name="06112715000091">I
raise those issues to show how demographic movements have consequential
effects on other forms of economic activity in communities such as
mine, especially in the labour market. Putting that alongside the
consumption of public services can create real, material tensions in
respect of the allocation of resources and labour market competition in
some of the more challenging parts of cities such as London.</p><p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="61127-0012.htm_para11"><a name="06112715000092">Such material conditions
account for part of the rise of the far right, which seeks to pit
community against community. However, the real issue is whether a
mature debate on the Queen&#146;s Speech and the Government&#146;s
economic strategy can actually build a real-time demographic picture of
communities such as mine, and offer both resource allocation solutions
that anticipate population movements and a labour market strategy that
stops the contemporary race to the bottom, which creates and fuels real
tensions.</p><p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="61127-0012.htm_para12"><a name="06112715000093">When my hon.

remedy that I suggested is critical to supply different footings for
the labour market economy to neutralise the seductive messages of the
far right, which argues that competition at the bottom of the labour
market is racialising the community owing to the threat posed by A8
migrants. I am, of course, aware of some of the debates in the European
Community about the 12-month threshold, but such policy initiatives are
critical if the Government are to be proactive in choking off the
downward pressures at the bottom of the labour market, which fuel
difficulties and tensions in communities such as mine, creating a
breeding-ground for political extremism.</p><br>

flexibility for changes at the top of the Government during this
parliamentary Session. My mind could not help but go back to
discussions that the Prime Minister and I have had, at his behest, over
the past few years. The Prime Minister tried to dissuade me from
Liberal Democrat support for a referendum on the single European
currency, which he thought was a daft idea. When that was put on the
shelf, he tried to dissuade me from Liberal Democrat support for a
referendum on the proposed new European constitution. At that time, I

such proposition with a bargepole, yet, lo and behold, a few weeks
later they did.</p><p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="61127-0012.htm_para16"><a name="06112722000034">It was

economic shocks that derailed previous Labour and Conservative
Governments. Yes, the oil price has been a difficulty, but we have not
had a devaluation. Yes, conflict has cost the country a great deal of
money,but overall the economy has been quite benign,
comparatively speaking, and quite successful. Against that backdrop, we
can have a sensible debate, even if I notice that Lord Rees-Mogg has
turned his attention in his column today to what we do when there is a
collapse in the housing market. I have not studied his article in

have justified their policy for England and Wales, they have readily
acknowledged that they have not begun to attack the broader funding
dilemmas of the UK university sector as a whole, which were well
touched on by the chairman of the Conservative policy review, the right
hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood). It seems to me that
we are not solving the big problem, while loading in many disincentives
for people who cannot be helped. I hope that in the different devolved

of the ironies of social policy affecting our older citizens. The
demography is such that we know that we now have a more active older
citizenry, yet the complexities of the operation of pension policy and
tax and benefits policy mean that the physical well-being and good will
of old people is not being utilised as much as it could be. As we look
to developments in social policy for the rest of this Parliament, I
hope that we will take account of the opportunities that exist. It
seems a shame that greater social flexibility does not lead to more
flexibility whereby older people in their 50s and 60s may dip in and
out of the labour market. Perhaps they no longer want or have to work
full-time, but want to work part-time without the system operating
against their interests. Much more could be done.</p><p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="61127-0012.htm_para22"><a name="06112722000042">Over a number of years,
Government and parliamentary rhetoric from all parties has seemed to
encourage use of the experience that older people bring to the labour
market, but what else are we doing? We seem to be presiding over the
wholesale demolition of local sub-post offices, and for which group of
people does that cause the most anxiety? What disincentive is that for
active citizens who do not have the access that they would wish to
enjoy to a wide range of services? More imaginative policies could
help, but they are not adequately dealt with in the Queen&#146;s

end of the age spectrum, the Government have pledged to look again at
the system of child support. I am sure that we are all often or
occasionally asked the question of what vote we most regret having cast
during our time in Parliament. In my case, it is a vote that I never
cast&#151;none of us did. There was an all-party agreement that the
principle behind the establishment of the Child Support Agency was a
good one. Without any rigour being brought to bear on the matter, we
ended up with something that entered into the realms of retrospection
and became more of a cash cow for the Treasury, rather than tackling
what it was supposed to tackle&#151;the social injustice of, mainly,
men not being around and failing to live up to their financial
responsibilities to the women and children whom they had probably
walked away from. It was a terrible error in which all three UK parties

away from the principle, as I see it, that a tax system should be
progressive and that we should not resile from redistribution as a
genuine and authentic aim of such a tax system&#151;provided, of
course, that we are in favour of a society in which those who are able
to be entrepreneurial, to take risks and to generate considerable
wealth are not held back and the state does not forget through the tax

point relates simply to pensions, which have been referred to during

the way in which the Government have gone about pension

conviction and credibility and that helped to begin to sow the seeds of
all-party consensus that probably even a couple of years ago would have
seemed like a mission impossible&#151;with the way in which our
future energy needs, particularly the civil nuclear role, has been
handled, with no proper independent evaluation and no sense of

me that arguably one of the most important measures in the Gracious

than the weighty Stern report as the fashion-statement approach to
environmental issues displayed by Opposition Members. The report is
obviously right to begin with a statement of the ethical and scientific

clearly or more precisely than John Locke in

science, the Stern report has made it very clear that we are now up
against an exceptionally tight timetable. We have only 10 to 15 years
to stabilise and reduce emissions. That is particularly important in my
constituency. At the rural end of my constituency in Upper Teesdale,
unique biodiversity exists that has survived from the last ice age.
Plants such as the spring gentian only grow in the north Pennines area
of outstanding natural beauty. Those plants and that biodiversity will
be completely destroyed by global warming. It is, of course, worth
noting that while humans might have strategies for mitigation and

who are concerned about the environment are frequently portrayed as
romantic impossibilists, but Stern has shown that there is an economic
case for action. At the other end of my constituency in Bishop
Auckland, we have a manufacturing base that is already changing shape
and showing how a new green model for the economy can operate. We have
a monthly farmers&#146; market in Barnard Castle, where people can
buy and eat local and seasonal food without the burden of air miles. We
have the Farmway farmers&#146; co-operative, which is the first link
in the supply chain for biofuels that goes through to Teesside. The
Glaxo plant, which is the most energy efficient one in the world, has
two windmills to supply its electricity. CAA Roofing has developed a
new solar wall system to trap the sun&#146;s heat for buildings.
Teescraft Engineering is considering constructing wind turbines. Thorn
Lighting has just decided to build a completely new plant. It has a
research and development programme with Durham university for low
organic lighting. That will involve the biggest change in the way that
we light our houses since the invention of the light bulb. All those
examples show that greening the economy can create new

Government&#146;s policy of supporting science and encouraging links

Chancellor&#146;s announcement of the energy technologies institute
is one of the most forward-looking policies that we could have. We need
to do more to simplify planning and building regulations, to reform the

we look across the board at the competitiveness of the economy, we need
to consider those sectors with high energy use where the picture is
obviously trickier. There are two examples in my constituency: a glass
recycling plant, Potters-Ballotini, and Wienerberger&#146;s Eldon
brickworks. Both have had serious problems in the past two years
because of high energy prices. In fact, both have had to close furnaces
for several months at a time. Excellent chapters in the Stern report
look at how we should address the needs of heavy industry. Table 11A is
quite compendiousand sets out statistics for UK production
sectors in123 different areas and shows that glass and bricks
are 10 times more carbon intensive than the financial sector. However,
I do not take the lesson from that that everybody can or should become
a banker.</p><p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="61127-0013.htm_para9"><a name="06112723000009">The position
of heavily energy intensive industries is a clear demonstration of the
need for an internationally co-ordinated approach to climate change.
There will be no environmental benefit if relatively efficient UK plant
moves overseas where environmental standards are lower and from which
transport costs are high. The Stern report suggests international
trading agreements by sector, and I agree. Obviously, we do not want to
impede major technological progress such as that by Thorn Lighting that
I described earlier, but exporting all our heavy industry is unlikely
to be the best environmental solution.</p><p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="61127-0013.htm_para10"><a name="06112723000010">Despite the 574 pages of the

true at all. We need to knock that myth on the head now. Last year, 10
per cent. of flights were taken by people in the bottom 25 per cent. of

everyone felt that they would be a complete disaster. However, in the

was sent by what is now the Department for International Development to
Prague to advise the transitional Government in Czechoslovakia on its
energy crisis. It was facing a situation rather like the one in Ukraine
last year. I found an economy that had been protected from the real
costs of energy. It was hopelessly sluggish and old fashioned. Forests
were dying because of acid rain and every building that one went
into&#151;whether a private home or an office&#151;was completely
stifling. There were no thermostats, so one could not switch the
heating off. Industry also used out-of-date stock. By introducing
proper energy pricing, all that has changed. The Czech and Slovak
Republics now have dynamic economies. They are growing modern
democracies and full participants in the European

David Gauke (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> It is a
great pleasure to have an opportunity to speak in today&#146;s
debate. In particular, I would like to address the rather topical issue
of our taxation system and the relationship it has with productivity. I
say that it is topical in part because of the report produced by the
CBI this morning. The survey looked at business&#146;s attitude to
taxation in this country. I am afraid that the picture is not a happy
one. According to the survey,70 per cent. of senior business
men who responded believe that the UK is a poorer international
business location than it was in 2001. Some 75 per cent. say that the
corporate tax regime is worse than it was in 2001 and 19 per cent. of
UK companies are considering moving their headquarters abroad, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) mentioned
earlier today.</p><br>

corporation tax rate among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development countries. It is now the 18th highest. However,
rates&#151;particularly corporation tax rates&#151;are not the be
all and end all of taxation. It is the habit of the Government, and of
the Chancellor in particular, to quote the fact that corporation tax
rates have fallen since 1997. That ignores two points. According to a
recent World Bank report corporation tax constitutes, on average, only
36 per cent. of the total amount paid by businesses. These things have
to be looked at relatively. There was a time, say in 1997, when our
business taxation rates were lower than the OECD average, but that is
no longer the case, because our competitors are cutting taxes whereas
we are going in the other direction. That is why we are rapidly
approaching the point where the tax burden in this country will be
greater than that in Germany. That puts us at a competitive
disadvantage, at least compared with where we were only a few years
ago.</p><p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="61127-0013.htm_para21"><a name="06112723000026">As I mentioned
earlier, rates are only one aspect of taxation; there is also tax
complexity. The Government have a poor record in that area and there is
nothing in the Queen&#146;s Speech as such that will address that. We
wait to see whether the Finance Bill in this parliamentary Session will
attempt to address it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="61127-0013.htm_para22"><a name="06112723000027">Returning to the CBI survey, 95
per cent. of business people say that the tax system should be
simplified. That hardly comes as a surprise. However, the external
experts have been damning when it comes to the position that we face in
this country. KPMG

general trend for the UK&#146;s tax system in recent years has been

clear that the system has become progressively more complex over a

market&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="61127-0013.htm_para24"><a name="06112723000029">The Chartered

goes much further than that...Certainly the UK&#146;s

undermined.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="61127-0013.htm_para25"><a name="06112723000030">It
is always difficult to quantify complexity, but there are one or two
rough and ready measures that are worth looking at. One is the length
of handbooks. In 1997, Tolley&#146;s <i> Yellow Tax Handbook</i> of
the British tax code was 4,555 pages long; it is now 9,841. In a report
published a week or so ago, the World Bank noticed that, among the
major economies, only India has a longer tax code than the
UK.</p><p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="61127-0013.htm_para26"><a name="06112723000031">Another rough
and ready measure is Finance Acts. I say this with some feeling having
served on the Committee on the previous Finance
Bill<i> &#151;</i>[Hon. Members: &#147;Hear,
hear.&#148;] I am grateful for those comments, which I hope will be
recorded in <i> Hansard. </i>One hears stories from the old hands about
how they stayed up all night considering Finance Bills in the 1980s.
Those Finance Bills were only 157 pages
long.</p><br>

Devine:</b> As a result of Farepak&#146;s
collapse, hundreds of thousands of hard-working families have, in
effect, seen Christmas cancelled. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the
Labour Government of 1948 introduced the Companies Bill, section 332 of
which would have protected those families? However, the Act of 1985,
which he is making light comment on, destroyed the right of those
people to get their money
back.</p><p><a name="st_o291"><a name="06112723000033"><b><a name="61127-0013.htm_spnew7"><a name="06112723000109">Mr.
Gauke:</b> First, I think that the hon. Gentleman is referring
to the Companies Act 1985. I am referring to Finance Acts. Secondly,
the sympathy of us all goes out to those who have suffered under
Farepak&#151;I am sure that he would agree that this is not a party
political point&#151;but the Government have been in place for nine
years, so if there is a fault with the legislation, which I am not
necessarily saying that there is, those remarks should be directed to
his own Front Bench. I was trying to make the point that Finance Bills
have grown in length substantially. Between 2000 and 2005, they were
481 pages long.</p><p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="61127-0013.htm_para27"><a name="06112723000034">The
third assessment of complexity involves looking at the World Economic
Forum, which produces a rating on these matters. Looking at the
UK&#146;s global competitiveness on tax complexity, in
2004-05&#151;not that long ago&#151;it was 48th, but within a year
it had moved to 67th. Again, there is an element of too much
complexity. It is worth noting that the survey undertaken by the tax
reform commission, which was commissioned by my hon. Friend the shadow
Chancellor, showed that 60 per cent. of businesses are increasing
spending on tax planning at the moment. Some 78 per cent. said that the
level of tax complexity has increased in the past five years.</p><p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="61127-0013.htm_para28"><a name="06112723000035">There is a further issue with
complexity. There are obviously the compliance costs and so on. The
major concern is unpredictability and instability. When we look at the
developing world and think about how it can develop further, most
people consider issues such as property rights, certainty within the
taxation system and so on. We do not face anything like the problems
that exist in some developing world countries, but the economic point
remains the same. It is bad for an economy to have an arbitrary,
unpredictable taxation system. Business needs confidence to invest and
the taxation system can undermine that confidence.</p><p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="61127-0013.htm_para29"><a name="06112723000036">Various elements make up the
concerns with regard to unpredictability. First, there is the extent of
the changes, to which I referred earlier. When we have large Finance
Bills and there are substantial changes to taxation, year on year, that
causes concern. There is also concern about the sheer level of
complexity. It is difficult for businesses, even when advised by highly
skilled advisers, to know what their tax liabilities are.</p><p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="61127-0013.htm_para30"><a name="06112723000037">There is also
a concern about extra powers for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs. I am thinking in particular of a recent consultation document
about additional powers. PricewaterhouseCoopers, for example, has made
representations to the Treasury to say that it recognises the
advantages of harmonising and modernising the powers of HMRC. However,
it says that while harmonisation and modernisation are one
thing,</p><a name="61127-0013.htm_brev5"><a name="06112723000093"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;taking the most

doubt from the tone of the submission made by PWC that it is sceptical
about that. There is also a concern&#151;again, I can see it in
documentation from PWC&#151;about too much discretion for HMRC. It
raises the concern that the Revenue was often able to manage
legislation by means of such devices as frequently asked questions.
That creates difficulty for business. There is no doubt that there is
increasing evidence that the relationship between businesses and HMRC
is deteriorating.</p><p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para1"><a name="06112723000040">I
have no doubt that tax evasion must be tackled&#151;the Government
are right to try to do so&#151;but the balance must be right. I am
worried that the increased complexity that is being weighed on business
is having a serious impact on it, partly due to a lack of certainty.
Support for the view that businesses lack certainty in the tax system
comes from today&#146;s CBI survey, which shows that 23 per cent. of
the business people who responded said that the way in which their
company&#146;s tax returns had been treated had declined since the
creation of HMRC. Something is going wrong with the relationship
between businesses and HMRC when that is happening. The Queen&#146;s
Speech contained no measures to address such
concerns.</p><p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para2"><a name="06112723000041">It is by no
means inevitable that tax complexity should be weighed on tax
complexity, although that appears to be the direction in which we are
going. We should consider examples from overseas, such as from the
Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, where
there has been simplification. Those countries have looked at
abolishing reliefs and lowering the actual
rate.</p><p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para3"><a name="06112723000042">The Government
could have considered procedural points and set out their conclusions
in the Queen&#146;s Speech. The tax reform commission that my party
set up examined ways in which there could be pre-Budget consultation on
tax measures. It also considered the establishment of an office of tax
simplification and the possibility of Finance Bills being examined by a
Joint Committee to make use of some of the expertise of the House of
Lords. I do not particularly advocate the last proposal because it
would give rise to constitutional concerns, but we should use greater
expertise to try to tackle the situation, because complexity and
uncertainty are creating a great deal of
worries.</p><p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para4"><a name="06112723000043">I have
mentioned before, including during the consideration of last
Session&#146;s Finance Bill, the impact on our tax law of decisions
taken by the European Union and, specifically, the judgments of the
European Court of Justice. Last week, the ECJ pulled back on excise
duties. There was a great deal of publicity about the rate of excise
duty that should be charged when a person from the UK ordered alcohol
or cigarettes from Latvia using the internet. Against the advice of the
advocates-general, the ECJ concluded that the UK rate should apply in
that case. Despite the easy temptation to make remarks about cheap
booze in the run-up to Christmas, I was greatly relieved that such a
judgment was reached.</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="27 Nov 2006">

<notus-date day="27" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>27 Nov 2006 : Column 888</b><br><p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para5"><a name="06112723000044">Concerns
have arisen about occasions on which the ECJ has waded into areas in
such a way as to attack the whole integrity of the UK taxation system,
especially with regard to the way in which corporation tax group relief
has worked. In many respects, the ECJ is more a political body than a
judicial body. Many of its judgments seem to reflect its ultimate
political objective of ever closer union, as is seen from its decisions
on taxation and other matters. The ECJ is also political in that it
seems to have an awareness of the political pressures in member states
and thus treads carefully at times&#151;perhaps last week&#146;s
decision on excise duties was an example of
that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para6"><a name="06112723000045">I am worried
that there is a two-stage process. The ECJ makes it difficult for any
member state to raise revenue in the way in which it would like. It is
not a huge jump to go from that on to the next step of suggesting that
that could be dealt with through greater harmonisation and a common tax
base, as I believe Mr. Lszl Kovcs
will propose at a meeting of Finance Ministers tomorrow. I am worried
that the integrity of the system is being attacked at the first level
and that the solution produced at the second level is essentially one
of European Union tax law. That would be wrong for a number of reasons.
It would further weaken any competitive advantage that we have in the
UK and it would take taxation out of the democratic forum in such a way
that our electorate would no longer have a
say.</p><p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para7"><a name="06112723000046">I know that the
Financial Secretary has heard me make similar speeches before, but I
say again that I am worried that the ECJ is, to some extent, a
political body so that I can increase political awareness of my
concerns. I hope that the House will send out the message that it does
not like our taxation system being attacked by judgments of the
European Court of Justice, and I am grateful to have had the
opportunity to make that point
again.</p><p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para8"><a name="06112723000047">Productivity
is a hugely important issue in this country. We need to address the
situation because recent years&#146; productivity growth figures have
not been good. The taxation system is one element of the problem,
because the competitive advantages that this country built up
throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s have gradually been diminished.
There is no doubt that economic policies have an effect for a long time
after they have been implemented. When the Chancellor was boasting
about unemployment figures to my hon. Friend the Member for
Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), I was struck that he resorted to
saying that his achievements on unemployment tended to have taken place
between May and October 1997. I cannot help thinking that the previous
Government might have had something to do with that success, although I
hope that I am not making a claim that is too hard to back
up.</p><p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para9"><a name="06112723000048">Many economic
decisions have long-lasting effects, although they are not always
immediate. Long-term harm is being done to our country through our
business tax system and we are no longer as competitive as we were. If
we do not address the situation in this Session or soon, we will face
problems.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_13"><a name="61127-0014.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="06112723000101">7.27

<notus-date day="27" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>27 Nov 2006 : Column 889</b><br>South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke). We heard, as usual, a
thoughtful and detailed contribution from someone for whom I have
developed a great deal of respect since we were elected last year. I
want to focus on three matters: the second paragraph of the
Queen&#146;s Speech, which paid tribute to the stability that the
Government&#146;s management of the economy has delivered; a
coupleof the Bills cited in the Queen&#146;s Speech; and
several of the points made by the shadow Chancellor and his
colleagues.</p><p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para10"><a name="06112723000050">First,
on the stability of the economy, the macro-economic framework
introduced by the Government has delivered growth of 26 per cent. in
the nine years since 1997, compared with 15 per cent. in the nine years
before 1997. Historically low mortgage rates have cut costs for the
average homeowner by about &#163;4,000 a year. Employment is at a
record rate of 29 million, which is up 2.5 million since 1997. More
people in my constituency are in work than at any point in our
history.</p><p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para11"><a name="06112723000051">Despite those
dramatic improvements, one can still see the legacy of the industrial
and economic restructuring of the early 1980s, when the industries on
which the black country&#146;s prosperity had been based experienced
decline. When I left school in the early 1980s, Dudley had high
unemployment and some 3,300 young people had been out of work for more
than six months. Today, the equivalent figure is just a few hundred,
although I want all young people to be in work or training. More than
1,000 youngsters are better off through the new
deal.</p><p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para12"><a name="06112723000052">As we consider
the next stage of our area&#146;s economic development, I am pleased
that the Queen&#146;s Speech showed that we will maintain our focus
on training, because skills are a crucial component of a dynamic
economy. We must ensure that young people have the skills that they and
the labour market need; that is particularly important for an area such
as Dudley because it is the only way that those without work will be
able to share in this country&#146;s prosperity. It is also,
crucially, the only way my area will be able to attract the high-wage,
high-skill jobs of the
future.</p><p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para13"><a name="06112723000053">Secondly,
having been one of those MPs who called on the Government to introduce
a climate change Bill in the Queen&#146;s Speech, I am pleased that
such a Bill was announced. Climate change is not only the biggest
long-term threat that we face, but a great economic opportunity for
areas such as mine. We need to look at how we can help manufacturers of
the new green technologies&#151;solar panels, energy-efficient
boilers and wind turbines&#151;to locate in former manufacturing
areas such as the one that I represent.</p><p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para14"><a name="06112723000054">Thirdly, I
want to welcome the proposals in the Queen&#146;s Speech to enable
more people to move off benefit and give them the support that they
need to return to work. Last week, the Opposition discussed how to deal
with the problem of the poorest 10 per cent. in society. It was the
latest in a long series of eye-catching initiatives to show how much
the Opposition have changed. I disagree with those who say that the
Opposition do not believe in anything or that they have no
policies.On the contrary, it is precisely because of what they
believe, because of their values, that their policies cannot
work.</p><br>

am as big a supporter of the voluntary sector and the social enterprise
movement as anyone, and I recognise the much bigger role that they can
play alongside an empowering and enabling public sector. But earlier
today the shadow Chancellor attacked the Government&#146;s record on
child poverty. We have tough targets to cut child poverty, but he says
that they are just an aspiration, and the Opposition fought us every
step of the way on those targets. They say that tax credits are a waste
of money and that child support should be cut. That is because,
whatever they say about the responsibility that we all have to act
together collectively as a community, they will not, as a matter of
ideology, do what is necessary to deliver social justice and open up
opportunity to all. That is why they say that they want to tackle
poverty but condemn the increases in public spending needed to tackle
it as &#147;fiscal
irresponsibility&#148;.</p><p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="61127-0014.htm_para17"><a name="06112723000057">As
we heard earlier, the Conservatives have announced the so-called
proceeds of growth rule, which, whatever they say, commits them to
cutting public spending year in, year out. The right hon. Member for
Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) complained earlier that we had not
spent enough on transport infrastructure, but the Leader of the
Opposition himself admitted that their policy is to spend less. He
said:</p><a name="61127-0014.htm_brev2"><a name="06112723000096"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As that
money comes in let&#146;s share that between additional public

Conservatives&#146; tax report, which was also mentioned earlier, was
commissioned by the shadow Chancellor and described by him as the
frameworkfor policy. Its authors went further and called
for&#163;21 billion of unfunded tax cuts. Those, if
implemented, would undermine the stability of the economy mentioned in
the Queen&#146;s Speech and repeat the mistakes of the past. It is
impossible to argue that savings could be made on that scale without
hitting hard-working low and middle income families by cutting deep
into tax credits and the new deal. Perhaps that is why the Leader of
the Opposition said that he wanted to replace public services for the
poor with</p><a name="61127-0014.htm_brev3"><a name="06112723000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a profound

have to travel much more and emissions increase. This has gone on for
some years in hospitals, schools and other areas. If the Government are

from a generation facility being built in the south of England. That
means that there is a disincentive for many renewable energy
developments, not only wind farms but tidal facilities and, possibly,
some of the coal plants, depending on where they are built. We must
examine that, and how to have an energy system that delivers to our
towns and cities while taking advantage of renewables. That matter

will take the CSA&#146;s place and how the transfer to the new system
will be handled. I raise the point because I am fearful that if we do
not get the detail right, we will just put another serious problem in

it would remove some of the contentious roadblocks to progress, but it

from that of the Government. On pensions, the Government have taken the
route of suggesting&#151;I would hardly class this as a
promise&#151;that it might be possible to restore the link between
pensions and earnings, but that we all need to work for longer. The
problem with that approach is that it does nothing to make up for the
fact that pensions have fallen further and further behind since the
link between pensions and earnings was first broken by the
Conservatives. Restoring the link at some future date will not deal
with that, which is why we have proposed a citizen&#146;s pension as
the way forward.</p><p><a name="st_o315"><a name="06112831000001"><b><a name="61127-0015.htm_spnew8"><a name="06112736000171">Mr.

we believe that it remains the best way forward. I am sure that the
Government would point out all that they have done for pensions, yet
too many continue to live in poverty. Rocketing energy prices are

pension tax relief encourages private savings; indeed, it costs a
fortune as it is massively geared to the better off. Turner pointed out
that it costs about &#163;12 billion, with another &#163;8 billion
in national insurance relief. That is a massive subsidy to private
pensions instead of using taxpayers&#146; money to provide a proper
state pension. Worse still, more than half of the total cost of tax

transparent and, in particular, to encourage low and moderate income
earners to save for retirement and reward those who do so. Instead of
doing that, the Government seem intent on raising the state retirement
age, which will have a disproportionate impact on the poor and in areas
where people have lower life expectancy. For example, a man in Glasgow
has a life expectancy of 69.3 years, compared with more than 80 for a
man in Kensington. Clearly, the Glasgow man will seriously lose out if
the pension age is increased. To be fair, Lord Turner recognised the
problem and suggested that it should remain at 65, but the Government
rejected that in their response, which said that they would consider it
nearer the relevant time. The evidence on life expectancy already
exists, and one has to ask what they think is the relevant time given
that they have already decided to raise the retirement

affordable or feasible. Moreover, there was virtually no way in which
the then Department of Health and Social Security could recoup any of
the funds that went out to support lone parents and their children, who
should have been properly supported by somebody in work. I hope that

The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)&#151;I was

neighbours&#151;mentioned unemployment figures. Those started to come
down very quickly because the windfall tax on privatised utilities went
into the new deal, which the Conservatives have opposed consistently
right down the line. The new deal has been very successful in getting
people, particularly lone parents, into work and, for the first time,
turning around the figures for lone parents out of work so that an
increasing number are now in work. Even the hon. Member for Runnymede
and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) would have to accept that at
this stage of the Tory Government we had already had a catastrophic
recession and were heading for a second one. Against that background,
some of the statistics looked good. The figures on productivity and
public services looked good at a time when grass cutters had to be paid
only &#163;1.20 an hour because they could be shipped up from Kent
into London to work for rates that no one else would work for. The
Conservatives have never really boasted about this, but even the
statistics on international development looked good because the amount
given was a proportion of gross national income at a time when GNI was
going down rather than up. Nevertheless, I urge my hon. Friend the
Economic Secretary not to think that it is worth having a massive
recession just to improve some statistics to which the Conservatives
like to turn.</p><p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="61127-0015.htm_para25"><a name="06112736000039">My

His proposals to deal with pensioner poverty among women are extremely

forward.</p><p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="61127-0016.htm_para1"><a name="06112736000041">Women
pensioners have faced particular problems and have been hit in many
different ways. First, they do not get the state pension. That is why I
have always disagreed with those who say that we should simply increase
the basic state pension because that is what pensioners need. Only 17
per cent. of women who work get the full state pension. It has always
been clear that index-linking the state pension and compensating people
for what they lost after the Tories broke the earnings link is not the
way forward because it would not tackle the problems that women face.
In addition, a disproportionate number of women have not had
occupational pensions or they have not been sizeable. On average, men
will get &#163;103 a week from their occupational pension while women
will get only &#163;17. That is a telling figure, because
occupational pensions have always been the bedrock of our successful
pension arrangements in this country. However, because women will
disproportionately work for smaller employers, who might not have had
an occupational pension scheme, or will work shorter hours, they will
not have that pension provision to back them up.</p><p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="61127-0016.htm_para2"><a name="06112736000042">The other finding from research
is that women will tend to save for their children, instead of for
their retirements. That is quite an obvious point when one thinks about
one&#146;s own experience and what one does with one&#146;s own
money. It has been found that although women might make pension
provision, once their children come along they either spend their money
on what their children need straight away or if they do put money by,
they put it by for their children instead of for their
pensions.</p><p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="61127-0016.htm_para3"><a name="06112736000043">For those

Keeble:</b> The old means test was an unpleasant and
undignified process, but the means of claiming benefits that people
have to claim was very straight forward. I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman would not propose a blanket high level of pensions throughout
the whole community, as that would be completely wrong. Targeting the
money where it was most needed was absolutely the right thing to deal
with the problem of ending pensioner poverty and, although I do not
have the statistics on that written on this piece of paper, they are
extremely
good.</p><p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="61127-0016.htm_para6"><a name="06112736000062">I
am glad that the proposals that are coming forward will not be about
the universal or citizen&#146;s pension. That is the Liberal
Democrats&#146; proposal, although the Scottish National party also
referred to it. Although superficially it looks attractive because
everybody receives it, there are two objections. The obvious one is
cost. I understand that to do what is wanted&#151;that is, to get a
universal pension up to the pension credit level&#151;would account
for some &#163;60 billion a year by 2050. The second problem is to do
with a deeply ingrained sense of justice among my constituents that if
people make more effort, that should be recognised. It is important to
keep that, albeit with a contributory principle, although one that is
not quite as onerous as what we have now. Although I was initially
attracted to the idea of a universal pension, it is right that we
should retain a pensions process that recognises the contributions that
people have made during their working lives, be that at home, through
caring or in work.</p><p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="61127-0016.htm_para7"><a name="06112736000063">I
also welcome the proposed improvements to home responsibilities
protection and the fact that more women will have much longer full-time
working records when that is introduced. Some of the problems that
women have faced previously because of the restrictions on part-time
work&#151;partly because they could not get child care, as they can
now&#151;will, I hope, have worked their way out of the
system.</p><p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="61127-0016.htm_para8"><a name="06112736000064">Finally,
I ask my hon. Friend the Minister for Pensions Reform please to ensure
that he addresses the problem of building women&#146;s confidence in
pensions when those proposals are brought forward. A lot of women paid
the national insurance stamp all their working lives, but received
nothing. They took out private pension plans because they did not have
occupational plans, but those plans were mis-sold. Women have also seen
the state earnings-related pension scheme widow&#146;s pension
largely disappear through changes that were made. It is important that
women have the sense that if they pay into the system, it will pay out
to them as well, and that it is

from the thoughtful, measured contributions of the Back Benchers to the
shallow, knockabout stuff that we heard at the beginning from the two
Front Benchers. This has been a good, enjoyable debate. Some people
have objected to the Punch and Judy or knockabout stuff that we heard
at the very beginning. However, if we cannot score political points in
this House, there is hardly anywhere else that we can score them, so I
have no great objection. People should not be surprised either, because
the Prime Minister has promised us that we will get that sort of
debate. He has told us that the Chancellor will at some stage deliver a
great &#147;clunking fist&#148; to the jaw of the Leader of the
Opposition. Listening to the Chancellor&#146;s laboured, ponderous
response to the shadow Chancellor today, however, he did not strike me
as much of a Muhammad Ali. Certainly, there was not much evidence of
dancing like a butterfly or stinging like a bee. Perhaps&#151;who

Since neither of the two main political parties is a rival to my party
in Northern Ireland, as they do not stand for election there, I do not
need to get involved in their economic squabbling. I just want to make
some observations about the economy in Northern Ireland and the content

Unionist party believes in devolution for Northern Ireland, we must and
do accept that a significant change in the economy has taken place
under direct rule. In my constituency, for example, unemployment is now
down to 4 per cent., the lowest it has ever been, and the growth rate
in Northern Ireland is the highest of any region in the United Kingdom.
I must be careful with Government-supplied statistics, as I notice that
the Queen&#146;s Speech mentions legislation to enhance confidence in
those, implying that there is not too much confidence, but anecdotal
and visual evidence such as new building cannot but lead one to accept
that there has been an improvement in the
economy&#151;</p><p><a name="st_o341"><a name="06112736000069"><b><a name="61127-0016.htm_spnew17"><a name="06112736000197">Mr.

be that movement, however, the right conditions must be in place. Given
the changes already introduced under direct rule, such as the review of
public administration and cuts in the number of quangos, councils and
bodies controlling health and education, people will need to be
redeployed quickly from the public sector into the private sector. For
that to happen, certain conditions will have to be met.</p><p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="61127-0016.htm_para13"><a name="06112736000072">First, Northern Ireland must
become competitive. As we have heard, the competitiveness of the United
Kingdom as a whole has dropped from fourth to 10th in the world. As we
share a land boundary with the Irish Republic, which has had rapid
growth, it is important that we have the right economic conditions. I
was glad to hear the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr.
Redwood) indicate that one of the changes required was to reduce the
level of corporation tax. The level of taxation, including stealth
taxes and so on, has never been higher in the United Kingdom. That is
one of the reasons for our decreased competitiveness.</p><p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="61127-0016.htm_para14"><a name="06112736000073">Several Labour Members have
talked about the threat to the environment, and it is significant that
that argument has appeared just when the Chancellor is running out of
stealth taxes and must find a new excuse to get us to open our wallets
and pay more. The threat of freezing or drowning&#151;or frying, if
we are talking about global warming&#151;seems to be the
Chancellor&#146;s next ploy to get his hands in our pockets. It is
essential that we have a low tax base.</p><p><a name="st_o343"><a name="06112736000074"><b><a name="61127-0016.htm_spnew19"><a name="06112736000199">Mr.

the comments of the right hon. Member for Wokingham, who, I am glad to
say, has not fallen under the spell of Polly Toynbee, as some of his
colleagues seem to have done. He was arguing for a low tax base for the
United Kingdom economy as a whole, as that is believed to be one way of
attracting and keeping industry in the United Kingdom. If Northern
Ireland is to be the guinea pig, of course, we would welcome that. The
Government seem to be willing to use Northern Ireland as a guinea pig
for many other kinds of taxes. We will provide the testing ground for a
new council tax, so we would be more than happy to test the effects of
a new corporation tax.</p><p><a name="st_o345"><a name="06112736000076"><b><a name="61127-0016.htm_spnew21"><a name="06112736000201">Kelvin

low-tax economy is a successful economy, and that the way to achieve

differential corporation tax headline rate, two key factors are
involved. First, we are, I hope, coming out of years of conflict.
Secondly, we are the only part of the United Kingdom that has a land

tax.</p><p><a name="st_o350"><a name="06112736000081"><b><a name="61127-0016.htm_spnew26"><a name="06112736000206">Sammy

particularly interested in some of the proposals in the Queen's Speech.
First, there are the proposed changes in the planning system. I believe
that one of the factors that have had an impact on economic growth in
Northern Ireland is the slowness of that system. The simplest planning
application takes an average of six months to go through the system; in
some council areas it takes a year, and a major application can take up
to two or three years. When Tesco began to come to Northern Ireland
after the ceasefires, it described its experience of the system as
&#147;like wading through treacle&#148;, because the process of
obtaining planning permission was so difficult and slow. I shall be
interested to see what measures will be introduced to improve the
planning system in that part of the United Kingdom, and I hope that
some of them will be mirrored in our own
economy.</p><p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="61127-0017.htm_para2"><a name="06112736000090">Secondly,
there is the proposed reform of welfare. I welcome the
Government&#146;s earlier legislation, especially the measures to
take people off incapacity benefit and put them into work. I think it
important for us to give people opportunities to contribute to society.
Let me say in deference to some of the Members sitting on my right that
when it comes to welfare I am of the Churchill rather than the Polly
Toynbee school. I believe in safety nets, not in cosy blankets, and I
think it important for welfare reform to be part of the restructuring
of the
economy.</p><p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="61127-0017.htm_para3"><a name="06112736000091">Thirdly, I am
very interested in the legislation on serious and organised crime. As
the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee has pointed out, organised crime
is a massive drain on the economy in Northern Ireland. It deters
investment, undermines existing industries and, of course, is used to
swell the coffers of terrorist organisations. Although much work has
been done, the proceeds of organised crime are still very difficult to
seize. We must find a way of conveying the message that crime does not
pay.</p><p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="61127-0017.htm_para4"><a name="06112736000092">We hope that many
of the measures that will have an impact on economic growth in Northern
Ireland will find their way to a devolved Assembly. Indeed, part of
what the Queen's Speech promised for Northern Ireland has already been
delivered. We may not approve of the way in which that Bill completed
its passage last week, the rapidity of its progress or the lack of
scrutiny, but we believe that it will make any future devolved Assembly
a safer Assembly, with safeguards that were not in the Belfast
agreement and are likely to make the Assembly more stable. Now it is up
to Sinn Fein to deliver on the other side, and give a commitment to
supporting the police and law and order.</p><p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="61127-0017.htm_para5"><a name="06112736000093">We hope that,

those who wish to be part of government in Northern Ireland to support
the police and create the right conditions for confidence and stability
in any devolved Administration. However, regardless of what might be
done and what powers might be vested in Northern Ireland, the huge
macro-economic decisions that will affect our economy will be

who turned to crime and drugs as a way of life instead of following
their parents into the world of work; the skilled men who could not get
work and were told to curl up in the corner and go away. I am also
thinking of people like my friend Keith Lamb, a skilled mechanic for 26
years who spent three years on the dole from 1992 and then got a job
making cardboard boxes for &#163;82 a week; the children taught in
leaking classrooms in classes with too many pupils by teachers who were
ground down by the lack of opportunity of the pupils in their charge;
the dedicated ancillary workers in our public services&#151;the
porters, the cleaners, the school-meals workers&#151;who were either
forced out of their jobs by compulsory competitive tendering or forced
into a future of reduced wages, fewer holidays and disgraceful sick pay
schemes and were told that they were no longer part of the NHS team;
and the public sector professionals trying to hold together our health
and social services while expending their skills and time in constant
budget cutting, reorganisations and redundancy negotiations, watching a
lifetime of work disappearing before their eyes.</p><p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="61127-0017.htm_para13"><a name="06112736000102">Those people

having become a way of life. They are real people: people I lived with,
grew up with, worked with and played with. They are the people I
represented as a trade union activist, the people who came before me as
a member of the social security appeal tribunal and the people I looked
after as a care worker in social services. They are the people who paid
the price for the arrogance, the short-termism and the lack of concern

riddled with inconsistencies and fake promises rather than real policy,

not know whether the sums for that are &#163;17 billion, &#163;21
billion,&#163;40 billion, &#163;50 billion or more, but I
do know that if the Conservatives do that they will not find it
possible to protect and defend public services, and the most vulnerable
people in our society who rely on them. No matter how hard they
flip-flop and how hard they pretend that they care, people will not be

that the Queen&#146;s Speech did nothing whatever for Scotland. As a

hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) mentioned that he had seen
real improvements on the ground in his part of the country, and it is
clear that those north of the border have also seen such improvements.
Their experience is similar to that of the people where I come from: we
have removed the scourge of youth unemployment; we have built extra
support for working families and their children; we have lifted
thousands of children out of poverty; and we are rebuilding the very
fabric of society through new schools and new hospitals, and by
refurbishing millions of homes.</p><br>

forget that we would not be here today without the national minimum
wage and the tax credits that some Members have tried to rubbish in
this House today. There have clearly been problems. But there has also
been massive good news for people who have had tax credits. We need to
do more,
however.</p><p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="61127-0017.htm_para18"><a name="06112736000114">Our
Government must do more. The pension reforms are key to the long-term
future of this country, and they are well-timed and necessary, but they
must reflect the needs of the people of this country. To that end, I
urge the Secretary of State to look at the issue of raising the
retirement age in the knowledge that not all people have shared in the
increase in longevity that there has been in this country. Manual
workers still die much earlier in this country than do professional
workers, and the factors linked to that should be considered. Likewise,
raising the school leaving age may reduce the time that people spend in
work, but let us not pretend that hard work did not kill anybody. Look
at the facts. When the retirement age for miners was reduced in the
1980s from 65 to 62, their average life expectancy was 65 years and two
days. It is no wonder that the mineworkers&#146; pension scheme was
so well financed&#151;there was nobody alive to take money out of
it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="61127-0017.htm_para19"><a name="06112736000115">In the effort to
build up security in retirement for tomorrow&#146;s pensioners, I
urge the Secretary of State to work with the representatives of
today&#146;s pensioners in order to address their real needs now. I
understand his reluctance to concede the demands of the National
Pensioners Convention, which has called for him to raise the basic
state pension to the level of the minimum income guaranteed for all. I
also understand his reluctance to reinstate the link with earnings, and
I appreciate the problems associated with paying a full pension to all
citizens in order to deal with the unjust treatment of women in
retirement. However, he has to accept that the NPC and other
representative groups, including Age Concern, are genuinely concerned
about the real-life experiences of the older people of today.</p><p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="61127-0017.htm_para20"><a name="06112736000116">In particular, I hope that the
Secretary of State will address the case put forward by the NPC that
the national insurance fund is massively over-funded, standing at
&#163;22 billion above its recommended &#147;safe cash flow
balance&#148; level. It is clear that a fund that was set up and paid
for by yesterday&#146;s workers is now being withheld from them in
their present position as today&#146;s pensioners. A provision
reinstating the link between pensions and earnings should be included
in the pension reform Bill and not left to chance or the fate of the
market. Using the national insurance fund for this purpose would remove
that uncertainty. What cannot be denied is the legitimacy of the
concerns expressed by pensioners&#146; organisations. I urge my right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State to hold a genuine consultation with
them during the Bill&#146;s
passage.</p><p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="61127-0017.htm_para21"><a name="06112736000117">In the

for that, I have come full circle. Our lack of control over the utility

adopted by the Conservatives in their orgy of self-indulgence as they
sold off our national assets. Nobody told Sid while he was buying his
cut-price shares that he would end up paying through the nose for gas
and electricity, or that water prices would quadruple as pipes leaked
and drought orders and hose-pipe bans became the norm. Sadly for the

of this debate, which is not what happened in 1986 but what is
happening in 2006. I have to say that I was disappointed by the
Chancellor&#146;s contribution, as I am sure many Members in all
parts of the House were. I was anticipating that, in his farewell
appearance at a Queen&#146;s Speech debate in the role of Chancellor,
he might put on a magisterial display and range across the successes
under his chancellorship. Instead, we had a policy-lite speech that
consisted primarily of attacks on Conservative Back Benchers. When we
look at <i> Hansard</i> tomorrow, we will see that he spent more time
criticising members of the No Turning Back group than he did on Labour
party policy. That may have had something to do with the fact that he
threw away most of his speech on Labour policy because he was so
enraged by the reaction of Opposition Members. That is not a
particularly encouraging sign of what we can look forward to should he
become Prime Minister
shortly.</p><p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="61127-0017.htm_para24"><a name="06112736000121">I shall talk
about what the Chancellor did not want to talk about&#151;his
legacy&#151;and the need for sound public finance. We hear often from
the Chancellor about his successes, but he chooses to gloss over those
elements of the economy that have been less successful. I shall focus
on a couple of those elements
tonight.</p><p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="61127-0017.htm_para25"><a name="06112736000122">In 1997, we
had had five years of rising GDP and, as a Labour Member who spoke
earlier seemed conveniently to forget, that growth rose at a higher
rate in the last five years of the Conservative Government than it has
on average in the nearly 10 years of the Labour Government. They do not
like to be reminded of
that.</p><p><a name="st_o366"><a name="06112736000123"><b><a name="61127-0017.htm_spnew9"><a name="06112736000222">Kelvin

between 1992 and 1997. That is fair enough, but the Conservatives first
dug a gigantic hole in the economy, because of their exchange rate

base&#151;</p><br>

the opportunity to highlight the fact&#151;I was not going to refer
to it and the Chancellor certainly never refers to it&#151;that the
Chancellor was a more enthusiastic supporter of British membership of
the ERM than anyone in that Conservative Government. The point that I
was trying to make about GDP growth was that we are repeatedly told
about the success of this Chancellor&#146;s conduct of the economy

which will be the highest proportion since 1986. That is not a record

consequences of those fragilities and frailties in the economy? One
that we need to bear in mind&#151;it has been touched on by other

the debts that are not on the Government&#146;s books, because they

parents. The Government are due to collect that money, but are failing
to do so. The agency calculates that almost&#163;2 billion
of that &#163;3.5 billion is uncollectible, and in recent reports in

the Chamber, and we will continue to discuss the subject when the

discount rate, based on the rate that would apply to a double-A

the Government to the subject of the personal debt legacy. Earlier this
evening, it was mentioned that personal debt in the UK has risen
rapidly, by more than &#163;100 billion, or 10.2 per cent., in the
past 12 months. It totalled &#163;1.258 trillion at the end of
September this year, and it has more than tripled since 1993. That
accounts for a large part of our economic growth, which has been
spurred by consumer spending over the past few years. The legacy of the
Chancellor that concerns me is the problems that will be posed for
people who have run up substantial debts that they are unable to pay
and the impact on the economy of that debt bubble
bursting&#151;something almost too frightening to
contemplate.</p><p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="61127-0018.htm_para8"><a name="06112736000143">Companies
are making good business from encouraging people to enter into
individual voluntary agreements; in other words, taking a short cut to
declaring themselves bankrupt. Rates of personal bankruptcy are at a
historical high&#151;not something from which any Chancellor should
take great comfort.</p><p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="61127-0018.htm_para9"><a name="06112736000144">The Chancellor touched only
fleetingly on another aspect of his legacy&#151;the growing increase
in unemployment in the UK, on which he puts a somewhat different spin.
We have had 18 months of trend increase in unemployment, which is
running at 5.6 per cent. across the country as a whole. That is of
concern to all of us, but of particular concern to me is the fact that
unemployment appears to be rising much more rapidly in some rural areas
that have historically relied on basic manufacturing. My hon. Friend
the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard), in a characteristically
impassioned intervention on the Chancellor, pointed out that over the
past 12 months unemployment in Shropshire has risen by an astonishing
36 per cent. In my constituency, much of that unemployment has been in
the aluminium capital of England&#151;Bridgnorth&#151;where we have
lost 200 manufacturing jobs in the past six months
alone.</p><p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="61127-0018.htm_para10"><a name="06112736000145">The consequence
of the Chancellor&#146;s legacy is that corporate Britain feels that
it is under much more pressure than he seems to believe. My hon. Friend
the shadow Chancellor referred to the CBI survey published this
morning, which makes a timely contribution to our debate. Three
quarters of the people surveyed believe that the corporate tax regime
is worse than it was in 2001. The Chancellor rather disparagingly said
that the survey was based on responses from only 89 companies. However,
if he had taken the trouble to read it he would have found that it was
based on the FTSE 350 companies, so 89 responses represent about 25 per
cent., which is a high response

most of the largest companies in the land that took the trouble to
respond.</p><p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="61127-0018.htm_para11"><a name="06112736000146">Areas
of concern relate to over-taxation and over-regulation and to the fact
that both may encourage businesses to move away from this country. The
headline tax rate for corporate Britain, at 30 per cent., is about five
percentage points ahead of the European Union, which is significantly
higher than the rate in Ireland, as we heard earlier. The tax burden on
companies has increased as a whole, and the proportion from direct
taxation is more than 20 per cent., compared to about 19 per cent. 20
years ago. The increase is significant and explains the concerns.
Although the headline corporate tax rate has gone down, the overall
proportion of tax contributed by corporate Britain to the Treasury has
gone up
considerably.</p><p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="61127-0018.htm_para12"><a name="06112736000147">In an
intervention earlier, I referred to a report, published last month, by
KPMG for the Investment Management Association on the City&#146;s
contribution to that increased taxation. The report argues that funds
that in the past we would have expected to be domiciled in the UK are
increasingly being domiciled outside this country to avoid the taxes
levied on the financial services sector. As I pointed out earlier, over
the past 10 years twice as many funds have been attracted to set up in
Ireland and 10 times as many in Luxembourg as in the UK. The conclusion
of the report is
that</p><a name="61127-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="06112736000157"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the UK&#146;s tax

concern that emerges from these reports is that if we continue with an
over-regulated and over-taxed corporate environment, we will
increasingly lose many of our corporates, which will domicile in more
favourable climates. The Chancellor is living in the past once again.
He repeated with some glee the numbers that he had quoted at Treasury
questions earlier this month. He spoke about the number of companies
that have located here in comparison with other European countries as
if it provided a magnificent rebuttal of my point. In fact, he was
talking about companies that located here over the past nine years, but
we are talking about companies today that are thinking about moving
overseas. It is apples and pears. We are not interested in what has
happened over the past nine years, but concerned about what is
happening now and what is at stake in Britain today.</p><p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="61127-0018.htm_para14"><a name="06112736000149">In that regard, the comments of
Mr. Chris Spooner, the head of financial planning and tax at
HSBC&#151;one of the largest companies currently domiciled in this
country&#151;in a speech given to the Chartered Institute of Taxation
earlier this month, are revealing. He said that he was no longer happy
with the tax situation in

the Government that we cannot have a strong, secure and stable
community without health care based on the founding principles of the
NHS. Those founding principles are that everybody should have access to
similar health provision, wherever they live in the country.</p><p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="61127-0018.htm_para20"><a name="06112744000005">I would like to speak today
about how, due to lack of funding, the Government are failing to uphold
the founding principles of the national health service in my area. I
would like to stress at this point how grateful I am to the doctors,
nurses, support staff and medical professionals who work tirelessly,
often under difficult circumstances. If it were not for their hard work
and dedication, the NHS would be in a much poorer
state.</p><p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="61127-0018.htm_para21"><a name="06112744000006">If
Wellingborough constituents need to go to hospital, they will attend
either Kettering or Northampton general on most occasions. Both those
hospitals can be a 45-minute journey away, which makes the trip
extremely difficult for elderly and vulnerable patients. Neither
hospital is in the Wellingborough constituency. I have been told
several times by Ministers at the Dispatch Box how many more doctors
and nurses there are in Wellingborough since Labour came to power. That
always amuses me slightly because none of them is based in my
constituency. Given the lack of a hospital in Wellingborough, Kettering
general finds itself full to capacity, and that is set to get
worse.</p><p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="61127-0018.htm_para22"><a name="06112744000007">The

We need more of it, and we need it now. In Wellingborough, it is
impossible to get an NHS dentist. New residents find it almost
impossible to sign on at a GP surgery, and our nearest hospitals are

Yet I still have to raise the issue today, and I will continue to raise
it until the Government accept that my constituents and north
Northamptonshire as a whole are not getting their fair share of health
care compared to the rest of the country. With an excellent set of
doctors, nurses and ancillary staff, an excellent set of professional
managers in both the primary care trust and the hospitals and an
excellent performance in efficiency by Kettering hospital, how can it
be that we still have the most acute crisis in our local

with the underfunding of our local strategic health authority, and in

crux of the matter is that the Government spend a lot of time, money
and effort working out what is a fair level of funding for each PCT
based on its needs compared to similar areas across the country. That
has been developed so that we have a level playing field across the
national health service. As the Secretary of State for Health said in a
letter to me and my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering

2005:</p><a name="61127-0018.htm_brev10"><a name="06112744000037"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A

with the Secretary of State. That is exactly what should happen in our
NHS, but it is not happening in north Northamptonshire and, year after
year, we are underfunded. There is no end in sight to this
underfunding. In a letter to me, the Secretary of State
said:</p><a name="61127-0018.htm_brev11"><a name="06112744000019"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Northamptonshire

the gap between what we should get and what we actually get is being
closed, we will still not receive what the Government say is our fair
and equitable funding. In fact, north Northamptonshire will still be
&#163;13.2 million short of its fair share. This lack of funding by
the Government is causing the crisis in Wellingborough and the
surrounding areas.</p><p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="61127-0018.htm_para31"><a name="06112744000021">Let
us look at the figures a little more closely and at the funding for
north Northamptonshire compared to the national average while bearing
in mind that we should be better funded than the national average
because of our areas of severe deprivation. Let us just go back three
years to 2003-04 when revenue allocations were directly made to primary
care trusts for the first time. In 2003-04, the PCT only
received90 per cent. of the funding that it should have had
compared with the national average. This was a shortfall of
&#163;22.2 million. In 2004-05, we again received only 90 per cent.
compared with the national average. This was a shortfall of
&#163;24.4 million. Almost unbelievably, in 2005-06, the figure fell
to 89 per cent. of the national average, increasing the shortfall to
&#163;29.37 million. This year, the shortfall is &#163;20.16
million and, next year, it is predicted to be &#163;15.08 million.
This gives a total shortfall since 2003-04 of
&#163;11,210,000.</p><p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="61127-0018.htm_para32"><a name="06112744000022">If
we had had the funding that the Government said we should have had,
there would be no crisis in our local health service. The people of
Wellingborough and the surrounding areas have suffered because the
Government have not implemented their own policy&#151;a policy to
bring fairness and a level playing field to what is supposed to be a
national health service, not a postcode lottery health
service.</p><br>

that Kettering general hospital has been forced to make in recent weeks

levels to the absolute minimum, making 2,100 patients wait a minimum of
five months for their operation, delaying planned second operations
such as hip replacements and removing patients from the waiting list
for low-priority operations. So apparently the answer to waiting lists
is not improved patient care, but is just to tell patients that they
can no longer have their operations. Further cuts involve redeploying
surplus staff into existing vacancies with little regard to
suitability, closing a surgical ward, closing an operating theatre,
reducing prescriptions on discharge from 28 to seven days, closing a
further medical ward, reducing the availability of consultants, making
patients wait longer for treatment in audiology, freezing vacancies,

four operating theatres, and a breast cancer screening centre. The unit
has never had any adverse statistics recorded against it, and the
reason why is that it does not have any patients, doctors or nurses. A
brand new unit is sitting empty and the hospital does not know if or

people in my constituency and in north Northamptonshire deserve a
fairer share of the national cake. I am not asking for more than our
fair share, just what the Government say we should be getting, but are
not. Why should my constituents suffer? This is meant to be a national
health service, not a postcode lottery health service. I have two
suggestions to improve health care provision in north Northamptonshire
and to make it fairer for my constituents. First, I want a guarantee
from the Secretary of State for Health that there will be an
investigation into the provision of a new hospital in my constituency
to coincide with the massive growth in population in the area.
Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I urge Northamptonshire PCT,
and Kettering general and Northampton general hospitals to put patient
care first, not Government accountants. I urge themto cease
making cuts to patient care and to spend the &#163;111 million that
we should have received from the Government through their own
capitation formula.The Government have said that we should
have had that money for health care in north Northamptonshire. Let us
use this funding for better health care provision for the people of my
constituency. I challenge the PCT and the local hospitals to stand up
against the Government and put the health care of patients first
instead of satisfying the accountants in Whitehall. If they do that,
they will have my full
support.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_20"><a name="61127-0019.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="06112811000051">9.22

Brooks Newmark (Braintree) (Con):</b> After seven hours of
patience, I am pleased to be able to participate in the final day of
the Queen&#146;s Speech debate. I hope to abide by the principle that
ought to apply to both regulation and legislation: less is more. The
meat, or should I say the gristle, of this year&#146;s Gracious
Speech is the Statistics and Registration Service Bill. As the Treasury
Committee, on which I serve, discovered in its investigation of the
independence of statistics before the summer break, there are some deep
misgivings about the Government&#146;s proposals. Some of those
misgivings, although happily not all, are reflected in the Bill that
was published last Wednesday.</p><p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="61127-0019.htm_para7"><a name="06112811000002">The quality of, and ease of
access to, statistics forms the bedrock of administrative oversight and
parliamentary scrutiny. When questioned about the structure and powers
of an independent board, Lord Moser told our Committee
that</p><a name="61127-0019.htm_brev4"><a name="06112811000044"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;if one needs one

might be forgiven for thinking that the principle of economy, which
ought to apply to regulation and legislation, ought not to apply to
statistics, because a wealth of material is always to our benefit.
However, less can be more when it comes to statistics, too. The Bill
does not explicitly address the burdens associated with the collection
of and access to statistical information. A study by the British
Chambers of Commerce, published earlier this month and entitled
&#147;Red Tape: The Real Story&#148;, tackles exactly that issue.
It contains a number of case studies drawn from real business. One of
the first studies concerns the impact of Government statistics on
business.</p><p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="61127-0019.htm_para9"><a name="06112811000004">The real
problem is that the proposed Bill is introspective, which is
symptomatic of what is happening across the Government. Legislation is
proposed without a clear view of the effect that it will have after it

regulation. Chris Harrod, the chief executive of a sports equipment

welcomed our recommendations on the sharing of data and the safeguards
that must be in place before that can safely take place. I fear that
the complex interactions among the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the
Data Protection Act 1998 and the need to share administrative data will
hamstring the Bill and add to the complexity faced by both the

enough to introduce show and tell to the Chamber by unfurling the whole

the story of red tape. Such things are the hallmarks of the
Chancellor&#146;s marriage to stealthy taxation and unwieldy
bureaucracy, which is paid for by the cost of falling productivity and
crumbling competitiveness. The opportunity to chart our relentless
decline through the medium of newly independent yet sketchy statistics
is not much compensation.</p><br>

the end of the final day of debate on what will be the Prime
Minister&#146;s final legislative programme. I am glad to see the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in his place; I am sorry that
he could not join us for more of the debate. There is a certain
poignancy in his winding up this debate, because he is probably the
most ultra-Blairite member of the Cabinet. Depending on which way one
looks at it, he is either the most honest in expressing his view or the

for the Secretary of State is that I have calculated that if he can
hang on to his job for another 22 days, until the House rises, he will
have surpassed the career average of his four immediate predecessors.
The bad news is that no one is betting on his luck lasting much beyond
that. Things have come to something when Conservative Members are wary
of quoting a Cabinet Minister&#146;s description of the Chancellor

attempt to deliver on that promise, so I will not be complaining, as
some of my colleagues have had cause to do from this Bench over the
last few days, of a sense of d&#233;j  vu surrounding the
measure&#151;quite the opposite.</p><p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="61127-0019.htm_para26"><a name="06112811000022">I cannot say the same about the

Government&#146;s proposals, but we do know that they amount to an
admission of failure of the 2003 reforms, in which the Government have
squandered &#163;500,000 of taxpayers&#146; money on a failed
computer system. There are now1.4 million families trapped in
the misery of the Child Support Agency, and every Member of the House
knows exactly what that means from their constituency experiences. If
the Secretary of State is looking for cross-party support on CSA
reform, his proposals will have to address the plight of those already
in the system as well as new claimants, because we will not support any
solution that denies a just and fair outcome to those 1.4 million
families.</p><p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="61127-0019.htm_para27"><a name="06112811000023">We have

objectives in the Welfare Reform Bill. I hope that the Secretary of
State, when he winds up the debate, will acknowledge the constructive
contribution from my hon. Friends in the Committee proceedings on that
Bill, which are ongoing. Similarly, we welcome the key changes to the
state pension system which we expect to be introduced in the pensions
Bill when it is published&#151;tomorrow, I believe. We welcome the
re-establishment of the earnings link, a policy on which we fought the
last election, and the changes to the contribution rules and caring
credits, which will address the unfairness suffered by women pensioners
in the present system. All of that will be paid for by asking people to
work until they are 68.</p><p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="61127-0019.htm_para28"><a name="06112811000024">Both those measures&#151;and,
indeed, the reform of the child support system&#151;have the
potential to contribute significantly to the anti-poverty agenda, but
both require the creation of significant numbers of net new jobs,
because both aim to achieve their objectives through a focus on work.
That is the right focus for the British economy and for a sustainable
and permanent reduction in poverty. An effective attack on poverty
requires an attack on the causes of poverty and, for those who can
work, work is the sustainable route out of poverty.</p><p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="61127-0019.htm_para29"><a name="06112811000025">However, as
my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor pointed out this afternoon, the
backdrop to such work-focused policy initiatives does not look terribly
encouraging. Unemployment is at a seven-year record and rising.
Long-term youth unemployment, which according to the Prime Minister as
recently as September has been eradicated on the planet he inhabits,
stands at 175,000 in the world where the rest of us live. Productivity
growth has halved, and Britain is sliding down the international
competitiveness league tables. All that makes the targets on reduction
in claimant numbers, on increase in work force participation and on

work.</p><p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="61127-0019.htm_para31"><a name="06112811000027">The Secretary
of State says he has not got the money for a more extensive roll-out of
the pathways to work programme. We appreciate the need for fiscal
discipline, but there is a way to roll out pathways for the benefit of
existing claimants without risk or cost to the Treasury by inviting the
private and voluntary sector providers, who are negotiating for
contracts under the Secretary of State&#146;s programme, to take on
existing claimants at their own risk. No result, no payment. The
providers say they could do it; 1 million existing claimants say that
they want it. It is a win-win option for claimants, for taxpayers and
for the economy, so why is the Secretary of State not pursuing it,
rather than turning his back on existing claimants?</p><p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="61127-0019.htm_para32"><a name="06112811000028">The Government's central
poverty focus has been children, and rightly so. Tackling child poverty
is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, which from generation to
generation becomes entrenched, not just as material poverty but as a
poverty of hope and aspiration. However, figures published by our
social justice policy group last week showed just how shallow the
Government's achievements are. Their targets are focused on households
that have less than 60 per cent. of median earnings, so the
Government's efforts have been equally focused on moving those just
below that line to just above

If the Economic Secretary thinks that those figures are not right, I
would be happy to hear from him. The percentage of children in
persistent poverty is unchanged over the same period. That reminds us,
if a reminder were needed, that good intentions do not translate
automatically into good

that the clunking fist is losing its grip. For the Prime Minister, such

to all of us and, I suspect, to everyone else listening to the debate,
that his spending plans, of which we have seen several versions
knocking about today, are completely out of control, that his tax
policy is in chaos, and that he has no economic policy for ensuring

both substance and vision. That is why we all look forward to hearing
more from him in

want to pick up on something that the shadow Chancellor said about
poverty that was, I am afraid, completely wrong. He said that the
number of people living on less than 40 per cent. of median income has
grown by 750,000 since this Government took office. That is completely
untrue. In fact, there has been no rise at all in the number of people
living below 40 per cent. of median income since 1997. He based his
claims on figures that began in 1994 rather than in 1997 and was,
completely unknown to him, attacking the record of his own party in
government. Our measures to tackle deprivation&#151;every one of them
opposed by the Conservatives&#151;have helped to take 700,000
children above the internationally recognised definition of poverty
since 1997, while the poorest families are now on average &#163;3,400
a year better off.</p><br>

the Pope travels to Turkey, and we all wish him well. We all want an
open dialogue between Christianity and Islam. I want people of all
faiths and none to rub along together, respecting each other&#146;s
beliefs and being tolerant of differences. I agreed with Cardinal
Cormac Murphy-O&#146;Connor when he said six months ago in a lecture
to the Oxford centre for Islamic studies that Catholic-Muslim dialogue
depends on religious freedom&#151;we all agree with that. However,
there are many question marks about religious freedom in Pakistan.
Indeed, my constituents, the Karims, fled from
Pakistan.</p><p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="61127-0022.htm_para8"><a name="06112815000557">The Karims
are asylum seekers, and asylum seekers get a really bad press. Asylum
seekers are viewed with suspicion, even more so when they are failed
asylum seekers, like the Karims. That is why I want to tell the story
of Nigel and Pearl Karim and their two children, Calvin and Crystal.
They are threatened with deportation, but I want them to be allowed to
stay in the United Kingdom outside the immigration rules, for reasons
that I will explain, on compassionate grounds.</p><p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="61127-0022.htm_para9"><a name="06112815000558">The Karims are an ordinary
family with an extraordinary story. They came to the United Kingdom in
2002 and sought asylum. They were turned down in November of that year.
They are practising Catholics and fear persecution if they return to
Pakistan. They appealed, and all the appeals were exhausted in 2003.
Since then, I have been working with them. I had a long discussion with
Pearl and Nigel Karim on Friday in my constituency office. Their story
is long and complex, but at its heart is the relationship between the
majority Muslim community in Pakistan and the Christian and other
minority faiths. That provides the
context.</p><p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="61127-0022.htm_para10"><a name="06112815000559">Nigel Karim
is now 53. He was born into a mixed-faith family. His father was Muslim
and died when Nigel was three. Nigel was brought up in Karachi as a
Catholic by his Christian mother, who still lives in Pakistan. Nigel
went to church but, by his own admission, he was not a particularly
regular churchgoer. All that changed when, in 1987, he joined the YMCA
and met Ivan Edwin, who was a committed Christian with a very high
profile. Nigel started to worship regularly after that and would help
Edwin out, driving him to meetings, posting letters and helping around
the office.</p><p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="61127-0022.htm_para11"><a name="06112815000560">It was
through that relationship that Nigel met Edwin&#146;s cousin and his
own future wife, Pearl, who was also a Christian. They married in 1991,
and their son Calvin was born in 1994. The relatives on the
father&#146;s side, the Muslim side, were very unhappy about that,
particularly the cousins, Mohammed Sharif and Mohammed Azim. They
periodically made threatsto the Karims which grew in intensity
once Calvin was old enough to go to school. Indeed, in 2001 they

want the children to be brought up as Christians.</p><p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="61127-0022.htm_para12"><a name="06112815000561">It was at that point that the
Karims resolved to get out of Pakistan. It was just as well that they
did, because Pearl&#146;s cousin, Ivan Edwin, was murdered in May
2002. He was killed in his office. He was found strapped to his chair
with a syringe sticking out of his arm that was filled with the
tranquiliser Diazepam. His killers were never found. When the Karims
were living in Karachi, they moved around, living in four or five
different rented properties, fearing to stay in any house for too long.
Nigel Karim&#146;s mother similarly moved around, fearing that she,
too, would be tracked down. I believe that the Karims will be danger if
they go back. That is the difference between me and
Ministers.</p><p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="61127-0022.htm_para13"><a name="06112815000562">There are 4
million Christians in Pakistan, but the Government have no central
record of the number of people from that country who come here seeking
asylum because of religious persecution. There is a huge number of
Christians over there. Indeed, in Karachi alone, I am told, there are
120,000 Catholics. Clearly, we cannot have 4 million Pakistani
Christians applying for visitor&#146;s visas to the United Kingdom
and, as soon as they step off the plane at Heathrow, applying for
asylum on the grounds of their religious beliefs. I accept that each
case must be dealt with case by case, but I believe that the
Karims&#146; case is compelling and that new information that they
provided relating to their plight was not properly considered by my
hon. Friend and her colleagues.</p><p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="61127-0022.htm_para14"><a name="06112815000563">I have been involved with the
Karims since June 2003 and have made a series of representations to
Home Office Ministers; I forget how many. The Karims have been told
that they have no basis to stay in the UK and they should leave. Most
recently, the Karims received two letters on 16 October and 7 November
and were told that the latest submissions</p><a name="61127-0022.htm_brev10"><a name="06112815000564"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;do not amount to a fresh

are now the subject of an application for judicial review by the
Karims&#146; solicitors, who say that Ministers failed properly to
consider new evidence, one piece of which concerned threats made to
Nigel Karim&#146;s Christian mother, to whom I referred. The other
related to a poster that has gone up in the area of Karachi where they
lived. It shows a photograph of Nigel Karim next to a rather ominous
drawing of a gallows and a reward of 500,000 rupees for information on
Nigel Karim&#146;s whereabouts. He is referred to in this poster as
&#147;Nigel the
Arrogant.&#148;</p><p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="61127-0022.htm_para18"><a name="06112815000569">Who
would feel relaxed about going back to Pakistan in these circumstances?
But the Government believe&#151;I am putting words in my hon.
Friend&#146;s mouth, which I should not do&#151;that Pakistan is
like a giant forgery factory; that all sorts of documents are forged
and fiddled and we cannot believe anything that anyone brings forward
because it could be a forgery. It was up to the authorities to prove
that the documentation was a forgery, and they have not done that. That
is the basis for the application for judicial review.</p><br>

blasphemy laws; Masih died after police torture. The operation of the
blasphemy laws continues to be a cause of great concern. We are told
that they are routinely used to harass religious minorities and liberal
Muslims and to settle personal scores or business rivalries. The
punishment for blasphemy is death, which is chilling. For example: in
April this year, an appellate court acquitted Christian school teacher
Pervez Masih of blasphemy charges and released him after five years in
detention.</p><p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="61127-0022.htm_para24"><a name="06112815000576">In April
this year, two prison staff at the central prison in Sahiwal, Punjab

Office what representations the Government were making to Pakistan
concerning the position of Christians. The Minister of State told me
that he had raised the issue with the Prime Minister of Pakistan,
Shaukat Aziz, in March, asking him to take action to protect religious
minorities. Only last month, I had the opportunity to have a word here
at Westminster with the Pakistan Minister for Information and
Broadcasting, Senator Tariq Aziz Khan, when I specifically mentioned
the case of the Karims.</p><p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="61127-0022.htm_para27"><a name="06112815000581">The Karims are well-educated
people, and they put a thousand times more into the community than they
take out. One of the many letters to me describes the two children as
polite, extremely well behaved and always eager to learn. Both children
are in the top streams for all subjects at their

to the BBC &#147;Today&#148; programme; and their story can be
accessed on the web. I have received literally hundreds of e-mails from
the classmates of Crystal and Calvin. A petition signed by between
3,000 and 4,000 people was presented to meat a packed meeting
at Christ church, Nelson, on9 November. I have been contacted
by a delegation from the local clergy, which is led by Father Chris
Gorman, and by one from Catholic schools, which is led by Brendan
Conboy, headteacher of Fisher More Catholic high school. The school

The case that my hon. Friend is making is absolutely justified. People
who end up in court can often expect not only to get no justice but to
get the worst kind of treatment outside, where there may be mob rule. I

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan
Ryan):</b> First, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
Pendle (Mr. Prentice) on securing the debate. As he knows,
other Home Office Ministers and I have taken the time to respond in
some detail on this case on numerous occasions over the past three
years. As a matter of principle, it would not be right for me to
discuss on the Floor of the House, or in any other public forum, the
precise circumstances of this family&#146;s case, because their legal
representatives have lodged an application for permission to appeal for
their case to be considered before the High Court under judicial
review. That application remains outstanding. However, I am happy to
discuss in more general terms the asylum and appeals determination
process in relation to the family&#146;s
case.</p><p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="61127-0022.htm_para36"><a name="06112815000593">As my hon.
Friend is aware, asylum and human rights applications are considered by
the Home Office on their individual merits in accordance with our
obligations under the 1951 United Nations convention relating to the
status of refugees and the 1950 European convention on human rights and
fundamental freedoms. Each application is considered against the
background of the latest available information about the situation in
the country of origin. Full account is taken of the ability of the
individual concerned to reside safely in other parts of their country
when it is not safe to return to their home area. I assure my hon.
Friend that full account was indeed taken in the Karim family&#146;s
case.</p><p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="61127-0022.htm_para37"><a name="06112815000594">Where an
application is unsuccessful, individuals are able to appeal to the
asylum and immigration tribunal. If the appeal is unsuccessful, an
applicant may seek permission for the decision of the immigration judge
to be reviewed. The Karim family have been through the appeal process,
and their case was considered at length by the adjudicator. However,
the appeal was dismissed in a very detailed and carefully reasoned
determination that was by no means unsympathetic. The adjudicator also
had the benefit of hearing oral evidence from Mr. and
Mrs. Karim. After the appeal was unsuccessful, the family
submitted extensive grounds when seeking permission to appeal to the
tribunal. The tribunal carefully considered those grounds but decided
that they did not undermine the conclusions of the adjudicator, and
permission to appeal was refused. The asylum and immigration tribunal
is an independent body established by Parliament to adjudicate on such
matters, and except in the most compelling circumstances Ministers
would not normally intervene where an appeal has been dismissed by the
tribunal.</p><br>

I have said that I will not enter into detailed discussion with regard
to the individual circumstances of this case on the Floor of the House,
I consider it important to point out that since the family exhausted
all avenues of appeal the case has been reviewed on numerous occasions
by the immigration and nationality directorate and by various Home
Office Ministers as a result of written representations from my hon.
Friend, from the family&#146;s legal representatives and from the
Bishops of Lancaster and
Blackburn.</p><p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="61127-0023.htm_para1"><a name="06112815000596">I
recognise that the family have contributed to the local community,
which is of course to be commended, and that as a result they have the
strong support of that community, as evidenced by the campaign on their

United Kingdom.</p><p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="61127-0023.htm_para2"><a name="06112815000597">The United
Kingdom has a long tradition of providing refuge to those in genuine
need of surrogate international protection of the 1951 refugee
convention, but it is only right and proper that those who are not
found to be genuinely in need of such protection should return home,
regardless of the degree to which they have integrated themselves into
this country&#146;s society during their temporary residence
here.</p><p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="61127-0023.htm_para3"><a name="06112815000598">In
relation to other points raised by my hon. Friend and by the hon.
Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes), it is accepted
that, in some areas of Pakistan, the situation for Christians is still
contentious and that, as a minority group, they might suffer some
discrimination. Discrimination in employment is particularly common,
and Christian parents have had difficulty gaining admission to
Government schools for their children. Christians also find themselves
disproportionately over-represented in Pakistan&#146;s most oppressed
social group&#151;bonded labourers. The Pakistani authorities have
shown that they are willing and able to provide protection for minority
religious groups against harassment, violence and intimidation. The
religious constitution guarantees the rights of religious minorities,
and the President has called for religious
tolerance.</p><p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="61127-0023.htm_para4"><a name="06112815000599">My

consideration was given to their case. I do not know whether my hon.
Friend is aware that the Karim family were recorded as absconders
earlier this month, having failed to comply with the residence
restrictions that pertained to their being granted temporary release.
On 16 November, their solicitors lodged an application for permission
to apply for a judicial review with the High Court, and it was only on
that date, when the application was lodged, that the family presented
themselves to the authorities.</p><p><a name="st_o419"><a name="06112815000600"><b><a name="61127-0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="06112815001166">Mr.

the House that the Karims were temporary absconders. I must tell her
that at no stage did they ever seek to evade the authorities or to go
to ground. They were absolutely determined to carry on with their
normal day-to-day lives.</p><p><a name="st_o420"><a name="06112815000601"><b><a name="61127-0023.htm_spnew1"><a name="06112815001167">Joan

following the debate.</p><p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="61127-0023.htm_para5"><a name="06112815000602">While the application is still
outstanding, no action will be taken to remove the family from the
United Kingdom. I ask my hon. Friend to advise the family that it would
be in their best interests to comply with the conditions attached to
their temporary release and to report any change of address
immediately. I know that he appreciates that while the application
remains outstanding, it would be inappropriate to discuss the case in
any but the broader terms in which I have done today, and that it would
not be appropriate to intervene while the case is before the court.
Should the court decide that the removal of the family is lawful and
proportionate, I hope that he will accept that returning them to
Pakistan is the correct, fair and just course of action.</p><p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="61127-0023.htm_para6"><a name="06112815000603">Although I

that that has been of use to my hon. Friend. I understand that he wrote
on 10 November to my hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration,
