<a name="90202-01_sbhd0"><H4><center>Dentists</center></H4>


<P>
1. <a name="90202-01_wqn0"><B> Charlotte Atkins  (Staffordshire, Moorlands):</B> 
 How many dentists there are per head of population <i>(a)</i> in the UK and <i>(b)</i> in North Staffordshire health authority; and what impact Government policies are expected to have on these figures.  [67159]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spmin0"><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Mr. John Denham): </B> 
 The number of general dental service dentists per 100,000 of the population at the end of September 1998 was 35 for England and the United Kingdom, and 24 for North Staffordshire, excluding salaried dentists. The Government are funding six Investing in Dentistry bids in North Staffordshire, which will increase the number of dentists by six and allow 16,000 people to receive national health service care.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew0"><B> Charlotte Atkins: </B> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that answer. I was horrified, when I was elected in May 1997, to find that there were no NHS dentists in my constituency. Since then, the very good work of John <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 708</B></P>
Rose and Liam Stubbs in the local health authority has attracted two more dentists to my area, but we are very much running to stand still. What are the Government doing to encourage more dentists to move into areas outside those covered by the dental schools? More dentists are especially badly needed in health authorities such as North Staffordshire, where dental health is so poor.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 A number of initiatives are under way to meet that need, and I congratulate my hon. Friend on her close involvement in this matter in her constituency. One of the most important initiatives is the Investing in Dentistry process, from which North Staffordshire has benefited already, and I know that two further bids are under consideration in my hon. Friend's constituency.
<P>

<a name="90202-01_para5">So far, 242 Investing in Dentistry bids have been funded across the country, enabling another 600,000 new patients to receive national health service care. It is also possible, of course, to develop salaried dentist services in areas where other dentists cannot be attracted to practise.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael Fabricant  (Lichfield):</B> 
 Is the Minister aware of the scandal that has developed over the past few months which means that people in Staffordshire have to wait 15 months or two years for dental and other operations at Good Hope hospital? In contrast, people in Birmingham have to wait only five or six months for the same operations.
<P>

<a name="90202-01_para6">Will the Minister guarantee that he will look into that scandal and find out exactly why such a discrepancy has developed under this so-called "caring" Labour Government?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Inequities in health care between different parts of the country were a feature of the development of the national health service under the previous Administration. I shall, of course, be more than happy to look into local cases brought to my attention by any hon. Member, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that, with the extra investment through modernisation to tackle the pressure of waiting lists, the national health service in his area will do far better than it did under the previous Conservative Government. That applies in all other parts of the country as well.

<P>
2. <a name="90202-01_wqn1"><B> Mr. Paul Flynn  (Newport, West):</B> 
 What proposals he has to reduce the use of neuroleptic drugs in care homes.  [67160]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spmin1"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health   (Mr. John Hutton): </B> 
 We are aware of concerns that have been expressed about the possible over-use of neuroleptics, and several current initiatives will help to address them, including the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and the national service framework for older people.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew4"><B> Mr. Flynn: </B> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful reply and for the action that his Department has taken to deal with a distressing problem. The symptoms of senility displayed by many people in care homes are the result not of old age but of the misuse and over-use of neuroleptic drugs.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 709</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-01_para7">May I urge my hon. Friend to copy the initiative of the school of old-age psychiatry in Manchester, under which independent pharmacists and doctors were taken into homes? As a result, the use of such drugs was reduced, people's lives were lengthened, money was saved for the NHS and many elderly people were rescued from much unnecessary misery and confusion.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that very legitimate concern about the use of neuroleptic drugs. I shall certainly look into the work that has been done in Manchester.
<P>

<a name="90202-01_para8">My hon. Friend may also like to know that we have commissioned the Centre for Policy on Aging to draw up new national standards for residential and nursing care homes. The use of medication in care homes will be covered by the new standards.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Jacqui Lait  (Beckenham):</B> 
 The Minister referred to draft national standards. Will he confirm that there will be formal consultation on them?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Yes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew8"><B> Mr. Alan Duncan  (Rutland and Melton):</B> 
 Is it not ironic that, while residents of care homes may be over-medicated with neuroleptic drugs, there is massive rationing of psychoactive drugs for people with mental illnesses? What does that imbalance say about the Government's priorities and values? Will the Minister at least admit that that imbalance exists?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 I must tell the hon. Gentleman that the use of neuroleptics is very serious, and we are determined to address the issue. He has conveniently forgotten that, as part of our strategy to modernise mental health, we are releasing significant new resources to help purchase new anti-psychotic drugs.

<a name="90202-01_sbhd2"><H4><center>Primary Care Groups</center></H4>


<P>
3. <a name="90202-01_wqn2"><B> Mr. Andrew Dismore  (Hendon):</B> 
 How many primary care groups he expects to commence during 1999.  [67161]
<P>
<P>

<a name="90202-01_para9">
<P>
8. <a name="90202-01_wqn3"><B> Mr. Jim Dobbin  (Heywood and Middleton):</B> 
 How many primary care groups he expects to commence during 1999.  [67166]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spmin2"><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Mr. John Denham): </B> 
 Some 481 primary care groups will commence on 1 April 1999, and they will have the capacity to commission services from that date. The degree of responsibility for commissioning services will be agreed between the PGC and the health authority.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew10"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
 Last week, I met representatives of Barnet West primary care group, who stressed the importance of recognising local factors in the work of PCGs. Does my hon. Friend share that PCG's desire for flexibility both in the setting up of PCGs and in ensuring that our doctors, our nurses and our community are in the driving seat when it comes to planning health care for our local area?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew11"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 I can certainly assure my hon. Friend that we have established PCGs covering all the general <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 710</B></P>
practitioners in a particular area in order to put GPs, nurses and other professionals in the driving seat in primary care. As the groups develop, enormous use will be made of the new powers of PCGs to develop much better services.
<P>

<a name="90202-01_para10">It is important that local factors and judgment are taken into account. That is why we have made it clear that the pace of development of PCGs over such matters as how quickly they take on the commissioning of services is a matter for local judgment and agreement.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew12"><B> Mr. Dobbin: </B> 
 Can my hon. Friend reassure GPs who are working hard to set up the primary care groups, and to make them work, that clinics and out-patient services provided for their local communities will be adequately funded by each health authority?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew13"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 I acknowledge my hon. Friend's tribute to the active role that GPs are playing in ensuring that primary care groups will work. We have made it clear to health authorities that, where cost-effective and good services have been developed at practice level, we wish to see them continue. We also want to see plans drawn up to spread the benefits of those services to other patients in the PCG area.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew14"><B> Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones  (Ynys Mon):</B> 
 Will the Minister acknowledge concerns about the extent of lay representation on PCGs? Will he undertake to reconsider lay representation if it is shown that it would be of immense benefit to the PCGs, particularly if it brought in wider expertise from outside the medical profession?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew15"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 I have looked at proposals for membership of primary care groups, and my view is that the different factors involved have been appropriately balanced. It is understandable that people are examining the formalities of PCG constitutions at this stage, but, given existing flexibility, primary care groups will develop effective partnerships to provide primary care at the local level. I am sure that health professionals will draw on the expertise of others, including lay people who are not themselves members of the PCG, to develop effective services. As PCGs evolve in practice, effective working partnerships will be created, and that is most important.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew16"><B> Miss Ann Widdecombe  (Maidstone and The Weald):</B> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, even by the standards of a Government who arrogantly sideline Parliament as much as they can, it is amazing, when the Secretary of State has published a Bill within the past few days to enable the abolition of fundholding, that fundholding has already been effectively abolished, and that arrangements are in place to dragoon GPs into collectives on 1 April, by which time the Bill will not have achieved even parliamentary consent, let alone Royal Assent?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew17"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The right hon. Lady has failed to notice the enthusiasm, commitment and dedication with which so many fundholding GPs have committed themselves to primary care groups. They see that this is the right way to develop the national health service. Professional GPs are working in co-operation with other health <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 711</B></P>
professionals to develop better primary care. They realise that we are moving in the right direction, and the right hon. Lady is out of touch with them.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew18"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
 I am wholly in touch with the timetable: primary care groups are to be set up on 1 April and the Bill has not even commenced its passage through the House. I am aware that the Minister has dodged my question--he is so ashamed of his arrogance that he will not address it. Will he now answer me?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew19"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The right hon. Lady does not understand either the legal or the parliamentary situation--although it has been set out very clearly and is evident from the Bill. Primary care groups can be, and are being, established under existing legislation. Fundholding will be abolished when the Health Bill achieves Royal Assent--assuming that that occurs. We shall make provision in the Bill--it should be perfectly clear to the right hon. Lady--for a residual fundholding scheme to operate from 1 April. I believe that the vast majority of fundholders will dedicate their energies to developing primary care groups and accept that fundholding will end on 1 April. It is there in the Bill. There will be a residual scheme for fundholders which will continue until the health legislation receives Royal Assent. I have answered the right hon. Lady's question, but she does not like my answer.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew20"><B> Mr. Andrew Reed  (Loughborough):</B> 
 The majority of Labour Members warmly welcome the establishment of primary care groups. Will the Minister join me in welcoming the establishment of such a group in North Charnwood--which covers the Loughborough constituency--which builds on existing co-operation between general practitioners in the area? However, will the Minister look closely at the management responsibilities of the group? It does not wish to appoint a manager but wants to allocate existing resources among the general practices in the group. Does that send the wrong signal to others who are involved in the PCG, for example, non-GPs--that it is GP-led?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew21"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 It would be wrong to comment on the particular local example to which my hon. Friend referred, although I shall be happy to look into the situation. We have published guidelines about the way in which we expect primary care groups to develop that strike the right balance between central encouragement and local flexibility. I shall look into the case that my hon. Friend has raised.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew22"><B> Mr. Robert Walter  (North Dorset):</B> 
 When the Government were elected, they claimed that they would save &#163;100 million on administration in the national health service. The Government have already allocated a massive sum for the administration of primary care groups and they have stated that health authorities will also have to make money available to that end. The Government also expect GPs and other health professionals to give freely of their time to help with that administration. Have the Government assessed the total cost and effectiveness of primary care groups?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-01_spnew23"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The hon. Gentleman fails to realise that, by introducing primary care groups, we will be able to cut <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 712</B></P>
out a huge amount of the bureaucracy and waste that were an integral part of the internal market. For example, whereas there were about 4,000 purchasing groups under the internal market, there will be about 600 commissioning groups under the new arrangements. That will enable a huge cut in bureaucracy to occur. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are on target to meet our aim of saving &#163;1 billion in management costs during this Parliament.

<P>
4. <a name="90202-02_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Linda Gilroy  (Plymouth, Sutton):</B> 
 What plans he has to increase the number of medical doctors in training.  [67162]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spmin0"><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Mr. John Denham): </B> 
 The Government are currently implementing their recent decision to increase the number of undergraduate medical education places by about 20 per cent.--that is about 1,000 extra places--over the next few years. Numbers in postgraduate medical training are also growing to meet future requirements for general practitioners and consultants.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Gilroy: </B> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. In inviting bids for that work, will he welcome and encourage new and innovative practices that complement other measures for developing a national health service for the 21st century? I have in mind the bid from the Exeter, Plymouth and Open universities, which, in addition to having a strong community focus, will seek to develop training through telematics and information technologies which will be the stuff of communication for doctors in the next century.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 I am aware of my hon. Friend's support for that proposal and sure that she will continue to champion it enthusiastically, but it would be wrong of me to comment on any individual proposals. Proposals for new medical schools will be considered alongside proposals from existing providers by the joint implementation group, which is now implementing the increase in medical school places in England. The group will judge those proposals against the objectives that are set, including value for money.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Marion Roe  (Broxbourne):</B> 
 Will the Minister confirm that his plans for more doctors include the number of qualified medical students who were due to enter the system anyway?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The position is that there will be 1,000 medical school places in addition to the number that we inherited on entering office in 1997.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew4"><B> Mr. Roger Casale  (Wimbledon):</B> 
 May I take the opportunity to bring to my hon. Friend's attention the existence of Wimbledon Civic Forum's health forum, which brings together local executives from the health sector and local residents to discuss the future shape of health services in our community? Will he acknowledge that such forums and community health councils have a valuable role to play in promoting transparency and <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 713</B></P>
accountability in the new national health service, and will he undertake to review the future role of such forums and CHCs as important partners in the new NHS?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 I am very interested in what my hon. Friend tells me: I am not familiar with that forum, but perhaps I shall have an opportunity to become acquainted with it in the not-too-distant future. One of the hallmarks of the new NHS is the way in which we are encouraging wider public involvement and consultation, for example, in the development of health improvement programmes, and co-operation between different parts of the NHS. That helps to overcome the fragmentation and competition that were so characteristic of the health service as it was left by the previous Administration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew7"><B> Madam Speaker: </B> 
 Order. I remind hon. Members that the question is on the training of doctors.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew8"><B> Dr. Evan Harris  (Oxford, West and Abingdon):</B> 
 Yes, thank you, Madam Speaker.
<P>

<a name="90202-02_para0">In seven years' time, when the last of the new medical students enter medical school, they will be able to look forward to receiving, five or six years later, a basic salary of &#163;16,710. Will the Minister take this opportunity to correct the information contained in the press release issued yesterday, which stated that a junior doctor or house officer would have a basic salary of &#163;26,405? Junior doctors cannot understand why they are expected to do three years in a one-year pre-registration post, or why the Government consider 32 hours of compulsory overtime at half rate to be included in the basic salary. If that is correct, what are the Government's plans to increase the hours over that basic number?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Yesterday, we implemented in full the recommendations of the pay review body for doctors, which was the right thing for us to do. We are continuing to make progress on the matter of junior doctors' hours: we have increased the funding to the task forces that deal with that problem; and, although I accept that this is not the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's question, we have made it clear that some of the conditions in which junior doctors are required to work--for example, their access to rest and canteen facilities out of hours--should be improved.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bob Blizzard  (Waveney):</B> 
 Does my hon. Friend know how many of the new doctors will receive training in the specialised treatment of cancer? The reason I ask that question is the huge amount of unsolicited tobacco advertising that still pours through people's letterboxes. My constituents are delighted that, in the White Paper, the Government proposed to ban such advertising, but can my hon. Friend tell me when that ban will come into effect, as it may have some bearing on the number of cancer specialists who need to be trained?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew11"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 My hon. Friend raises a number of important issues in his question. We set out our proposals for action to reduce smoking and dependence on tobacco in last year's White Paper, and we are moving ahead on the implementation of those measures. In addition to the need for basic undergraduate training, there is the need to continue postgraduate specialist medical training, for we <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 714</B></P>
have to ensure that we are able to meet the service standards and targets that we want to set in respect of the treatment of cancer.

 What assessment he has made of the costs to nurses of on-going and re-entry training requirements.  [67163]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spmin1"><B>The Secretary of State for Health   (Mr. Frank Dobson): </B> 
 This Government are committed to encouraging the training of nurses. In this year alone, &#163;72 million will be invested in post-registration training of non-medical staff. As part of our effort to encourage former nurses to return to the NHS, we are investing &#163;4 million this year in local return-to-practice initiatives and free return-to-practice courses. We are also making available &#163;36 million over this year and the next three years to help enrolled nurses to upgrade their qualifications. Ward assistants and other NHS staff can now train to be qualified nurses while retaining their existing pay for the duration of the course.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew12"><B> Mr. George: </B> 
 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that helpful reply. What advice can he offer my constituent, Rachel Blight, who broke her nursing career after 14 years for the sake of her family and now wants to return to nursing? She has recently paid &#163;350 for her re-entry training, which involves going 35 miles to the local training centre for three weeks of study and two weeks of practical work. If we want to--
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew13"><B> Madam Speaker: </B> 
 Order. This is perfect material for an Adjournment debate. Will the hon. Gentleman get to his question now?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew14"><B> Mr. George: </B> 
 Thank you, Madam Speaker. We want to encourage nurses to return to their careers, but do not such conditions represent an obstacle to them?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew15"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 Certainly, charging people for such courses is an obstacle, which I why I announced last year that the courses would be free. I shall look into why they are not free in the hon. Gentleman's constituency.
<P>

<a name="90202-02_para1">Following the pay announcement yesterday and the advertisement campaign that we have started, 2,874 people had telephoned the helpline by 2 o'clock today for further information about returning to nursing. I shall try to give the House an update later.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew16"><B> Dr. Brian Iddon  (Bolton, South-East):</B> 
 On regional television a few days ago, a nurse from the Royal Bolton hospital made the comment--with which I agree--that there is a pool of young people and others who want to enter nursing but are put off by what they see as the high academic qualifications required to enter the profession. Has my right hon. Friend taken that into consideration?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew17"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 Many people perceive the present courses as too academic for their liking. We are trying to change the situation to make it easier for people to enter nurse training in various ways. The changes in the past few years certainly put off a substantial number of young people who might well have gone into nursing.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew18"><B> Mr. Tim Collins  (Westmorland and Lonsdale):</B> 
 I welcome any and every means to increase the number of <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 715</B></P>
nurses in the national health service, but will the Secretary of State guarantee that those steps will prevent a repetition of the case about which I had cause to write to him a fortnight ago? That case concerns a constituent who was told that he needed a quadruple heart bypass operation and that it would be 24 months before the NHS could perform it. His GP told him that if he waited 24 months he would die, so he had to spend &#163;10,000 on a private operation. Surely a case where someone has to pay to save his life represents the ultimate privatisation of the NHS.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew19"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 All I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that his Government promised that no one would ever have to wait for more than 18 months for in-patient treatment; they did not keep that promise for a single month, but we have kept their promise since April.

 What steps he is taking to increase the number of nursing trainees.  [67164]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spmin2"><B>The Secretary of State for Health   (Mr. Frank Dobson): </B> 
 Between 1992 and 1994, the Tory Government reduced the number of nurse student training places from 15,000 to 11,000. The figure never rose much above 13,000 in subsequent Tory years. In January 1997, they announced their plans for an additional 1,300 nurse training places in 1997-98. We managed to add 1,400 nurse training places in that year, despite taking over after the start of the financial year.
<P>

<a name="90202-02_para2">For this year, we have increased the number of new nurse training places to 15,000 again--the highest figure for six years. If the Tories had not reduced nurse training in their last five years in office, there could now be an extra 11,000 nurses available to work on the wards.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew20"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for that answer. Is he aware of the centre for health care education at University college, Northampton in my constituency, which has had a share of the increase, successfully filling 60 extra nursing places over the past year and planning an extra 100 over the next three years? It filled all those places by careful local recruitment and close partnership. Will he join me in paying tribute to University college, Northampton for successfully attracting more people to fill the extra places that the Government have created?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew21"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 I would certainly like to congratulate everybody involved in the increase. We have increased the number not only of training places but of applicants per 100 places--from 106 to 120 since we took office.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew22"><B> Mr. Simon Hughes  (Southwark, North and Bermondsey):</B> 
 Why did the Government almost entirely undermine yesterday's welcome announcement, on increasing nursing recruitment by awarding some trainee nurses a pay increase of 11.8 per cent. and junior nurses a decent pay rise, and by not staging the awards, by announcing a pay increase of 4.7 per cent. for two out of three nurses--200,000, or all the rest? When they receive their rise in April, they will be less well off in real terms than four years ago. The Chancellor has &#163;5 billion in the contingency fund. Could that not have been used to pay all nurses a decent increase?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew23"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 I do not know whether that would be another charge on the famous Liberal penny. The hon. <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 716</B></P>
Gentleman should remember that the Royal College of Nursing was very keen that an independent pay review body be established, and that the Government carry out the body's recommendations. We have done exactly that. I do not think that the Royal College of Nursing would want me to substitute my judgment for that of the independent review body, and I have no intention of doing so. We have implemented its recommendations in full.
<P>

<a name="90202-02_para3">In negotiations with nursing representatives, I intend to try to make nursing more attractive to experienced nurses, who will be receiving a 4.7 per cent. increase--well above the rate of inflation--together with increments, in most cases, taking their pay increase for next year up to about 7 per cent. Nevertheless, they need to be encouraged. We want to change the grading system, which at present obstructs their career development and holds down their pay.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew24"><B> Mr. Dennis Skinner  (Bolsover):</B> 
 My right hon. Friend probably agrees with me that we will never satisfy the Liberals, who said in their manifesto that they wanted an extra &#163;700 million for the health service in this financial year and the next one. In reality, &#163;7 billion is going in as a result of the statement the other month. Does my right hon. Friend agree that, in order to ensure that we get enough nurses and other hospital staff, the pay rise needs not only to be adequate but repeated next year? Perhaps he will consider the point that, 20-odd years ago, we found a way of putting the pay of firefighters into the upper quartile. With rare exceptions, the problem was solved.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew25"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 As my hon. Friend knows, I am very careful about making individual promises on behalf of the Government. The pay settlement and the changes that we want to make in the career structure of nurses over this coming year are intended to start solving the problems of nurse shortages and the way in which the previous Government ran the health service, which resulted in most nurses feeling as if they had been run off their feet and unable to give patients the attention worthy of their professional standards. We cannot put it all right in one go; this is a start.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew26"><B> Miss Ann Widdecombe  (Maidstone and The Weald):</B> 
 May I draw the right hon. Gentleman's attention to one effect of yesterday's announcement and ask him how he intends to ease it? The pay rise granted to nurses, especially new nurses, will have to be met not only by the NHS but by the hospice movement and the voluntary sector, which depend on grants. Is it his intention that those grants should be enhanced, to ensure that the hospice movement and similar concerns are able to afford to pay for good and adequate nursing care?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew27"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 One way or another, the hospice movement gets substantial grants from the Government. We want to encourage the hospice movement, and when it submits its applications, they will be carefully considered. The right hon. Lady would not expect me to be able to go any further today on that individual item.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew28"><B> Ms Julia Drown  (South Swindon):</B> 
 Will my right hon. Friend confirm that paying 12 per cent. to newly qualified nurses will be one way of attracting new trainees into the profession? Will he outline to the House some of the other initiatives that the Government are taking to attract more <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 717</B></P>
people to the nursing profession--in particular, action on family-friendly policies and measures to tackle violence in the workplace?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew29"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 Since we came into office we have been encouraging NHS management to introduce family- friendly policies, not just for nursing, but for the entire staff of the NHS, so that they can do their jobs as well as discharging their responsibilities to their families--for example, by offering staff shifts that enable them to take children to school in the morning and bring them back in the evening.
<P>

<a name="90202-02_para4">One of the problems is that, in many places, the shortage of nurses is so acute that it is difficult to provide flexible hours because there are not enough staff to go round. That is why we have launched the &#163;5 million advertising campaign on the back of yesterday's pay announcements, in an effort to break out of the cycle of decline that the health service faces. We also want to change the grading system, as I said.
<P>

<a name="90202-02_para5">One of the things that I am frequently told by nurses as I go round hospitals and community services is that they get sick to death of equipment breaking down and going on the blink, which is upsetting for patients and disturbing for nurses. <i>[Interruption.]</i> That is why--if the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) would keep her mouth shut and her ears open--I have told the management of the NHS to give top priority, in small capital schemes, to replacing equipment that is constantly failing and letting down both staff and patients.

<P>
7. <a name="90202-02_wqn3"><B> Mr. Philip Hammond  (Runnymede and Weybridge):</B> 
 What progress he has made in implementing the proposal to create supernurses.  [67165]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spmin3"><B>The Secretary of State for Health   (Mr. Frank Dobson): </B> 
 Many talented nurses and midwives want to keep on treating patients and training their less experienced colleagues. Up to now, highly skilled nurses who reached the top of their professional grades could better themselves in the national health service only by going into management, so their hands-on skills are lost to patients and colleagues. In future, they will be able to apply to become consultant nurses, instead. We have been discussing the details of that with representatives of the professions, and our plans will be set out as part of our new strategy for nursing.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew30"><B> Mr. Hammond: </B> 
 The fact is that, since the plan for supernurses was announced with a great fanfare last September, not a single one has been appointed. Indeed, the right hon. Gentleman's Department has instructed trusts not to appoint them. Yesterday, the Government announced a pay rise of 4.7 per cent. for the most senior nurses. I shall not ask the right hon. Gentleman whether that is fair or affordable, but will he tell the House whether he believes that it is sufficient to stem the haemorrhage of skilled and experienced senior nurses from the NHS?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew31"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 I sincerely hope that it is. As the hon. Gentleman would know if he had read the details--and if he has not read the details, let me tell him for the first time--a number of discretionary increments are added for people who are at the top of the more senior scales, which make it possible for their pay to go up by more than 4.7 per cent.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 718</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-02_para6">With regard to the proposals for consultant nurses, we made it clear that we would introduce them after we had had thoroughgoing discussions with the representatives of the professions, so that we did not create trouble by establishing them. Those talks are still going on. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I can tell the right hon. Lady that doctors, nurses and midwives welcome being consulted about such matters, and not having measures imposed on them, as the previous Government did.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew32"><B> Ms Harriet Harman  (Camberwell and Peckham):</B> 
 I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his forthright recognition that one of the ways to keep senior and experienced nurses in the health service is to recognise that most of them have family responsibilities for young children or elderly relatives and that, as well as invaluable work in the NHS, they also do invaluable work at home. I draw to his attention the industrial tribunal case of Hale <i>v.</i> Wiltshire Health Care NHS trust in which the trust was found guilty of discriminating by changing nurses' work patterns in such a way that they were prevented from taking their children to school. Will he ensure that all NHS managers implement his family-friendly policies?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew33"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 Yes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew34"><B> Rev. Martin Smyth  (Belfast, South):</B> 
 Although I welcome the attempts to improve the standard of pay and other matters, such as training for nurses, does the Secretary of State agree that the average patient speaks of a supernurse as one who gives tender nursing care? Is he aware that there is some concern that, with the professionalisation of the nursing profession, some nurses are so busy that they cannot spend the time with patients that patients require?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-02_spnew35"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 I have already said that many nurses find that they are run off their feet and feel that they cannot give individual patients the attention that they deserve. We want to deal with that, in part by increasing the number of nurses available so that there is a bit more time for patients. We must recognise that everyone still expects nurses to provide tender loving care for the individual patient, while, at the same time, nursing is becoming infinitely more demanding and complex, as new and incredibly complicated pieces of equipment come on to the wards and pharmaceutical products become more complex. It is very difficult for an individual nurse to reconcile those needs and it is vital that we have more nurses to enable them to do so.

 How many women in the Trent health region have received cervical smear tests in the last year.  [67167]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spmin0"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health   (Mr. John Hutton): </B> 
 In the year ending 31 March 1998, 350,617 women in the Trent region were tested, up from 328,014 women in the year to 31 March 1997--an increase of nearly 7 per cent.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew0"><B> Mr. Heppell: </B> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that response. I congratulate the Government on their recent action in ensuring that quality standards on cervical screening are consistent across the whole country.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 719</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-03_para0">Will my hon. Friend confirm that the cervical screening programme has been a success, and has saved the lives of thousands of women, and that a lot of that success is due to the dedication of the staff of the service? The previous Government left the work of the staff unsung; the service was understaffed and the staff were overworked and underpaid. On that last point, will my hon. Friend at least ensure that, in the next pay round, the dedication of the staff is recognised?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing attention to the success of the cervical screening programme. About 4 million women are screened each year in England and it has been estimated that the programme prevents up to 3,900 cases of cervical cancer each year. He might also want to know that coverage in Nottinghamshire is among the highest in the country--slightly over 90 per cent., compared with a target of 80 per cent.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stephen Dorrell  (Charnwood):</B> 
 I am pleased that the Minister recognises that the cervical smear testing programme constitutes a huge advance in women's health in this country--in the Trent region and elsewhere. Will he also recognise that the programme was introduced--and was given huge stimulation--as a result of the NHS reforms introduced in 1990 by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)? Will the Minister take this opportunity to congratulate the previous Conservative Government on an important public health programme launched by my right hon. and learned Friend?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 I am sorry to have to disappoint the right hon. Gentleman, but I shall not be able to do that. We inherited a situation that was not satisfactory and I should point out to him that one of the consequences of the reforms that he oversaw, and for which he was responsible, was the compromising of the effective monitoring arrangements for the cervical screening tests. He should be ashamed of that.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael Clapham  (Barnsley, West and Penistone):</B> 
 My hon. Friend will be aware that the assessment of the cervical tests varies from area to area, and that causes some concern. What mechanism is he considering to drive best practice through the service?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 I can assure my hon. Friend that the whole thrust of our reforms, right across the board, is to improve the quality of services available to everyone who uses the national health service, including those women who use the cervical test screening programme.
<P>

<a name="90202-03_para1">We want to improve the service across the board. That is one of the priorities that we have identified in all our policy documents, and in all that we have said in the House about our policies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spmin1"><B>The Secretary of State for Health   (Mr. Frank Dobson): </B> 
 Our target is to have enough nurses and <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 720</B></P>
midwives to provide the treatment and care that patients need. We therefore need more nurses, and we need them now. That is why we have agreed the biggest real-terms pay rise for nurses for 10 years, and why we are paying it in full.
<P>

<a name="90202-03_para2">That is not all. We are also making nursing more attractive by providing more flexible shift patterns. We want to make things better for more experienced nurses by replacing the rigid grading system with arrangements that will help them to develop their careers and reward their additional responsibilities.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew6"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for his answer. He will know, however, that only 15,000 of the 300,000 nurses in the national health service will welcome yesterday's announcement. In that context, is the right hon. Gentleman not concerned about the NHS Direct service, about which he will shortly make a statement? The service was piloted in Wiltshire hospitals--so well run by the Wiltshire NHS trust over the past three years, incidentally, and set up by the Conservative Government. Does the right hon. Gentleman not fear that a nurse-based service such as the NHS trust--thought up by the Conservatives--will be hard to man if experienced nurses leave the service?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew7"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 The hon. Gentleman ought to learn to count, or else brief himself before coming into the Chamber. While between 13,000 and 15,000 nurses will receive a 12 per cent. pay increase, another 70,000 will receive an increase of 8.2 per cent. or more, and the remainder will receive 4.7 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90202-03_para3">I shall deal with recruitment through NHS Direct in my statement. At this stage, I shall merely say that I have urged NHS management who are involved in the introduction of NHS Direct to try to recruit, in particular, nurses who have had to leave nursing because of industrial injuries. A back injury, for instance, might make it impossible for a nurse to perform the normal nursing task, but that nurse might still be able to deal with telephone callers. Nurses would thus be able to use their skills for the benefit of patients and their own great satisfaction.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew8"><B> Laura Moffatt  (Crawley):</B> 
 Can my right hon. Friend reassure us that the superb nurses' award--about which many of my colleagues will be thrilled--will affect neither recruitment nor the modernisation of our health service? Those who work in the health service are our best-ever asset, and we must ensure that we modernise their pay. Will my right hon. Friend confirm that the money that has been set aside for modernisation will not be affected by the award?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew9"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 I can confirm precisely that to my hon. Friend, who is one of two former nurses in the House. We are financing the nurses' pay increase with money that we put into the NHS budget for next year. We made the decisions in July last year, and, not unreasonably, we anticipated that the review bodies would make a recommendation well in excess of the rate of inflation, which they have. We therefore set aside, within the modernisation fund, certain sums to help to pay the increase if it reached the level that it has reached. That is a proper use of money to modernise the health service. I think that many people, especially nurses, detest the <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 721</B></P>
suggestion that there is a conflict between paying nurses a decent wage and looking after patients. After all, it is the nurses who do the looking after.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew10"><B> Dr. Peter Brand  (Isle of Wight):</B> 
 I am sure that the Secretary of State will agree that nurse recruitment needs good schools of nursing. Will he use his good offices to sort out the unseemly dispute between the universities of Portsmouth and Southampton following the transfer of the contract for nurse training? A number of nurse tutors have been left in limbo, because those two public bodies will not agree on which is responsible for redundancy payments.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew11"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 As the hon. Gentleman knows, I want to improve the arrangements for nurse training, not overthrow them because there have been some good developments. I want to change them, so that there is considerably greater national health service influence over who goes into nurse training and what sort of training there is. The aim is to redevelop the links between the NHS and nurses in training. As the NHS has had so little to do with nurse training in recent years, many of those in management have lost interest in nurse training and not given it enough attention.

<a name="90202-03_spnew12"><B> Mr. Michie: </B> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for his answer. I welcome the new initiative, which I believe to be the first on policing legal duties of partnership. Does it include social care?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew13"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Yes. If we are to improve services across the board--that is our primary objective--it is important that we find a way of getting the national health service and social services to work much more effectively together. We know from the result of the consultation on "Partnership in Action", which we published last year, that that is overwhelmingly what people want us to do. The Health Bill will, for the first time, remove the legal obstacles that currently prevent the NHS and social services from working effectively together.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew14"><B> Ms McCafferty: </B> 
 Can my hon. Friend confirm that, through the Bill, for the first time, a legal duty will be placed on the quality of care, unlike before, when the only duty placed on trust chairs was to balance the books?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew15"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B>

 I think that that is a typical lawyer's perspective. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I will answer the hon. and learned Gentleman's question because it is a serious one. The whole purpose and thrust of our new clinical governance and duty-of-care arrangements will be to improve the quality of care. That, I hope, will make it less likely that people will litigate.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew18"><B> Mr. Howard Flight  (Arundel and South Downs):</B> 
 Will the Minister clarify the Government's policy with regard to primary care centres and, in addition, beacon of excellence awards--proposed targets for practices? In my constituency, the leading general practitioner practice was well lined up to develop such a centre and has qualified for a beacon of excellence award, but, for the past few months, the NHS executive has been completely silent on how the scheme is going forward. Yesterday, the Secretary of State for Health was quoted in a leading paper as saying that he supported such centres, pulling together a wider package of optician services, prescriptions and other health care services, but it seems that the Government policy in that area is somewhat in limbo at present.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew19"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, the Government's policy is not in limbo. The Health Bill, which I invite him to study, will clearly apply to primary care, but the quality duty that we intend to legislate on is not about individuals; it is about institutions. The principle of clinical governance needs to apply obviously and clearly in the area of primary care, as well as secondary care, and it will.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew20"><B> Mr. Tom Clarke  (Coatbridge and Chryston):</B> 
 Given that elderly patients represent around 50 per cent. of those in hospital, and consistent with the Griffiths report, "Agenda for Action", and Lady Walner's report, "Residential care: options for choice", may I invite my hon. Friend to agree that it is extremely important, as it was when those documents were published about a decade ago, that organisations of elderly people, individual elderly people and elderly people locally should be consulted on services that are vital to their particular needs?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-03_spnew21"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The answer to my right hon. Friend's question is yes. I also draw his attention specifically to two of our current initiatives. The first is the establishment of the new national service framework for older people, which will make a very positive contribution in defining new service models and in setting national standards across the national health service for the care of older people. Secondly, as I said earlier, we are currently embarked on a new regulatory framework and standard-setting exercise for treatment in registered <P>

nursing homes and care homes. Together, the two initiatives offer the prospect of developing policy in that very important sphere.

 What recent representations he has received on the unavailability of particular <i>(a)</i> drugs and <i>(b)</i> treatments to patients in certain health authorities.  [67170]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-04_spmin0"><B>The Secretary of State for Health   (Mr. Frank Dobson): </B> 
 I have received representations about availability on the national health service of certain drugs in certain parts of the country. The current situation is quite unsatisfactory, which is why we are establishing the National Institute for Clinical Excellence--NICE--chaired by Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, to assess new drugs and new treatments and to issue authoritative guidance. NICE will ensure faster access to modern treatment right across the health service--which is why it has the support of doctors, nurses, midwives and other NHS staff.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-04_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Bottomley: </B> 
 Many people hope that the new National Institute for Clinical Excellence will indeed encourage innovation and change. However, people are not prepared for the institute to act as a straitjacket, dampening down innovation and making it more difficult to develop and make available new drugs. Recently, the Secretary of State was condemned by the British Medical Association for an inequitable and irrational approach in reaching his rationing decisions. Health authorities are in despair about how on earth they are to meet the new pay awards. Will the Secretary of State now accept the offer of my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) and lead a mature debate on the establishment of rationing and on how decisions are made in the national health service?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-04_spnew1"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 All I can say in response to that is that the professions welcome the establishment of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. The BMA chairman was chairing the meeting at which I announced the appointment of Sir Michael Rawlins, and said that I had been as good as my word in appointing to chair the institute someone who commanded the professions' respect. The professions welcome the establishment of the organisation, which I am sure will do a good job. I am sure also that, if anyone is in despair running parts of the national health service, I should not want them to be working in despair--they can go work somewhere else.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-04_spnew2"><B> Mr. Andrew Miller  (Ellesmere Port and Neston):</B> 
 Did not my right hon. Friend inherit a situation that included restraints--which varied across the country--on the availability of some drugs, such as beta-interferon, and huge disparities in the availability of some treatments because of huge waiting lists? Will he ensure that NICE maintains need as its primary criterion when it considers some of the alternative treatments that may become available because of genetic and other treatments?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-04_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 Certainly, NICE will examine all new treatments and new pharmaceutical products, and it will issue authoritative advice. In some cases, it will be saying, <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 724</B></P>
"Get on with it, quickly. This is a good development, and you should introduce it right across the country." Currently, no one performs such a function. In other cases, NICE may say, "We are not too sure about this. The results of its effectiveness testing may not be as good as we should have liked." If so, NICE may recommend that the treatment or product should be made available systematically in only one part of the country, so that further proper tests and assessments can be performed.
<P>

<a name="90202-04_para0">The object of the exercise is to have fast access to modern treatment right across the national health service, and not to maintain the ridiculous current situation, in which some drugs are available in one part of the country but not in another, because of the lack of clear advice given under the system that we inherited from the previous Government.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-04_spnew4"><B> Mr. Peter Viggers  (Gosport):</B> 
 Is the Secretary of State aware that 22,000 of my constituents made active representations about the closure of the Royal Haslar hospital in my constituency which would be a disaster for the defence medical services and a catastrophe for local residents? Will Ministers take a personal interest in the disaster that would result from the closure, particularly as the hospital in question is close to the constituency of the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), and the closure would have reverberations there too?
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-04_spnew5"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 It is clear that the closure of the Royal Haslar hospital will have an impact on health care in Portsmouth and in Hampshire generally and we are looking into that. I intend to meet the admiral who chairs the Portsmouth acute trust to discuss the matter. He is a most admirable admiral and probably carries a little more weight at the MOD than an ex-civilian.

 What assessment he has made of the role primary health care plays in improving health service provision in Liverpool.  [67171]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-04_spmin1"><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Mr. John Denham): </B> 
 More than 90 per cent. of patient contact in the national health service takes place in primary care. In Liverpool, general practitioners and primary health care teams have a major role to play in improving the health of local people and in further developing services. That includes participation in the primary care groups where a key priority will be improving access to local services closer to where people live, rather than in a hospital setting.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-04_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Ellman: </B> 
 Does the Minister agree that in areas such as Liverpool, where many people suffer chronic ill health, it is absolutely essential that all parts of the health service work together effectively and co-operate with social services? How will his Department encourage the health authority in Liverpool to ensure that primary health care is used to its maximum, working together with community hospitals so that the pressures of chronic ill health do not concentrate solely on the acute hospitals such as the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS trust?
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-04_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 A series of measures is already in hand, or will be introduced in the Health Bill, and will produce precisely the result that my hon. Friend would like. Already, in addition to the development of primary care groups, which we encourage to enable the health authority to grow and develop, there is a health action zone, and the health authority, in co-operation with others, will <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 726</B></P>
develop a health improvement programme identifying how primary health care should be improved. The Health Bill will place a duty of partnership on all parts of the NHS. I believe that in Liverpool and elsewhere we are getting the structures right, putting in place the legal responsibilities and providing the resources to enable local people to lead the way in developing better primary care services.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-04_spmin2"><B>The Secretary of State for Health   (Mr. Frank Dobson): </B> 
 I wish to make a statement on the development of NHS Direct, the nurse-led 24-hour helpline.
<P>

<a name="90202-04_para1">In March last year, we launched three NHS Direct pilot schemes in Milton Keynes, Preston and Newcastle upon Tyne. Between them, they covered more than 1.5 million people. They have proved a great success--up to the end of December, they had taken over 60,000 calls. Independent research has revealed that 97 per cent. of users are satisfied with the service provided, which they find prompt, friendly and professional. It has been particularly popular with young mothers and around40 per cent. of calls have been about children.
<P>

<a name="90202-04_para2">Callers get through at first to a call handler, who takes their details and deals with any requests for basic information. Callers who have a specific health problem are then put through to a nurse. The nurse listens to the caller, assesses the case using what is called an expert computer-based decision-support system, and then recommends what action the caller should take. That can range from immediately summoning an emergency ambulance to advising callers to visit their general practitioner or the accident and emergency department, giving advice on how to treat someone at home, and offering simple reassurance.
<P>

<a name="90202-04_para3">A detailed survey of the three pilots showed that, for the latest quarter, 80 per cent. of callers were advised to do something different from what they had intended before they rang NHS Direct; only 9 per cent. of callers had intended to look after themselves at home, but after calling NHS Direct 38 per cent. of them were enabled to do so; 20 per cent. of callers were directed to more urgent care and 40 per cent. to less urgent care; and 530 people were transferred to the 999 service.
<P>

<a name="90202-04_para4">It rapidly became clear that the pilot schemes were a success, so last summer I authorised the extension of the scheme, with 13 call centres to cover 40 per cent. of the country--20 million people--by April this year. The first of those opened last month, covering 1.1 million people in the black country. Yesterday, a further scheme covering almost 1.6 million people opened in Essex. A further service covering Nottinghamshire opens next week and the first service in London opens in parts of west London early in March.
<P>

<a name="90202-04_para5">The other areas to be covered by about Easter are in the west country; Manchester; West Yorkshire; Hull and East Yorkshire; Hampshire; north-west Lancashire; Birmingham as well as the black country; Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham; Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire; and Newcastle and the north-east. Most of the services will be provided by the local ambulance trust, but they usually involve the local GP co-operatives, other NHS trusts and voluntary bodies. In some cases, local social services are involved as well.
<P>

<a name="90202-04_para6">The success of NHS Direct springs partly from the use of modern technology, properly managed and staffed by top-quality professionals with a sympathetic ear. It also depends on commanding the support of the NHS in each locality, particularly the professions involved in providing primary care. At my personal insistence, there will be a <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 728</B></P>
major role for GP co-operatives in the delivery of the service in many parts of the country. I am pleased to be able to report that the west London call centre, to be located in Southall, will be run by a local GP co-operative.
<P>

<a name="90202-04_para7">Our original intention was to extend NHS Direct to cover 60 per cent. of the country by April next year. However, in view of its growing success and my concern to help the NHS cope with the special problems that it is likely to encounter over the millennium period at the turn of the year, I have decided that the programme should be brought forward to aim to cover at least 60 per cent. of the country by the beginning of December this year. In some cases, that will be achieved through extensions to existing centres where the service is well established and in others it will be achieved through opening new centres. We intend to cover South Yorkshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Liverpool and parts of London. NHS Direct could be particularly valuable in all those areas next winter. To achieve that, we shall be investing an additional &#163;10 million from the NHS modernisation fund on top of the &#163;44 million from the fund already committed to NHS Direct in the coming financial year.
<P>

<a name="90202-04_para8">NHS Direct is proving to be a modern, additional, convenient and dependable service for the people who turn to it. It is also proving to be popular and professionally satisfying with the nurses who staff it. One centre recently received more than 300 applications for 50 jobs. Applications for nursing jobs with NHS Direct have come from other parts of the NHS, from the private sector and from those returning to nursing. With the support of the Royal College of Nursing and Unison, I am keen to encourage applications from experienced nurses who have left nursing because of, say, a back injury that left them unable to carry out routine nursing tasks. Working in NHS Direct could give them the opportunity to continue to put their hard-won professional skills and experience to good use to the benefit of patients.
<P>

<a name="90202-04_para9">The new schemes should provide the basic NHS Direct advice and information service that has proved so successful in the three pilot areas of Newcastle, Preston and Milton Keynes. From July, the Newcastle centre will be working with local doctors, A and E departments and other services to provide one gateway for out-of-hours services, with a single number for patients to call. That shows the huge potential for using NHS Direct to develop new and better services for patients in a way that is also popular with the professionals involved. Building on the experience of that pilot, I will be prepared to consider similar pilots where NHS Direct has shown that it can deliver the basic service and where there is a joint commitment by NHS Direct and the local doctors and other professionals involved to deliver services in that way.
<P>

<a name="90202-04_para10">Arrangements are now being made to set performance standards for NHS Direct call centres, drawing on careful evaluation of experience so far and on best practice for call centres in other sectors of the economy. We are determined to use the capacity of the national network that we are creating to provide the most dependable service. NHS Direct is a good example of the opportunities that new technology offers to help make the best possible use of the professional skill and knowledge of NHS staff, putting 21st-century technology in place for the beginning of the new century.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 729</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-04_para11">I am pleased with the success of NHS Direct, delighted that it can be funded from the extra &#163;21 billion that we have found to invest in the health service, and glad to have been able to announce today that 60 per cent. of the country should have access to NHS Direct by December this year.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-05_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Duncan  (Rutland and Melton):</B> 
 It is a happy task to give today's announcement on NHS Direct a general welcome from Conservative Members. Our objective always is to improve patient care and to see continuing improvements in the NHS. When the Government do the right thing, we will say so--and this appears to be just such a case. I hope that my warm reception for today's statement does not so shock the Secretary of State that he becomes an early user of the hotline. NHS Direct stands to be popular with nurses, patients and doctors alike. We are pleased that the Secretary of State has decided to build on a project which--as I am sure he is prepared to confirm--we started when in government.
<P>

<a name="90202-05_para0">Does the Secretary of State agree that a patient's GP should know of the advice given by NHS Direct to his patient, and by whom that advice was given? Does he accept that the success of the service will depend on the model that is adopted? Is he aware that there is some concern that ambulance trusts may not be the most appropriate providers of the service? Does he envisage lots of local units, or a few larger units? Is it not true that small and local is desirable, but that larger and more central is more economic? How will he strike the balance between the two? Will there be a single nationwide telephone number for the service?
<P>

<a name="90202-05_para1">We note that there is already evidence that nurses who have left the NHS will be attracted back to NHS Direct, but what percentage of nurses are applying from other areas of the NHS, given that there is already a shortage of nurses in those other areas? What is the right hon. Gentleman's assessment of any legal liability that might attach to the advice given by NHS Direct? What guidelines and safeguards will be put in place?
<P>

<a name="90202-05_para2">We wish NHS direct every success and we want it to add to patient care. We will watch closely the exact way in which it is implemented.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-05_spnew1"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 It would be churlish not to welcome the general welcome from the hon. Gentleman--although it may be the sort of general welcome that could be matched by the Russians, who would say that their main general was "General Winter".
<P>

<a name="90202-05_para3">GPs will be informed of approaches made on the helpline, provided the person who has rung in gives permission. Confidentiality must work both ways. It applies not only to GPs patients, but to people who ring in to NHS Direct--and so it should. I have made it clear that, so far, ambulance trusts have been the principal suppliers of the call centres because they have the necessary experience and, sometimes, some capacity.
<P>

<a name="90202-05_para4">I have made it clear to GPs--and, in particular, those who are behind the GP co-operatives--that I want a greater involvement of GP co-operatives. That is why I say that it is at my insistence--rather against the advice of some of my officials--that GP co-operatives are now <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 730</B></P>
so extensively involved. It is also why at least one of the new centres that will come into operation shortly will be run by a GP co-operative. Whoever provides the service, co-operation among all those involved locally is crucial.
<P>

<a name="90202-05_para5">The size of units will vary from one part of the country to another. I am a great believer in horses for courses: in some places there will be large horses and in others there will be small horses, because those who are responsible for providing the service locally will decide how best to do it.
<P>

<a name="90202-05_para6">We are trying to get a single telephone number, but that is proving more difficult in our relations with BT than we or, I would have thought, most people in the country would have expected, and we will have to do something about that.
<P>

<a name="90202-05_para7">We have not as yet set any national performance standards for NHS Direct, because if we are to set sensible standards we will have to draw on the experience of the set-up. Legal liabilities for NHS Direct staff will be the same as those for all other national health service staff.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-05_spnew2"><B> Mr. David Hinchliffe  (Wakefield):</B> 
 I welcome my right hon. Friend's statement. NHS Direct will seem to most people to be common sense, so it is strange that such a system was not introduced a long time ago. I welcome the fact that one of the inquiry centres will be in Wakefield.
<P>

<a name="90202-05_para8">Bearing in mind the fact that NHS Direct is about enabling people to make the best use of the NHS, will my right hon. Friend consider the marked differences in the use made of A and E departments from area to area? A while ago, my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who was then a Health Minister, told me that more use is made of A and E in my area than in most other areas. There are reasons for that. I hope that calls to NHS Direct will be analysed and that we can examine the way in which people make different use of facilities in different parts of the country and tackle the discrepancies and the reasons for them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-05_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 Again, as a believer in horses for courses, I note that, for example, when there is a large and famous hospital in a deprived area--such as the centre of Manchester, Newcastle or Leeds, or in certain parts of London--it has been traditional that people who wanted to be attended to went to that hospital rather than to their GP. Generally speaking, it is up to the national health service to adjust itself to people's needs rather than asking people to adjust themselves to the NHS. There may be variations, but we should not necessarily seek to eliminate them; we should simply try to cope with them.
<P>

<a name="90202-05_para9">There are large variations in all forms of use of the health service, be it in the proportion of people resorting to A and E or the state of people who are put in intensive care beds. That varies from one tradition to another throughout the health service. We need more uniformity in some aspects of NHS practice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-05_spnew4"><B> Mr. Simon Hughes  (Southwark, North and Bermondsey):</B> 
 The Liberal Democrats, too, welcome the extension of NHS Direct and the fact that it will be more integrated with GP co-operatives. We are a bit suspicious that the announcement was made today because the Secretary of State felt that he needed a good news fig leaf to cover the rather less good news on which we would otherwise have been concentrating.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 731</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-05_para10">How many nurses will be engaged in NHS Direct? Will integration with primary care groups, trusts and GPs throughout the areas to which the service is extended be guaranteed? Have the pilot schemes demonstrated any impact on the rising tide of emergency admissions or on the demands on consultants and other practitioners? Have the pilots already shown money to have been saved and pressure moved from other places in the health service?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-05_spnew5"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 It is difficult to determine the causes of all sorts of complex shifts in the national health service, especially in winter, but, roughly speaking, twice as many people are advised to do something that is less demanding on the health service as are advised to do something that is more demanding on it than they would have done had they not telephoned. The rest of the hon. Gentleman's points are all part of the Liberal Democrat leadership campaign. We are used to him spending at least a penny every Health questions and such like, and now I suppose it is "Three Coins in a Fountain".

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-05_spnew6"><B> Kali Mountford  (Colne Valley):</B> 
 I add my congratulations to my right hon. Friend on his announcement, especially as it includes my constituency of Colne Valley, which he visited last year at the time of a meningitis outbreak. How does my right hon. Friend envisage NHS Direct integrating with the other services that support schools, parents and hospitals at such times?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-05_spnew7"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 For a start, NHS Direct is supposed to be relatively free-standing and to do its basic job of receiving calls from people who are concerned about the health of themselves, their relatives or neighbours, and giving direct advice. It is likely that, eventually, its functions will be extended to other spheres, but it is crucial that each local service demonstrates that it can do its basic task before it seeks the agreement of the other professionals in the area to extend into more complex spheres. If there were an outbreak of meningitis or something else that is very frightening for parents, the people working at NHS Direct, like everyone in the front line, would be all the more vigilant, and I am sure that arrangements would be made to inform other people in the health service if issues cropped up unexpectedly or needed to be drawn to the attention of people with greater expertise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-05_spnew8"><B> Mr. Stephen Dorrell  (Charnwood):</B> 
 I join in the general welcome for the national launch of NHS Direct. The Secretary of State's proposal will make an important contribution to the more effective use of NHS resources. He is right about that, but I have one niggle in my mind. Can he explain to the House how he has persuaded himself that an idea, the piloting of which started a year before he took office, is his idea?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-05_spnew9"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 The pilot schemes for NHS Direct started after we came into office, in Milton Keynes--[Hon. Members: "Wiltshire."] The pilot schemes started in Milton Keynes, Newcastle upon Tyne and Preston and Chorley. They drew on bits of experience--[Hon. Members: "Ah!"] Do you remember, Madam Speaker, going to the doctor when you were a lass and he said, "Say ah"? They cannot stop doing that on the Opposition Front Bench. Obviously, the pilot schemes drew on bits of information and experience that had been gathered in this country and others. That was the only sensible thing <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 732</B></P>
to do, because it is best to try to make use of experience. However, the three pilot schemes, run in the way that we intended, were introduced in Milton Keynes, Newcastle upon Tyne and Preston and Chorley, by us.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew0"><B> Miss Anne Begg  (Aberdeen, South):</B> 
 I welcome my right hon. Friend's announcement today that NHS Direct will give jobs to nurses who have found it difficult to continue on the wards because of, for example, a back injury. I ask him to go further and draw on a pool of nurses who have left the profession, perhaps some time ago, because of encroaching disability or an illness, such as multiple sclerosis, and nurses who may have taken early retirement because the physical aspects of the job had become too much for them. Such people have much relevant expertise and making use of that would not exacerbate existing nurse shortages.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew1"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 I can honestly say to my hon. Friend that that is the very point that I have been making to departmental officials for a long time and I am disappointed with their performance in seeking and securing the recruitment of people who are disabled. The proportions are no greater than for the general recruitment of disabled people, despite the fact that that point has been drawn to officials' attention time and again by Ministers. It is an ideal situation to enable people with immense practical skills and experience acquired in nursing to make use of them, despite having a disability that makes it impossible for them to work on the wards.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew2"><B> Rev. Martin Smyth  (Belfast, South):</B> 
 I welcome the NHS Direct scheme, and also look forward to reports covering the peripheral regions of the kingdom. I underscore what has been said about the ambulance service, which has years of experience of such work and alongside which GPs have been employed to give really professional guidance. However, may I advise the Secretary of State to be careful about using one telephone number for the whole nation, given BT's lamentable failure to cope with the recent storms in Northern Ireland?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 I shall bear in mind all the points that the hon. Gentleman has made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew4"><B> Mr. Kevin Barron  (Rother Valley):</B> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for his statement and for the success that NHS Direct has achieved already. The extension of the scheme into South Yorkshire will be warmly welcomed by the people there, who will regard it as a further investment in our national health service. Given what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) said, may I, as a resident of Southwark, thank my right hon. Friend for extending the scheme to my neighbours in London as well?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew5"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 As with everything else that we have done, we have tried to ensure that the new developments in the national health service are concentrated initially on the most deprived areas, as part of our general effort to raise the standard of health of people who are the most badly off more quickly than we raise the standard of health of the rest. That very proper and reasonable priority includes the introduction of NHS Direct, and we shall stick to it through thick and thin.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew6"><B> Mr. John Bercow  (Buckingham):</B> 
 Although the statement is welcome, how can the Secretary of State <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 733</B></P>
guarantee that nationwide implementation of the NHS Direct scheme will not be compromised by the Government's decision to raid the so-called modernisation fund to pay for the welcome increase in nurses' salaries?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew7"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 There are terms of abuse that one is not supposed to use in the House, but let us assume, for the purposes of answering his question, that the hon. Gentleman is fully equipped with all his senses. He might have noticed that the day after announcing the biggest real-terms pay increase for nurses for 10 years, I am announcing that further expenditure is to be brought forward from the modernisation fund to deal with another aspect of modernising the national health service. The modernisation fund will continue to fund all the other aspects of modernisation to which we are committed. It can do so because, as I explained earlier, we have ensured that it contains a sum to cover the likely additional increase in pay for nurses.
<P>

<a name="90202-06_para0">While we are talking about helplines, I can tell the House that the latest figure for people ringing in to express an interest in returning to nursing is 3,400--a rise of 600 in the hour that we have been talking.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew8"><B> Mr. Tam Dalyell  (Linlithgow):</B> 
 Can I ask an awkward--although I hope not malign--question? Does my right hon. Friend recall that I sent him a long and complex paper by Lord Justice Sir Philip Otton on the question of medical negligence? What happens when, in good faith, a person rings up for guidance and, in equally good faith, is given that guidance over the telephone? If that guidance turns out to be disastrously wrong, could NHS Direct be sued in the courts? Does not the potential exist for a legal nightmare, even though people might act in the best of good faith on the basis of what they are told? What is the legal position?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew9"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 As my good and hon. Friend knows, I have discussed the paper with Sir Philip Otton, and we are holding discussions with other people about the problems of litigation for the health service. However, there is no difference, in terms of liability, between advice given over the telephone through NHS Direct, advice given face to face and advice given over the telephone by anyone else. Liability would depend on whether there was a degree of negligence. That is the legal position and we cannot change it. At some point, something will go wrong--that is inevitable; face-to-face advice goes wrong, and operations go wrong even when they are carried out by the finest surgeons in the land. It is no good our pretending that that does not happen. We must try to make sure that the best-quality advice is available. but the liability for NHS Direct is just the same as it is in any part of the national health service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew10"><B> Dr. Evan Harris  (Oxford, West and Abingdon):</B> 
 May I congratulate the Secretary of State on the apparent success of the pilots, and welcome their extension to Oxford? It remains to be seen whether my constituents will welcome our pilot or see it as adequate compensation for the millions of pounds worth of social services cuts forced on the local authority by the Government.

Milton Keynes A and E attendances lower than the figures for surrounding areas, or has their rise been smaller? There is a danger that schemes such as the pilots, which appear welcome and worth while, may in fact increase attendances by finding untapped demand.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew11"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 We must look at the net effect. Clearly, some people who would be reluctant to dial 999 for an ambulance or to try to get their doctor out in the middle of the night will ring up NHS Direct in the knowledge that a 24-hour helpline exists for them. As I have said, one survey shows that 530-odd people were immediately put in touch with an emergency ambulance when they called. It is almost impossible to calculate how many of those people were additional to those using the ambulance service or going to accident and emergency departments.
<P>

<a name="90202-06_para2">There have been attempts to analyse the figures, but the relationship between them and what happens on, for example, Tyneside--involving, say, the Royal Victoria infirmary or the Freeman hospital, which are both in Newcastle--and NHS Direct is difficult to discern. I have told the people involved in the schemes that we do not want to come up with a lot of false claims, and, at present, any direct claims could be false and misleading. Roughly speaking, 40 per cent. of calls have involved people who were advised to do something less than they had intended, and 20 per cent. resulted in people being told to do something more. There may be a net gain, but that is not the object of the exercise: the object is to make top-quality advice available on the phone for people who are bothered about their health.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew12"><B> Dr. Phyllis Starkey  (Milton Keynes, South-West):</B> 
 May I pass on the warm feelings of the people of Milton Keynes about the success of the national health service pilot in our area, which is efficiently run by the Two Shires Ambulance NHS trust? I accept the point that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made in his reply to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) about the difficulty of analysing different uses of the service. However, will the analysis of the use of NHS Direct in Milton Keynes be made available to Buckinghamshire health authority, so that it may use the information as one of its indices of health care need in the area and ensure that the needs of Milton Keynes are rather more fairly funded within the county than they have been heretofore?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew13"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 Certainly, all the information will be made readily available. There is nothing commercially secret about it. When I went to the opening ceremony at Milton Keynes, I was somewhat disturbed to observe that the local coroner turned up.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-06_spnew14"><B> Mrs. Virginia Bottomley  (South-West Surrey):</B> 
 Like others, I wonder why we are debating NHS Direct, not the acute problems caused by the nurses' pay award. Will NHS Direct help my authority, which has received less than 1.7 per cent. growth money, and which has an inflation allowance of 2.5 per cent? The pay award will cost twice that, and the authority's share of the modernisation fund, which is apparently intended to pay for NHS Direct, will cover less than 25 per cent. of the cost.
<P>

<a name="90202-06_para3">Many of the Secretary of State's hon. Friends have thanked him for what he has done for their constituencies, but other areas of the country that have enormous demand <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 735</B></P>
are being offered a deaf ear by the Government when they ask how on earth they are to cope. Please will the right hon. Gentleman find a way to assist constituencies such as mine, through NHS Direct or in any other way?
<P>

<a name="90202-06_para4">As to the scheme, has the Secretary of State learnt any lessons about the GP practices from which the callers come? Traditionally, many people might have contacted their GP, who has a 24-hour commitment, with their queries. I imagine that the Secretary of State will learn some interesting information about those who make enormous demands on the NHS Direct service and those who use the services of their GP. How will the Secretary of State ensure that there is appropriate feedback about the use of the service and what that reveals about the rest of the NHS?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-07_spnew0"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 The right hon. Lady has raised two points. The fact is that, next year, funding to the national health service will increase by 5.7 per cent. in real terms. A substantial chunk of that increase will go to Surrey--although it is true that it will not be as substantial a chunk as would have been allocated under the rigged system that we inherited from the Conservatives. We are trying to target our efforts at the most deprived areas where people are least healthy, which is a wholly laudable priority. The financial officers in the health service in the right hon. Lady's area should not be in despair. If they cannot manage with the money they have, they are not doing a very good job because they are receiving much more funding.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para0">NHS Direct is a perfectly good scheme which was welcomed at its inception by the British Medical Association. Doctors in each area are enthusiastic about it once it is in operation. They have initial doubts about the scheme's likely impact: some are concerned that it will take work away from them and others are concerned that it may add to their work load. If, like her colleagues, the right hon. Lady is an expert on the Wiltshire scheme, she will know that it appeared to reduce GP work loads in Wiltshire. However, we do not know whether that is a typical outcome: it may vary between different parts of the country.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-07_spnew1"><B> Mr. John Gunnell  (Morley and Rothwell):</B> 
 As the calls to NHS Direct will be incoming, will the nurse who responds initially be able to call the patient back if she is concerned about her original advice or the patient's condition? Will she pass on the call to another health service agency or person who will then make that contact?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-07_spnew2"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 The person who first receives the call will take a note of telephone numbers, addresses and names. Therefore, either the nurse who gives the advice or some other professional will be in a position to get back to the caller if they have reconsidered their advice or they want to check that everything is okay after several hours. Callers are often advised, "Go to bed and tuck yourself in, and I'll ring back in a few hours to see how you are." It is a very flexible service, which is one reason why it is so popular.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-07_spnew3"><B> Mr. John Maples  (Stratford-on-Avon):</B> 
 On a point of order, Madam Speaker. My point of order goes to the heart of the rights of Members of Parliament to hold Ministers to account. In October, I tabled questions to every Government Department about the use of RAF and chartered flights. All of them answered, except the Treasury--the Chancellor simply refused to do so. Standing Order No. 22(4), which deals with written questions on a named day, states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Minister shall cause an answer to be given".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-07_para2">I suggest, Madam Speaker, that under Standing Order No. 22, you have the power to insist that the Chancellor answers my question. The Chancellor is blatantly and brazenly refusing to give factual information about his use of public money. In recent days, his taste for chartered jets and helicopters has been leaked and we can see what he has to hide.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para3">If Ministers are allowed to get away with this trick, they will be able to deny information to hon. Members on any subject that they find embarrassing. Madam Speaker, I hope that you can find some way to stop this deplorable practice--otherwise the rights of the House will be seriously eroded.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-07_spnew4"><B> Madam Speaker: </B> 
 As the hon. Gentleman is aware, I am not responsible for the answers that Ministers give to parliamentary questions. No doubt, those who are currently sitting on the Treasury Bench will have noted his remarks and may well follow through on that issue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-07_spnew5"><B> Mr. Dale Campbell-Savours  (Workington):</B> 
 Further to that point of order, Madam Speaker. May I say that I have been a Member of Parliament for 20 years and can refer to thousands of replies of a similar nature that I received from Conservative Ministers, except that they were far more devious? They referred to disproportionate costs. Conservative Ministers did that repeatedly when they did not want to answer questions asked by Labour Members.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-07_spnew6"><B> Madam Speaker: </B> 
 I have nothing to add to the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon(Mr. Maples).

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-07_spnew7"><B> Mr. Patrick Nicholls  (Teignbridge):</B> 
 On a different, but related, point of order, Madam Speaker. Is there not a distinction to be made between your not being responsible for the nature, content or quality of an answer being given, and the issue being asked about, which is, as I understand it, that of whether an answer is given at all?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-07_spnew8"><B> Madam Speaker: </B>

 I beg to move,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require organisations responsible for the provision of essential public services and critical infrastructure to draw up contingency plans in the event of their computer systems failing to deal with calendar dates after 31st December 1999; to require such plans and the names of those responsible for them to be notified to an appropriate authority; to require the plans to be made available on demand; and for connected purposes.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-07_para6">In 1995, in a question to the then Prime Minister,my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), I warned of the possible consequences for business and government of the threat to computer systems posed by the failure of most of them to recognise the year 2000. On hearing that, the whole House fell about--I do not suppose that there were many hon. Members then who knew what I was talking about. Today, scarcely a day goes by without a reference to the threat of "Y2K", as the issue is technically called. Today, with only 333 days left, there is growing awareness that not enough has been or can now be done to ensure that the commencement of the new century will be trouble free.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para7">It is true that this country is probably ahead of most others in taking the action necessary to avoid problems. In addition to the measures that my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon told me his Government were taking, in response to my Adjournment debate on the issue in June 1996, the then information technology Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor), announced the establishment of a TaskForce 2000 business awareness campaign. In 1997, the current Government replaced TaskForce 2000 with Action 2000, which last year introduced the millennium bug campaign. In addition, the current Government report quarterly to the House on the progress being made by central Government in tackling the problem.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para8">The Leader of the House made the fourth such statement to the House on 2 December, when in answer to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) she said that, when she had attended an international conference on the issue, it appeared that this country was much the best prepared. The right hon. Lady also said that we are internationally vulnerable, and she was right to do so. One of the essential messages that everyone needs to understand about this unique issue is that no computer is an island, and no island such as ours can be insulated from the global economy. No matter how well this country is prepared, if our computer systems are linked to others that are not ready, ours will be affected by them.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para9">There is no internationally recognised standard on millennium conformity, or any world test day: I have argued for both of those in the Council of Europe in its role within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Today, there is ample evidence that Japan, much of south-east Asia, China, Russia and many European countries with which we trade, such as Spain, will not be millennium ready. Because there is no longer sufficient time left--let alone sufficient resources available--to ensure that such countries will be ready, the early warnings by experts that there will be a tidal wave <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 738</B></P>
of chaos affecting whole economies, commencing where the new millennium first arrives, in the Pacific region, and moving westward with the speed of time, are no longer treated with incredulity.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para10">The same logic applies just as crucially to our economy and the provision of public services. It is truly an all or nothing situation. In a network of computer systems, the chain is as strong as its weakest link. If one system is not compliant, all those with which it is linked are at risk. That is why no one can guarantee that we shall avoid problems at the end of the year. The magnitude of the millennium issue is impossible to quantify. The truth is that no one knows what will happen when Big Ben strikes midnight of the new millennium.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para11">To date, the House has kindly allowed me to introduce two Bills to respond to that issue. Because I did not consider that it would be sufficient to rely on voluntary awareness and action on the part of those in the private sector to ensure that British business would be millennium ready, I introduced the Companies (Millennium Computer Compliance) Bill in 1996 and again in 1997. In March last year, I introduced the Millennium Conformity Bill, which would have required all date-related computer systems to conform to the British Standards Institution code. Neither Bill received the support of the Government of the time.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para12">Today, most experts agree that anyone now waking up to the issue and commencing the time-consuming, painstaking process of essential testing will find that there is not enough time left. That is the view of the head of Action 2000, Gwyneth Flower, who recently said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are too late to have a trouble free transition to the new millennium".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-07_para13">
That is why it is now essential to ensure that contingency plans are in place, and especially to ensure that our public services are maintained and that our critical infrastructure makes a seamless transition into the next century. That is the purpose of the Bill that I seek the leave of the House to introduce today. It accords with the advice of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the House, the National Audit Office, Action 2000, TaskForce 2000, the second report of the Select Committee on Science and Technology, the 66th report of the Public Accounts Committee and the second report of the Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs. The difference between their advice and my Bill is that they make exhortations to take voluntary action, whereas my Bill would impose a statutory obligation on those concerned.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para14">Why should that obligation be necessary? As I have already emphasised, voluntary action has not resulted and will not now result in this country being completely millennium ready, so it will not ensure that contingency plans will be in place. The Bill would do more to ensure our protection. It would require organisations responsible for providing essential public services and critical infrastructure to draw up contingency plans to maintain continuity in the event of the failure of the computer systems involved. It would require such plans and those responsible for them to be notified to an appropriate authority and to be made available on demand. Hon. Members from both sides of the House are sponsoring the Bill.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para15">It may be said that such a Bill is unnecessary because existing legislation provides for contingency plans to be drawn up to deal with a wide range of civil emergencies, <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 739</B></P>
from floods to terrorism and from hurricanes to epidemics, and those arrangements are already in place. That is true, but all that legislation is designed to respond to unforeseen events. Such contingency plans are broadly designed to respond to a variety of situations and, conventionally, to counter physical failures. Year 2000 problems are not a physical failure; they are a logical failure.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para16">It is not well understood that all conventional forms of contingency and disaster recovery planning for information technology systems will not work for year 2000 projects. New forms of contingency plans will be needed. Moreover, existing legislation does not provide for business risk scenarios, and existing private sector contingency plans are also unlikely to be appropriate for potential millennium emergencies.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para17">Unlike most emergency situations, the threat of the millennium bug is utterly predictable in its timing. It will begin to affect non-compliant, date-related computer systems from midnight of the first day of the new century--either with immediate effect or after a period, according to what the computers have been programmed to do. That is a threat on which we can legislate precisely.
<P>

<a name="90202-07_para18">My Bill calls for contingency plans to respond precisely to the performance of computer systems. It is confined to those that provide essential public services and infrastructure that is critical to our nation. If passed, it would do much to ensure minimum interruption in our daily lives and the protection of the most vulnerable people. Without such precise legislation in response to such a predictable and unique threat, a growing mood of uncertainty and alarm may develop over the year, altering the behaviour of the public and financial markets. We still have time to avoid that scenario; that is what my Bill will do.

 On a point of order, Madam Speaker. You will have noticed the fine body of parliamentary persons who sponsor the Bill promoted by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Atkinson). By dint of queueing, I promoted a ten-minute Bill last Tuesday. Parts of my speech were played on "The World This Weekend". I was put out when asked on that programme which Minister listened to my speech, because no Minister, either from the Ministry of Defence or the Foreign Office, was on the Front Bench to do so. I noticed that there was no one from the Department of Trade and Industry to listen to the hon. Gentleman's speech today. I shall be very blunt: if the Government of the day had listened years ago to the House of Commons and the hon. Gentleman when he promoted his previous Bills--I served on the Committee that considered one of them--we would not be in the bloody mess that we are today about the millennium bug. That applies to both Governments concerned.

When Tom Paine wrote that in "The Rights of Man", which was first published in the early part of February 1791, he could scarcely have imagined that, almost exactly 208 years later, his criticism of the hereditary Members of the House of Lords would still be relevant, and would still be opposed by the Conservatives.
<P>

<a name="90202-08_para6">What exactly is the Conservatives' view of the hereditary principle in the legislature? Even after careful scrutiny of the speeches that they made yesterday, it is difficult to say with any confidence. Indeed, the Conservatives still seem to believe that membership of the legislature should be determined by what happened in a previous lifetime. The only other person who seems to believe in that principle is the England football manager. Perhaps the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) is already exhausted by the unequal struggle of trying to reconcile the conflicting wings of his team, and is even now sending his application to be the next England manager. He will plan, no doubt, to select a hereditary England football team, presumably with lots of players on the right wing, little ability up front, and an open goal at the back.

<a name="90202-08_para10">I welcome the Conservatives' recent conversion to the cause of constitutional change. We did not hear a great deal about that during their 18 years in government. Indeed, the boast of the hon.

As a result, they were published in a White Paper in the name of the Government alone. However, hon. Members on the Conservative Opposition Front Bench in the Commons spoke in favour of the ideas when the White Paper was debated in the Commons.

<a name="90202-09_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ian Bruce  (South Dorset):</B> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for the excellent history lesson that he is giving us on the previous proposals. Does he agree that the failure in all those systems was that nobody agreed on how we would end up with a better House of Lords, a better second Chamber or, indeed, no second Chamber? It is wholly wrong for the Government to try to achieve reform in two bites, instead of introducing proposals that had been accepted by hon. Members on both sides of the House and achieving reform in one go. Why are the Government carrying on with this illogical proposal?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-09_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The proposal is not illogical, and, if the hon. Gentleman will bear with me for a few minutes, I will deal with his point in my brief description of the history of it.

<a name="90202-09_para0">The 1968 White Paper stated unequivocally that

<a name="90202-09_para1">
It was proposed that existing hereditary peers could keep their seats, but not their voting rights. Their heirs would have no rights at all. What sank those proposals was their complexity, together with the decision by the Conservative Opposition to withdraw their support. The proposals were so complex that there were an almost infinite number of issues on which it was possible to delay progress.
<P>

<a name="90202-09_para2">It is clear that, in each of those efforts at reform, it was assumed that the inheritance of a peerage would no longer automatically give the right to attend and vote on legislation in the House of Lords. Each time, the complexity of those comprehensive packages led to difficulty and to eventual defeat. Although the key elements of the reform proposals--the need for a revising second Chamber, the extent of their lordships powers and the overriding need to remove the rights of hereditary peers--received widespread support, the minority opponents of each element combined to defeat the whole. That is why this Government's step-by-step approach is such a sensible and pragmatic way of achieving reform.

 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his observations. I have started to read one of his speeches from those debates, but he will forgive me for not having yet completed it. The Government have clearly sought to address those observations in the package of proposals in the White Paper.
<P>

<a name="90202-09_para3">The pragmatic approach that I have described was deployed by a Conservative Government, who proposed and passed the Life Peerages Act 1958. The purpose of that Bill, as described by Lord Home in the other place, was to

If a Conservative Government were right in 1958 to deal with the creation of life peerages in a pragmatic, single-step reform, why should it be wrong today for a Labour Government, implementing a specific manifesto pledge, to seek to remove in a first stage the rights of hereditary peers to vote?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-09_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Mackinlay  (Thurrock):</B> 
 On that manifesto pledge, my hon. Friend will recall that the manifesto specifically said that there would be a Joint Committee of both Houses in relation to the second stage, and used the words "to bring forward proposals". I know that there will be a royal commission, and I am told that a Joint Committee will sit after the royal commission. Will my hon. Friend put some beef on what, exactly, will be the procedure for the Joint Committee? Will it be able to reject the proposals of the royal commission and will it have a time scale? What are the rubrics for that Joint Committee coming forward with what our manifesto described as proposals for the second stage?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-09_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 For technical reasons, the Joint Committee cannot meet until the Bill has passed through Parliament. <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 745</B></P>
It will consider the parliamentary implications of any recommendations that are made by the royal commission. There will be a two-stage process: the royal commission will consider ideas in a general way, and will then put them to the Joint Committee, which will examine the specific implications for Parliament, both here and in the other place. Its suggestions will then have to be put before Parliament, which will legislate if necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-09_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
 What about the time scale?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-09_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I shall deal with that in due course, when I have looked at the proposals for the transitional House.

 I thank the Minister for giving way. It is most courteous of him.
<P>

<a name="90202-09_para11">The hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Mackinlay) has made an important point. After the royal commission has reported, its report will go to a Committee of both Houses. I consider that entirely proper, as Parliament itself is sovereign. Can the Minister assure me that the Committee will have an opportunity, if it wishes, to object to, reject or change the commission's proposals, and that, if that is the case, the Government will not automatically cast aside the Committee's views, but will recognise that Parliament will wish to have its say in what the reform is? Can I be assured that Parliament will not necessarily rubber-stamp the work of a royal commission whose members have been appointed by the Government?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-09_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The right hon. Gentleman has, in a sense, answered his own question. It is clear that, ultimately, Parliament must decide on the recommendations of either the royal commission or the Joint Committee. It will be for Parliament to legislate, if legislation proves necessary--as it is likely to, given the likelihood of a fundamental change in the way in which legislation is passed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-09_spnew10"><B> Mr. Robert Maclennan  (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross):</B> 
 I hope that the Minister will be as helpful to me as he was to the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major). At what point might the Government wish to indicate their view--before the Joint Committee sits, or during its hearings? Certainly, we shall not learn about the Government's position during the consideration of the royal commission.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-09_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 It may not be entirely appropriate for me to say at this stage what the Government's position might be, but I assure the right hon. Gentleman that Labour and other political parties are very likely to want to make their views known. That may give him some idea of Labour's thinking.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-09_spnew12"><B> Sir Patrick Cormack  (South Staffordshire):</B> 
 The Minister's reply to my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) was a little disingenuous. Did he mean that the Government would not have their own <P>

view--that the Government would not whip their troops? Will the Government allow Parliament truly to make a decision on this matter?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-09_spnew13"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Parliament always truly makes a decision on any matter. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should make such an observation, given his long experience of the ways in which this place works.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-09_spnew14"><B> Mr. Major: </B> 
 I am sorry to pursue my point, but it is a genuine point, and I think the Minister may not have understood precisely what I was saying.
<P>

<a name="90202-09_para12">When the royal commission's report goes to a Joint Committee of Members of both Houses and, presumably, from all parties, the Committee will doubtless make specific recommendations. Of course Parliament decides; the question is, will Parliament decide on the Joint Committee's recommendations on a free vote, or will the Government, having made up their own mind, determine--using their large majority--to overrule Joint Committee views that may not be the views of the royal commission?

<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The right hon. Gentleman tempts me too far down a road leading to something that is still in the future. Although we have clearly indicated the importance of the royal commission reporting quickly--I will deal with that later if I have time--we have also indicated that we would encourage the Joint Committee to resolve its responsibilities in terms of the parliamentary implications of any royal commission suggestions. Obviously, it is important ultimately that Parliament does decide, and it will be a matter for Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew1"><B> Mr. Tony Benn  (Chesterfield):</B> 
 Does my hon. Friend understand the difficulty that faces the Government? The Bill is a simple one and no Labour Member would dispute it, but the new House coming out of the deliberations of the royal commission and the Joint Committee will be immensely complex. The fear of many people--I am one of them--is that the transitional deal that will preserve hereditary peers will become the permanent solution. With the Bill itself, we do not know what the Government view is, but we do know that the process will involve the most complex legislation. It could be so complicated that we end up with hereditary peers electing each other--and we have not even fulfilled the manifesto commitment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I have already made it clear that the Government take the view that the royal commission should report as soon as possible--by the end of this year if it can do so. That is a tight timetable for a royal commission, but it follows from that that the Government are determined that there should be a second stage. We have set that out clearly in the White Paper, but may I add this? My right hon. Friend and I were both elected on a specific manifesto commitment to remove the right of hereditary peers--

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew3"><B> Mr. Benn: </B> 
 All hereditary peers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 --of all hereditary peers--to vote. Of course, what we propose, which is contained in the Bill, is designed to achieve precisely that, so the Government have an interest in delivering the manifesto commitment <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 747</B></P>
on which Labour Members were elected. Therefore, there is no reason why we should want a transitional House to last any longer than it absolutely has to.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew5"><B> Mr. Patrick Nicholls  (Teignbridge):</B> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 No. I must make progress. I have given way on a considerable number of occasions. I was hoping to demonstrate how important it is to analyse what precisely the objection of Conservative Members is to the Bill. We had a good deal of debate yesterday and I regret to say that their objections did not become particularly clear.
<P>

<a name="90202-10_para0">I hope that Conservative Members will not object too strongly if I suggest that there are some suspicions about their real motives in arguing for the reasoned amendment. Are they genuinely in favour of profound constitutional change, or are they simply using the amendment as a fig leaf to hide the embarrassing fact that they have little idea whether they are for or against the hereditary principle?
<P>

<a name="90202-10_para1">The suspicion must be that the Conservatives are using the reasoned amendment to frustrate not simply the particular change in the Bill, but any change in the composition of the House of Lords. It is they who want to kick reform into the long grass.
<P>

<a name="90202-10_para2">In contrast, the present Government set out clearly in their manifesto not only their principled position, but the means for achieving their goal. The Government are fulfilling their manifesto commitment. A Joint Committee of both Houses will be appointed to take forward the proposals of the royal commission, which has been established to ensure the widest possible public debate. In analysing the options, the royal commission has been given clear terms of reference.
<P>

<a name="90202-10_para3">The royal commission is to report by 31 December 1999. The tight timetable will provide for its recommendations to be completed in sufficient time for the Government to respond to them in advance of the next general election. It demonstrates the Government's seriousness and sense of purpose in moving forward towards a full reform of the second Chamber. Once the royal commission has reported, the Government will establish the proposed Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament to examine the parliamentary implications of the commission's report. It, too, will be asked to work to a tight timetable.
<P>

<a name="90202-10_para4">The time limit is much shorter than for most royal commissions, notwithstanding the need for the widest possible public debate and the need to find consensus.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew7"><B> Mr. Nicholls: </B> 
 The hon. Gentleman has been generous in giving way, but, equally, he will appreciate that it is a most important matter. Everything that he has said so far concerns the composition of the upper House. Have the Government any idea at all what they want the function of the upper House to be because, if they change one House, they are bound to change the other?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 For reasons of brevity, I skipped over the terms of reference for the royal commission. The hon. Gentleman can find them in the White Paper, but they briefly are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to consider and make recommendations on the role and functions of a second chamber; and

<a name="90202-10_para5">Very clear guidance has been given to the royal commission on the matters on which we should like it to achieve consensus.

<a name="90202-10_spnew9"><B> Mr. Patrick McLoughlin  (West Derbyshire):</B> 
 The idea of a royal commission was first announced in July, by Baroness Jay, in another place. We have now had an announcement on the royal commission's chairmanship. When will the Government be able to tell us the size of the commission and who the other commissioners will be?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We shall announce those details in due course. I anticipate that it will not be a large royal commission. We want to ensure not only that the widest possible view is reflected in the commission's membership, but that the commissioners are few enough to be able to get on with doing their important work in a short time scale.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
 I should like to clarify one point with my hon. Friend. He keeps saying that the Joint Committee will consider the "parliamentary implications". However, our manifesto did not say that--it said that the Committee would make proposals. Will my hon. Friend flesh out both the implications of our manifesto commitment and his definition of a "tight time scale" for the Committee?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Committee will make proposals based on the parliamentary implications of the royal commission's recommendations. I cannot do any better than that in answering my hon. Friend's question. That will be the role of the Joint Committee, which will follow the findings of the royal commission and make recommendations to the House, on which my hon. Friend and all other hon. Members will have an opportunity to comment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew13"><B> Mr. Nigel Evans  (Ribble Valley):</B> 
 The Minister said that the names of those to serve on the royal commission will be announced shortly. Will the Government be consulting the Conservative party on a Conservative nominee to serve on the commission?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-10_spnew14"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Conservative party is already well represented on the royal commission, and I am sure that Conservative Members will be delighted by the names of those who fill the other places.
<P>

<a name="90202-10_para6">Yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House briefly mentioned the package of measures for the transitional House of Lords which have not been included in the Bill, because they are temporary administrative matters. However, they are an important and integral part of our proposals, and it is right that I should deal with them in more detail.
<P>

<a name="90202-10_para7">The Conservative party continues to maintain that our intention must be to create a "House of Patronage". Undoubtedly, from experience, they are aware of the potential for partiality in the exercise of the current powers of the Prime Minister to control access to honours. From 1979 to 1997, the Conservatives created 173 Conservative peerages to only 96 Labour ones. Excluding <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 749</B></P>
resignation and dissolution honours, the figures were126 to 59. That imbalance added to the already dominant Conservative representation in the House of Lords.
<P>

<a name="90202-10_para8">The new Government's position is radically different. We have consistently made it clear that we do not intend the transitional House of Lords to be one that is under the Government's control. Our manifesto was explicit on that point: we said that no one party should seek a majority in the House of Lords. Are the Conservatives able to commit themselves unequivocally to supporting a second Chamber in which no single party should have a majority? If they are, what action are they willing to take to achieve such a Chamber?
<P>

<a name="90202-10_para9">We have also made it clear that the system of appointment of life peers will be reviewed. We have committed ourselves to maintaining an independent Cross-Bench presence of life peers. We have said that, over time, the number of party appointees should more accurately reflect the votes cast at the preceding general election. We shall deliver on those promises.
<P>

<a name="90202-10_para10">There are three elements to our proposals: first, the principle that will help to determine numbers in the transitional House of Lords; secondly, introduction of an independent appointments commission to nominate Cross-Bench peers; and, thirdly, the undertaking to forward to the Queen without interference the recommendations of other party leaders and the commission.

<P>
<a name="90202-11_spnew0"><B> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield):</B> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-11_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I must make progress.
<P>

<a name="90202-11_para0">I shall deal, first, with the principle. We have publicly committed ourselves not to seek more than broad parity between the Government and the main Opposition party. Consistency with our manifesto would have allowed us to seek about 40 per cent. more seats than the Conservatives have in the other place. We have, therefore, gone much further in restraining the Prime Minister's powers than we had to. Consistent with our commitment to maintain an independent Cross-Bench presence, we have undertaken to allow peers to be created in proportion to the numbers of the other parties.
<P>

<a name="90202-11_para1">Secondly, the appointments commission will be an advisory, non-departmental public body. As such, it will be accountable to Parliament, through Ministers, in the usual way. That answers one of the points raised yesterday by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell). The Prime Minister will relinquish entirely his power to recommend nominations to the Cross Benches, giving up that power to an independent appointments commission. There are two important aspects of this to draw to the House's attention. The first is that the very act of setting up the commission is an indication of the Government's continuing commitment to the retention of independent Members of the House of Lords. The second is the reduction in patronage that will follow.
<P>

<a name="90202-11_para2">The commission will be set up later this year. It will begin to operate when the transitional House comes into existence. It will include members of the three main <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 750</B></P>
parties, together with a majority of independent members. The appointment of the independent members will be "Nolanised" in accordance with the relevant rules of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. As those rules were drawn up under the previous Government, I am sure that Opposition Members will not be tempted to claim that the body in question will not be properly independent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-11_spnew2"><B> Mr. Tam Dalyell  (Linlithgow):</B> 
 Exactly how are they to be "Nolanised"? What will be the process?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-11_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The appointments will be subject to precisely the procedures that the Nolan Committee expects such bodies to use--right hon. and hon. Members are becoming familiar with those procedures.
<P>

<a name="90202-11_para3">The appointments commission will be encouraged to seek nominations from a wide field, and will be able to consider nominations from members of the public. It will take over the role of the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee in vetting all peerage nominations for propriety, for example to ensure that they are not proposed in return for party donations instead of public service. That, after all, is how we came by so many hereditary peers earlier this century.
<P>

<a name="90202-11_para4">Thirdly, control over names will be relinquished. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has committed himself not to interfere in the detail of other parties' nominations. Within the agreed numbers, and subject to approval by the appointments commission, the Prime Minister will pass on any names submitted to him by the other political parties.
<P>

<a name="90202-11_para5">Taking the Government's proposals together, the Prime Minister will in future have less influence than any of his predecessors over appointments and over the composition of the House of Lords.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-11_spnew4"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold):</B> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way as I wish to raise an important point. Does what he has just said mean that the Prime Minister will have ultimate control over who is appointed to the commission? Everybody who is appointed to the commission is bound to have a political view, so how will the political balance be maintained?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-11_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 On the contrary, the position is precisely the opposite. As we set out in the White Paper, the chairman will be an entirely independent figure.
<P>

<a name="90202-11_para6">The question was raised yesterday about what guarantees the Government could give that the transitional arrangements would actually be put in place. Having set out commitments for a transitional House in our White Paper, it seems clear that, if we had then included them in the Bill, we would have been accused of wanting to make the transitional House permanent. Our intention is to move on from the transitional House as soon as we can. The Government were elected on a clear and unequivocal commitment to reform the House of Lords, with a specific first stage of ending the rights of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords.
<P>

<a name="90202-11_para7">Whenever efforts have been made previously to remove the hereditary peers' rights to sit and vote, and at the same time to deal with the powers and the composition of the House of Lords, they have failed. Taking the process step by step makes it more, not less, likely that real reform will actually take place. Removing the hereditary peers first removes a first real obstacle to reform and change.

<P>

<a name="90202-11_para9">In opening the debate for the official Opposition, let me first pay tribute to the dedication and commitment of the many hereditary and life peers who have served Parliament well--the life peers since 1958 and the hereditary peers over several centuries.

 I was paying tribute to those who had given great service, dedication and commitment. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the attendance record of some of the life peers--even some appointed by the current Prime Minister--he will find it wanting.

<a name="90202-11_para10">At a recent conference on Lords reform, the Liberal Democrat peer Lord McNally spoke of the difficulty of getting life peers to serve on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill Committee in 1996. Only one life peer served on the Committee, to six hereditary peers.

<a name="90202-11_para11">I enjoyed hearing the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) referring yesterday to the modernising policy of previous Administrations. Even the introduction of the hereditary principle for peerages was a modernising move at the time. The right hon. Gentleman pointed out that, even after the passage of the Bill, the second Chamber will lack democratic authority. The White Paper refers to all sorts of mechanisms to determine the composition of the future House of Lords and talks specifically about the down side of having a body that is wholly democratically elected.
<P>

<a name="90202-11_para12">There is no perfect model that would suit all systems of government. As hon. Members have pointed out, the composition depends on what we want the second Chamber to do. The Government have already decided, in the remit that they have given the royal commission, that this Chamber should remain the pre-eminent Chamber of Parliament, so they do not want a solely elected second Chamber. The new House will want to use all the powers at its disposal and may demand more, depending on how often its elections are and what form of electoral system is used if there is an elected element.

<P>
<a name="90202-11_spnew11"><B> Mr. Beard: </B> 
 The House of Lords has consisted of hereditary peers and life peers for 40 years. I have never heard the Conservatives question its legitimacy. Do they believe that the hereditary peers gave the House of Lords a mark of respectability that will be removed when it is left with people who are nominated for what they have done during their life time?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-11_spnew12"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
 Viscount Cranborne put it succinctly. Why should a House full of nominated peers who owe their positions to the current Prime Minister and previous Prime Ministers--I think that the White Paper mentions eight--be any more democratic than the current House? We are not arguing for the preservation of the second Chamber as it is currently constituted. In his tour de force covering historical approaches to such reforms, the Minister said that the Conservative Front Bench supported the 1968 proposals to remove the hereditary principle. We are not arguing with that. We simply want a more effective approach to the reform of the second Chamber.

<a name="90202-12_spnew0"><B> Dr. Phyllis Starkey  (Milton Keynes, South-West):</B> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that Viscount Cranborne was slightly in error, since he, alone of all Members of the House of Lords, owes his place to somebody who is still living--his father? I believe that Viscount Cranborne is a peer by accelerated succession, which means that he has his place by virtue of one of the extra titles that his father is not using. Was not the hon. Gentleman wrong? <i>[Laughter.]</i>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-12_spnew1"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
 Hon. Members may still be laughing at my reference to Labour's manifesto. However, the point is well made. The Chamber will be no more democratic if peers are nominated by the current Prime Minister or previous Prime Ministers than if they are there by dint of birth. We are looking for something that is far more effective, and we are not getting that with the proposed reform.
<P>

<a name="90202-12_para0">Yesterday, the Leader of the House referred to the Bill as simple. She should not confuse short with simple, because the intention behind the Bill makes it radical, and that intention is to shift more powers to the Executive. The Executive have already enjoyed an increase in the <P>

payroll over the past 40 years. The Executive constantly sideline the House in the presentation of policy, and use patronage and the stick over their Members to ruthless effect. We have Government by pager, supported by compliant, drip-fed Members of Parliament and abetted by the Liberal Democrats, who are no longer members of the Opposition but part of a coalition.
<P>

<a name="90202-12_para1">The coalition is led by a Prime Minister who is prepared to bypass the newspapers--which are only interested in tittle-tattle and trivia--to speak to the nation on the Richard and Judy show about Humphrey the cat, football and life at No. 10. No doubt the next stop for the Prime Minister's assault on serious political messages will be the next edition of <i>Hello!</i> magazine.
<P>

<a name="90202-12_para2">The Lords have been regularly chastised by the Prime Minister and his obedient followers at Prime Minister's questions. If the Lords dared to do their job, if they scrutinised legislation--and improved it, on certain occasions--and if they called on this House to think again when the legislation was sufficiently bad, their very existence was threatened.
<P>

<a name="90202-12_para3">The Bill is all about further enhancing the powers of the Executive. The so-called modernising of the House of Commons--half an hour of questions on a Wednesday, everybody home early on Thursdays, constituency weeks for Members--has nothing to do with keeping the Executive in check and everything to do with keeping Back Benchers in the dark.
<P>

<a name="90202-12_para4">We have a presidential style--as the right hon. Member for Chesterfield said yesterday--but without the checks and balances. Any reform of the second Chamber should have at its core the improvement of Parliament's work. The proposed reform does not do that. The Conservative party is not tied to the second Chamber as it is at present constituted. Indeed, many attempts at reform have been made by both parties. Viscount Cranborne stated:

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-12_spnew3"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
 There are many ways in which we could go forward. We set up a commission under Lord Mackay to look into the various options, and Viscount Cranborne asked Lord Richard, when he was Leader of the House of Lords, to come forward with an options paper. If the Government were serious about proper reform, and about a consensual approach, they would have set up the royal commission 20 months ago. The fact is that they did not, and we are now being offered a cobbled-together, two-stage deal. I will have a little more to say on that deal, and the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Mackinlay) may agree with me.

<P>
<a name="90202-12_spnew5"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
 Perhaps one of the Whips could have a word with the hon. Gentleman, as he has clearly not been listening to the debate. I have already been chastised for the fact that Viscount Cranborne was appointed as the nominee of a former Prime Minister. Neither method of appointment is democratic, as the hon. Member for Thurrock suggested. We need to investigate ways of getting a more effective second Chamber, so we must consider its functions. The royal commission should have been sitting 20 months ago. If the Government had set it up as soon as they were elected, it would have reported by now and we would have been able to reform the second Chamber in one stage, instead of which we have two-stage proposals--and many of us believe that we may never even get to the second stage.

<a name="90202-12_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nicholls: </B> 
 Will my hon. Friend help to protect the credentials of my noble Friend Lord Cranborne as an appointee? Does not the real reason why he does not have to wait until his father's death lie in the fact that my right hon.

<P>

<a name="90202-12_spnew7"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
 That is the point I was trying to make--obviously rather poorly--and my hon. Friend makes it better than I ever could.

<a name="90202-12_para6">The reform follows other constitutional changes, none of which is yet operational.

<a name="90202-12_para7">In an interview with the <i>Financial Times</i>, Baroness Jay referred to the House of Lords reform as part of a jigsaw, but the trouble with jigsaws is that pieces go missing, especially when they are all thrown in the air at the same time, as is happening now.

 We are pursuing this point because we do not have clarity from the Opposition.

<a name="90202-13_para19">The Government know all the possibilities for stage 2, but they have no clear idea of where to go. We fear the same as Lord Richard and the right hon. Member for Chesterfield and others of independent spirit on the Labour Benches--that the second stage simply will not happen.
<P>

<a name="90202-13_para20">I have no doubt that the royal commission will sit, just as the Jenkins commission sat. The royal commission will present a report, just as Jenkins did. If that report does not come up to expectations, however, what will happen to that report? Jenkins is now sitting on a shelf somewhere in Downing street. What will happen if the royal commission's report does not come up to standard? What guarantee do we have that, even after the Joint Committee has seen it, the commission's report will not end up gathering dust on a shelf, just as the Jenkins report on proportional representation has done?
<P>

<a name="90202-13_para21">We have been given no guarantee. Stage 1 is happening without stage 2, and hon. Members know that that is the reality. It was Bagehot who said:

Never have we needed an effective second Chamber more than we need it now.

<a name="90202-13_para23">I have seen wrecking amendments in the past, but the Bill is a wrecking Bill, like all the other wrecking constitutional Bills since May 1997. The Government's approach is incoherent and clearly incomplete. They are not finishing unsettled business from 1911, but creating unsettled business for well into the future. The House has the chance to do something that its Members normally leave to the upper House--to ask the Government to think again. Tonight, let us do just that.

<a name="90202-14_spnew0"><B> Sir Edward Heath  (Old Bexley and Sidcup):</B> 
 As I always do, I listened with great interest to the speech of the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) yesterday. In particular, I listened to that part in which he said that many of us wanted to keep life peers in the House of Lords because Prime Ministers had such joy in creating them. With a wave of his hand, the right hon. Gentleman said that I was one of those Prime Ministers who had created that sin. Let me tell the right hon. Gentleman that I found absolutely no joy in creating life peers. Every time I created one, nine people turned up saying that it should have been them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-14_spnew1"><B> Mr. Benn: </B> 
 For every peer created, there are nine hovering around Prime Ministers, saying, "What a brilliant speech you made." The penumbra of patronage is even more dangerous than the patronage itself.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-14_spnew2"><B> Sir Edward Heath: </B> 
 With great respect to the right hon. Gentleman, I must say that, when people have been turned down, they do not come saying nice things--exactly the reverse. The right hon. Gentleman said that I was one of those who had created a large number of peers. Therefore, I was inspired to turn up the figures--which are quite interesting.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 760</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-14_para0">As we have heard many times, the process started with Harold Macmillan in 1958. I was his Chief Whip at the time, and I remember that one of his main reasons for creating life peers was to bring to the upper House people with experience in business, administration or overseas affairs who would not normally be there. He believed that such people could make an extremely valuable contribution to general debates. His choices were admirable, but they did not fit the Bill. If one follows their careers in the House of Lords, one will find that they seldom contributed anything of unique interest that they had gained from outside experience.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para1">It then became purely and simply a political affair. Life peers were created for a variety of political reasons--often because it was felt that individuals would be less trouble up there. As I have been blamed for running away with this process, I shall give the right hon. Gentleman the figures. I found that Harold Wilson created 226 peers, Lady Thatcher created 216 and my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) created 171. The present Prime Minister, with remarkable speed and determination, has already created 105. Looking at my own figures, I found that my total was 48.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-14_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
 The people's Prime Minister.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-14_spnew4"><B> Sir Edward Heath: </B> 
 My annual rate was only 12. I discourage the right hon. Member for Chesterfield from saying such things in future, because I was certainly not to blame.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para2">I have thought a great deal about the problems that we are discussing today. Of course, this debate is about only one thing: the abolition of the peerage. It is about nothing else. The innumerable questions raised and dozens of comments made in the debate bear no relation to present events. The Bill says simply that we will wipe out the historical peerage in the upper House. That does not make for much of a debate: either you do or you do not. What else is there?
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para3">The Government have offered a compromise in the form of a proposal from the Cross Benches that 91 peers should remain in the upper House. We must look at that proposition from two sides. There are those who say that we should keep those 91 peers. Is it a very polite plot, in the hope that time will run on and the 91 will remain? It may be. On the other hand, it may be a rather impolite blackmail on the part of the Government, who are saying, "Very well, we will let 91 stay there, provided you let this Bill go straight through without any trouble." That is my reading of current events. I would not worry about retaining 91 peers because I do not believe that it will mean very much to them. They may be disappointed in the end, and there will be more bad feeling.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para4">The question is: do we abolish the hereditary principle for membership of the upper House? The Leader of the House was quite clear when asked about future developments: she had no answers. The reason is that the Government have not worked anything out. I do not mean to be offensive, but I am absolutely astonished that the Labour party spent 18 years in opposition and did not work out the details of what it wanted to do about the upper House. There is a moral there for my own party: although the Conservatives might not be 18 years in opposition, they must use the time that they are there properly, so as to be ready for the future.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 761</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-14_para5">It is true that, in opposition, the Conservatives have to do a great deal of work on their own policies, but it is also true that the reason why the Leader of the House could not say any more than she did is that she does not know any more. However, she did say that the reason why reform broke down in 1968 was that the Government tried to do too much at one time. I have to correct her on that, for that was not the reason at all. The measure commanded a large majority in the Lords--5:1--and the support of all parties; it then came to this House. Devaluation had just occurred and morale was pretty low, but the reason why the measure fell was that it was opposed by Michael Foot, who said, "Away with an upper House--we don't want an upper House at all." He got a lot of support. On the Conservative side, the measure was opposed by Enoch Powell, who said, "Let's go back to the 14th century with the upper House." He got some support. Faced by the two of them, the Government lost their nerve and Harold Wilson said, "Let's pack up." That is what happened--it was not an attempt to do too much at one time.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para6">The debate has proved how impossible it is to have a proper debate unless there are positive propositions on what to do next. The right hon. Member for Chesterfield ended his speech with a warning to the Leader of the House and to the Government, saying, "Yes, but wait for the next stage." We all know what that means, as far as the right hon. Gentleman is concerned: on many different problems, he reaches the last stage and the Government get pretty peeved about it. We now know that, unless propositions are advanced that receive full support from a large number of Labour Members, the Government are in for a difficult time with the next stage.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para7">To give the royal commission only until Christmas sounds fine, but it faces an impossible task. Lord Wakeham is a great friend of mine and was an immensely able Chief Whip. He knows all about the difficulties of administration, but I can assure the House that having a mixed-party commission as well as outsiders, and being told to solve the problem in less than 12 months, is entirely different from solving a party problem as Chief Whip. I wish him well, for he faces an extremely difficult task and we must await the outcome.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para8">Before I sit down, I shall say a few words about my own beliefs. First, I believe that the time has come for the end of the hereditary principle in politics--that is my absolute conviction. We are about to enter the first century of the next millennium and it is time that that came to an end, although that is not in any way to undervalue what has been done in the past by many--not always the same few--families. Theirs was a tremendous task and we owe them a great deal for having carried it out, but it is now over and we must move on to a purely democratic arrangement.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para9">The measure does not affect the royal family for, as we know, the Queen does not sit as an hereditary Member of the House of Lords. In Europe, there are many proofs of that: I have found at least six European Union member countries that have a sound monarchy, but no hereditary system. I therefore want to see the abolition of the hereditary system.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para10">We must then answer the question of what will be substituted for that system. Should we have appointments? That is largely what has been discussed <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 762</B></P>
today. I am extraordinarily dubious about switching to any of the systems that have been detailed. The Prime Minister is pleased to have said that he does not want to make all the appointments, but will just look after his party and, similarly, party leaders can look after the other two parties. An odd committee, appointed by the Prime Minister, will look after the rest of the appointments.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para11">That is an opportunity for those leaders to gain far more power than they have at the moment, which would not be in the common interest. It would be extremely dangerous. Their increased powers would apply not only to the upper House, as it would then be, but to a range of their activities in the country, on the economy, politics and administration. Having once occupied that position myself, I know the extent to which it could be abused.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para12">My second point is that the upper House must be elected. That will cause astonishment--I think that I heard a great gasp of breath behind me. If we have an elected system, it must fit in with our present system. That can be done. The powers that are given to the upper House--if we still call it that--need not interfere with the powers of the Commons. That is a question of working out the system and how it will operate.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para13">The fact that we have such a flexible election system for this House makes it very difficult to decide on the election system for another House. In the States, on the same date, representatives are elected for two years and senators for six years. It is not possible to do that here. It is very difficult to decide how that should be done without having a fixed timetable for one or other of the Chambers. We may come round to the idea of having a fixed timetable for both, but that would be an enormous change to our system.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para14">As I have said, this is the end of the hereditary system. It should be the end of appointments, because what will be required in future makes it impossible to have anything other than a mass of stooges, which is not what the system is about.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para15">We are witnessing rapid change--faster than before--of the whole system of our government. I am not sure that it is yet realised that this House is being considerably changed. I am always struck by the fact that those who have the power of organisation want the occupation of MP to be a daytime one. There have been changes to Wednesdays and Thursdays, and we often do not sit on Fridays. We are being given a week off later in the month. That is turning the job of a Member of Parliament into a daytime occupation. The impact is that professional and business men will no longer be able to enter the House. As a result, they will not be available to be members of a Government. That is a drastic change which will affect the rest of society as well as the membership and behaviour of this House.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para16">I do not believe that such a process can be changed now that it is on the move. The Prime Minister comes here on Wednesdays for half an hour of questions and gets tired at the end, but does not appear otherwise. This debate, tremendous as it is, has not been attended by the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition. My hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), who opened for the Opposition yesterday, has not appeared today and the Leader of the House has now disappeared. That shows the lack of attention now paid to Parliament. I see that developing with the greatest possible regret <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 763</B></P>
because it is immensely damaging to our political system and the welfare of our present citizens and those who are due to follow.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para17">I want an elected upper House and an elected lower House because they will have the power to deal with those who simply want to cast off the whole parliamentary system and run it in a centralised fashion. It is becoming more and more centralised because that is how--I shall not go into the niceties of the issue--those in power get their way, reaching all the ends that they want to reach.
<P>

<a name="90202-14_para18">This is a momentous debate; you may not have realised, Mr. Deputy Speaker. We must consider matters in this new way because we in this House can try to influence developments. That is the lesson that I draw from this one-way debate. Although it may be solely about abolishing the hereditary system, it is one of the indicators of the future of our parliamentary government.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-15_spnew0"><B> Mr. Peter Mandelson  (Hartlepool):</B> 
 I think that all of us would agree that the speech of the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) was utterly commendable for its clarity and firmness of view. Thank goodness that, at long last, someone on the Conservative Benches has expressed a firm opinion on how the reforms should be carried forward. However, our Government Front-Bench team should not embrace his blandishments and his suggestion that we should decide on the outcome of the reforms and the review before we embark on anything. I agreed with my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House when she said yesterday that, only too often, the House has been prevented from conducting any reform because it has become bogged down in an insistence that everything be right and clarified before any change is made.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para0">The course of action on which the Government have embarked, including the decision to depart in one respect from the party manifesto to set up a royal commission before establishing a Joint Committee of both Houses, is therefore absolutely right. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not in any way want to risk stirring up and provoking my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Mr. Mackinlay), but I am afraid that I must tell him that I was the lonely voice in the original Cabinet Committee discussion who urged that we set up a royal commission. I did so because I thought that the party's original commitment to create a Joint Committee of both Houses immediately was rather incestuous and introspective. I thought that it was right--the Government decided that it was right--to create a mechanism by which we could tap the views of the wider public and all those who want to contribute to those matters before both Houses came together to decide how to proceed.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para1">Incidentally, I hope that I have not just breached part of the Official Secrets Act 1911 in disclosing such a point. I do not want to retard any progress that I may or may not be making. I shall just chalk it up on my freedom of information slate for a later day.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para2">I also thought that setting up a royal commission was right because there was every risk that a Joint Committee of both Houses would become a political playground for the Opposition, who would not be able to resist playing politics with it, in which it would be difficult to reach any half-decent outcome in any reasonable time.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para3">We have seen from the debate so far that the Opposition are incapable of placing the interests of Parliament above their own narrow party and partisan interest. In the <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 764</B></P>
process, they have tied themselves in the most awful convoluted knots, as was evident from the speeches of those on the Opposition Front Bench, both yesterday and today. What we heard today from the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) was a contortion too far, even by the standards of this Opposition.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para4">No doubt, the Tory party will try to free itself from its illogical predicament by means of a late burst of democratic enthusiasm, when its own commission under the chairmanship of Lord Mackay reports. It would not surprise me in the least if the Tories were to follow rather tardily and, in this respect alone, unfortunately, the leadership shown by their former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para5">However, no late democratic conversion undergone by the Opposition will carry any conviction whatever with the public. Most people observing their antics will simply conclude that they are showing an interest in a democratic second Chamber only because no one is showing any interest in their returning to power in this Chamber. People will conclude, rightly, that that is a pretty squalid and cynical exercise on the Opposition's part, that their interest in a democratic second House is only skin deep and that their democratic credentials remain wafer thin.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para6">What is clear from so many of the speeches that we have heard from the Opposition is their deep longing to retain their 3:1 in-built hereditary majority, which they have held on to through so many generations. If they were given half a chance, they would continue to do so.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para7">The Government should pursue their simple, step-by-step, considered and consensus-building approach to reform of the House of Lords. If the so-called Weatherill amendment is offered again in the other place, we should probably embrace it. It would be a proper reward for good behaviour on the part of a House that might otherwise be tempted to filibuster the Bill endlessly, thus doing enormous damage to the rest of the Government's programme. If we can get the Bill and the rest of the programme on which we were elected through the upper House with minimum delay and damage to ourselves, we should seize the opportunity.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para8">I certainly do not think that we should embrace such an amendment if it were offered in this place during our Committee stage. It should be a matter of consensus building, which we should judge in the light of the behaviour of the other place.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-15_spnew1"><B> Sir Patrick Cormack: </B> 
 Has not the right hon. Gentleman just demonstrated his utter cynicism? He is prepared to vote against the amendment, as it were, one week, and to vote for it the next, at the behest of his party bosses. Is not such an exercise in cynicism beneath contempt?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-15_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 It is an exercise in eminently good sense from a party member who supports a Government who want to get their business through both Houses, because that is what we were elected to do. Our approach and behaviour should take their cue from the attitude and behaviour of others in the upper House. That is entirely reasonable.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para9">The Government's approach and the discussions that we conduct should start with the recognition that the House of Lords is far from bad, but that it canbe improved. Its revising wisdom is, for the most part, a <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 765</B></P>
benefit rather than a hindrance to the parliamentary process. It must be recognised, however, that there are two aspects of the House of Lords that the public find objectionable. The first is the existence of hereditary peers--the principle of being born to rule, something that the public will never accept, and nor should they--and the second is that the public find unacceptable the excessive power of patronage by the Prime Minister, however worthy and suited are his nominees to membership of the other place. Both those objections about the House of Lords are rightly addressed in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para10">What people like about the House of Lords is the fact that it is, in some respects, somewhat less partisan, and somewhat less tribal, than this place. The public like the idea of Cross Benchers--people who do not owe their membership of the House of Lords to the patronage of a party or to having been shepherded by Whips--and the idea that the House of Lords is a collection of soldiers, dons, business men, doctors and trade unionists. Although they like the composition of the House of Lords, they would certainly prefer the average age of its Members to be reduced, and for it to have more women and more representatives of ethnic minorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-15_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
 If we were to pause after implementing the new arrangements, how we would get the loose cannon, the bloody-minded, the eccentric and the awkward? Those people simply would not become Members of the House of Lords, except by patronage. One of the benefits of electoral systems is that they throw up the bloody minded, the awkward and the irritable. That is important, because a Chamber of Parliament must have that cocktail of characters to provide scrutiny and accountability, without fear or favour and without showing partial affection. If we pause with the setting up of an independent commission for the Cross Benchers and the involvement of party leaders, we will not get that.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-15_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 I shall overlook my hon. Friend's obvious invitation, and come to that point in a moment. I entirely agree that the bloody-minded should have their place in the House of Lords. He could draw up criteria that might be introduced on the workings of the appointments commission and I am sure that such an amendment, in due course, would be taken very seriously by Ministers.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para11">The public do not want the removal of a clear party mandate, a clear manifesto and a clear means--the basis--by which a Government can carry their programme in this place. Those, of course, are the basis of the House of Commons: people know exactly what manifesto they are voting for, they offer a clear mandate and they vote to constitute a majority for the governing party in this place. People like such clarity and the straightforwardness about this place, which depend entirely on the dominant role given to the House of Commons by the Parliament Acts and by the Salisbury convention. Any reform of the House of Lords needs to take that firmly into account; if we alter the basis on which this place operates, rather than enhance democracy, we will risk severe damage to it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-15_spnew5"><B> Mr. Robert Jackson  (Wantage):</B> 
 I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will take a moment to note that his <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 766</B></P>
arguments about the straightforwardness of the system for election to this place and the manifestos are the main arguments for retaining our present system of voting for the House of Commons.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-15_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 I recognise that entirely, but that argument is set against the other argument in favour of electoral reform, which is that we want a more representative and more fairly elected House of Commons. If the hon. Gentleman does not mind, I will not be drawn on that issue on this occasion.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para12">I do not want the House of Commons to be demoted. I do not want the conditions created in which we would create two rather powerful Houses of Parliament which would compete, risking gridlock and constitutional stalemate between them. That would be the inevitable consequence of building up the House of Lords and its powers through any reforms that we might be minded to introduce. That is not a matter for the Bill; in the first instance, it is a matter for the royal commission and its excellent chairman, Lord Wakeham.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para13">I cannot resist teasing the Government slightly about Lord Wakeham. I learned of his appointment in the way that we are always informed about the background to the Government's thinking: through the proliferation of spin doctors and such people who, I am afraid, infest this place. When I heard that Lord Wakeham--a Tory peer--was being appointed to prove that no one was trying to fix anything, a smile came to my face. After all, there is no better fixer than Lord Wakeham. He is lucky, as we are, to have sitting alongside him that paragon of selfless humanity, independence and integrity--my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton(Mr. Kaufman).
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para14">I shall offer the House two concluding thoughts on reform and thinking about the future composition of the House of Lords, but will not be drawn on them in any detail because this is not the time. First, when--in my view, at least--some glue is needed in the United Kingdom to set against the possible fissiparous effects of devolution, a second Chamber, if constituted and composed in the right way, could contribute a bit of that much-needed glue, to keep the United Kingdom together. I am glad that the Government have given some inkling of that thinking in the White Paper, which is absolutely right.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para15">I contribute my second idea as a well-known, if not notorious, pro-European who is none the less worried about the remoteness and lack of legitimacy of the European Union's institutions. This is not the time to develop that argument; I have done so on other occasions in other places. If we were to use the second Chamber to create a link between this national Parliament and the European Parliament, we would help to overcome the slight gulf that has opened up between this Parliament and the institutions of the European Union.
<P>

<a name="90202-15_para16">In both those respects, we could use this opportunity of reform of the House of Lords to make other, wider improvements to our constitutional settlement. I have no doubt that those ideas, along with many other worthy proposals, will be considered by the royal commission in due course.

honourable estate. As a Back Bencher, the right hon. Gentleman has an important part to play in trying to check the control of an Executive with an over-mighty parliamentary majority, and I look forward to seeing him perform that role.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para0">Certainly, during the past few minutes, the right hon. Gentleman has demonstrated that he has the capacity to surprise. Not since Satan denounced sin have I heard such a recantation as the right hon. Gentleman's remarks about the possible implications for the "glue" of the United Kingdom of the devolution policies that he previously supported. But, speaking with some experience, I can tell him that he will find that returning to the Back Benches is not too bad; indeed, it has a large number of compensations.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para1">I once advocated a classless society, so I am not here to defend the hereditary principle for legislative purposes. It is, for those purposes, a dead principle, and I am unconcerned about that aspect of what the Government propose in the short term. I am here to defend the effective and efficient working of Parliament, in Commons and Lords, for I do not wish to see that die in the same fashion as the hereditary principle, which is now doomed to extinction.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para2">Over recent months, we have had a great deal of talk about reform of the House of Lords. Let us be clear: up to a point, this is reform. It is the first half, the destructive half, of reform. It is tearing down what exists; it is condemning the hereditaries to the tumbrel--but it builds for the future, nothing. It is, at the moment, a blank cheque for the future of the House of Lords. The hereditaries are disappearing into a vacuum, and, as we wish them godspeed, we have no idea what will replace them in the medium term. Not even my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Wakeham has any idea, and he is to chair the royal commission--a royal commission with an impossible mandate: to replace 700 years of constitutional practice in a few months of part-time consideration.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para3">I do not know what the commission will propose. Maybe--given the virtues of the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman), as adumbrated by the right hon. Member for Hartlepool--if and when the Government ever get around to appointing all of it, the commission will prove to be very wise; maybe. What I do know is that, given the time scale, it will have no time for consultation, no time for consideration, no time for reflection, and no time to weigh the implications of what it may decide. If there had been some weighing of the implications of the Scotland Bill, we might not have had the Scotland Bill and the right hon. Member for Hartlepool might not now be worried about the glue of the United Kingdom. What is clear is that the commission has no time. The timetable imposed by the Government makes it less of a royal commission, as I have always understood it, and more of a high-powered fig leaf, as the Prime Minister understands it.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para4">I hope that, when they have been appointed, the commissioners will examine their task and then say to the Government, "This is an important task, but if we are to perform it properly we must ask for more time. We are, after all, a royal commission and not a focus group, and we want to produce a report, which will be considered by Parliament in both Houses, of which we can be proud, not a report that has been too rushed."

<P>

<a name="90202-16_para5">I do not say that to make a short partisan point; I say it because the way in which Parliament works, in Lords and Commons, matters to us. Whatever changes may be made in the House of Lords will have an effect on the House of Commons. That is why, earlier, I sought the Minister's assurance that, if the Joint Committee of the Commons and the Lords disliked the royal commission's recommendations, the House of Commons would have an opportunity to decide on the Committee's views on a free vote, rather than a Whip imposed by a Government with a very large majority.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para6">Thus far, this reform has been sold to the country on a questionable prospectus. If we are to believe Cabinet Ministers, a phalanx of self-interested peers, Conservative to the bone--both men and women--appears whenever necessary to frustrate the people's Government. I speak as one who occasionally had a bit of his Government frustrated by those same peers. The concept that they are there, waiting to rush out of the hills and frustrate just this Government, simply does not stand up to examination. When they attacked my Government, it was to the cheers of Labour Members; when they attack their Government, the peers are very impertinent. How dare they raise the possibility that the Government might be wrong! What a dreadful proposition! Off with their heads! The Leader of the House is pleased to see them go at the first possible moment: she will be there at the guillotine, knitting to hand, as head after head disappears in the near future.

<a name="90202-16_para8">The Government, however, never miss any target if it can deliver an easy headline. It does not matter whether the target is the unpopular principle of hereditary peers, or the dotty ramblings of a football coach; if there is a mob mentality to disagree, this Government will put themselves at the head of that mentality in order to garner a headline or two.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para9">Now, who was the first to intervene?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-16_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hope: </B> 
 I have listened carefully to the right hon. Gentleman, and I understand that he and Opposition Front Benchers do not support the inclusion of hereditary peers in a reformed second Chamber. Can the right hon. Gentleman therefore explain why he and his Front Benchers seem to support the inclusion of hereditary peers in determining the composition of that second Chamber?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-16_spnew6"><B> Mr. Major: </B> 
 If the hon. Gentleman will let me proceed, he will learn many other things, as well as the answer to that point.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para10">Let me now make a substantive point. Although hereditary peers are to go, even Labour Members, in their quieter moments away from the Chamber, will admit that many of the hereditary peers--not all; they will not <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 769</B></P>
concede that--have had great virtues. They will admit that one of those virtues--I testify to it, for it was used against me often enough--is their independence, because of their hereditary nature, from the party Whips, when they choose to exercise it.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para11">How is such independence to be replicated? We have heard nothing of that from any Minister. How are the new peers to have the independence of Whips that the present Lords enjoy? The Government do not know the answer to that. How are the new peers to have the vocation of the hereditary peers? It was said earlier--and I can testify to this, too--that many of the life peers appointed were keen to go to the House of Lords, and were going to be there morning, noon and night; my goodness, they would turn up on Sundays. Where are they--not just those whom I appointed, but those appointed by many others, including the present Prime Minister? No sooner are their bottoms on the red leather Benches than they zip off somewhere else, and turn up only occasionally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-16_spnew9"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
 Did not Lord Archer miss the 1994 Conservative party conference, when storms were raging over the Anglia Television deal, because he was too busy as a working Conservative peer? He is a real busybody, that Lord Archer, is he not?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-16_spnew10"><B> Mr. Major: </B> 
 I can think of a substantial number of peers whose work rate in the House of Lords does not match that of my noble Friend Lord Archer.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para12">We are told that we should not worry about the mass axing of the peers because the Government have a mandate. Yes, they have; but as an argument of principle that is pretty pathetic. It is generally the last refuge of a Government who, although they have no credible case, can at least point to something that was in their manifesto. But I must tell them that they have no mandate to act without thinking about what they will do to our constitution and to the working of our Parliament. They have no mandate to tear down what works without telling the House of Commons what they will replace it with. They can tear it down, but, before they do so, they have an obligation to explain what comes in its place.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para13">Liberty needs protection from democracy. The Government are tearing apart, piece by piece, act by act, the most sophisticated constitution of them all, with little real understanding of the implications of what they are doing. That is why I think that it is a mean, inadequate little Bill. It is not because of the substantive point; it is because of what is not in the Bill but should be. The Bill utterly misses the chance of a proper reform of the Lords and, with it, reform that will have an implication for us in the House.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para14">What will the new Lords, as no doubt it will come to be known, be about? Will it be a deliberative Chamber? Will it be a revising Chamber? Will it be a check on over-mighty government? Or will it be a rubber stamp for <P>

party hacks, party funders and party apologists in the upper House? If it is, I might be inclined to join my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup(Sir E. Heath) and to contemplate a wholly elected House--<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Mackinlay) should not over-excite himself.
<P>

<a name="90202-16_para15">The ideal is a Commons that is democratic and decisive, and a Lords that is independent and reflective. Will it be so? A proper reform would make clear what the future of the Lords is to be. Will it retain the right to delay and to change legislation? If rights are lost, the ancient checks, balances and safeguards of our constitution will genuinely be at risk.

<a name="90202-17_spnew1"><B> Mr. Major: </B> 
 I will in a moment.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para0">We should define and, in some ways, increase the power of the Lords, because it can carry out work that will help the work of this Chamber and make it easier. It is and must remain the subordinate House, but it could do work that would make it easier for the House of Commons to carry out its functions properly. That would be a real reform.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para1">Why not, as a matter of routine--it cannot always be done, but the Leader of the House will know that it could often be done--as often as possible send draft legislation to the Lords for examination and for comment before it comes to the House of Commons? Why not let the Lords take public evidence on many contentious and technical issues, so that we may produce better drafted legislation?
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para2">Why not give the Lords a statutory obligation to take evidence on European legislation and on treaty commitments, so that the House of Commons may be better informed when it comes to consider those matters? Why not have a standing commission to consider our evolving constitution? At the moment, it evolves as a result of piecemeal actions by the House of Commons, by judges and in other ways. Why not let a standing commission consider how the constitution operates? Those reforms to the Lords would be worth while. They could be part of the Bill, but they are not.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para3">Let us be a bit more dramatic. Why not look at ministerial roles as well? Why not let Ministers vote in one House, but speak in both Houses? One practical advantage of that is that it could significantly reduce the number of Ministers, and I know from personal experience that that would be a thoroughly good thing. It would also save immeasurably on travel expenses.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para4">Why should not the Prime Minister--who, without consulting me, the then Leader of the Opposition, or, so far as I know, the Liberal Democrats or any other party, decided to present himself here once, rather than twice, a week--contemplate answering questions in the House of Lords occasionally as well? I say that not to be mischievous, but to suggest what we might do to make the work of the two Houses more cohesive, and to put the upper House in a better position to support the work of the primary House--the Commons. Let us look at those ideas.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para5">What we have before us is a little cameo of a Bill. It is vindictive in its intent and probably unthinking in its effect. That is hardly worthy of much of the hype that has surrounded it.

<P>

<a name="90202-17_spnew2"><B> Mr. Maclennan: </B> 
 Is not the argument that the right hon. Gentleman uses the sort of argument that was used against <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 771</B></P>
the removal of the rotten boroughs in 1832? Is he not condemning a good reform by admitting that it does not solve the entire problem? Surely we can vote to condemn the rotten boroughs and accept that the franchise should be widened further later.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-17_spnew3"><B> Mr. Major: </B> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong. The whole thrust of what I have been saying is that I do not object to the departure for legislative purposes of the hereditary peerage, but that, as part of the Bill, we should be enhancing the way in which both Houses of Parliament examine legislation and have control over the Executive. Fewer Ministers means more Back Benchers: that is another helpful thought on control over the Executive. Sadly, it is becoming all too evident that the whole Bill has been poorly considered. It has been poorly prepared. It is partisan. We do not know what will follow it and neither, worryingly, do the Government.

 I will not, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para6">Like other constitutional changes, the Bill diminishes Parliament in the Lords and, potentially, in the Commons. In many of the things that they are doing, the Government run the risk of bypassing the House of Commons as well.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para7">The Cabinet and Prime Minister, like all their predecessors, have some virtues and many faults. Among their failings, the one that concerns me most is not a single item of policy--they have won an election and they are entitled to put their policies into operation; they have the majority to do it--but, and I profoundly hope that I am wrong, their disregard, even contempt, for the views of anyone other than themselves. Even the House of Commons--Parliament itself--is for them too often apparently a rubber stamp and an irritating anachronism. Their reforms in the House of Commons are already in danger of turning it into a derelict, powerless and pointless place that is empty for half the week.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para8">That is one of the practical effects of moving Prime Minister's questions from Tuesday and Thursday to one single Question Time on Wednesday, and of the other reforms that the Leader of the House and the Government have brought forward. That may be convenient for this Government at this time, but it is not good for the House of Commons in the short or long term.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-17_spnew6"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-17_spnew7"><B> Mr. Major: </B> 
 No.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para9">If the Government are attacked, their habit is to attack the critics, not answer the criticism. They strangle alternative views even in their own party, as a number of their Back Benchers will testify. That is why reforming our constitution piecemeal without the whole scenario being subjected to proper democratic examination in this House and the next is so dangerous.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para10">On the Bill, the Government have listened to nothing thus far but their prejudices. Like the Scotland Act 1998, it may yet prove to be a shambles, with a constitutional price to be paid in future.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para11">The abolition of the peers on their own is no great point, but the Commons should remember that introducing such a measure without proper consideration <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 772</B></P>
and examination of all that it entails is but part of a pattern. It should remember that it is the master of the Government, not its servant, and should realise that diminishing the power of any part of Parliament in the way that the Bill does runs the risk of diminishing the power of every part of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para12">The question before us today is the abolition of the peers--very well; abolish them. However, the real issue behind the Government's overall constitutional change is the authority of Parliament itself over the Executive. On that issue, this House--both Opposition Members and Government Members--should think very carefully, to decide how far it will permit the Government to go before it asserts its own rights.

<P>
<a name="90202-17_spnew8"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths  (Edinburgh, South):</B> 
 I welcome the House of Lords Bill, which, at long last, will give this place the opportunity of transforming significantly the upper House. All previous attempts at reform have been the subject of guerrilla tactics by opponents of change, and by unlikely alliances, such as the ones mentioned by the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup(Sir E. Heath) that included Michael Foot and the late Enoch Powell.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para13">Achieving reform in two stages, in a relatively simple five-clause Bill, was a tactical masterstroke. It is no wonder the Opposition are calling for a more comprehensive Bill, as that would allow them and the unelected peers on whom they rely to frustrate the legislation and to bog down reform in ancient procedures, so that they may misuse the past to impede the future.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para14">It is a myth that the House of Lords is a reforming force; the opposite is true. At every milestone in democracy--the male franchise, votes for women, abolition of slavery, and even the Ballot Act 1872--the House of Lords has been a force of reaction.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para15">We know the impact of that reaction in my own city of Edinburgh. When the Lords opposed the Great Reform Act 1832, Edinburgh had a population of more than 100,000 men, women and children. Guess how many citizens were entitled to vote? It was not half the 100,000 population, not a quarter of it and not even one tenth; in 1832, only 33 citizens could vote in the whole of Edinburgh. The House of Lords whole heartedly endorsed that old, undemocratic and corrupt arrangement. The fact was that 100,000 citizens in Edinburgh were disfranchised, and that it was not the peers, but the people themselves who fought for greater democracy. That is why we take no lessons from the peers.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para16">Today, little has changed with regard to the majority of those in the Corridors of the other place. This year, 81 more peers gained entitlement to sit in Parliament, by right of birth, than hon. Members were elected to Parliament, in a general election involving 31 million voters. Today--70 years after all women gained the vote--there are still 62 peers who may sit in the other place but who do not even live in Britain. Those peers can legislate in the other place and affect the lives of millions of people.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para17">We are supporting the Bill on behalf of the descendants of Edinburgh citizens who never had the vote, not on behalf of the few descendants of a handful of people who were chosen centuries ago by the reigning monarch.<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 773</B></P>
In 1997, the people of Edinburgh voted for the party that pledged itself to modernise our country and our democracy.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para18">Reform of the House of Lords is long overdue. It is therefore fitting that our Labour Government are now, in this Bill, making such positive and practical proposals. By what right can hereditary peers veto reforms necessary to modernise our health service, to invest in our schools, colleges and universities and to give the jobless a new deal? We cannot allow an unrepresentative second Chamber to block progress.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para19">As the Bill deals with a matter of principle, I shall make no adverse comments on the quality of those who sit in another place. I question the legitimacy of peers' rights on the ground not of paternity, but of democracy. Some of those in the other place are descended from families that have rendered this country great service, including outstanding scientists, doctors, teachers, engineers and explorers, and great military figures and great humanitarians. However, they are all in the other place because of patronage--as my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) said earlier in the debate, in his expansive, amusing and highly thought-provoking style.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para20">The House should not, however, confuse some of the reminiscences and forceful views expressed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield with the facts. He was right to point out that, since monarchs effectively ceded their powers to Parliament, Prime Ministers have increasingly exercised patronage in appointments to the House of Lords. However, it is simply not true to say that that practice continues unabated. For the first time, we have a Prime Minister who is determined to reduce his powers of patronage in appointments to the other place. He wants to give his powers to an independent appointments commission, so that it may make non-political appointments to the second Chamber.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para21">My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield lamented that he was unable to cede similar powers when, as President of the Council of Ministers, he used the royal prerogative without any consultation with Parliament. It was an amusing debating point. Nevertheless, at the time my right hon. Friend did not feel sufficiently strongly to make an issue of the nature of those powers. His comments, 22 years later, make for interesting listening.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para22">The Bill is not the last word in reform. Some people see greater merit in a unicameral legislature that is strengthened by committees--which would operate constructively, like our Select Committees, rather than as the farce into which our Standing Committees too often descend. Such committees could scrutinise legislation far better than the House of Lords currently does.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para23">Some people advocate an elected second Chamber. The current problems in the American Congress and Senate demonstrate some of the pitfalls of such a system.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para24">The Bill will, at a stroke, remove the biggest single obstacle to change: hereditary peers. The Bill seeks only to accomplish that objective and will take us one more step along the historic path on which we embarked in May 1997. Modernisation of the House of Commons has started. We have legislated for elected bodies in Scotland and Wales and for elections in London. Now, we are dealing with modernisation of the House of Lords.
<P>

<a name="90202-17_para25">We are achieving a goal that has eluded Parliament for most of this century. If nothing more follows from the Bill--if it stands alone--we can be proud of giving our legislature a modern and fresh start for the new century.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-18_spnew0"><B> Mr. A. J. Beith  (Berwick-upon-Tweed):</B> 
 We support the Bill--which is hardly surprising, as we have been trying to get rid of the hereditary peers for 100 years. The Bill itself closely follows the Cook-Maclennan agreement, and is clearly only the first stage in a relatively speedy process of fundamental reform.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para0">At times, particularly yesterday, the debate on the Bill seemed like a rerun of the 1911 debate. Today, we have heard some new ideas, which have been quite interesting, especially when considering the source--former Prime Ministers--of some of them. Yesterday's debate was like the 1911 debate without the passion. We should remember that, in 1911, Asquith was denied a hearing by the Conservatives for about three quarters of an hour.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para1">Now, the argument is over. No one outside the diminished Conservative ranks, and not many within them, really believes that the hereditary principle is an acceptable way of choosing a legislature. However, I should say that, yesterday, the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) said that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the hereditary principle in itself is not something that we challenge."--[<i>Official Report</i>, 1 February 1999; Vol. 324, c. 620.]
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-18_para2">
The statement is there on the record, although I think that it rather slipped out.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para3">
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para4">The usual Conservative approach to the issue is not to defend the hereditary system but to temporise, to delay and to offer seductive arguments, to the effect that any partial change is unacceptable, because it must all be done at one go. Of course they hope that, with luck, that will never happen, because they have a majority in the current Lords to frustrate change. There would therefore never be a satisfactory scheme, so nothing would ever change.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para5">The Conservatives had 18 years in power, during which they could have reformed the system in their own way. They never lifted a finger to do so. There was a hint that they might do so, only once or twice, when Mrs. Thatcher suffered the occasional severe rebuff in the other place. Perhaps she woke up one morning and said, "Let's just abolish them"; but nothing ever happened. <i>[Interruption.]</i> That is what she used to do. When bits of the constitution annoyed her, such as the Greater London council, she was not against sweeping them away entirely. However, something stopped her doing so when it came to dealing with the Lords. [Hon. Members: "Perhaps she needed somewhere to go."] Indeed. Perhaps she had a place lined up for herself.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para6">When another Government try to do something about it, every argument and delay is deployed. We have been discussing the issue for some time now. One historian records that, in the 1910 constitutional conference, the Conservatives
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"dangled all kinds of fantastic bargains before the indifferent noses of Asquith and Lloyd George"--

<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 775</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-18_para9">Then it occurred to me that there is a crucial difference between 1999 and 1911. In the 1911 debates, the Conservative peers and their relations wanted to die in the ditch for hereditary peerages. Ironically,Lord Cranborne's kinsman, Lord Hugh Cecil, led the jeers that drowned out Asquith. Now, however, the peers are offering compromise and the Conservative Leader and a few of his hon. Friends are enthusiastic about fighting in the last ditch.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para10">It is said that in 1911, when the Conservative Lord Lansdowne heard Lord Halsbury speak against the Bill, he
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"knew, as one sentence followed another, that he could no longer vouch for the sanity of his followers".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-18_para11">
Lord Cranborne must have felt rather similarly about the Leader of the Opposition during the fateful meeting at which he was told that he should never have offered the well-known compromise for the interim House.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para12">Several hereditary peers live in my constituency, which has quite a long feudal tradition. They really are a decent bunch. They are all landowners, and one is a very large landowner. In various ways, they make a valuable contribution to the life of the community. I have not noticed any of them pressing to prolong a system which adds a seat in the legislature to their inheritance. I do not think that any of them, particularly the new generation, see it as their role in life. If they did, they would probably prefer to seek democratic legitimacy by standing for election. The battle to keep the House of Lords as our second Chamber is now being fought not by hereditary peers, but by those within in the Conservative party who look back with nostalgia to a society long gone. It is the battle of the young fogeys.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para13">Let us not forget that the Bill creates only an interim House, whose days are necessarily numbered, and that will create future problems for the Government. When the commission and the Committee of both Houses have done their work and we are ready to put in place a new and more democratic second Chamber, 500 life peers will lose their entitlement to be legislators until their dying day and their right to the facilities and opportunities afforded by membership. Life peers have a higher average age, and are the most extensive users of the splendid facilities of the House. I fear that the Government may have a harder time convincing some of their well-established life peers, particularly those who have gone there after long service, of the merits of phase 2. Yet phase 2 is integral to the reform and we welcome the Government's commitment to it.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para14">Before I turn briefly to the phase 2 second Chamber, I have a couple of secondary questions that arise from the Bill. Are peerages as an honour to become obsolete, or will titles be granted in future? If so, will it be on a life or hereditary basis? Mrs. Thatcher had a rather strange habit of awarding hereditary peerages to people who had no male heirs. The last remnants of the creation of hereditary peerage were in her time and on that basis. Will peerages continue to be awarded as honours; and on what basis? I do not think that anyone has made a decision on that.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-18_spnew1"><B> Mr. Linton </B> 
: Although the Bill says clearly that hereditary peers should lose only their right to sit and vote in the House of Lords and that it should not affect their status in any other way, once hereditary peers have lost their powers and privileges would it not be open to the <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 776</B></P>
Government or anyone else to refer to them by their names rather than their titles, in the same way as any other citizen?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-18_spnew2"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
 Some of them prefer it. If, for the sake of argument, I am allowed to breach the rules of the House, the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) prefers to be called Mr. Michael Ancram, although that is not, in terms of the peerage, his real name. No doubt others will follow suit, but that is not what we are discussing.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para15">We are trying to create an effective second Chamber and the Bill raises the question whether hereditary peers should be created in future. I certainly hope not, as honours should be awarded for what people do in their lifetime and not be conferred on successive generations. That also goes for the quaint practice of calling the children of life peers "honourable"--a perversity that dates from the 1960s.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para16">Consideration is being given to ways in which other denominations and major religious groups could complement the Church of England bishops in the interim House. I believe that the Church of Scotland and the English free Churches welcome the idea, but it requires a different approach because, emphatically and as a matter of belief, there is no equivalent to bishops in their systems. Leadership is exercised by ministers and lay people in a variety of offices. Some are annual offices rather than long-term positions. Episcopacy and a priestly caste are alien to their traditions. The Government should bear that in mind in considering the make-up of the interim House.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para17">The Government will also have to give some thought to the issue of Scottish representation in the interim House, bearing in mind that it was specifically provided for in the Treaty of Union and in subsequent legislation, including the Peerage Act 1963, which greatly widened Scottish representation in the second Chamber.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para18">I would assert two principles in respect of the phase 2 second Chamber. First, we wish to see a predominantly elected House. We see room for a procedure to allow some nominated Members so as to ensure the continued membership of people from walks of life that preclude involvement in party politics; but it needs to be a democratic Chamber.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para19">Secondly, its role should complement the role of the House of Commons: it should neither rival it nor replicate it. Its delaying capacity should effectively be limited and not be subjected to bypassing by the extended ping-pong that was illustrated by the European Parliamentary Elections Bill. The second Chamber should be able to force the House to think again, and not merely as a formality; but the wholly elected House, once it has fair elections, must prevail.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para20">As my right hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) suggested yesterday, the second Chamber should do things that the House cannot readily do or does not do very well. It could review certain public appointments, and fill more of the gap in the scrutiny of delegated legislation. It should have a role in representing the specific concerns of the nations and regions of the United Kingdom and their Parliaments and assemblies.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para21">On the other hand, the other place probably does not need to do some of the things that it does now. It is not necessarily logical to repeat ministerial statements in the <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 777</B></P>
second Chamber. However, I was quite attracted by the suggestion of the former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), that from time to time the Prime Minister might answer questions in the second Chamber and that Ministers from this House should be able to take their legislation through a reformed second Chamber, replacing the requirement for Ministers to be appointed in another place.
<P>

<a name="90202-18_para22">The issues will be considered in the commission and in the Joint Committee. If we were not committed to a speedy process, I would be anxious about the Bill progressing in its present form because it leaves the second Chamber in an unsatisfactory temporary state. However, even in those circumstances I would still, with a heavy heart, want my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote for the Bill because, at long last, it ends a totally indefensible feature of our constitution which has defied numerous previous attempts at reform. So let us get on with it.

 I am delighted that you should have made that error, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as it has never been made before.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para0">I begin by saying what a privilege and joy it is--it fills me with humility to speak in the same debate as the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath). Until he spoke, I had intended to begin by saying that I had never participated in a debate that had revealed so starkly the intellectual and political poverty of the Opposition. By that, of course I mean the present Opposition.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para1">This is a fine Bill. It is an historic and seminal Bill, which deserves--and will almost certainly receive--wholehearted support. However, I have one fundamental reservation about it. Its only substantive clause--clause 1--extends to 17 words. As my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House said, it is beautifully simple. However, beauty and simplicity can be improved on. My reservation about the Bill is that it is far too long. The single important clause reads:
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No-one shall be a member of the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-19_para2">

<a name="90202-19_para3">
If that is felt to be too succinct, I would be prepared to widen it so that it read:

<a name="90202-19_para4">Hon. Members will understand that I wish to come out and reveal myself to be an unashamed, intractable, practising unicameralist. I suspect that when the second Great Reform Bill comes to be debated--the important Bill--the Government will discover that many others will come out and reveal themselves to be intractable and practising unicameralists.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para5">In a modern elective democracy based on constituency Members of Parliament of integrity and reasonable ability, there is no purpose in having a second Chamber, be it <P>

elected, partly elected, appointed, partly appointed, anointed, semi-anointed or even driven in haphazard groups from the street to form the people's second House.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para6">As we enter the transitional phase that we are debating, I bleed for my Government and the difficulties that lie in store. The likely constitution of the new, interim, transitional House of Lords is a glorious mess, relying partly on patronage, partly on old patronage, partly on a new appointments commission of doubtful legitimacy and partly on a rump of self-selected peers--presumably those with nowhere better to go. Reform thereafter will be even more difficult, relying on a hitherto unappointed royal commission which will have to struggle with the myriad ways in which a second Chamber may be cobbled together and the associated powers that it may be allowed.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para7">Anyone who has made any study, however ephemeral, of royal commissions and their habits will see immediately that the terms of reference are mischievous and far too wide. There are only two. The first is to consider and make recommendations on the role and functions of a second Chamber. The second is to make recommendations on the method, or combination of methods, of composition required to constitute a second Chamber.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para8">We, the elected representatives of the people, are setting up a small royal commission composed of the great and the good. I have no faith in the great and the good in this country. This country's economic decline over the past 50 years can be laid entirely at the door of the great and the good. I say that with due deference to several hon. Members. The one thing that has not impeded this country's progress in the past half a century has been this Chamber and the Palace of Westminster. Yet we in this Chamber are deferring to a small and unelected commission of the great and the good. In their terms of reference, we are asking them to tell us what we want and saying that we do not know how the second Chamber will be elected or what it is going to do--we want their recommendations.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para9">I have little confidence in terms of reference that are so wide, because the ambit of the report will be so great that it will be too easy for any committee to refuse its recommendations. To reform this House and the Palace of Westminster, we do not require the expense of the members of a royal commission; we require a gang of bricklayers. They should be told as a matter of urgency to wall up the entrance on the other side of the Central Lobby. After they have applied themselves to the necessary amount of Pugin wallpaper, the job can be completed in a week. The same firm could then be employed to turn what used to be the second Chamber into a reclusive home for the elderly and infirm, no doubt looked after by supernurses.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para10">When that is done, we shall at long last be left to our own devices in this House. In particular, we shall be freed from the most pernicious aspect of the second Chamber--the power of patronage. We have no concern about dealing with the hereditary principle. It is an intellectual deficit on the part of the Conservatives that some of them continue to argue, at least by implication, for its retention. Patronage is the great evil that we must fight. The difficulty with the transitional provisions and any provisions that may follow is that at least some members of the second Chamber will be appointed by patronage, which will lie in the hands of the Prime Minister.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 779</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-19_para11">Here we have a double nepotism. Not only will some people be elevated to the upper House by the patronage of the Prime Minister; thereafter they may be elevated into government by the same patronage. That is an intolerable system which is long overdue for reform. I ask my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House to address the issue, because the transitional provisions will do nothing to stop that double nepotism.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para12">The absent Leader of the Opposition is struggling to climb a mountain to get back to electoral respectability. Some of the few blows that he succeeds in landing in the House are his points about nepotism and patronage. The continual allegations about Tony's cronies are some of the few that cause Labour Members some consternation and periods of silence, as Conservative Members will have observed.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para13">The Leader of the Opposition has a point that he may probe. However, the great problem is whether he will promise that he would not employ such patronage. As Prime Minister, if there were an upper House with nominated members, would he turn his face against such patronage and refuse to appoint to the Government those who were not elected? If he said that, I suggest that he would earn public respect--the lack of which, hitherto, has been part of his problem.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para14">I am one of the few unicameralists to have absolutely and genuinely come out--probably the only one--and spoken in the debate. I listened with great respect to the speech of the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Wells); it was rather less than totally full-blooded in its commitment to unicameralism. If I am wrong, I shall retract my statement immediately. One or two of us may come out in the debate, and I suspect that many more will come out in due course.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para15">It distresses me when I hear colleagues on both sides of the House deliver apologias for the continued existence of a second Chamber by saying that we need it as a check on an over-mighty Executive. We are the check on the Executive in this Chamber, and we need no help or sustenance from anybody else.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-19_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bowen Wells  (Hertford and Stortford):</B> 
 I am sorry that the hon. and learned Gentleman thought that my adherence to unicameralism was not as full-hearted as his clearly is. The difference between us is simply that I do not believe--as I said yesterday--that any proposal that comes from the Committee, which he so accurately described, meaning that power is transferred from this Chamber to whatever ersatz assembly we establish, either temporarily or permanently, will be agreed by this elected House of Commons: and that is quite right. Unicameralism is therefore the only solution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-19_spnew2"><B> Mr. Marshall-Andrews: </B> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. The chances of this House passing, or the Committee recommending, a unicameralist solution to the problem is small indeed. That is one of the reasons I have not tabled an amendment to the Bill--because I am not given to exercises in futility.
<P>

<a name="90202-19_para16">On the other hand, that does not stop me saying that there is manifestly only one answer to the problems with which we are grappling. What distresses me when I hear Members producing apologias for the existence of the second Chamber is that they are, in fact, providing an alibi for our own inadequacies. That concerns me more than anything else. Let us have done with it, once and for all.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 780</B></P>

<a name="90202-19_para17">When we no longer have that alibi, hon. Members who, at this stage, are content--because the second Chamber exists--to adhere to the Whip in circumstances where they do not agree and where they may wish to be a check on the Executive may, in due course, change. In addition, we will need to review the Select Committee and other Committee procedures to provide the wherewithal for this House, and this House alone, to provide the check on the Executive--which is, in reality, the substance of the debate.

 It is always interesting to hear a political party that has discovered Thomas Paine two centuries after his advent. From the House of Lords to here, the repetition of the notion, that there is nothing so absurd as the principle that the Poet Laureate should be hereditary, manifestly demonstrates the absurdity of the hereditary principle.

 Why?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-20_spnew1"><B> Mr. Shepherd: </B> 
 Because--I say to the hon. Gentleman, who spoke dismally for most of his speech--it does not follow that one has a talent that is inherited.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para0">Many of us on both sides of the House have never thought that the hereditary principle should inform our constitutional arrangements in the latter part of the 20th century, and in a long-established democratic nation. The Government's attack on the upper House has been focused on the question of legitimacy. That is why I will profoundly disagree later in my speech with the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) about a unicameral system of government.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para1">The Government, rightly, have challenged legitimacy. Why should it be that, because I am the inheritor of my father's name, I should be a legislator in a democracy? However, that question can be asked of an appointee. We did away with the aldermanic principle in local government. Why should one be a legislator by appointment? That is profoundly anti-democratic in itself.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para2">What underlies the concern of my right hon. and hon. Friends is the true incoherence with which the Government--with neither history nor an understanding of where we have come from--tackle important constitutional change. The right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) thinks that, after he has done his constitutional mis-works, the United Kingdom may require glue which the House of Lords may provide in an--unstated--reformed state. Many of us do not like taking a step in the dark, for the very reasons that have been adduced by the Government. One stage may not lead to another, and an unknown second step may be perilous to us.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para3">The right hon. Member for Hartlepool, in a twist of fortune, may appreciate that he also made a step in the dark that led him astray. However, he still talks as if he were running Government Front Benchers and trying to hold them on-message. The act of hubris in his speech was bemusing to someone who has served as a Back-Bench Member for 20 years.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para4">The American revolution was not founded in an abyss. Thomas Paine's great language--which fired that part of a discovered continent, and helped inform the French revolution--was a declaration of principles. When the <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 781</B></P>
revolution was successful, those principles were filled in by the building of a constitution. The American constitution--which was spoken of disparagingly by some--has stood the test of two centuries. It has protected and enhanced the freedoms and liberties of the American people, and it has protected them against revolution.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para5">The British constitution has done likewise. For three centuries, the British constitution has provided a focus, and it came about because of the impetus from here--this House of Commons. When the Government talk about the primacy of the House of Commons, I have an historic and instinctive sympathy for the argument. However, that primacy has long since gone in the 20 years that I have been here.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para6">Is this an independent Chamber? No, of course not. It is the creature of the person who leads the party with a majority. This is not a partisan point. The frustration of Labour Members who served in previous Parliaments was palpable in terms of what they thought were unpalatable and over-reaching acts. There is no defence for the people of this country against a parliamentary majority, and that is the danger that has informed our constitution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-20_spnew2"><B> Mr. Sheldon: </B> 
 Government Back Benchers were always the safeguard. If the Government do not have an overwhelming majority--such as there is now--sufficient Government Back Benchers can bring about change.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-20_spnew3"><B> Mr. Shepherd: </B> 
 The right hon. Gentleman will know that that is my sentiment and that I have tried to honour that principle, as have others in this House. However, in the age of patronage and promotion, one sees press reports that state that the only value of a Member of Parliament is if he or she is a rising star. It is assumed that the only purpose of being a Member of Parliament is to influence or to become a member of the Administration; hence some of the frustration of those in opposition.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para7">I hold the setting aside of the disciplines of party to be the ideal; those disciplines have killed with patronage this Chamber's effectiveness in safeguarding the liberties of our citizens. The Law Lords recognise that fact and judicial review has become an important method of trying to protect the citizen. We have invoked the European Court of Human Rights as part of our domestic law, because of our own failures; time and time again, the argument could be won, but the vote was lost.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para8">We no longer protect freedoms and liberties. It used to be a central argument of constitutional reform or the building of constitutions that one has checks and balances, back and forth. Montesquieu analysed the English constitution. We should use the phrase "English constitution" more, because the glory of this island flowered from an English constitutional settlement over many centuries. The island was incorporated, but the House no longer represents its elements. I have seen Conservative Governments, with no majority in Scotland, voting against the intent of Scottish Members and not even listening to their own Back Benchers on Scottish law reform. When that happened, we were no longer representative.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para9">The Prime Minister controls the House, which is effectively his poodle. The outside world recognises that. That is why we have fallen in the world's esteem. <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 782</B></P>
That has happened not because Ministers take Concorde, but because we no longer act as a proper brake or check on the ambitions of the Executive. Whenever one says anything about Government policy, it becomes manifest that the whole mechanism is geared to defend it even when it is unsustainable.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para10">As an instance, I take the emergency terrorism provisions for which the House was summoned in the summer. The Irish Supreme Court has said that the legislation is inoperable and the Royal Ulster Constabulary has said that it cannot be used. More consultations are being held and it is very inconvenient. The legislation became imperial management of a presidential nature.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-20_spnew4"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
 Pre-Mrs. Thatcher, it was not always so. For example, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) is right: Harold Wilson could not accede to the pressing request of the President of the United States, Lyndon Johnson, to send what he called "a battalion of bagpipers" to Vietnam, because Michael Foot, Jack Mendelson and many others prevented him from doing so. When there was a normal majority--a thin one--in 1978-79, devolution was a rather different story.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-20_spnew5"><B> Mr. Marshall-Andrews: </B> 
 I am not too keen on the thin majority point.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para11">I agree with a great deal of what the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) says, including about the terrorism provisions. Does he agree that, if one wants to inject some backbone into Government, and possibly Opposition, Back Benchers, so that they can indulge in the luxury of independent or dangerous thought, the existence of a second Chamber is precisely the way of inhibiting that, because that so-called countervailing force or check is in reality no check at all and merely gives the Government yet another way of controlling their Back Benchers?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-20_spnew6"><B> Mr. Shepherd: </B> 
 I started by saying that the Government attacked the House of Lords by questioning its legitimacy. Clearly, if part of the legislature has no legitimacy, it ceases to be a proper check; it has no authority. Every time the second Chamber does something of which the Government disapprove, the charge is made that it is not legitimate.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para12">We have an opportunity to reform the second Chamber and make it a representative body. It is unthinkable to me that, in a democracy, those who legislate do not stand accountable to the electorate--the people of this island--in determining whether a law is valid. I listened with the greatest respect to my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath). It is funny how, as one grows older, the spirit grows younger. I understand from some of his colleagues when he was Prime Minister that the world was not entirely as he may have suggested, but he rightly described how we were beginning to see the prospect of this country having checks and balances, and a constitution in balance. Labour's reforms have shown us how uniquely vulnerable we are to huge upheaval, whereby we end up with the master of spin, now out of the Government, saying that maybe we need glue.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para13">I am deeply concerned, as many hon. Members have been. I believe that the second Chamber should be elected and that its powers should be enhanced to provide the <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 783</B></P>
necessary checks and balances. The former Attorney-General, no less, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), said that election to the House of Lords should be staged, and I agree. I believe that the Government should have to fight for their business. I have been concerned by the growing assertion by Prime Ministers and acceptance by Back Benchers that Governments have a right to their business. It is for Parliament to adjudicate on whether the business proposed by the Government has sufficient merit, but the process is no longer seen in those terms.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para14">Considering the great opportunity presented by the Bill, even in the absence of a thought from the Government, the very conditions laid down in the White Paper are grotesquely inappropriate. The primacy of the House once lay in the fact that we were more representative and that we could exercise power as it ebbed away from the landowners. Our people had to pay the money that made Government work. There was a real purpose to us.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para15">Now, as we increasingly become baying party hacks, on-message, with bleepers, trying to juggle the minds and imaginations of a free people, we are merely prattling along; we are an empty Chamber, echoing to who knows what. This nation's vitality was in discourse. There is much talk about what can happen if we sit in semicircles or horseshoes and connect--I use language familiar to the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West(Dr. Starkey)--and find a new, purposeful way forward. All we want is a settlement and a coherent constitutional reform.
<P>

<a name="90202-20_para16">The Government specifically charge that we are not interested in constitutional reform; but I am, and I know that many of my colleagues are. I am slightly ashamed that, almost two years into a Labour Government, with the clear objective of a half-baked, half-stage reform--

 Excuse me.
<P>

<a name="90202-21_para0">Many of us have a genuine concern that reform could be frozen at the point that we have reached; then we will have a House of total patronage. I took encouragement from my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup when he commented on the qualities of some of the appointees. There is nothing distinguished about some of them, although, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) suddenly recalled, there were merits in some of his appointees, and they attended debates.
<P>

<a name="90202-21_para1">The Labour Government know full well that half their glitterati, who have never contributed anything to public debate in terms of the details of legislation, do not turn up. What is their purpose? It is a blatant exercise in what most excites a sinking nation at the end of the 20th century: patronage. People want to be a lord, a knight, a something.

has to report by the end of this year and it is already2 February. The Bill will go through and my party has no identified, coherent, alternative strategy for the building of a constitution. We have to have one, and quickly. It is not as if we have not had time to reflect on the matter. This is, alas, no longer the age of pamphlets, but the arguments have been laid out. How do we ensure checks and balances? How do we rein in the Executive?
<P>

<a name="90202-21_para3">I agree that individuals can make a difference, but only for the lifetime of their stay in this House. We must broaden the inclusion of elected representatives. It is banal and absurd to suggest that people from the Clapham omnibus should be sent to the House of Lords--a title that must be replaced by, perhaps, the senate or the second Chamber--at random, as if in some revival of Athenian democracy. We might as well make it a lottery prize and say to people, "Well, you didn't win &#163;8 million, but you are now a Member of the House of Lords." That sums up the crassness of this Government's approach to deep matters which involve the protection of our liberty and freedoms. We must be a body that expresses and, therefore, represents. Most of us are not.

<a name="90202-21_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith  (Basildon):</B> 
 I have spent many happy hours yesterday and today listening to the debate on the Bill, and I have been surprised that so little of it has focused on what the Bill is about. That arises from the confusion among the Opposition about whether they are for or against the Bill. In 1997, the Conservative party handbook for the general election made its position clear by stating that it was important to defend the hereditary principle on its own merits, but only one Conservative Member has had the courage to do so. I wonder what else the handbook contained that Conservatives would no longer defend.
<P>

<a name="90202-21_para4">The Conservatives have missed the point of the debate. Whatever follows--and we all have a great interest in that--it is right that we get rid of the voting rights of hereditary peers, because they are wrong in principle. Only those who undervalue the role of legislators, and the scrutiny of the work of the Government and the House could argue that accident of birth is qualification enough for a seat in the second Chamber. For some, the issue is that there is an inbuilt Tory majority through the hereditary peers. As wrong as that is, the arguments for reform are valid whether the inbuilt majority is Tory or Labour.
<P>

<a name="90202-21_para5">It is a great shame that, with a golden opportunity before us to reform the constitution and modernise this place, we have to drag the Opposition kicking and screaming into the 21st century. However, perhaps we should not be surprised. On more than one occasion in the past, we have had to drag the Conservative party forward, kicking and screaming. I hesitate to go back as far as the repeal of the corn laws in case a Conservative Member contradicts me and says that they should not have been repealed, but every stage met with opposition from the Conservatives then. Even when Attlee marginally reduced the powers of the House of Lords in 1947, he was heckled by Churchill, then a Conservative, who described the Government's action--overplaying his hand somewhat--as an "act of socialist aggression".
<P>

<a name="90202-21_para6">Perhaps even sadder was the House's response to the early attempts to gain votes for women. At the beginning of this century, Members of Parliament used <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 785</B></P>
parliamentary tactics and every single trick in the book to prevent women from getting the vote. Few people would now oppose the women's suffrage Bill of 1904, but it failed. It was second on the Order Paper to a non-controversial private Member's Bill, which proposed that carts travelling on public roads at night should carry a light behind as well as a light in front. Few Members disagreed with the Bill, but it was debated for hour upon hour to frustrate change and modernisation of the constitution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-21_spnew3"><B> Mr. Tyrie: </B> 
 Is the hon. Lady aware that the extension of the franchise to women was accomplished in two stages, with the first stage introduced by a coalition Government including the Conservatives and the second--the reduction of the voting age from 30 to 21--by a Conservative Government?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-21_spnew4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 I am aware of that, but the reform could have been achieved much earlier had Conservative Governments supported it. Contemporary accounts mention silly stories and foolish jokes being told during the debate, while other Members joined in the laughter. Such behaviour, then as now, does nothing to raise this House in the public's esteem. Members probably felt safer ridiculing such measures in those days because there were no cameras in the House to record their antics. That is another progressive measure that was opposed by Conservatives.
<P>

<a name="90202-21_para7">A former Member of the House, Charles Bradlaugh, was unable to take his seat until he had the right to affirm the oath. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) mentioned yesterday that he was here because the law was changed to remove his hereditary title. There was opposition to the reduction of the voting age from 21 to 18. I raise those examples to show that the modernisation of Parliament has always been slow, tortuous and difficult.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-21_spnew5"><B> Mr. John Hayes  (South Holland and The Deepings):</B> 
 My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) corrected the hon. Lady on her point about suffrage, and I wish to remind her that virtually every reform of the 19th century was opposed by the Liberal party and pioneered by the Conservative party. I think specifically of prison reform, slum clearance, Disraeli's reform Acts and a range of social and economic legislation. The hon. Lady should take a more thorough look at history before she makes such claims.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-21_spnew6"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 I make no claims for the Liberals, but I was talking about constitutional reform. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's correction, as he puts it, because history shows that Conservatives took a long time to accept reform. Many Opposition Members have already accepted that the hereditary principle is wrong, having supported it at the time of the last election. Reforms such as working class men getting the vote, women getting the vote and secret ballots all had to be fought for, but nobody today would argue that we should go back and that those reforms were not essential. It is incredible today to think that anybody argued against those measures, and people in the future will be incredulous that Members of the House of Commons were prepared to support the right of hereditary peers to take part in our legislature.

<a name="90202-21_para8">Those of us who passionately believe in the reform of the second Chamber have waited a long time for the Bill. I must correct some of the comments made by Opposition Members. We are not seeking an easy life. There is a role for a second Chamber in a modern democracy, but to be effective it must have legitimacy. There is no legitimacy in using an accident of birth to claim privilege. The current qualifications for membership of the upper House bring into question the authority and integrity of our entire parliamentary system. Last week, Lord Strathclyde said that their lordships have sought answers from Governments on
<P>

 Does the hon. Lady agree that when the reform set out in the Bill has been achieved, and the hereditary peers have been removed, the life peers who remain will be in no better position to claim that legitimacy?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-21_spnew8"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 That point has been dealt with many times. The life peers in the transitional House will be there on their own merit, not on the merit of people from centuries ago.
<P>

<a name="90202-21_para11">The Labour party has always had a somewhat uneasy relationship with the House of Lords. Many distinguished parliamentarians from the House of Commons have refused to take a seat in the Lords because of its undemocratic composition. In his autobiography, Fenner Brockway--whom many Labour Members recall with great affection--recalled his dilemma at being offered a seat in the House of Lords. He wondered whether it would compromise his principles: indeed, he seemed far more delighted that the local council named a block of flats after him than he was with his new title. He used to delight people with the story of how a friend wrote to him and addressed the envelope to The Lord Brockway, without adding the number of the house. The letter was returned with the words "No public house of that name in this street" written across the envelope.
<P>

<a name="90202-21_para12">Yet if Fenner Brockway had not taken his seat in the House of Lords, we would have been deprived of the political contribution of an honest, radical, courageous and decent man. I make that point to emphasise that this Bill is essential, not because of any individual Members of the House of Lords, but because the debate is about the legitimacy of the upper Chamber.

 The hon. Lady has given us a potted history of how the people have had to fight to increase democracy in this country.

Would she support increasing the powers of a legitimate second Chamber to check the Executive?

<P>

<a name="90202-22_spnew1"><B> Angela Smith: </B>

<P>
<a name="90202-22_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael Fallon  (Sevenoaks):</B> 
 Every so often in each Parliament a Bill comes along that tells us more about its promoters than about its provisions. This is just such a Bill.
<P>

<a name="90202-22_para2">The Bill is sinister and deeply flawed. What the Government propose has to be stated again and again so that people may fully appreciate the constitutional monstrosity involved. The Government are expelling 60 per cent. of one House of Parliament without indicating how that portion is to be replaced: in other words, 40 per cent. of Members of Parliament as a whole--it is worth reminding ourselves that peers are Members of Parliament--are to be expelled.
<P>

<a name="90202-22_para3">We have been given neither a clear idea of how those Members of Parliament will be replaced nor any binding commitment to come up with a specific plan for their replacement. At the very least, the expulsions should be stayed until the royal commission report--or the Joint Committee deliberations or the colour of the Government's proposals--clarify what will stand in their place.
<P>

<a name="90202-22_para4">The composition of the House of Lords cannot be considered until there is agreement about what that House's functions and powers should be. That is as self-evident today as it was to those of us who wrestled with the issue in the committee appointed by the thenMrs. Thatcher, and chaired by the late Lord Home, more than 21 years ago.
<P>

<a name="90202-22_para5">By introducing stage 1 without giving any indication about stage 2, the Government defy their own instruction to the royal commission. As Lady Jay made clear, the terms of reference ask the royal commission
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to consider the role and functions of the second chamber as a preliminary to considering its composition."--[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 20 January 1999; Vol. 596, c. 585.]
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-22_para6">
Those are the instructions to the royal commission, but the Bill defies them. We are asked to embrace stage 1, not as a subsequent or complementary task, but as a preliminary. Tonight, we set in train the process of expelling 60 per cent. of the Members of one House of Parliament, without a single firm proposal on how those Members will be replaced, or any agreement on the functions that a new and newly reformed House will perform. We are asked to begin that process on the basis of a deeply flawed Bill.
<P>

<a name="90202-22_para7">The Bill has three major flaws, and one minor flaw.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-22_spnew3"><B> Mr. Linton: </B> 
 The hon. Gentleman said that what he calls the expulsion of the hereditary peers should be stayed at the very least. Does he or does he not support the retention of hereditary peers in the long term?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-22_spnew4"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
 No. Once we have agreement on the functions and powers of a second Chamber, there can be <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 788</B></P>
no case for retention of the hereditary principle or of the existing hereditary Members. If the hon. Gentleman reads the 1978 report of the Conservative review committee, he will see that position clearly set out.
<P>

<a name="90202-22_para8">The first major flaw in the Bill is that it contains no commitment to introduce stage 2. There is no such commitment in the preamble, let alone in the text of the clauses. In the Parliament Act 1911, the preamble at least stated that, eventually, there would be an elected or modernised second Chamber. It is true that stage 2 of that process was delayed, but the commitment to that stage was always present in the 1911 Act. It remained as a constant reminder, like a knot in a handkerchief, and I urge Ministers to accept an amendment to make it clear that they are committed to introducing stage 2 in this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="90202-22_para9">What the Minister of State said this afternoon worried me further. He said that the Government would simply be looking at proposals emerging from the royal commission, and at proposals that the Joint Committee had scrutinised. I hope that when the Parliamentary Secretary winds up the debate, he will reaffirm the Government's intention to proceed with stage 2 in this Parliament. That would give us some compensation at least for the expulsion that the Bill sets in train tonight. Otherwise, we will be left--as we were after 1911--with stage 1 on its own. There will be a hostage House up the Corridor, kept on permanent tenterhooks at the bidding of the Government, with no commitment to its replacement by stage 2.
<P>

<a name="90202-22_para10">The second flaw in the Government's proposals for the temporary House is that there is no limit on that House's membership. It is true that there is no limit on the membership of the present House of Lords, but that has long been acknowledged as one of its weaknesses. The problem is less important because only 40 per cent. of that House is nominated. In the new, interim House established by the Bill, almost all Members will be nominated. It is therefore vital, as a constitutional safeguard, to have an upper limit on the patronage that the Prime Minister, through the appointments commission, will so freely dispense.
<P>

<a name="90202-22_para11">We have not been told very much about the appointments commission. Who appoints it? Cronies, as Conservative Members have learnt, can appoint cronies--that is the essence of cronyism. The Bill should contain a constitutional safeguard against the Government flooding the interim, temporary House with cronies when they need to overcome a difficulty in getting legislation through.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-22_spnew5"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-22_spnew6"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
 No, not at the moment.
<P>

<a name="90202-22_para12">That limit could take a number of forms. It could be a numerical ceiling on the size of the upper House. Equally, it could be a limit on the number of new creations that can be made in any one year.
<P>

<a name="90202-22_para13">The limit on the size of the temporary House is needed because of the third and most serious flaw--the failure to exclude the Bill from the operation of the Parliament Acts. The draftsmen of 1911 did not exclude the 1911 Act, which was assumed to be a piece of temporary legislation. There is no need to repeat that mistake now. The principle should be obvious: the new temporary House should have to consent to the reform of its own composition, just as we are required to consent to stage 2 and future <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 789</B></P>
modernisation--otherwise, we shall have no check at all on the next stage of constitutional reform, which could be whipped through the House of Commons, then through the temporary House.
<P>

<a name="90202-22_para14">If the Government accept some check under the Parliament Acts for the lifetime of a Parliament, it automatically follows that, having reformed the other chamber, they should accept a similar check on the composition of Parliament. If they are not prepared to accept that in the Bill, they have precious little faith in the composition of the temporary House that we are asked to license.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-22_spnew7"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
 It seems odd to criticise the temporary House because it is open to cronyism and will consist entirely of appointed members while simultaneously insisting that its assent is essential to any reform that would make it better.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-22_spnew8"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
 The missing link is another flaw--the lack of a ceiling on the number of Members. Once that is put in place, there will at least be one check on the extent to which the temporary House could be flooded with additional creations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-22_spnew9"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman feel no sense of shame when he talks about the Government flooding the House of Lords? The Government of whom he was a member were prepared to bus in 450 hereditary peers to enforce their will on the Maastricht treaty. When the Conservatives were in government, they could temporarily influence the composition of the other place whenever they wanted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-22_spnew10"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
 If the hon. Gentleman had studied the history of the upper House during the Conservative years, he might have been interested to note that the Parliament Acts procedure has been used only against a Conservative Government. In all the years since the revision of the Parliament Acts in 1947, the procedure has been triggered only once--against a Conservative Government during the passage of the War Crimes Act 1991. The hon. Gentleman would also have learnt that even Margaret Thatcher in her heyday was often checked and her provisions reversed by the upper House. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) explained, Conservative Governments had to live with that, and even with being checked by Conservative peers. The Labour Government are not prepared to tolerate that for a moment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-23_spnew1"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
 I want to make some progress because some of my hon. Friends wish to speak.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para0">The Minister may be able to clear up a final minor flaw in the drafting of the Bill. This is one of the few occasions on which we are entitled to refer to the Prince of Wales. Clause 5 classifies the Prince of Wales as an hereditary peer, and he will therefore be barred from the upper House. Will the Minister clarify whether the Prince of Wales will therefore be entitled to stand for this House?
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para1">The Prince of Wales might run from Highgrove, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), or from St. James's palace, which <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 790</B></P>
is situated in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster(Mr. Brooke), so they, at least, ought to know whether the Prince would be able to stand for election to the House of Commons. He made occasional, but important, contributions to debates in the other place. If he is entitled to stand for the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Assembly, I cannot see why his talents should be denied to the House of Commons.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para2">Let us consider the principles behind the Bill. The Conservatives have always supported a strong House of Lords. Conservatives fought to protect the longer delaying powers contained in the Parliament Act 1911. We introduced life peers in 1958. Our Front-Bench team supported Dick Crossman's reforms to remove the hereditary peers 30 years ago. Margaret Thatcher and our present leader, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), have set up our own review committees to consider how to strengthen the House of Lords.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-23_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hope: </B> 
 It is clear that there is some support on the Conservative Benches for the abolition of the hereditary principle. In that case, why must the hereditary peers play any role in determining the make-up of the second Chamber?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-23_spnew3"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
 The hereditary peers are being invited by the Prime Minister to play a part in determining the future of the second Chamber and its continuity with the existing chamber. The Prime Minister cooked up that deal, so the hon. Gentleman should address his question to his own Government.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para3">We support a strong House of Lords, but it is becoming ever clearer that Labour wants a weaker House. We have at least heard the honesty of the unicameralist position set out so clearly by the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews). True socialists have always been single-chamber democrats. They have always trumpeted the doctrine of the mandate. Once elected, they say, a Government can do anything in the name of the popular will. That is how they define democracy--unlimited government.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para4">We, on the contrary, have always accepted that the will of the 51 per cent. cannot be absolute, as that would be the path to elective dictatorship. There must be limits to the force of the mandate. Why else would Governments seek a fresh mandate? John Stuart Mill famously wrote of how
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A majority in a single assembly . . . easily becomes despotic and overweening".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-23_para5">
We intuitively accept that there must be limits in a democracy to the authority of a popular majority. As we reform the House of Lords, two issues are before the House: where those limits derive their authority from; and how we give them institutional expression.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para6">Some countries ascribe authority to old age or experience. In our country, we once ascribed authority to mediaeval offices--that is why the bishops sit in the House of Lords. Part of the answer may lie in tradition, although I would not claim that dukes, marquesses and earls are custodians of any living tradition. Another part of the answer lies in the common law, but that common law has been weakened by statute, and surrendered, neatly, to Europe.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 791</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-23_para7">These matters are difficult to elucidate, but the very survival of our second Chamber as a constitutional safeguard can be seen in the exemption from the Parliament Acts of any Bill to extend the life of Parliament. That concept implies the existence of some other source of authority in our society, above the ability simply to choose and to change a Government. We accept that there must be limits to the ability of the 51 per cent. to tyrannise the 49 per cent. Given that the monarch is now a figurehead, and given that the common law is subservient to statute or to continental law, it is only the existence of a strong second Chamber that can protect people against their Government.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para8">Labour Members and the Government want a weaker House of Lords. The White Paper clearly signals that fact. A key question that it poses for the royal commission is whether the functions of the present House of Lords are still necessary. It queries the interrogative function with some weasel words about whether the House of Lords should still have direct access to Ministers.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para9">Even the second Chamber's legislative function--the essence of a Chamber of Parliament--is questioned. The White Paper suggests that the second Chamber should no longer pass amendments that it can stick to but should offer what it coyly calls
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"recommendations for improvements to legislation".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-23_para10">
We will have a new stage in the passage of Bills called "Lords' suggestions". The House of Lords will not be able to play a proper legislative role and pass its own amendments to Bills. The Government come clean at the end of the White Paper--they can no longer disguise their intentions. On page 40, they say that there is a case for reducing the "theoretically available powers".
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para11">The Government admit that there might be a case for reducing the delaying power and scrapping the ability of the Lords to propose amendments in lieu to House of Commons legislation. They even want to scrap the Lords' power to reject secondary legislation. That means that a Bill in this place--we have seen several of them in the past year and a half--that gives Ministers enormous powers regarding secondary legislation and orders that are steamrollered through this place cannot be checked because the House of Lords will not be able to exercise its traditional rights over secondary legislation. That is a Cromwellian law-making position.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para12">There we have it. This Bill is not about Parliament: it is about government. It is about making life easier for Ministers and their officials. It is about saving Ministers the chore of having to expose their policies to public scrutiny and about eliminating the need to justify their Bills and orders and submit them to the public gaze. The Bill is about making government easier, quicker and simpler. That was never more clearly stated, somewhat carelessly and shamelessly, than by Baroness Jay--who, by the way, has never troubled to seek election to any public office. In her statement on 20 January, she said that House of Lords reform is about "modernising government".
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para13">There we have it: in a single sentence, we can see the present Government's contempt for the House. The Government equate Parliament with government--for Labour Members, the two are synonymous. That is why, in the past 18 months, this place has become mere lobby fodder. That is why, against the wishes of Madam Speaker, the Prime Minister comes here only once a week. <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 792</B></P>
That is why our powers are being given away to new assemblies or foreign councils. That is why constitutional Bills are guillotined. The Government believe that Parliament is simply an extension of government.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para14">That should come as no surprise. Some 21 years ago, the Labour party opposed the second Chamber in its entirety. In 1977, the Barry constituency Labour party tabled a resolution, which read:

<a name="90202-23_para16">Labour wants a legislative machine. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) reminded us eloquently, that is not the sole function of the House. We are here not simply to pass laws but to represent people's grievances. We are here not just to mobilise consent but to express opinions. We are here not just to facilitate the Executive but to protect the governed. This Bill, which vandalises the upper House and expels more than 700 members of our Parliament, signals not just a weaker second Chamber but marks yet another step in the deliberate enfeeblement of our own.

<a name="90202-23_spnew4"><B> Mr. Robert Sheldon  (Ashton-under-Lyne):</B> 
 Like all Labour Members, I welcome the Bill and its provisions for removing the hereditary peers. I played a role in the 1968-69 legislation, which I shall describe briefly while revealing some of the pitfalls that we must avoid.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para17">The last time the House was involved in debating the future of the House of Lords was 1969. I opposed that legislation, proposed by a Labour Government, because it involved a scheme, planned with the collusion of the two Front Benches, that would have provided an aldermanic bench. Back Benchers on both sides opposed the measure. Hon. Members may not recall that aldermen held an historic position in local government. Once a councillor was elected to the bench, he stayed there for life. He was influential and respected, with no elections to fight--it was an envied position.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para18">The scheme devised by Dick Crossman was of that type. It was designed to lead eventually to paid peers enjoying power without the troublesome task of fighting elections. It was about power with security, and, understandably, it did not enjoy the enthusiastic support of Back Benchers on either side. My role in that process was to realise at the outset that the guillotine could not be applied to the Bill. While others were playing parliamentary games, I saw that it could be defeated. After 14 days and 14 nights, including morning sittings, the Bill was finally dropped.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para19">The case that is always made in support of the second Chamber concerns its role in revising legislation. However, as Professor Griffiths--the great expert on constitutional matters--pointed out long ago, and as page 36 of the White Paper confirms, Lords amendments are more often than not Government amendments. The Lords' role in this process, although useful, may be easily overstated. In fact, the Select Committees could undertake part of that work--and there has been a move in that <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 793</B></P>
direction. Nowadays, Select Committees are more powerful and membership of them is much sought after, which makes it easy to transfer that part of Parliament's work to them.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para20">In the present debate, many hon. Members have expressed the wish to see the House of Lords become more independent of the Executive. That has been a common theme throughout. Some hon. Members have looked to the Lords to redress the weakness of the House of Commons in facing the Executive. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) made that point: he said that the weakness of the House of Commons in facing the Executive could be remedied by improving the standing of the House of Lords.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para21">The weakness of this place has increased over the past 20 years. The failure to halt the poll tax, and rail privatisation--which was called by the great Conservative Member of Parliament, the late Robert Adley, a "poll tax on wheels"--was not the fault of the House of Lords: the responsibility lay with us. We were the pusillanimous House of Commons. We do not need more powers; we have enough already. The trouble is that we have not used those powers when it was necessary to do so.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para22">I have thought that the weakness of the House of Commons in the past 20 years--first with Margaret Thatcher and now with a 417-seat majority party, which produces its own problems--has been an aberration. We can deal with many of the changes that are called for so long as we have the resolve to do so. If the resolve is there, the aberration ends.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para23">The measure before us is limited--and I support it fully. In yesterday's debate, most hon. Members agreed that the hereditary peers had to go. The amendment that is yet to come will provide for the 91 hereditaries to remain for the first phase. The royal commission is to produce its conclusions by the end of this year, in nine months' time. I wish it well.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para24">Some years ago, the Royal Institute of Public Administration held a one-day seminar for those who had been members of royal commissions. I had been involved in one on civil service reform and so was invited to attend. All those attending that large seminar felt some disillusionment; some even expressed anger at the fact that their work had been used not to bring about change. In some cases, they felt their work had been ignored; in others, that there had been lengthy delay. In the case of civil service reform, the surprise of others was a surprise to me--I had expected what happened in that respect. It took 17 years and a Conservative Government for the civil service reform that I had wanted to be achieved. There had been 1,400 departmental committees within the civil service, but a complete end to that nonsense was not brought about for 17 years. Let us not misunderstand the likely speed of reform in this country. Although 17 years' delay is a serious matter, the lesson of that seminar is that the majority of reports are not implemented and that none is implemented speedily.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para25">The royal commission on the House of Lords has to consider an endless variety of alternative systems. In the debate so far, we have heard many suggestions: the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) suggested a House of Lords comprising 87 senators; a unicameral solution was proposed by the hon. Member <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 794</B></P>
for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Wells) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews); a House of experts was suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris); and there have been many other suggestions. There are as many solutions as there are Members of Parliament--many and diverse are the schemes that can be proposed.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para26">Those schemes are not the only considerations that the royal commission has to survey: it will have to consider the consequences of devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as our relationship to Europe and other constitutional changes. The commission has to digest all that, but it cannot know how those matters will turn out in practice for some time yet, and what form they eventually assume has to be an integral part of the commission's consultations.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para27">After that hurdle has been cleared, there is to be the Joint Committee of both Houses. How long will that take? Then, there is the passage of a further Bill from this House to be negotiated. We must remember that, if that measure is taken in the next Parliament, there will be new Members of Parliament who do not have our experience and background and who will have to learn what arguments were made in the preceding Parliament. The result of all that is that one does not need to be a pessimist to believe that there might be some delay before the second stage takes place.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para28">My fear is that the first stage will be the only stage. There is a case for that, but it is nothing like the case that we want to be made. However, there is limited appetite for constitutional reform. After the proposals for devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and changes to the European Parliament elections, we see that House of Lords reform can hold only limited interest once we have passed from general observations to detailed examination of legislation. That is where the problem arises. Broad statements of principle can achieve some sort of consensus; it is the detail that will split asunder not only parties, but even individuals who find it hard to find agreement among themselves on central matters, so complex are the possibilities.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para29">We must remember that Lord Cranborne did not act to accept the retention of 91 hereditary peers and so undertake what many considered to be a treacherous act in order to buy two or three years of continuation; he realised that there was a possibility that the arrangement would last in perpetuity--or at least for his lifetime. That is why he did what he did and subverted the Conservative Opposition--his eye was not on the short term, but on the possibility that stage 1 could be the only stage. That is the view of one who has some considerable knowledge and understanding of the position. In the light of all that, we need to consider more carefully than we have done throughout this debate what happens in phase 1. We are currently dealing with phase 1, which might last for a long time, so let us see what we can do to get it right.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para30">In phase 1, 91 hereditary peers are to remain, bolstered by the creation of new peers who would make the House of Lords somewhat, albeit not a great deal, more representative of the electorate than it is at present. There would then be an increase, not only in its legitimacy, but in its perceived legitimacy; therefore, it is unlikely that the interim Lords would be quite as restrained as the unreconstructed House. In other words, the Lords would be likely to throw their weight around a little more, and <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 795</B></P>
certainly no less, than they do at present. The increase in legitimacy could lead to an increased use of the powers currently available to the Lords.
<P>

<a name="90202-23_para31">If the Lords in the transitional House really wanted to get their way on a specific issue, they would not necessarily be bound by any convention--Salisbury or otherwise--that was acceptable in a wholly unjustifiable House. The current Lords are constrained because they realise that it is illegitimate to use the powers they have, but once they decide that their legitimacy is that little bit greater, they are likely to use those powers far more frequently in future than they have in the past. They might go even further: it might already have occurred to them that they could filibuster on controversial Bills so as to get their way. That would be even easier if there were some public support for the stance that they adopted.

<P>
<a name="90202-24_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ian Bruce: </B> 
 I can see that the right hon. Gentleman is nearing the end of his speech. I am following his argument closely and wonder whether he has concluded that he would prefer the total abolition of the second Chamber.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-24_spnew1"><B> Mr. Sheldon: </B> 
 The main reason for keeping the other Chamber is the quinquennial Act. Under that Act, Parliament sits for five years and this House--this House alone, were the House of Lords to be abolished--can overturn that Act at a throw, if it so desires. There has to be some method of providing for that eventuality. As far as the principle of abolition is concerned, if the House of Commons behaved as a proper House of Commons and acted where it thought fit, the need for that second Chamber would be greatly reduced.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-24_spnew2"><B> Mr. Benn: </B> 
 I have followed my right hon. Friend's argument and agree with it. However, he spoke about the dangers of new-found legitimacy in the transitional House of Lords: would he go so far as to argue, as I would, that the one point where the Lords are likely use that legitimacy is to frustrate the second stage, for if the second stage were to be at all radical, they would be committing suicide by accepting it? With their new-found legitimacy, would they not frustrate the second stage to save life peers, the remaining hereditary peers and everyone else in that Chamber?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-24_spnew3"><B> Mr. Sheldon: </B> 
 In my idle moments, I have pictured some of the matters on which the transitional House of Lords might use its powers, and the one that my right hon. Friend suggests is undoubtedly one that has occurred to me. It would be easier for the Lords to use those powers on the not infrequent occasions where there was some support for their position.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-24_spnew4"><B> Mr. David Winnick  (Walsall, North):</B> 
 My right hon. Friend is being extremely generous in giving way. It is true that, in stage 1 when the hereditary Lords--other than the 91 remaining--have gone, the Lords might have a feeling of greater legitimacy, but surely, if stage 2 were to produce an entirely directly elected House, such action to frustrate it would be a direct challenge to the House of Commons?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-24_spnew5"><B> Mr. Sheldon: </B> 
 There is no doubt about that, but I am not currently concerned with stage 2. Lord Cranborne might yet see his dream come true, and that is what frightens me.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 796</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-24_para0">Once we start to alter the balance of the two Houses, we must not think that the long-standing conventions will continue to apply. Once change begins, we cannot know the use to which such reform will be put. What we can be sure of is that, even without changes to the Lords' powers, far greater use will be made of them. In addition, the 91 hereditaries might come into their own. When my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House said, in answer to me, that the powers would remain unaltered, she did so on the basis that stage 1 would last for only a limited time. The longer stage 1 remains, the more problems will be caused to this Parliament and the next. That has to be dealt with during the Committee stage of the Bill before us.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-24_spnew6"><B> Mr. Deputy Speaker: </B> 
 Before I call the next hon. Member, I remind the House that time is getting on and many hon. Members have been in the Chamber all day yesterday and all day today. It is only fair to point out that, if speeches are shorter, some of those hon. Members will be called.

<a name="90202-24_spnew7"><B> Mr. Peter Brooke  (Cities of London and Westminster):</B> 
 The right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) and I once travelled together to China. He will remember the Yeats poem "Lapis Lazuli":
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para1">
The right hon. Gentleman and I are not young, and it is a happy conceit, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you should have yoked me with him in this debate.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para2">The debate yesterday, almost all of which I attended, was perfectly relevant to the topic and therefore worthy of it. However, the response of the House to the Government's intentions could have risen higher and been more worthy of the great history of the other place if the Government had not been so preoccupied to descry it and so little to praise it.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para3">I do not blame the Government for using statistics to make their points, although, in his account of the popular vote for the two major parties at the previous general election, the hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Clark) was more accurate in the last Back-Bench speech made for the Government last night in column 684 of yesterday's <i>Hansard</i> than was the Leader of the House in the first Front-Bench speech in column 613. I appreciate that I myself am more literate than numerate, but I can plead to having done advanced applied statistics at postgraduate level at Harvard, so my criticism of the Government for a high concentration on the numerical and a compensating aversion to the verbal is not the product of statistical unfamiliarity but due to a preference of taste.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para4">Of course I understand why the Government have preferred the statistical route, and I am not gainsaying the particular arguments that they sustain, other than referring to the curious inaccuracy of the Leader of the House. Nor am I criticising the Government for wishing to reverse what they see as a perceived party political disadvantage. I could not blame any Government, let alone one so sensitive to party political advantage as this one, for wanting to redress an honest disadvantage under which they felt they were suffering. I am only sorry that they <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 797</B></P>
should have felt it necessary to overdo the immediate arguments against the hereditary peers to justify their lack of preparedness for comprehensive reform.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para5">The Brookes are a smallish family--they run nowadays to more than 5,000 individuals worldwide but fewer than 10,000--but they spread into eight or 10 county branches in this kingdom. All the branches have a badger as their crest on the grounds that brock equals brooke, and the Gaelic for badger is broc. I have found a badger as far back as 1558 on a tomb in a church in Shropshire, while in Colebrooke in County Fermanagh, in a church of which it has been accurately remarked that most churches are dedicated to the glory of God but Colebrooke is dedicated to the Brookes, there are 18. Despite that longevity, my own county branch, which is in County Cavan via Cheshire, has never produced an hereditary peer under our name, although Holbein's drawing of Brooke Lord Cobham has a distinct look of my father.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para6">I remark in parentheses, and as a declaration of interest, that the County Fermanagh branch in the next-door county produced in the last war Lord Alanbrooke and Lord Brookeborough, whose banners as knights of the garter hang from the beams of Colebrooke church and whose hereditary heirs still sit in the other House. My noble late father was a life peer and, at 91, my noble mother still is a life peer.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para7">In a certain personal respect, I speak for my parents, who served directly in the other place for 36 years between them, which, by coincidence, was precisely the same number of years that they served between them on the old Hampstead borough council. I shall draw on that coincidence in a moment, but, before that, I want to record with pride that, in seven centuries of our parliamentary history, my parents were the first married couple to sit simultaneously on the Front Bench of either House, an achievement that anticipated by a single year the same one in this House when it was accomplished by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) and Dr. John Dunwoody in the then Government.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para8">The coincidence to which I referred is that both the bodies of which my parents were members for 36 years--Hampstead borough council and the House of Lords--have been the subject of drastic reform. The merger of Hampstead borough council with St. Pancras and Holborn into Camden chronologically followed the Herbert commission, which my late father established in the late 1950s and which in due course gave rise to the subsuming of the London county council into the Greater London council in 1965. It was, in short, the measured product of long deliberation and prudent preparation and in that respect wholly worthy of this great city.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para9">The reform of the House of Lords--an institution at least 10 times older than the LCC and the old London boroughs when they were reformed--is being passed at a breakneck and seemingly unpremeditated pace. The right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) modestly took the credit for the royal commission, but the credit for that happening at all belongs to her Majesty's loyal Opposition for their campaign against the haphazard and ramshackle way in which the Government are handling the reform. Because they took no thought for the morrow, the Government now have to introduce the reform much faster than would have been necessary if there had been greater forethought--a charge that can be laid at the door <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 798</B></P>
of their whole constitutional project. As I remarked at an earlier stage, if you do not know where you are trying to get to, any road will get you there. After more than seven centuries, that is not worthy of this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para10">The hon. and learned Member for Medway(Mr. Marshall-Andrews) referred to bricklayers. I have a criticism of the royal commission other than that it has an excessively short life due to the Government's unthinking folly. I served in the Whips Office and the Cabinet with my noble Friend Lord Wakeham. He has a considerable reputation as a fixer in the eyes of political journalists and, although historians will determine its eventual validity, the profession of fixer owes more to the role of a plumber than to that of an architect. Lord Wakeham's principal credential for the chairmanship seems to be that he belongs to the right union. The future House of Lords is in more than a little need of architecture, and in that I am saying more brutally what my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) said gently.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para11">The Government may justify their acquiescence in the Weatherill amendment on grounds of pragmatism, but it owes nothing to principle. The House of Lords has a great national past. In 1975, the Brussels Commission confessed that, for the first time, it had been outwitted, defeated and perplexed by a delegation from a national legislature. That was a scientific delegation consisting of Lord Ashby, Lord Hinton and Lord Zuckerman. When representatives of the Commission rang No. 10 the following day, they asked, "Why are you proposing to abolish the House of Lords?" Those were life peers, but the late Launcelot Fleming, who was successively Bishops of Portsmouth and Norwich, was a scientist of sufficient distinction to serve on the royal commission on environmental pollution in his own right.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para12">On the hereditary side, the noble Earl Russell has all his father's genes and he is not alone among the hereditary peers. There are plenty of hereditary peers who sit as fellows of the Royal Society. Able Ministers from this place who have gone to the other place report that, when they speak in that massively knowledgeable forum, they experience the same nervousness that they experienced as small boys before going out to bat. Of course I acknowledge those who are lightly called working peers, but I see no significantly greater fault in a peer who sits in the other place because his ancestor gave money to Charles I than in one who sits there now because he has given money to the governing party of the day.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para13">I fear that I am more sure that the Bill is not worthy of the Government's constitutional project--perhaps it is--because of the arguments that were deployed yesterday on its behalf. I cannot blame Back Benchers, because a lead is always given by the Front Bench, and I regard it as a trivialisation of what we are about that the Leader of the House spent so much time discussing taxpayer support for the 62 hereditary peers who live abroad when this Government have not even tried to answer the West Lothian question, the fault line of which still lies beneath their constitutional structures.
<P>

<a name="90202-24_para14">I am no great believer in focus groups, because I recall Dean Acheson's account in his great post-war book about a wartime episode when Cordell Hull said to President Roosevelt:

<a name="90202-24_para15">It was clear from Labour Members' speeches yesterday that they have gone into the highways and byways of their constituencies--either spontaneously or under bleeper control--to verify opinion on the House of Lords. I cite the speeches of the hon Members for The Wrekin (Mr. Bradley) and for Gillingham. The hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) referred to his constituents. The hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt) more spaciously told us what people wanted.

<a name="90202-24_para16">Although I am personally glad that the Labour Members are so close to their constituents, I have a different impression.

<a name="90202-25_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Louise Ellman  (Liverpool, Riverside):</B> 
 This very important debate is about the basic issues of government, accountability and representation. Over the past two days, the Opposition have painted a picture of confusion and disarray. Numerous Opposition Members have told us that they reject the principle that the rights of heredity are superior to those of democratic accountability, yet, in addressing that issue, they have described the Bill using adjectives such as "sinister" and "vindictive". They have said that they want to hear what the detailed proposals for change might be, yet appear to reject the proposition that a royal commission should be--indeed, already is being--set up to consider such details.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para0">The Bill is part of a proposal that shows the Government's determination to deal very positively with an issue which, until now, has proved intractable. It is extremely important that we all recognise the momentous opportunities that the Bill, and the process that it begins, puts in front of us. We have the opportunity to look again at our constitution, give a voice to people who have been denied a democratic voice and the right to be listened to, and reconsider issues of accountability and the representation of interests and people who, for far too long, have been excluded.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para1">The issue of devolution in the United Kingdom and beyond has been mentioned by many hon. Members. I welcome devolution; it is about accountability, the need to give a focus to decisions that are often taken in a fragmented way, and identity. Those different aspects of devolution assume different importance in different parts of the United Kingdom. We are to have a Scottish Parliament, a Welsh Assembly, a Northern Ireland Assembly, a Greater London authority and a Council of the Isles.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para2">In England, with the formation of regional development agencies--we shall have, at long last, a focus for economic activity in the regions--and in regional chambers, we see at last an attempt to bring together, on an indirectly elected basis for the moment, a forum in which issues to do with social structure, the economy and the environment can be debated, and in which strategies can be addressed and delivered. In the House only yesterday, the Leader of the House confirmed that it is proposed to restore the Standing Committee on the Regions.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para3">We have therefore reached a position from which an elected base--even if only indirectly elected--could nominate members of a second Chamber, whatever we decide to call it. Regional chambers in England comprise elected representatives. They are appropriate bodies to nominate people for a reformed House of Lords. In that way, the voice of the regions would be heard, not just in the House of Commons, where it absolutely essential, but in a reformed second House. Such views could not only be heard but considered and acted on. That could be done in the context of the United Kingdom and, indeed, of Europe. We would no longer have to face the situation, which the Transport Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs described last week when referring to the fact that the promise of regional rail links with Europe had not been delivered, of the regions of England being "cheated".
<P>

<P>

<a name="90202-25_para4">Such a system would provide an opportunity to consider the impact of proposed legislation on regions. It would provide a forum in which to consider the impact of spending policies on the regions and of wider European issues and the way in which the regions should influence those wider European policies.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para5">Discussions in the reformed second Chamber would, of course, be only a part of the review of our constitution. There should be room, too, for the voice of the regions to be heard in this directly elected House of Commons. Indeed, I hope that, soon, regional chambers in England will be directly elected.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para6">The regions of England are at different stages of readiness to move forward. The north-west is particularly well prepared, having worked with the public, private and voluntary sectors over the past eight years, in the North West Regional Association and the North West Partnership--and now, the north-west assembly--to put together strategies for training, economic development, transport and the environment, and to work with Europe. Indeed, such strategies are being enacted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-25_spnew1"><B> Mr. Graham Brady  (Altrincham and Sale, West):</B> 
 I have been listening to the hon. Lady's speech with interest; she has obviously given considerably deeper thought to this matter than the Government appear to have done. I am intrigued by one aspect of her remarks. Why does she appear to hold the view that a second Chamber nominated by regional assemblies would better represent the interests of the regions than a directly elected second Chamber?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-25_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Ellman: </B> 
 The constitution of the second Chamber, its membership, role and functions will be the subject of consideration by the royal commission that is being set up. I believe that part of the revised second Chamber should comprise elected representation. It is vital that the voice of the English regions should be heard in that Chamber, and regional chambers or assemblies, which are indirectly elected, would be appropriate bodies to nominate such representatives.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para7">The proposition that I have advanced is a contribution to a major debate on which we are embarking. The Bill is of momentous importance. It begins to tackle an issue that has troubled so many people for so long, and it opens up new opportunities. I want to ensure that those will include an opportunity for the voice of the English regions to be heard and acted on. I hope that the royal commission will consider the proposal, and that the House will give it due consideration. I also hope that, when hon. Members speak about devolution, they will view it not as a weakness, but as a great strength for the United Kingdom and for every region of the country.

 We can all agree that the debate has been of a particularly high standard. The House is always at its best when our more senior Members take part and give us the benefit of their collective memory and collective wisdom.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para8">Although I was ready to attack the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) for starting her speech by somewhat misrepresenting the position of the <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 802</B></P>
Conservative party, she made an important contribution to the debate, as she was willing to say how she thought a second Chamber could contribute towards the better governance of the United Kingdom. That is exactly the approach of the Conservative party.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para9">I should state at the outset that, whenever I have been asked whether I accepted the hereditary principle, I have replied that I would never be on the barricades trying to defend a principle that is clearly indefensible, but that we in this place must defend a second Chamber that works rather well. When we replace it, we must replace it with something better.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para10">I am, perhaps, fortunate to be in this place because of the hereditary principle--not because I have any claims on that basis, but because, in its great wisdom, my constituency has elected as two of its past four Members of Parliament a member of one of the hereditary families who, on the death of his father, has had to give up the seat. When Victor Montague moved from South Dorset, the seat was, admittedly, won by the Labour party.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para11">My predecessor as the Member for South Dorset, Robert Cranborne, decided to go early so that he could do other things--indeed, he told us that he had to look after his acres of roofs and earn some money to maintain them. I was fortunate to be selected when one of the future hereditary peers decided to move on, so I am grateful to have gained my seat in this place as a result of the hereditary principle.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para12">We must find ways of improving our second Chamber. Much that has been said this evening should be considered carefully by the royal commission. We have heard some excellent suggestions. It worries me, however, that the Prime Minister does not seem to want a political balance in the second Chamber, so that, when the Conservatives are in power, the Conservatives would have control in that Chamber, as would Labour when the Labour party was in power.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para13">It would be daft for us to make the second Chamber more democratic and thereby to create a constant coalition where the Liberal Democrats of the day could enter a coalition with whichever party was in opposition to block the Government's plans. The Prime Minister should consider that carefully. By increasing the democratic accountability of the House of Lords, we would automatically give it more power. That is the difficulty that we all face.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-25_spnew4"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
 It does not necessarily follow that, if the second Chamber were democratically elected, it would be in a position to challenge the primacy of the House of Commons. That all depends on the allocation of powers between the two Chambers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-25_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bruce: </B> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but the Bill does not change the powers of the other place. It puts in place a Chamber that could go on and on. We must be cautious as we proceed. Many Labour Members object strongly to the House of Lords and are convinced that it is necessary to get rid of the hereditary principle. I hope to persuade them that there should be fundamental amendments to the Bill, or that it should be thrown out.
<P>

<a name="90202-25_para14">The second Chamber is willing to give way to the primacy of the House of Commons because the Lords know that there is no democratic basis for them to say, "We know better." Nevertheless, in a typically British <P>

way, the institution works. When we discuss reform, especially the first stage, we must ensure that we put in its place a Chamber that works better.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-26_spnew0"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman recognise the fact that the upper House as currently constituted works better for his party than for any radical party, whether Liberal or Labour? It is much less likely to interfere with his party's legislation because of the in-built majority and its inherent sympathy with his party.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-26_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bruce: </B> 
 The hon. Lady goes on at length with her point, but there were 240 defeats of a Conservative Government. The democratic legitimacy of the House of Lords when there is a Conservative Government is much greater. If Members of the House of Lords take the Conservative Whip and behave as Conservatives most of the time, they feel happy to challenge the will of a Conservative Government, whereas if they challenge the will of a Labour Government, they would be working against the democratic mandate given to that Government. That has happened time and again.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-26_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hayes: </B> 
 Perhaps my hon. Friend will acknowledge, in answer to the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), that the essential difference between the two Houses is that the House of Lords is less partisan. The people who take the whip in the House of Lords take a far less severe whip than Members of this Chamber. They need to prove nothing, do not need to impress their party leaders and, very often, are going nowhere. Therefore the atmosphere in the House of Lords is quite different. The issue is to do with the style, as well as the content, of that Chamber.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-26_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bruce: </B> 
 My hon. Friend had made a point that I would have made. I leave it in his hands, and it was made much more eloquently than if I had made it.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para0">I am not defending leaving the House of Lords as it is, but we must have a plan to go forward and achieve something better. I am also keen that people who enter the House of Lords through the hereditary principle and decide to work--effectively for nothing, other than expenses--should be acknowledged for what they have done. People with enormous knowledge, who have worked for 10 or 20 years in the House of Lords, could be stripped away from us.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para1">I am a vice-chairman of the European Informatics Market Group, and two hereditary peers--Lord Renwick and Lord Chelmsford--are the mainstays and do all the work. I am keen that, whatever we get in place of the House of Lords, we have similar people who are willing to put that sort of dedication into doing a job of work that helps Parliament. For example, the work of the Select Committee on Science and Technology has been acknowledged.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para2">We also need that extra attribute, which no one has mentioned. A second Chamber slows down legislation, which is very important.

<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 804</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-26_para3">A second Chamber slows down legislation and allows the public to realise that something is going on. Many people realise that there will be change--for example, in their industry--only when a Bill is debated in the House of Lords or the House of Commons. The newspapers alert the public to it by reporting the opening debates. People have time to table amendments in the second Chamber, which is often where a Government realise that there is something wrong with legislation. They then table Government amendments in the second Chamber, whether the Commons or the Lords--

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-26_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wareing: </B> 
 We do not need a second Chamber to do that.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-26_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bruce: </B> 
 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but Ministers are suggesting that we should have a second Chamber. He should fight for what he believes in.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para4">I have reached the point where Labour Members may like to think about whether they will get the deal that they were promised by Ministers--the abolition of the hereditary principle and a reformed House of Lords. The Labour party manifesto may not have said that we will achieve a reformed and more democratic House of Lords, but I know that Labour Members are keen for that to happen.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para5">If Labour Members are willing to let the Government off the hook in respect of the first phase by saying, "We have now fulfilled our manifesto commitment," there could be many Parliaments before any further reform takes place. If the prize, and the incentive to reform the House of Lords, is to get rid of the hereditary principle, Labour Members who want that to happen should not allow the Government to get rid of the hereditary principle one minute and say the next, "We have done the urgent thing, so things can go on and on."
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para6">I hope that I am not giving away confidences by saying that I was in a meeting with the leader of my party the other day. He went round the 10 of us in the room, and there were about 15 different opinions about what we should have in place of the House of Lords. That does not happen only in the Conservative party; it happens in the Liberal party and the Labour party. Those who have listened to the debate know why reform of the House of Lords has not yet happened: we have not agreed what we will put in its place. Taking the pressure off the Government, by allowing them to get rid of most of the hereditary peers, will stop them having to make those difficult decisions.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para7">My right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon(Mr. Major) made some excellent suggestions. He went through what the House of Lords could work at, and that is the way that we should be going. We want to achieve reform in this Parliament, and it is right to do so. If the Government try to achieve reform in two stages, they will simply end up with imperfect changes in the first stage. They should be rejected by the House.

<a name="90202-26_spnew8"><B> Dr. Stephen Ladyman  (South Thanet):</B> 
 I have been trying to catch your eye since the beginning of the debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker, so I have been listening throughout to the speeches of Conservative Members. Some were interesting. The right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) at least gave an unequivocal <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 805</B></P>
commitment to a reformed second Chamber, and we heard a moving contribution from the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd). Unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman is no longer in his place, but I agreed with much of what he said. After slightly less than two years in this place, it is clear to me that all of Parliament needs some type of reform.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para8">Although I strongly support the Prime Minister and the work that he is doing, it is clear to me that a future Prime Minister could turn out to be Caligula, and, under our current system, could make his horse a proconsul. Unfortunately, little could be done to prevent him or her from doing so.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para9">The reform of Parliament is plainly necessary, but the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills should note that at least the Labour party has embarked on the process. There may be dangers in what we are beginning to do, but at least we are trying. We cannot cross oceans until we are prepared to lose sight of the shore, and that is what the Labour party is trying to do.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para10">Other interesting speeches have been made by Opposition Members. The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) made what I considered to be a particularly good speech. I never thought that I would hear myself say this in the House, but I suggest that hon. Members read it. I am equally horrified to say that I was strangely drawn to some of the ideas advanced by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth); and there was a delightful moment when the right hon. andlearned Member for North-East Bedfordshire(Sir N. Lyell) seemed to be trying to convince us that Members of the other House should be neither appointed nor elected, but should somehow be caught with rod and line.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para11">With those exceptions, however, Opposition speeches have been uniformly depressing. Conservative Member after Conservative Member has risen to tell us that he or she supports the idea of abandoning the hereditary principle, but will not support the Bill. Conservative Member after Conservative Member has risen to claim that we need reform of the House of Lords, but not yet. Conservative Member after Conservative Member has risen to claim that there is a need for a free-thinking and independent House of Lords, yet Conservative Members are prepared to continue with a system that allows the dim and the devious to keep their place in that House as long as they are shackled to the Conservative party.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para12">Let me spell out what I believe to be obvious: a vote against the Bill is a vote in favour of the hereditary principle. We are discussing what is essentially a simple Bill. The Leader of the House described it as exquisite in its simplicity, and she was right. Clause 1 is the only substantive clause, and it is absolutely explicit in its meaning. All the other measures in the Bill provide for adjustments and new arrangements following from that clause.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para13">It is clear to me that, as clause 1 is entirely concerned with the abandoning of the hereditary principle, anyone who votes against the Bill will vote for that principle. No spinning can change that; no dressing up by the Opposition can change it. Either the Opposition are for the hereditary principle, or they are against it. By their deeds we shall know them: if they vote against the Bill, they will be voting for the hereditary principle.
<P>

<P>

<a name="90202-26_para14">I start from this premise--if Parliament is to be fair and democratic, all parliamentarians must have one quality in common: they must be replaceable. I am the Member of Parliament for South Thanet. I have many weaknesses--I am sure that my constituents know my weaknesses--but, whatever weaknesses I have, I have one quality that should commend me to my constituents: I am replaceable. My predecessor, Mr. Jonathan Aitken, was also replaceable. If my constituents had not replaced him at the last election, I suspect that they would be in the process of replacing him now; but, if he were an hereditary peer, he would still be a parliamentarian.
<P>

<a name="90202-26_para15">At the last election, the constituents of Tatton decided to replace their Member of Parliament, because--rightly or wrongly--they considered that he did not measure up to their standards. If he were an hereditary peer, he would still be in that Chamber and would still be influencing our legislation.

<P>
<a name="90202-27_spnew0"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
 I hope that the hon. Gentleman is going to explain how it is that the gentlemen to whom he has referred would not still be part of the legislature if they were life peers. His whole argument seems to be flawed. He says that they would be here if they were hereditary peers; they would also be here under the Government's proposals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-27_spnew1"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right and I shall deal with that point in a moment, if he will just be patient.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para0">The House of Commons has authority for one reason and one reason only: the people give us that authority. Because of that authority, although we are not builders, we can build houses; although we do not work as teachers, we can teach; although we are not nurses or doctors, we can cause people to be cared for and treated. People give us that authority knowing that, if we abuse it, we can be replaced. As it stands, the House of Lords cannot be replaced. Hereditary peers and their successors sit there for their lives without ever having to take responsibility for what they choose to do.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para1">It follows--to me at least--that any reform of the second Chamber that takes away the hereditary principle is an improvement. It is a start in the process of reform. Anyone who votes against the Bill is denying us that improvement and that start.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para2">The interim second Chamber is, by definition, replaceable. It will contain life peers--people who have been appointed to be there. If the Cross-Bench amendment is tabled in the upper Chamber and accepted, it may even contain people who are currently hereditary peers, but they are replaceable: when the reforms are completed, they will be replaced. I have absolute confidence in the commitment of the Government and of Labour Members to push through that second-stage reform. A vote against the Bill has to be--there can be no other interpretation--a vote for the continuance of parliamentarians who are there by right of birth.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para3">Other Conservative Members have tried to argue that the interim Chamber is no improvement, that the Lords is independent and that it should be left alone while the royal commission deliberates. The independence of the House<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 807</B></P>
of Lords is a myth. My parliamentary neighbour, the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale), has recently written in our local newspaper:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The House of Lords is eccentric, antiquated and undemocratic. It also works."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-27_para4">
My message to him is: three out of four is not bad. It is eccentric, antiquated and undemocratic, but it does not work. It has conducted no reasonable scrutiny of Conservative party legislation over recent decades. The Lords is politically dominated by the Conservative party, which has a majority of 3:1. It is a simple fact that, during the previous Labour Government, defeats of Government legislation as a percentage of all Divisions in the House of Lords never fell below 50 per cent. They averaged 5 per cent. during the subsequent 18 years of Conservative rule.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para5">A few years ago, more than 400 Tories were bussed into the House of Lords to push through the Maastricht treaty without a referendum. Those independent, free-thinking Conservatives went through the Lobby and voted for something that every one of them now says is wrong, and that the entire Front-Bench team of the Conservative Opposition in the House of Commons claims to be wrong.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para6">Those free thinkers allowed the poll tax on to the statute book without a whimper. They sold the railways cheap with hardly a whimper. They are not independent, free-thinking spirits, as they are made out to be. They are Conservatives root and branch. That is why the Opposition want them to stay there.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para7">Let me deal with why the Bill does not include a complete reform of the House of Lords. I want to raise something that has not so far been mentioned in the debate--the so-called Salisbury convention. The Salisbury convention requires, or at least expects, Members of the upper Chamber to allow legislation through that Chamber if the proposals were included in the Government's manifesto.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para8">The Government's manifesto is clear and unequivocal on Lords reform. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The House of Lords must be reformed. As an initial, self-contained reform, not dependent on further reform in the future, the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords will be ended by statute. This will be the first stage in a process of reform to make the House of Lords more democratic and representative. The legislative powers of the House of Lords will remain unaltered."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-27_para9">The Bill is absolutely and explicitly tied to the manifesto. There can be no question but that the Government are doing what we said we would do in our manifesto. If we were to allow further reforms to the House of Lords to be included in the Bill, Opposition Members would today be saying that we are exceeding the authority of our mandate, and that our legislation should be opposed on that basis. In the House of Lords, the Tory hereditary peers would be saying that the Salisbury convention did not apply and that they could therefore block the legislation. The Government have done what is required tactically to ensure that the Bill is passed by the House of Lords.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para10">Some of my colleagues have been in the Chamber for almost 10 hours and would like to speak in the debate. I shall therefore conclude my comments. The Bill is a vital piece of reforming legislation; there is nothing to be feared in it. Some of my right hon. and hon. Friends have <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 808</B></P>
suggested that reform may not proceed to the second stage, but they should not have such fears. All Labour Members are absolutely committed to second-stage reform. First, however, we have to take that first step. We have to lose sight of the shore if we are to cross the ocean. I commend the Bill to the House.

 I am delighted to follow the speech of the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman). I wish that I shared his supreme conviction that stage 2 will follow stage 1. I suspect that the Government have not made detailed proposals because they do not know in detail how they will accomplish reform. Nevertheless, they have asked a royal commission to report, in only 10 months, on one of the most complex constitutional issues of our time.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para11">This has been a very important constitutional debate. We have had some very high-class speeches, notably from the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) and from two former Prime Ministers, my right hon. Friends the Members for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) and for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath). I want to refer to all three of their speeches.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para12">I should, first, mention the Government's attitude on the issue. The President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons, in her speech yesterday, clearly expressed her political prejudices against hereditary peers per se. She said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Anything would be better"--[<i>Official Report</i>, 1 February 1999; Vol. 324, c. 614.]
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-27_para13">
than the current system. Her statement truly demonstrates that she is introducing the legislation not because she wants to improve our current legislative structures, but purely out of political spite.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para14">My constituents are not writing to me in droves on this constitutional issue. However, they did elect me to this place to guard jealously the great democratic principles on which our country was founded, and to look after their welfare and interests.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para15">Perhaps this specific plank in our constitutional change--merely abolishing hereditary peers--is not a huge one. However, it assumes much greater importance when one considers what might follow that change. If we place the change into the overall context of the Government's constitutional changes, we begin to understand how radically the United Kingdom might be altered in only four or five years of this Labour Government.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para16">Let us consider the constitutional changes that the Government have made. I think that, once the people of the United Kingdom realise how the Government have sold them down the river, they will start to react against them. The Government have embarked on passing a great body of constitutional change--devolving government to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; changing how our judiciary operates; enshrining in law the European convention on human rights; encouraging judicial review--by altering profoundly the operation of our judiciary and Parliament.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para17">Now, the Government are reforming the House of Lords, but they do not have a clue about what they want to put in its place. They have asked a royal commission to report in just 10 months. I hope that, having considered <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 809</B></P>
the issue, the royal commission will tell the Government that it is too complex to be addressed in just 10 months. I am not against change and nor is my party, but if we are to do the job properly and look at the matter in depth, as it deserves, we need longer than 10 months.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para18">I applaud my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon for asking that, following the constitutional change, the Joint Committee be given a locus in thoroughly investigating the royal commission and have the power to reject any part of its findings. Parliament must assert its right of supremacy over the royal commission. It would be totally intolerable to do otherwise.

So, we can nail once and for all the assertion that the in-built Conservative majority needs to be addressed.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para22">Much has been said today about the Bill abolishing hereditary peers, the transitional arrangements contained in clause 4 and how the transition is to be handled. The White Paper deals in detail with what is envisaged during the transition and subsequently. It has already constrained the work of the royal commission because it assumes that the new House of Lords will be appointed by some system or another. If anyone does not believe that, I need only quote from chapter 1, the executive summary, which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The system of appointment of life peers to the House of Lords will be reviewed. Our objective will be to ensure that over time party appointees as life peers more accurately reflect the proportion of votes cast at the previous general election."

</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-27_para23">
It then slightly contradicts itself by saying:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No one political party should seek a majority in the House of Lords".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-27_para24">In my mind, there is only one question to be addressed. It concerns how the power of the Executive will be held to account. I am a democrat. I do not like the power of Parliament progressively being reduced. Even under the Conservative Government--and certainly under the present Government--the power of the Executive has been increased progressively. My right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon referred to some of the measures that have been introduced during this Parliament--Prime Minister's questions take place in just one half-hour session and there has been an increase in secondary legislation. Indeed, under this year's Finance Bill, the entire arrangements for introducing the euro were referred to secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para25">The power of the House to scrutinise the Executive is progressively being reduced. The right hon. Member for Chesterfield was quite clear about the huge power that the Prime Minister has in his patronage. He has been delegated the power to commit the country to war, to sign treaties and to appoint commissioners and bishops. The Prime Minister already has huge power.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 810</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-27_para26">I come now to the Bill's potential consequences. Unlike the hon. Member for South Thanet, I doubt whether the Bill will move to phase 2 because of its complexity. The appointment system is fraught with danger. Indeed, my intervention in the Minister's speech this afternoon proved the point that the Prime Minister will still have the ultimate veto over who is appointed to the commission. That means that it cannot be truly independent.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para27">We have to consider alternatives. I believe that the most legitimate alternative is an elected second Chamber. I shall deal with the issue in some depth, because some of my hon. Friends might be a little surprised to hear me say that. I am concerned to ensure that the calibre of the existing Members of the House of Lords is maintained. The current system works because we have people of eminence and experience in almost every field. They are thoroughly equipped to debate and scrutinise the legislation brought forward by this House and to tell us when we are making mistakes and ask us to think again. That deliberative, delaying power is the reason for the existence of the second Chamber.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para28">If an appointments system will not work, we have to consider an elected system. In that case, the Members will have to be paid, which would considerably increase the cost of the House of Lords, contrary to what the notes on clauses say. The current cost of administering and running the House of Lords is about &#163;42 million. The cost of administering the House of Commons is almost &#163;260 million. An elected House of Lords would be likely to result in considerably greater costs.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para29">An elected second Chamber has one great argument in its favour. If its elections coincided with a general election to this place, the potential for political patronage would be huge because it would be likely to be of the same political colour as the Government. However, if its elections fell in the middle of the cycle of elections to the House of Commons, the situation would be entirely different and could be highly advantageous. If the Government were popular, the House of Lords would still be of the same political colour and the Government would have no difficulty in getting their manifesto commitments through both Houses. However, if, as has often been the case, the Government were unpopular, the House of Lords would be likely to be of a different political colour and would act as a check on the Executive.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para30">That has a great deal to commend it. However, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup made clear, having elections in the middle of the electoral cycle of the Commons would need fixed-term Parliaments for the House of Commons. I believe that that is a good idea. It would remove one of the Prime Minister's great powers of patronage--the ability to call an election when it suits him. The Government are elected on a manifesto. They should carry out that programme in full and then go to the country at a known date after four or five years. That would allow the elections to the House of Lords to be in mid-cycle.
<P>

<a name="90202-27_para31">There are a host of difficulties to be overcome in thinking about the possible operation of stage 2. The Government have acted with undue haste: out of pure political spite to meet their prejudices against hereditary peers, they have brought forward a Bill that will lead to a situation that they have no idea how to resolve. My constituents are more concerned about the health service, the education system, the economy, jobs, and how they are to get on in Europe. They are not concerned about the <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 811</B></P>
minutiae of how democracy works. However, the issue is vital. Our history has been built on democracy. I do not want the Government to alter the balance of the country during their five-year term. I shall vote against the Bill tonight and I shall give evidence to the royal commission on how difficult coming up with an alternative might be.

<a name="90202-28_spnew0"><B> Caroline Flint  (Don Valley):</B> 
 I congratulate all hon. Members who, like me, have been here for 13 hours over yesterday and today, waiting for a chance to speak in the debate. The debate has been interesting, and I have listened carefully. I have not intervened, and I was rather hurt that the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) did not respond when I tried to intervene earlier this evening. I am glad to have the chance to speak now.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para0">It has been interesting to see the Conservative party in denial about the link that dare not speak its name--the link between the Conservative party in this House and the Conservatives in the other place. I must say to the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) that you got your statistics the wrong way around. Quoting from the document that you raised in your speech--

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-28_spmin0"><B>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </B> 
 Order. I am getting rather tired of having to repeat this night after night, but I must be consistent with hon. Members. The form of address that we use in this House must be applied consistently.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-28_spnew1"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 I apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker. As we enter the graveyard shift, I apologise for any tiredness that has led me to forget parliamentary etiquette.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para1">The document to which the hon. Member for Cotswold referred states that, from 1970-71 to 1997-98, the average number of Government defeats per Session under a Labour Government was 63, compared with eight under a Conservative Government. That makes the point.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para2">It is interesting that we are having this debate in a year when we celebrate two anniversaries--although "celebrate" may be the wrong word. Last weekend saw the 350th anniversary of the execution of Charles I. This year, we see the 400th anniversary of the birth of Oliver Cromwell. As I am sure hon. Members are aware, those two were the protagonists in a situation that led to the abolition of the House of Lords--the only abolition that has occurred in parliamentary history.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para3">When I show schoolchildren from Don Valley around the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the story that they like best--and write to me afterwards about--is that of Charles II coming back after the restoration, digging up the body of Oliver Cromwell, cutting off his head and putting it on a spike in Westminster hall. However, Charles II contributed to something else--perhaps more than many monarchs, he contributed to the providing of hereditary titles for services rendered in the bedroom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-28_spnew2"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
 When the hon. Lady is talking to schoolchildren, does she talk to them about parliamentary democracy, checking the power of the Executive, the powers of the Whips, how she is dictated to by the pager from Walworth road and the spin doctors--and about how that adds to democracy in this country?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-28_spnew3"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 I speak to my constituents and schoolchildren about the struggle within Parliament for <P>

the rights of universal suffrage, and about how many centuries it took to achieve universal suffrage against the dominance of the landed gentry. I am delighted that, by abolishing the hereditary principle, we will do something to alter the balance from the two thirds of those in the House of Lords who still represent the landed gentry towards those from other, more diverse walks of life.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para4">It is a sad reflection that, after 18 years of government--and despite all the rhetoric that we have heard yesterday and today from all the born-again Tory reformers--the Tory party's election manifesto for 1997 said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have demonstrated we are not against change where it is practicable and beneficial. But fundamental changes which have not been fully thought through--such as opposition proposals on the House of Lords--would be extremely damaging. We will oppose change for change's sake."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-28_para5">
That was all the Tories had to say. They did not say that, as a point of principle, they supported the abolition of the hereditary principle. The right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) did himself no service by pontificating this evening on all the ways in which we could modernise and change this House, given that he had a fair opportunity to do something when he held the reins of power.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para6">We will not expect any executions during the passage of the Bill, or through the debate that we have started and to which the Government have given oxygen and life--something that would never have happened under a Conservative Government. We will discuss, inquire and explore the modern ways in which Parliament can work as we move into the next millennium.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para7">This first step is part of that process. It is a modest proposal to undo the rights of 760-odd families who believe that they have the right to be represented for time eternal in our legislative Chambers. Such job security has been afforded to no one in my constituency: not only a job for life but a job for successors for hundreds of years through an accident of birth.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para8">I say no one, but in fact the 12th Earl of Scarborough is my near neighbour. He is a very nice man whom I have met on several occasions. He owns considerable land in my constituency and elsewhere. I have nothing against him personally--he seemed amiable and is generally well regarded--but I note that he has not taken the oath since the general election and that the Library records show that he has not spoken in the Chamber at any time in the past 11 years.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para9">I have no objection to such self-restraint: in one respect, it is commendable, and I am pleased that my local lord has not taken part in the wrecking of Government legislation in the other place since the 1997 general election. I do not believe that hereditary peers should be entitled to participation in the formation of legislation.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para10">Like my noble earl, many Members of the House of Lords do not attend. We have had a discussion about scrutiny, and that prompts the question: who is doing the scrutiny and asking the questions in the other place? Thanks again to the Library, we find that only 508 peers out of the 1,294 have attended more than a third--76--of the sitting days. Of the 508 who do the bulk of the work--they should be respected for that--222 are hereditary peers. They represent only a third of the hereditaries, but in such numbers they have considerable sway.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 813</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-28_para11">As we approach the millennium, it should not be morally acceptable for our democratic process to be influenced by the self-selection of 766 people who gained their title by an accident of birth. It is an historical legacy that the Bill will rectify.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para12">The Opposition have asked whether we have a right to proceed in this way. I will not repeat what my hon. Friends have said about our manifesto, but I believe that, even if the manifesto did not have all the answers, it certainly set in train a series of events by which we will gain a more representative second Chamber. The starting point for that is getting rid of the hereditary principle.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para13">We are not creating an elected dictatorship. Our manifesto commitment is clear: to make the House of Lords more democratic and more representative. We have the first Prime Minister ever who is willing to relinquish the patronage that many other Prime Ministers have used. We are not interested in fixing the reform of the second Chamber. Some Opposition Members say that we are going too slowly and others that we are going too fast. It is clear that we have started a debate that would never have taken place under the Conservatives, had they won at the general election. They did not win, and our manifesto commitment was pretty clear to the members of the British public who voted.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para14">I hope that, after the Bill is enacted, we can put some of the vested interests to one side and consider how we can reach political consensus on the second Chamber. I believe that the bicameral arrangement works in most major advanced democracies. Only a few Members have suggested that a single Chamber should be the answer.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para15">I think that we would agree that we want a body that is free to scrutinise legislation and Government. The second Chamber, even in its present form, has sometimes excelled at scrutiny, and many refinements to legislation have been made by successive Governments following representations from the Lords. That role should be protected and maintained. Would we all not agree that such a Chamber has the potential to play an effective role and be independent of the Commons if no party has a majority in it? The Prime Minister said that that would be considered.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-28_spnew4"><B> Mr. Paul Tyler  (North Cornwall):</B> 
 I am very appreciative of the hon. Lady's comments about my ancestor, Oliver Cromwell.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para16">Is not the role of the House of Lords far more important than its constitution? It is as if we were interviewing for a job without writing the job specification. Does the hon. Lady agree that a large amount of the attention of the House has been concentrated on who should be there rather than on what they should do, but that the latter is the far more important issue? I am glad that she is coming to that subject.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-28_spnew5"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 It is very important that we consider the role of the second Chamber. It may not be a first priority for the public; certainly in Don Valley people are concerned about jobs, health and education. However, underpinning the development of policies in those areas is the creation of opportunities for our constituents to have a say in how the country is run. That is true whether we are considering the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 814</B></P>
Assembly, regional and local government or this place. We do not yet have all the answers, but we have created a debate and that is one of the purposes of the House.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para17">It has been suggested that the second Chamber should be more representative, and I agree. No one denies the wealth of political, religious, diplomatic and business experience that is represented in the upper House, but I suggest that it overwhelmingly comes from the life peers. The hereditaries can claim to represent but few. If we look at the statistics, we see that they are mainly men, they mainly went to one public school, they are mainly from the landed gentry, they mainly went to Oxford or Cambridge and they represent the gentlemen's clubs and country life of the old establishment.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para18">One benchmark of a proper second Chamber is a more representative spread of gender, race and social class. On those criteria, the hereditaries are among the least representative of all those in our political and governmental institutions. One irony of the statistics about the hereditaries is that they have a broader age range among their number, because death leads to replacement with a younger generation. However, that on its own cannot justify their presence.
<P>

<a name="90202-28_para19">One feature of the debate has been the Conservatives displaying synthetic outrage that we dare to remove the influence of hereditary peers before proceeding to establish the final shape of the new Chamber. The reason for doing so is simple: we should not allow 760 families, above the many millions in this country, to play a key role in determining what will replace them. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The history books are littered with the problems of democratically elected Governments who have sought to reform the House of Lords. It is only in the past 100 years that the House of Commons has even managed to establish any dominance. <i>[Interruption.]</i>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para0">The Reform Act of 1832 was passed by the Lords at the third attempt, after riots nationwide provoked by the refusal to accept the reforms, and only then because the Lords feared a revolution. That Act did not even introduce universal suffrage--far from it--but it enfranchised one in five of the male population and brought about a redistribution of power that proved irreversible. The landed gentry conceded power to save their skins. What a noble principle.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para1">The same happened with the Parliament Act 1911. Having defeated the Asquith Government's Budgets, the Lords finally conceded the limitation of their powers to block legislation for two years only after a general election and the threat of the creation of 500 new life peers to dilute their reactionary power. Again, reform was accepted only to salvage the bulk of their power and position. Such is the influence of those 760 families that only in 1949, under a Labour Government, were their delaying powers finally limited to one year.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para2">The battle to defend the entrenched power of the hereditary peerage, with its inbuilt Conservative majority, is not an honourable one. As we mark its passing, history should record its finer moments. The poll tax would not <P>

have been introduced in its final form, but for the peers' votes. Nor would rail privatisation. Those are hardly great victories of the people, nor are they the conscience of the nation holding Governments of all persuasions in check. Tory Administrations were defeated in the House of Lords just over 13 times on average per Parliament, but the Wilson-Callaghan Labour Government were defeated more than 68 times a Session. Nor do the Lords respect election mandates. This Government have a huge mandate and a manifesto of considerable detail, but that has not stopped the House of Lords defeating the Blair Government 33 times in the first Session, including halting the passage of one Bill altogether.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para3">It is little wonder that we believe that it would be wrong in principle and reactionary in practice to allow those 760 families unduly to influence the shape of the second Chamber. However, there is a further dimension. A composite Bill that included abolition of the hereditary principle plus consideration of the new structure would risk one element overshadowing the other or neither being given the time or detailed consideration that they both deserve. Done systematically and carefully, the two-stage approach will ensure a full and detailed debate on the merits of reform.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para4">The reality is today's decisive step. The boldest measure of British constitutional reform for centuries, it will free up thinking and move the debate forward. The Tories will no longer be able to call on their slumbering squirearchy to attempt to thwart an elected Labour Government. That is what they tried to do over handgun reform and the national minimum wage. They called on the same people to defend privilege as were exemplified in the assisted places scheme. There will be a more positive, forward-looking debate after the royal commission reports. Over the coming weeks, we can focus on the issue that is at the heart of this long-overdue reform.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para5">We sat through the debate yesterday, waiting for Conservatives to defend the rights of hereditary peers. What we witnessed was Conservatism in confusion: one after another, Conservative Members proclaimed support for clause 1, which provides for the exclusion of the hereditary peers. Nowadays, it must be compulsory for Conservatives to carry in their pockets two versions of every policy. The Tories used to be defenders of an age-old constitution which--supposedly--served the country well for centuries. Suddenly, they are ditching their allies among the landed gentry.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para6">What a disappointment. Where is that Conservative backbone, the stiff upper lip? Yesterday, the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) talked about the Alamo; I suggest that we are witnessing Hague's last stand. The Conservatives are adrift, rudderless and leaderless. Not so long ago, they condemned the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly: suddenly, over the weekend, they began saying, "We're going to make it work, we're going to make it happen." The reason is that they are having to follow this Government's lead in supporting modern reform of our institutions.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para7">How many more about-turns will we see when the Government prove the Conservatives wrong and show that there will be a sincere and full debate on reform of the House of Lords?

<P>
<a name="90202-29_spnew2"><B> Mr. Andrew Tyrie  (Chichester):</B> 
 I shall take up only one point from the speech of the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint). That is the suggestion that Conservatives are in deep disarray over House of Lords reform, in contrast to the complete unity displayed by other parties. In fact, today we have heard differences of opinion from all around the House. There have been both convinced unicameralist and convinced bicameralist speeches from Labour Members, and something of the same has been evident among Conservative Members as well. It is important that we, as a Parliament, grasp that the issue is not and should not be entirely party political. If possible, we must think through the matter in a somewhat bipartisan manner.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para10">In that respect, the White Paper is a very depressing document for all who believe in checks and balances in the constitution. It does not seek to improve the House of Lords, and pays no more than lip service to bicameralism. If we are to have a bicameral system, we must have two things.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para11">First, the composition of the system must be legitimate enough for it to feel able to exercise its powers. At present, we live in an age of virtual unicameralism, because the House of Lords does not feel capable of exercising the powers that it has. Secondly, a second Chamber must have sufficient powers to enable it to make the House of Commons think again on major legislation.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para12">The White Paper drags its feet on both. Throughout, the subtext is that stage 1 will do. Stage 1 is described as "self-contained" and not dependent on "further reform"--an echo of the wording in the Government's election manifesto.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para13">The White Paper goes further. On page 27, it describes the reform as a "stand-alone" change. There is little commitment to enhancing democratic legitimacy. The underlying theme is one of keeping the Lords a long way from the voters. The White Paper seems to prefer retaining the biggest possible appointed element, implying that, if there must be a democratic element, it should be elected as indirectly as possible.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para14">I believe that such a House of Lords would not have the confidence to take on the House of Commons. Maybe, just maybe, it would, as the right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) suggested. To protect itself against the unlikely event of the House of Lords acquiring some legitimacy--by the removal of the hereditary peers and by more quango appointments--the Government have guarded their flank. The White Paper clearly sets out, mostly on pages 40 and 41, their determination to trim the powers of the Lords further in major ways.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 817</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-29_para15">First, there is a clear statement of the Government's intention to put into a more legal form some conventions by which the peers have traditionally operated self-limitation of their powers. The most important of those is the Salisbury doctrine, but no reference is made to the fact that that doctrine was devised as a response to the inbuilt Tory majority that Labour is committed to removing. Once rough parity is achieved between the parties, logic says that the Salisbury doctrine should fall away. To set it in legal form, therefore, would be not to continue as we are, and greatly to circumscribe what the Lords may do. That would gravely weaken the Lords, whatever that House's composition.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para16">The power of delay, too, is crucial. It is not commonly appreciated that the delaying power may already be under threat from the proposal of the Select Committee on Modernisation of the House of Commons to enable legislation to be carried over from one Session to another. At present, that proposal will be implemented only with the agreement of both Houses. However, if over time the presumption is established that Bills can normally be carried over, and if that presumption finds its way into Standing Orders, the one-year delaying power of the Lords will have its teeth drawn almost completely.
<P>

<a name="90202-29_para17">At present, the Lords can impose an obligation on the Government to move legislation from one session to the next. That power, with all the consequent problems for rearrangement of the next Session that it entails, is the one serious power of the House of Lords. It would go.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-30_spnew0"><B> Mr. Sheldon: </B> 
 The hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that there is nothing to prevent the Government from introducing further legislation to limit the powers of the House of Lords. However, anyone who assumes that stage 1 and stage 2 will be followed by further legislation on the powers of the House of Lords is assuming that there will be a terrific amount of legislation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-30_spnew1"><B> Mr. Tyrie: </B> 
 The right hon. Gentleman seems to imply that the powers of the House of Lords can only be reduced. I am suggesting that that may not be so. It may be sensible to remain in a bicameral world in which there is a balance of power between the two Houses. The House of Commons should have the last word, but the House of Lords might retain substantial powers. I do not see the strength of the right hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para0">Even if I am wrong, and the Modernisation Committee's proposal does not develop as I have suggested, the Government do not want to take any risks. They do not rely on the Modernisation Committee's proposal alone to weaken the House of Lords. They have made it clear that they are contemplating reducing the delaying power to less than a year in any case. That would draw the teeth of the remaining powers of the House of Lords virtually completely.

<a name="90202-30_para1">I do not know whether Labour Members think that sensible. Do they think that the Lords should be left with no practical delaying power at all?

Benches of which I have already spoken. The White Paper sometimes argues for bicameralism, but it slips occasionally into unicameralism, paying lip service to the mutterings that we can hear from some Labour Members.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para2">Just in case the combination of removing the hereditaries and creating a quango, plus a reduction in the powers of the House of Lords, might lead the royal commission to speak up, suggesting that the Lords' powers should be preserved or even enhanced--which I would favour--the Government have virtually removed the question of powers from the remit of the commission. The last thing that Labour wants is any public debate about Lords' powers. You do not need to take my word for it, Mr. Deputy Speaker. In an interview just the other day, Baroness Jay said that reforming the powers of the Lords
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is not the kind of discussion that is most appropriately held in public."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-30_para3">
Lest we be in any doubt about the Government's approach to powers, Baroness Jay made it clear in her answer to Lord Rodgers in the other place on the day of the statement--I went to another place to hear it. Referring to the text of the White Paper, she said of the royal commission's remit:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"we were careful not to open up the rather difficult area of powers".--[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 20 January 1999; Vol. 596, c. 591.]
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-30_para4">
In other words, when it comes to Lords' powers, the royal commission should keep out.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para5">It is becoming clearer now--if it was not before--that Labour never intended to do anything more than abolish the hereditaries. It has been forced away from that course and into establishing a royal commission. However, the Government have no idea what they want in stage 2--in fact, they would rather not have stage 2. If they go any further than stage 1, they will want just a "little Bill" to reduce the powers of the Lords further.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para6">An important choice of fundamental constitutional significance is now facing the House. It is about the balance between the Executive and Parliament. I favour a strong Executive: I do not want checks and balances to lead to immobilism. However, I want an Executive that is subject to thorough scrutiny by Parliament. I believe that, for a country such as ours, bicameralism offers the best chance of delivering that scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para7">It would be all too easy to allow Labour's proposals to pass through under the guise of Labour doublespeak about increased democracy. The subtext of this debate is that many Commoners--including some of my hon. Friends--quietly like the idea of weakening the power of the Lords. Some hon. Members are convinced abolitionists and unicameralists, as Labour has been for so much of its history. However, I urge my fellow parliamentarians not to lose sight of the bigger picture. Britain is being governed by an over-mighty Executive and a supine Parliament. I have not met any new Members of Parliament on either side of the House who believe that serious scrutiny of the Government--

 I am sorry, but there are only a few minutes left.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 819</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-30_para8">I have not met anyone on either side who thinks that serious scrutiny of the Government is occurring in Standing Committees--still less on the Floor of the House. Secondary legislation floods through on the nod. The Government do not bother to announce anything in the Chamber: it is all done beforehand in the media. They did not even bother to announce the establishment of the royal commission here: that was done via a leak to <i>The Observer</i>. Some Ministers do not bother to answer letters for months at a time. I have kept a record of them--although one of the worst miscreants has lost his job. I sometimes get the impression that the Prime Minister can barely contain his disdain for this place: he believes it to be completely irrelevant.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para9">However, I do not want to make an entirely party political point. The power of this place over the Executive has been declining for a long time, with the more than doubling in the payroll vote since the war; with the changes in party structure that have left the Whips dominant and all but wiped out the independent Back Bencher; and, above all, with the development of Standing Orders that give precedence to Government business over all other business.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para10">As parliamentarians, we should have an interest in ensuring that some scrutiny takes place. Even if keeping the Whips happy and the hope of promotion to the Front Bench is a deterrent at times, we owe it to our constituents to make the effort to act as parliamentarians have acted before us. I believe that it would be a terrible mistake for this place to derive too much satisfaction from the emasculation of the other place which this Bill threatens.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para11">As a debating Chamber, we must not try to go it alone. That is pretty much what Labour is proposing under the guise of this White Paper, which uses words such as "modern" and "new". We may be left without a second Chamber worthy of the name whose composition gives it little or no legitimacy and whose powers have been eroded and further eroded. That is why the Bill is so pernicious and why I will vote against it tonight.

<a name="90202-30_spnew6"><B> Sir Patrick Cormack  (South Staffordshire):</B> 
 We have had a remarkable two days of debate, with 37 speeches from Back Benchers. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House will forgive me if I decline to give way during my speech: I apologise for that, but the need to refer to many of the speeches made gives me little time for anything else, and the Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office and I cut down our time so that as many Back Benchers as possible could speak.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para12">As I listened to the 37 speeches, I thought of the Heinz 57 varieties, for we have heard 37 different accounts of how the second Chamber should be reformed. There have been some magical moments: for me, one of the most magical occurred less than half an hour ago, when the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) announced in an intervention that he was a descendant of Oliver Cromwell--the first hereditary Lord Protector.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para13">My right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath), the Father of the House, made an extraordinary, splendid and spirited speech, in which he explained that he had not really been a lord of creation, having created only 48 peers, compared with the 715 created by his successors. Perhaps that explains a great deal. We heard the re-maiden speech of the right <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 820</B></P>
hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), who announced that he had been the father of the royal commission. He made the immortal remark that, because of what had been done to the constitution by the Government's ill-thought-out devolution proposals, we had to find some much-needed glue; and perhaps that could be provided by a reconstituted House of Lords.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para14">My right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), another former Prime Minister, made a fine speech in which he expressed his concern about the fact that 700 years of parliamentary evolution should be dispatched in only a few months under the unrealistically tight timetable given to the royal commission. An interesting aspect of his speech is that it was the speech of a true parliamentarian, as was the magnificent speech made yesterday by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn). I might not agree with everything the right hon. Gentleman says, but every time he speaks in the House, by Jove, he is worth listening to.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para15">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) saw virtue in simplicity--well, I suppose that is appropriate sometimes. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) was somewhat dismissive of the House of Lords, but pleasantly eloquent about some of its Members. The hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) was introduced, in a memorable bon mot, as Mr. Marshall Hall. In a remarkable speech, he suggested that what was needed were bricklayers down the Corridor. Having read my papers, I know that the hon. Gentleman is a great expert on building--no doubt he wants to leave that remarkable underground edifice to someone when he goes.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para16">My hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) made a moving speech--indeed, he always speaks with considerable passion and great conviction. Announcing himself--perhaps slightly improbably--as a disciple of Tom Payne, he declared that it was essential that we should have an effective second Chamber, and that that meant an elected second Chamber. I must apologise to the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith), for hers is the only one of today's speeches that I did not hear. She was enthusiastic in her support for the Bill.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para17">My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) made a fine speech, in which he quoted Baroness Jay on the modernisation of Government and pointed out that, in saying that, she gave the game away. The right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon), who was an opponent of the previous scheme for Lords reform, explained that that measure was defeated in 14 days--only twice as long as it took the Almighty to create the world. He argued effectively for a longer time span for the royal commission to do its work.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para18">My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) took us on a Cook's tour of his own lineage. With the inimitable wit that he always brings to his speeches, he contrasted the deliberation that took place on the reform of local government in part of London with the breakneck speech with which the Government propose to force through this constitutional reform.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para19">The hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside(Mrs. Ellman) wants the second Chamber to be constituted as a large regional assembly. My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) is opposed to the hereditary principle, but pointed out, also with <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 821</B></P>
considerable eloquence, that the House of Lords works. He wants to be persuaded that whatever replaces it will be effective.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para20">The hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) made an effective speech, but seemed to spend half his time attacking arguments that had not been made by Conservative Members. He was trying to suggest that there had been a passionate defence of the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords. I have yet to hear that defence made in this debate.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para21">That point certainly was not made by, for example, my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), who pointed out that he has received few letters from his constituents about House of Lords reform. I ask any hon. Member present who has received more than 100 letters about that in the past two years to put up his or her hand. I do not think that a single hand will go up. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) raised his hand. By Jove, they talk of little else in Pendle. Most of our constituents--I am sure that yours are no exception, Mr. Deputy Speaker--are interested in schools, hospitals and jobs, and are not moved to write to us to demand House of Lords reform.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para22">The hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) waited a long time to speak and gave a long speech, which she ended with an extraordinary peroration on what she called the "slumbering squirearchy". I have not seen any of them around recently.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para23">The starting point for any discussion about the future of the second Chamber should not be the composition of the Chamber or even its powers, but the type of constitution that we want in the United Kingdom. With all its many imperfections, our system, more than any other on offer, delivers accountability on the part of Government. One identifiable body--the party in government--is responsible for public policy, and electors can hold it to account at the next general election. We have to accept that that core attribute would be challenged if power were fragmented among other bodies. An inevitable consequence of electing more layers of government is what Lord Norton has called the paradox of accountability: the more elected bodies there are, the less accountable each becomes, because electors do not know whom to hold to account.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para24">It can be convincingly argued that, if we are to retain that core attribute of our Westminster system, this Chamber must remain the sole directly elected Chamber. The role of the second Chamber in our present system is to be complementary to this Chamber, not competing and not subservient. The present House of Lords has proved, as the White Paper rather grudgingly admits, a diligent body of scrutiny, revision and debate. Those features surely need to be retained and, if possible, strengthened.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para25">That should be the starting point for any discussion about the future of the House of Lords. The Government are looking down the wrong end of the telescope. The constitution has to be looked at in the round. We have to consider how the different parts relate to one another, and appreciate that simply changing one part without seeing it in the context of the whole damages all the other parts and can thus undermine the whole.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para26">The White Paper is called "Modernising Parliament: Reforming the House of Lords", but it is not about modernising Parliament. Parliament, as an institution, gets <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 822</B></P>
only a cursory mention at the beginning. The White Paper has merits as a scene-setting options paper, but nowhere does it explain the Government's constitutional aims. No one, least of all the Government, seems to know what those are. The Bill contains a simple proposition to remove, but there is no suggestion of what should replace what is being removed. We should examine the Bill's effects, and consider what they are likely to be on the working of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para27">According to the Government, hereditary peers rarely turn up in the House of Lords, and the House of Lords can do very well without them. The noble Baroness Jay said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government have always made it clear that they appreciate the contribution which individual hereditary peers can make to the work of the House of Lords. However, the Government are also clear that much of the work of the House is done by life peers, and that the House will continue to function perfectly well after the hereditary peers have left."--[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>,17 December 1998; Vol. 595, c. <i>171</i>.]
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-30_para28">
Paragraph 27 of the explanatory notes to the Bill states that the financial effects of the Bill "will be negligible". It says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Bill would reduce the size of the House of Lords, but since many of those who will be removed attend very rarely, there will not be any significant savings on Peers' expenses and daily allowances."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-30_para29">
According to the White Paper,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Only 40 per cent. of Life Peers attended more than two thirds of the House's sessions and 34 per cent. attended less than one third. The equivalent figures for Hereditary Peers are 20 per cent. and 67 per cent."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-30_para30">Those statements reveal a very odd attitude towards the contribution of hereditary peers. Given the number of hereditary peers, 20 per cent. of them amounts to 150 peers, and 40 per cent. of life peers is approximately 200. In other words, hereditary peers comprise more than 40 per cent. of the frequent attenders. The present House of Lords is effective as a scrutinising and debating Chamber because most life peers, and a fair number of the hereditaries, are experts and have experience in their respective fields. If almost half the very active membership were removed, a notable burden of extra work would have to be carried by life peers.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para31">There is no way round such a problem, other than the Weatherill amendment, which should be put on the face of the Bill immediately. However, the fact remains that the Government have given no sustained thought to the consequences of removing hereditary peers. If they have given no thought to the consequences of stage 1, it is hardly surprising that they have given less to stage 2.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para32">Let us be clear; we are not debating the hereditary principle as such. <i>[Interruption.]</i> All those who support a constitutional monarchy accept that. We are debating the practice of allowing hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords. We, as a party, do not seek to defend that automatic right. For my part, I sought to introduce a private Member's Bill 15 years ago to limit that right and to do away with the built-in majority in the upper House. We are content to accept the Weatherill proposals, but object most strongly to the way in which the Government have lurched from slogan to expedient, motivated by vindictiveness and a wilful refusal to recognise that there are men and women in the House of Lords who have given of their time and talents in the public service.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para33">Having stated their aim to remove such people, the Government should have at that point produced a White Paper and established a royal commission.<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 823</B></P>
We should--and could--have had this debate 18 months ago. The royal commission, without being unduly rushed, could have reported by now. There is a story of Churchill contemptuously dismissing the pudding presented to him at a great banquet by saying,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Take it away; it has no theme."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90202-30_para34">
The Government's constitutional policy has no theme. Even now, let us try to get things right rather than playing ducks and drakes with the constitution. What we decide over the next couple of years must be able to stand the test of time. So, whatever proposals emerge from the royal commission must be subject to proper and detailed scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para35">I shall propose a constructive programme of sensible reform. If the Government accept a Weatherill-type amendment in this place, consider carefully other amendments that we shall table in a constructive spirit, give the royal commission until summer 2000 to report, and allow proper time for consideration of the proposals in both Houses and in the country, there is no reason why we should not be able to agree on a form of second Chamber, which could come into being at the beginning of the next Parliament.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para36">However, if we are to reach the desired conclusion, the Government must take particular care over the appointment of that commission. I urge the Minister to say this evening that the commission will be appointed on the basis of consultation, and that it will include representatives from both sides of this House, nominated by the parties to which they belong.
<P>

<a name="90202-30_para37">If we can find that basis of consensus, all is perhaps not lost. At present, this is a rag-bag of a mean little Bill, and I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against it.

<a name="90202-31_para1">The debate has been good-humoured in the main, thoughtful at times, and occasionally passionate. Some criticisms have been made of the fact that no thanks have been given to the Lords for their services over the years. At the risk of offending one or two--only one or two--of my colleagues, I am prepared to put that right now. Many, many Lords have given unstinting time, effort and commitment; I have no hesitation in saying that. I value their service over a long period. That, however, does not justify the system. Those peers are making the best of a bad job.

<P>

<a name="90202-31_para3">There were several important themes to the debate. First, I am struck by the consensus across the House on the need for change. Almost without exception, hon. Members have advocated change. Some have been more radical in their approach. Yesterday, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire(Sir N. Lyell) and the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) made interesting suggestions on the composition of the second Chamber. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) spelled out clearly--we heard him--his position on the hereditary peers.

Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Wells) and my hon.and learned Friend the Member for Medway(Mr. Marshall-Andrews) advocated the case for a single Chamber. I was interested to hear the Father of the House, the former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath), speak tonight about the need for an elected Chamber. For him, the time had come for change.
<P>

<a name="90202-31_para5">The overwhelming opinion of the House is that the hereditary principle cannot be defended any longer. I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Hope) for vigorously questioning hon. Members on that point. It reminded me of the accusation, "When did you last see your father?" In this case, the question was, "Do you sign up to clause 1?", which states:

<P>

<a name="90202-31_para14">What do the Opposition say about the pace of change? The hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir P.

<a name="90202-31_para17">The royal commission has a demanding timetable. It has an independent chairman, a fact that, on 20 January, was welcomed by the Opposition. Lord Wakeham is currently consulting about the membership of the commission. I hope that we can establish a commission that meets the needs of all parties in this House.
<P>

<a name="90202-31_para18">It is simply not true that this issue is being kicked into the long grass. We will be judged on what we achieve, but I believe that the eventual endgame will be quicker than the pessimists forecast. Our aim is to make the position clear before the general election.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 826</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-31_para19">I suspect, however, that the Opposition are keen not to kick the issue into the long grass, but to kick it into the jungle and put a palisade around it. That is the traditional device of those who have opposed change over the years. The idea is to ask more and more questions, to make life more difficult, to go for a one-stage solution, to argue for the big bang and, at the end of the day, to delay and delay until nothing is happening.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-31_spnew6"><B> Mr. Grieve: </B> 
 Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-31_spnew7"><B> Mr. Tipping: </B> 
 No.
<P>

<a name="90202-31_para20">This time, that simply will not work. This is a short, simple, elegant Bill, which is already acting as a catalyst for change in the thinking of Opposition Members. The debate is moving on, not with a big bang, but in the British tradition of evolutionary change, one step at a time and adapting to survive.
<P>

<a name="90202-31_para21">The Opposition made a lot of noise about the need to hold the Executive to account. I am surprised that they cannot see for themselves that that is an implicit criticism of their own performance in the House since the general election. At least the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) recognised that. Rather than discussing a big issue and a broader vision, Opposition Members talk about the trivia--the trips and the accommodation. They are not interested in modernising Britain.
<P>

<a name="90202-31_para22">That leads me to the Opposition's wider accusation that the second Chamber will be a quango packed with the Prime Minister's placemen and placewomen. We have been fortunate today in hearing from two former Prime Ministers. The right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup was certainly sparing with his appointments. I thought that was due to principle, until he told us this evening that, for every appointment he made, he disappointed nine other people. The right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) made it clear that he, too, had made appointments--160, of whom 75 were Conservatives, 40 Labour and 17 Liberal Democrats. He packed the upper House with his own people. He argued that the life peers were not independent, but 119 Cross Benchers are life peers--more than 20 per cent. of the total number.
<P>

<a name="90202-31_para23">The current Prime Minister has made it clear that he will establish an appointments commission on Nolan lines. He will give up power; he will not block the appointments of other party leaders. What is more, we have said in our White Paper that we will seek broad parity between parties in the other place. No one has concentrated on that. Winding up the debate, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire did not make it clear whether that principle, for which the Tories have stood since 1911, still obtained.
<P>

<a name="90202-31_para24">Opening the debate, my right hon. Friend the President of the Council described the Bill as a simple solution, designed to remedy a state that is broken and indefensible. After 88 years of debate on the hereditary element of the House of Lords, the Bill provides an agenda for action. It constitutes another step towards the modernisation of Parliament and Britain. It is time to stop looking at the old--the past--and to fix our sights on the future.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 827</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-31_para25">The time has finally come to modernise the House of Lords. We have a chance to make it more representative--a chance to build a new future. After years of indecision and confusion, the Bill provides a way forward. The time has come to face the challenge; the time has come to make the change.
<P>

<a name="90202-31_para26"><i>Question put</i>, That the amendment be made:--

In the light of the <i>Evening Standard</i> report last week, claiming that up to 20 public libraries are to close in London alone, it is a timely debate, especially as we are celebrating the national year of reading.
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para3">Going to the library is, after visiting the pub, eating out, driving for pleasure and eating at a fast-food chain, the fifth most popular pastime in the United Kingdom. There are four types of library in use in the United Kingdom. There are our six great deposit libraries, led by the British library, which are the envy of the world; the academic libraries in our universities, hospitals and colleges, which are seriously underfunded; school libraries, on which I shall dwell at length shortly; and our public libraries, which are under threat everywhere.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-34_spnew1"><B> Ms Linda Perham  (Ilford, North):</B> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. As he says, it is our first debate on libraries. I want to make a contribution as chair of the new all-party group on libraries and as a professionally qualified librarian. I welcome the Government's declared commitment--

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-34_spmin0"><B>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </B> 
 Order. I understand that the hon. Lady wants to contribute to the debate at a later stage. She cannot make a speech within the hon. Gentleman's speech. It will be more appropriate if she makes a short contribution when he has completed his speech.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-34_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
 There are thousands of libraries, such as the wonderful cricket library at Lord's, the library at the British Film Institute, where I dwelt at length when I was writing my book "Wisecracks from the Movies", and the one at Windsor castle.
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para4">Libraries come under two Departments, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Education and Employment. In the joined-up government that we are constantly being told is happening, I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend the Minister's response on what initiatives he has undertaken with my hon. Friend the Minister for School Standards regarding school libraries.
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para5">The British library is one of the six legal deposit libraries in the United Kingdom and Ireland, dating back to an Act of 1911. The others are Oxford, Cambridge and the national libraries of Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The Irish national library is in Dublin, but there is no national library of Northern Ireland, which is surely an oversight. Perhaps in the new mood that exists there, the deposit library at Trinity college, Dublin, could open a digital version at Queen's university, Belfast, or simply plug itself into an on-line British library.
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para6">The British library needs to be redefined for the21st century. It needs to be the focus for the whole library system, not only in the United Kingdom but in our <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 836</B></P>
embassies and high commissions and, most important, in our British Council offices. It needs a private finance initiative to finance the digital library of the future, so that we can all visit it from the comfort of our homes. It also needs to be the lead player in the national grid for learning and the university for industry. Why are we trying to reinvent the wheel? The British library should be the centre of our library policy, and an all-enveloping technology broad-band hub should be built at St. Pancras that lays the architecture down to link every academic library and, as important, every school and every public library.
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para7">As for our school libraries, it is amazing that no regulations exist that lay down how much money schools should spend on library books per student. Nor is there a law that lays down how large a given school library should be. At least, that is the case in England and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the recommendation is that school libraries should have spaces of 40 sq m. How generous! In the United Kingdom, however, there is no ring-fence regulation that says that schools should spend a minimum amount on books. That is absurd.
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para8">I have visited 33 of the 44 school libraries in my constituency and most of the schools have no full-time librarians. Worse, two libraries are in corridors and, worse still, some of the books are 20 or 30 years old. Other schools in my constituency, thanks to parent-teacher support, have superb libraries. As libraries go on line, it will be the well-off primary and secondary schools that have suites of 60 computers and ISDN lines. The policy is exclusive, not inclusive, and it is unfair. In the information technology world, we talk of the information rich and the information poor, and some of my schools have been information poor for most of this century.
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para9">Figures released recently show that provision for school library services fell in the United Kingdom from &#163;2.17 per pupil in 1994-95 to &#163;1.98 in 1996-97, with more than 30 per cent. of secondary schools no longer having a full or part-time librarian. Ofsted should be charged with providing a report on the state of information-rich and information-poor schools, especially with regard to the libraries, library books, computers, internet costs and online support.
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para10">In public libraries, the situation is critical. I shall give a quick overview of what is happening in the United Kingdom today. Barnsley plans to close 23 branch libraries. Surrey is reported to be closing 16 branch libraries and Haringey may close two or three. Kingston upon Thames intends to cut the schools library service. Islington may cut its library service so that only five open at the weekends. However, 10 years ago, more than 200 public libraries opened for 60 hours or more. Today, the number of libraries open for 60 hours a week has declined by 49 per cent. There are none open for 60 hours a week in Wales or Northern Ireland and only 43 in Scotland. The number open for 45 to 60 hours has declined by 19 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para11">A Sheffield university questionnaire found that 48 per cent. of the local authorities which replied had closed libraries in the past 10 years. Some 74 per cent. had reduced opening hours and 69 per cent. had closed for financial reasons. We should compare those figures with the Government's statement of their intention to build a public library network connecting all 4,000 public, but not school, libraries by 2002. That simply does not add up to a coherent, joined-up strategy for libraries for the<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 837</B></P>
21st century and I await my hon. Friend the Minister's response with much interest. I wish to persuade my hon. Friend the Minister to ensure that public libraries open all day on Saturday and Sunday, so that those children from information-poor homes can have access to books and the internet.
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para12">I am passionate about libraries because it was through them that I came to understand the value of literature. Later, I was a publishing director at William Heinemann. As a councillor in Haringey, I sat on the leisure committee and learned what a rip-off the buying procedures for library books were. That issue needs attention. if amazon.com or amazon.co.uk can produce a website with 1 million or 2 million books to buy, why can we not produce the same service off the back of the technology to buy library and school books?
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para13">As we face the 21st century, I wish to ask my hon. Friend the Minister a favour. Will he lean on the new opportunities fund officials to pre-select the information-poor areas in our communities to make a pre-emptive strike for the homework club funds and to insist that they are placed in local schools or public libraries?
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para14">Finally, I shall quote from Frances Hendrix, who said:
<P>

<a name="90202-34_spnew3"><B> Ms Linda Perham  (Ilford, North):</B> 
 I want to make just a brief contribution. As I said in my intervention, I am a professionally qualified librarian and I chair the recently formed all-party group on libraries. I welcome the Government's declared commitment to libraries as the cornerstones of their communities and their aim to deliver better education services and to improve reading and literacy standards. I especially welcome the plans embodied in the document "New Library: The People's Network".
<P>

<a name="90202-34_para15">However, like my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt), I am worried about the continuing problems with libraries. Local authorities are reducing book funds and opening hours, and even closing libraries. I join my hon. Friend in urging the Minister to be alert to the anxiety about that among members of the public and of the profession.

<a name="90202-35_spmin0"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport   (Mr. Alan Howarth): </B> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt) on securing this debate. His commitment to reading, to books and to the part that books can play in the life of our society is well known in the House. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Ms Perham), who spoke from her background of professional knowledge. I welcome very much holding a debate in the House on the extremely important subject of libraries.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para0">The Government attach great importance to libraries. They are valued institutions in their own right, and they contribute to the Government's objectives in many ways. <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 838</B></P>
They underpin education by providing essential support for children, students and lifelong learners. They enhance public access to the world's store of knowledge and information. They combat social exclusion by helping to bridge the gap between those who can afford access to information and those who cannot. Increasingly, they have a role to play in the modernisation and delivery of public services.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para1">Above all, our libraries are highly respected and cherished by the public, who use them a great deal. I can think of few other public services to which nearly 60 per cent. of the population subscribe. More than 423 million book issues are made each year in England--nearly nine for every man, woman and child. It is that bond with individual users and communities that represents the sector's major strength, and long may it remain.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para2">Libraries fulfil many roles in delivering economic and social benefits to communities. They are broadly based organisations, delivering a multi-faceted range of services to their members.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para3">The Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 requires local authorities in England to provide comprehensive and efficient library services and makes it the duty of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to ensure that they do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-35_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Russell  (Colchester):</B> 
 Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-35_spnew1"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to carry on.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para4">My Department takes that duty very seriously, but the key players in the delivery of public library services, as the legislation makes clear, are the local authorities that are responsible for running them. Decisions about the delivery of the library service on the ground, including decisions about opening hours, are for local authorities to make, rather than for the Government. However, I urge authorities to have proper regard to their statutory responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para5">The Government's role is to provide a positive policy framework, within which the service can operate and thrive at the local level. Through the use of annual library plans, we will encourage library authorities to focus attention on various areas of their services, such as current Government initiatives, to ensure that our policy is understood and acted on nationally. We are also, of course, looking to raise standards across the board through the establishment of a new museums, libraries and archives council, and improved arrangements for library service co-ordination and representation at a regional level.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para6">My hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey referred to libraries in schools. He will appreciate that they are not my direct responsibility, but I take a close interest in education matters and I can assure him that I work closely with my colleagues at the Department for Education and Employment. The ministerial teams of that Department and mine are developing a shared agenda, as my hon. Friend would wish us to do. My Department played a role in ensuring that school library services were properly taken account of in the DFEE's "Fair funding" proposals.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para7">Libraries have a major role to play in delivering educational objectives, particularly for life-long learning. They provide ready and free access to the nation's <P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 839</B></P>
storehouse of knowledge and information, and theyallow people of all ages the opportunity to maximise their educational opportunities. Libraries are particularly effective in providing access to learning for those who may be less comfortable in a more traditional or formal learning setting.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-35_spnew2"><B> Mr. Russell: </B> 
 Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-35_spnew3"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me for not doing so, but I have too little time.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para8">Libraries allow learners to set the pace and direction of their own learning. I have referred before to our public libraries as street-corner universities. To ensure that they play a central role in delivering educational services, the Government announced in April 1998 the target of connecting all public libraries to the national grid for learning by 2002 via the public library information technology network.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para9">The development of that IT network is a key Government priority. The new opportunities fund, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend, is providing &#163;20 million for information and communicating technology training of library staff, and &#163;50 million for creating digitised content. Our document, "New Links for the Lottery", published on 27 November 1998 proposes further funding to the network via a new opportunities fund stream to support lifelong learning. We are considering responses to our consultation on those proposals.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para10">My hon. Friend suggested that school libraries were left out of our plans for the network. I assure him that that is not the case. The public libraries network will, as he said, link to the national grid for learning by 2002, producing a network that will link schools--whose libraries will be central--with public libraries and other learning institutions. School librarians will be trained to support the use of the network as part of the new opportunities fund's provision for training teachers and library staff.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para11">My hon. Friend suggested that the British library should be the centre of the network. The British library is a centre of excellence, which provides a specialised service to scholars and information seekers from around the world. That is a vital service, but it is a different service from that envisaged for the public library network. The British library will have a role to play in making available its special collections and national treasures. However, it would not be right to charge it with overseeing the provision of the network.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para12">The Government accept that strategic leadership will be needed to ensure that the libraries sector achieves its full potential for involvement in the learning society, and to direct the creation of the public library network. That is why our recent departmental review proposed the creation of a new body--the museums, libraries and archives council--to provide strategic leadership for the whole sector. Meanwhile, we are strengthening the role of the Library and Information Commission, allowing the British library to focus better on activities more central to its role as the national library. The commission has, as my hon. Friend will know, been instrumental in suggesting how the public library network should be designed and implemented, and it will continue to play the central strategic role that my hon. Friend envisaged for the British library.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 840</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-35_para13">My hon. Friend mentioned the British library's digital library project. The British library is continuing to develop plans to achieve a digital capability, and I agree that that will be important in future. The private finance initiative is not the only possible route for that. The British library is exploring alternative solutions since negotiations for a public-private finance project did not produce an acceptable solution.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para14">My hon. Friend mentioned the importance of the legal deposit libraries. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 17 December our plans for the way forward on legal deposits in the light of our consideration of the report of the independent working group chaired by Sir Anthony Kenny. A copy of that report has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para15">Because of concerns about the absence from our national published archive of non-print publications, which are continuing to increase in number and importance, my right hon. Friend has commissioned a detailed voluntary code of practice for the deposit of electronic publications. However, we have accepted the report's conclusion that a statutory system will be needed in the longer term. As my right hon. Friend announced, we intend to move towards legislation on the basis of a minimum burden on publishers once some necessary additional work on definitions and regulatory impact has been carried out.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para16">My hon. Friend mentioned the lack of a legal deposit library in Northern Ireland and asked about a digital version. My right hon. Friend concluded in January 1998, as a result of responses to the 1997 consultation on legal deposit, that there was almost no support for a new deposit library in Northern Ireland. Therefore, he specifically asked Sir Anthony Kenny's working group to examine the scope for improved access in Northern Ireland to deposited material through IT networking. The report's conclusion was that, if an acceptable method of networking deposited electronic material could be agreed, an access point should be located in Northern Ireland. My right hon. Friend has therefore asked Sir Anthony Kenny to examine the scope for the voluntary code to include a basis for the secure networking of CD-ROMs between the deposit libraries in a way that will satisfy copyright holders.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para17">Important first steps towards the library network and an enhanced role for libraries in providing learning opportunities are already being taken. Libraries are extending the educational services that they offer and developing their appeal to those whose educational opportunities may otherwise be limited. Some 200 library learning centres have already been developed, offering services such as information on training and educational opportunities, including careers guidance; provision of basic skills training; courses aimed at women returners; NVQ training for those wanting to enhance skills; and business skills training aimed at small businesses.
<P>

<a name="90202-35_para18">Many open learning centres have well-established links with local colleges and are able to support distance learning. Most have a wide range of informing and communicating technology--ICT--equipment and software, with staff trained to support open learning. In addition, libraries are also offering after-school clubs, homework centres, IT resource centres, local history websites, specialised facilities for disabled library users, and outreach to housebound users via the mobile library service and laptop PCs is also being offered.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 841</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-35_para19">Libraries are also well placed to play a key role in another of the Government's initiatives to create a learning society in Britain: the university for industry. They are among the organisations taking part in pilot projects for the UFI through the European Adapt funding scheme. The traditional strengths of the library service in promoting reading and literacy have not been neglected, with many libraries participating in imaginative ways in the national year of reading.

<a name="90202-36_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Russell: </B> 
 In the light of those wonderful pronouncements, will the Minister explain to the hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt), who introduced the debate, why there is a catalogue of library closures, reduced opening hours and so on? Perhaps he would also care to comment on the absence from this debate of any representatives of Her Majesty's official Opposition.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202-36_spnew1"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 To an extent, it is the season of rumours and alarmism. It is a period when local authorities are setting their budgets and there is anxiety about their capacity to sustain library services of the desired extent and quality. Those matters are clearly under active consideration in a number of libraries. I counsel the hon. Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell) not to rush to conclude that the rumours that we have heard are necessarily true or will prove to be well founded. We have provided a much better public expenditure settlement for local government than in previous years, and we can see no justification whatever for cutting library services in the present financial climate.
<P>

<a name="90202-36_para0">As I reminded the House, the 1964 Act places a statutory obligation on local authorities to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State requires library authorities to produce annual library plans and we take that responsibility seriously. We shall closely examine what happens: where cuts are rumoured, my officials will inquire of the library authorities concerned what precisely is going on and we shall not be easily satisfied. We shall rigorously require local authorities to justify alterations in strategy that appear to involve reductions in services.
<P>




<B>2 Feb 1999 : Column 842</B></P>

<P>

<a name="90202-36_para1">We recognise that there might be cases of library authorities finding it necessary to rationalise and restructure their services, because we look to them to provide a cost-effective service, which means that the pattern of library services cannot be frozen. Nevertheless, the statutory duty on local authorities remains and we attach great importance to it. I know that local authorities overwhelmingly want to honour their obligation to provide proper library services. I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is also our desire and that we shall act in that respect with great energy, thoroughness and care. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for following my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey in drawing attention to the anxieties that have been expressed. We have all seen the press stories, but I counsel hon. Members not to rush to premature judgment or premature pessimism.
<P>

<a name="90202-36_para2">Public libraries play a crucial role in promoting educational achievement, enhancing public access to knowledge and information, combating social exclusion and modernising the delivery of Government and local authority services. The Government have already committed an additional &#163;80 million to develop library services. We are also considering the possibility of further funding through the lottery to encourage the development of computer technology in libraries. I trust that local authorities will remember that more than 60 per cent. of the adult population are members of public libraries and that libraries are among the most popular, widely used and valued local authority resources.
<P>

<a name="90202-36_para3">One of my roles is to ensure that local authorities continue to meet their statutory obligation to provide a comprehensive and efficient service and I shall continue to pursue that role vigorously. The Government's requirement on local authorities to prepare library plans is a key part of the process. However, I hope that most authorities will have the vision to provide and develop services and that they will want to go beyond the legal minimum in doing so.
