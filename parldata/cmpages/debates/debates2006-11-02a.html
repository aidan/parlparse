because some systems in parts of the country are confusing and people
do not always know exactly what should go into which bin. It is

overall waste, thus reducing costs to councils and council tax payers.
However, no decisions have been made on that in this country. Local
authorities that have introduced those bins have done so because they
constitute the common technology. Only two local authorities that have

that the Conservatives voted against it on Second Reading, which they

problem in towns and cities up and down the country, and it costs local
authorities millions of pounds to clean it off pavements. The new
provisions enable local authorities to levy on-the-spot fines for the
dropping of chewing gum for the first time. In several pilot cities,
where we have worked with local authorities on special education and
publicity schemes on chewing gum, we have seen a 37 per cent. reduction
in chewing gum litter. That shows that things can be done, and I hope
that local authorities will use the powers in the Act not only to clean
up the chewing gum on the streets but to address the other problems to
which the hon. Gentleman referred.</p><a name="subhd_o8"><a name="61102-0003.htm_sbhd1"><a name="06110287000040"><h3 align="center">Inland

fact that with many NHS trusts in deficit, social care is now often
having to replace care in hospital. Councils are having to revise their
eligibility criteria, which means, for example, that some vulnerable
people are going to have to pay more for services such as home care.

of the House will be aware that there has been widespread concern and
anger that Abu Hamza was able to sell and buy property while on remand
and in jail, and while his assets supposedly had been frozen by the
Treasury. He had apparently transferred his assets to his son. Last
week at Treasury questions, the Economic Secretary&#151;following
questions from my hon. Friends the Members for Chipping Barnet

expose a very big loophole in the Government&#146;s legislation? How
was Abu Hamza able to transfer assets to his son when they had been
frozen by the Treasury? Will the Economic Secretary now come to this
House to explain the position and tell the House what the Government
have done to close this
loophole?</p><p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="61102-0004.htm_para10"><a name="06110287000185">Yeldall
Manor is a very effective drug rehabilitation centre in my
constituency. It is facing problems because it is receiving fewer
referrals from local authorities and others, something that is a
problem across the country. Indeed, as the noble Lord Taverne, chairman
of Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Treatment Ltd, said in a recent
letter to <i> The Times</i>:</p><a name="61102-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="06110287000186"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Several units providing

was that local drug action teams have been set targets, but find in
practice that they can meet them most easily and cheaply by maintaining
addicts on methadone or by sending them to short treatment courses that
include day treatment centres, which are often unregulated. Yet recent
research in Scotland has shown that giving methadone to heroin addicts
has a 97 per cent. failure rate. Research has also shown that the
overall reconviction rate for those on drug treatment and testing
orders was 80 per cent. Will the Home Secretary come to the House to
make an urgent statement on the failings in the Government&#146;s
drug treatment
programme?</p><p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="61102-0004.htm_para12"><a name="06110287000188">Finally,
the Leader of the House has always been clear that he expects
Government Ministers to reply in a timely and helpful fashion to

answer he received, effectively, was that the cost would be published
next July and that it was all in accordance with the ministerial code.
In other words, the answer told us precisely nothing. When will the
Government come clean on how much the Deputy Prime Minister is costing
the taxpayer for doing
nothing?</p><p><a name="st_o110"><a name="06110287000189"><b><a name="61102-0004.htm_spnew2"><a name="06110287001368">Mr.

for issuing printed copies of the Stern report were not satisfactory,
and I apologise to the House for that. I wanted to get hold of a hard
copy&#151;not a hard disc copy, but one that could be read on
paper&#151;and I spotted that that was not available in the Vote
Office, as it should have been. Steps have been taken to ensure that
that does not happen again. It is a substantial report and obviously it
is cheaper if colleagues are able to make use of the hard disc or
internet versions. But there are many circumstances in which that is
not convenient and it is accepted that it is a duty of all Government
Departments to make sure that sufficient copies of printed versions of
these reports are placed in the Vote Office before the documents are
published.</p><p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="61102-0004.htm_para13"><a name="06110287000190">I am in

Cabinet Committee on the Olympics. Many speculative stories about the
Olympics appear with great regularity. If my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State for Culture. Media and Sport were to come to this
House to answer each of them, there would be little else she could do.
The truth is that we had a brilliant success in achieving the
nomination for the 2012 Olympics and that preparations for the Olympics
are well advanced and within the plans laid down. If there are going to
be any major and significant changes to the costs already proposed,
announcements will be made in due course to this

give a joint answer on social services and drug rehabilitation. It
strikes me that every week the right hon. Lady reads out a list of
Government activities where our offence is that we should be spending
even more money than we are spending, rather than less. She will cost
the shadow Chancellor, the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr.
Osborne), a huge amount, not least in terms of his credibility, when he
tries to go to the country&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I was
listening to what the right hon. Lady was saying, and I wrote it down
as usual. She will cost him a huge amount in terms of his credibility
when he goes to the country and tries to say that his party will cut
taxes as well. However, we know that it will certainly cut spending, so
it does not lie in her mouth&#151;or any other Conservative
Member&#146;s mouth&#151;to complain about the fact that some
social services departments and some drug rehabilitation centres, which
are operating on a base of very high levels of spending compared with

increased support for drug addicts. It is absolutely right that the

area, should be able to make their own decisions at local level about
what is appropriate. Sometimes methadone is appropriate. Very often,
the use of day treatment centres is appropriate. Sometimes, full-time
residential drug rehabilitation centres are appropriate. Decisions on

only wish that we had received the same full-hearted support when we

that, if sufficient consensus existed, we would be prepared to
introduce a local authority power for admissions to other new faith
schools. I emphasise that it was a power, not a duty. We undertook to
consult the key representatives of the faith communities before
deciding our way forward. Having done that and having listened to the

Muslim community believed that it was unnecessary to legislate. All the
faith communities did not support the amendment, but they were all in
favour of the far more important and profound proposition to place a
duty to promote community cohesion on the governing bodies of all

community cohesion, we mean working towards a society in which there is
a common vision and sense of belonging by all communities; a society in
which the diversity of people&#146;s backgrounds and circumstances is
appreciated and valued; a society in which similar life opportunities

place, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood, was a former chief inspector of
schools and set up the Ofsted model, so we have some experience. We
have full endorsement from Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of

aspects of schools&#146; work that contribute to community cohesion.
However, an explicit reference in legislation will ensure that all
schools will be held to account for their contribution. I have no doubt
that Ofsted&#146;s new focus will highlight the excellent work that
is already taking place in many of our schools through creative and
innovative approaches to, among other things, the curriculum, personal

wish to clarify. We welcome the Lords amendments and have reached the
same conclusion as the Secretary of State: they are a sensible approach
to the role that schools, and particularly faith schools, can play in
the promotion of community cohesion. We should pay tribute to the
efforts of Lord Alton, who put an enormous amount of work into ensuring
that this consensus was created, Baroness Buscombe, Lord Ahmed, Lord
Sutherland and Lord Adonis, who also contributed to the creation of
this consensus. Consensus has been the hallmark of the Bill. The Bill
has reached this stage because the Opposition have been willing to

responsibility by an individual faith group, not as something that
should lead to nationwide legislative requirements on other faith

Secretary of State were able to tell us at the Dispatch Box today
whether, as Lord Adonis suggested in the other place, there will be any
changes in admissions codes. The Secretary of State will know that
there has been some concern about possible changes to the admissions
code. If he envisages any such changes, it would be helpfulif

they might be and what their effect would
be.</p><p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="61102-0007.htm_para16"><a name="06110287000326">We also welcome
the fact that the duty applies to all schools, not just faith schools,
because that recognises that faith is only one of a variety of factors
that we need to take into account. One argument that has impressed me,
as I am sure that it has impressed Members on both sides of the House,
is that faith schools can often achieve high levels of social and
ethnic mix. The Catholic Church has made the point to us that, if
anything, its schools achieve higher levels of ethnic and social mix
than some of the secular schools in the area. That important point
needs to be taken into account.</p><p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="61102-0007.htm_para17"><a name="06110287000327">The Secretary of State referred
to the conversations that he had with representatives of the Muslim
community. Does he agree that one of the big prizes is to attract more
Muslim schools into the maintained sector? It would be welcome if those
Muslim schools that are outside the maintained sector could preserve
their ethos, but at the same time benefit fromthe breadth of
the national curriculum and some of the other obligations that follow
from being in the maintained sector. It would be interesting to hear
from the Secretary of State about that. I had hoped that he would say
more about how the Government were approaching what we understand to be

impossible to think of a child simply as somebody to be fed information
by teachers so that they will go on, at the other end of the machine,

all that is left to promote the idea of community. Both urban and rural
areas are losing facilities such as post offices and pubs, so the
school has an important role to play. In some areas, a number of
schools will serve the whole community and there will be a need for

amendments on which I seek assurances and answers from the Secretary of
State. The first relates to my intervention to ask whether a parent
sending a child to a faith school under the 25 per cent. voluntary
agreement would be able to say, straight-faced, &#147;I want to
withdraw my child from the religious elements of the
education.&#148;</p><p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="61102-0008.htm_para3"><a name="06110287000345">My
hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) believes that
if parents have chosen to send their children to a faith school, it
would be wrong to withdraw the children from religious lessons.
However, parents do not necessarily have a choice. Often, the only
neighbourhood schools, especially at primary level, are faith schools.
If parents want their child to travel only a short distance to school,
they have to send the child to a faith school. The alternative is to
subject the child to a much longer journey each day, which we believe
is undesirable. There is not always a choice, so the Secretary of State
has to explain what guidance he will offer schools on determining their
policies in respect of non-believers at a school where religious
lessons are the
norm.</p><p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="61102-0008.htm_para4"><a name="06110287000346">The second
question is how on earth do we inspect for community cohesion? Which
model of cohesion do we think is the right one? Will inspectors be
inspected to find out whether they have a proper understanding of what
is meant by community cohesion? There is an ongoing and important
debate in which some say that they are not sure that the celebration of
different identities and views is the correct model for British society
in the 21st century&#151;they argue that we should be urging a far
greater degree of homogeneity of understanding, reference points and
signposts to bring people together. How can I know whether an Ofsted
inspector is knowledgeable and has a coherent view? Will the Government
state what they mean by their model of community
cohesion?</p><p><a name="st_o218"><a name="06110287000347"><b><a name="61102-0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="06110287001476">Philip

advanced at somewhat greater length, and the Government again rejected

cent. of admissions in addition to those selected according to the
faith. It seems to me that, in principle, his argument is precisely the
opposite of the argument that should be made in the spirit of the new
accord. It simply cannot be a school&#146;s prime function to
propagate a specific faith at the expense of the delivery of high
quality education; nor can it be regarded as reasonable to oblige

that it is a simple matter in which the distinctions are always clear,
but it seems to me that the most powerful argument in favour of the
compromise agreement on admitting children not of the faith, which the
Secretary of State has worked hard to achieve, is that children who are
not of the faith should not be subjected to a religious interpretation
that is at odds with their own assumptions or their parents&#146;

We played rugby against other schools, most of them outside the inner

huge number of pupils in our communities do not. Community cohesion is
an issue in schools where there are large numbers of pupils from the
ethnic minorities and a limited amount of mix. In north-west
Birmingham, we deal with cohesion through cluster programmes and
through the learning and schools council and the local education
authority. We have built up relationships between schools in the area
so that they work together and support each other. Rather than
segregating schools in the area, we try and get them working together.
That has a far better
effect.</p><p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="61102-0008.htm_para10"><a name="06110287000358">There are

multiculturalism or community relations, it is about how we improve the
education of those young people and get them to interact with their

different geographical areas. That is the fundamental issue that the

National Secular Society would be&#151;that we should not have faith

subject of debate today. Faith schools exist, and I believe they
perform an important role in our education system. The question has to

find out in those discussions? We found out from Muslim representatives
that as a matter of policy they would want between 20 and 25 per cent.
of pupils in Muslim schools to come from outside the Muslim faith. They
said, with a good deal of justification, I think, that their problem
was the way their schools and the faith were misrepresented. They
welcomed the opportunity to have the discussion about how we can take
matters forward. We could make enormous progress on a voluntary basis.
If we had continued to move down the road of compulsion, I do not think
we would have had the same spirit of

Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East put his finger on the
two main issues&#151;with the 25 per cent. of children from outside
the faith coming into faith schools, what will happen with religious
education, and what will happen to the ethos of the school? He spoke as

First, 30 per cent. of the students in Catholic schools are not from
the Catholic faith. Secondly, at the King David school in Liverpool, a
Jewish school, the majority of the students&#151;never mind 20 or 30
per cent.&#151;are not of the Jewish faith. It is an excellent school
that received a brilliant Ofsted report and is working very well.
Thirdly, the St. Francis of Assisi academy in Liverpool was set up as
50 per cent. Catholic and 50 per cent. Anglican in one of the most
deprived areas of Liverpool. It is a brilliant school. In schools
throughout the country, we have day in, day out the experience of
parents not from that faith choosing faith schools. My message to my
hon. Friend is that nothing has changed in that respect.</p><p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="61102-0008.htm_para18"><a name="06110287000371">On the points made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew),
sometimes&#151;rarely&#151;parents do not have a choice about
sending their children to those schools, but usually they want to send
their children there because of the ethos of the school. Muslim parents
send their children to Catholic schools because they like the ethos of
the school. That happens right across faiths, so we must not talk as

Purchase:</b> Does the Secretary of State accept that this is
a multi-layered matter? There are compelling pieces of work showing
that outcomes at schools are mainly determined first, by the
determination of parents to ensure that their children do well,
secondly, by experienced teachers, and thirdly, by good buildings and
so on. The rest hardly matters. I have never come across any piece of
work suggesting that outcomes are better in faith schools than anywhere
else because of the faith element. The schools that he mentions will
probably have these inputs: fairly bright children; a degree of
selection, dare I say; and good buildings and good quality all round.
Does he accept that those deliver the outcomes that we all so
desperately want for all our
children?</p><p><a name="st_o230"><a name="06110287000373"><b><a name="61102-0008.htm_spnew13"><a name="06110287001488">Alan
Johnson:</b> I do not think that my hon. Friend can support an
argument that faith schools have worse results as a question of faith.
Evidence shows that there is a premium in terms of educational outcomes
at all faith schools, whether Sikh, Jewish or whatever. I will not make
that argument because issues other than faith are involved. I agree
with my hon. Friend about the importance of good parenting, good
leadership, good teachers and so on, but he is trying to turn the issue
into one of our opening up something that we should not in respect of
voluntary agreements. My point is based on the incontrovertible fact
that 30 per cent. of students in Catholic schools are not from the
Catholic faith. If my hon. Friend needs any more examples, there are
good ones all over the country. Eighty per cent. of pupils at Sir John
Cass&#146;s Foundation and Red Coat Church of England secondary
school in Tower Hamlets are Muslim. Lord Ahmed made an excellent
contribution in the House of Lords in which he pointed out that in many
C of E schools 98 per cent. of the students are from the Muslim faith
or a minority faith. I agree with my hon. Friend that it is a
multi-layered problem, but he gives the impression that he is seeing
spectres, ghosts and shadows where they do not exist.</p><p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="61102-0008.htm_para19"><a name="06110287000374">The second point was how we
ensure that Ofsted can consider community cohesion. I refer hon.
Membersto a document called &#147;Guidance on Community
Cohesion&#148;, produced in 2002 by the Local Government Association,
the Home Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the
Commission for Racial Equality and the Inter Faith Network. I counsel
those who are worried about this not to be worried. As I said, Ofsted
already inspects many aspects of community cohesion. Ever since it was
set up, it has been duty bound to report on the spiritual, moral,
social and cultural development of pupils. Everyone, including
secularists and faith groups, can unite around community cohesion,
provided that we do not use it as a handy phrase and then forget about
it. It is important that Ofsted accepts, as it does, that it is able to
take this role, and that we continue the discussion on how to have more
voluntary agreements.</p><p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="61102-0008.htm_para20"><a name="06110287000375">To echo my hon. Friend the

Knight:</b> Lords amendments Nos. 53 and 218 to 221 extend the
provisions for free school travel for low income groups to include
secondary-aged children attending the nearest school preferred on the
grounds of religion or belief within a 15-mile radius. Evidence
suggests that choice of school, particularly for low income groups, is
often restricted by parental concerns about the cost and availability
of transport. Forty-one per cent. of parents living in social housing
cite travel convenience as the most important reason for choosing a
school, compared with only 33 per cent. of owner-occupiers. To create
equity in the system, it is crucial that lack of affordable transport
be removed as a barrier to choice. While the existing proposals
extended rights to free transport for low income groups to one of their
three nearest schools, we believe that lack of affordable transport
should not stand as a barrier to parents exercising a choice based on
their religion or belief&#151;or, in the context of how the law
defines belief, their lack of
belief.</p><p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="61102-0008.htm_para23"><a name="06110287000381">Lords

in rural areas. More than half the people in those areas live more
than13 minutes&#146; walk away from an hourly daytime bus
service, and 29 per cent. of rural settlements have no bus service at
all. This lack of public transport&#151;combined with the lack, and
high cost, of taxis&#151;leaves many people unable to get to key
places. All this becomes even more difficult when a local
denominational school closes and children are forced to travel even
further to attend school.</p><p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="61102-0009.htm_para5"><a name="06110287000390">The remaining amendments in

transport is not regulated on the same basis as public transport. In
particular, they will give local authorities greater flexibility to
vary the times of services. These are not controversial amendments. It
is unreasonable to treat school transport used only by pupils at a
school as though it were the same as general public transport that is
open to all. We support the remaining amendments in the

gave us on the extra cost of school transport. Local authorities will
be relieved, and even more so when they get the cheque in the post. In
parallel with the change in the eligibility for free transport over
much longer distances, there is the fast-tracking of some Muslim faith
schools into the maintained sector, and some of those in my area are
Muslim girls schools. My Select Committee visited Birmingham, where, on
one side of the ring road, there is the largest girls school in Europe.
Has the Department considered the large number of parents in urban
areas who, under the new eligibility, might choose to send their
children long distances to get single-sex education? Is the Minister
aware that, as has happened in Birmingham, that often removes the
ability to have a gender balance in any of the local
schools?</p><p><a name="st_o245"><a name="06110287000407"><b><a name="61102-0009.htm_spnew10"><a name="06110287001503">Jim

the Bill, the issue was originally raised by the National Secular
Society in communication with Education Ministers and with the Joint
Committee on Human Rights on which I serve. It asked whether it was
correct in human rights terms for the opt-outs from collective worship
and religious education to rest only with parents of young people, when
those young people should be considered to be competent humans in their
own right. As a result of those representations on both collective
worship and religious education, the Joint Committee took legal advice,
as is the usual process. According to that advice, unless young people
who are competent to make a decision about their article 9 rights with
regard to freedom of religion were able to exercise an opt-out, the
Government were at risk, in legislation and in practice, of breaching
the Human Rights Act 1998. There is a right not to be forced, when one
is old enough to know whether one believes in God, or in which God one
believes, to pray against one&#146;s will to another deity. That
right applies regardless of age&#151;there is no age threshold for
human rights. Indeed, the UN convention on the rights of the
child&#151;and I have heard some of my hon. Friends speak eloquently
on that&#151;provides specifically for consultation with children on
their education and other matters.</p><p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="61102-0009.htm_para17"><a name="06110287000417">In other areas, such as in the
provision of contraceptive advice, the Minister will be aware that
young people are able to consent to medical and surgical intervention,
including the right to access an abortion, without parental consent or
even parental knowledge. In such cases, the health
professionalmust decide routinely whether the young person is
competent enough to make a decision about their health. In relation to
sexual health, that judgment is often activated at around age 14.
Religious belief will vary according to the maturity of the child, but
a child who has a strong view against belief in God should not be
forced in any state school, under the Human Rights Act, to pray,
whether individually or collectively.</p><p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="61102-0009.htm_para18"><a name="06110287000418">The Joint Committee also
covered the question of religious education. The reason that there is
an opt-out for religious education, which seems strange to many people,
given that it is a subject rather than worship, is that it has no
central curriculum. In voluntary aided and voluntary controlled schools
with a faith ethos, the religion education curricula and syllabuses
obviously look extremely different. Religious education syllabuses are
generally set by standing advisory committees on religious education in
each local authority area. For faith schools, there is a layer on top
of that, which is the faith school deciding. As the Government have
always recognised, however, the curriculum or syllabus is designed and
delivered in such a way that there is no current protection for those
parents who do not want their children exposed to both the content and
style of

that there is sympathy for this view in my party, although our
Front-Bench spokesman will also speak&#151;is that religious
education is important in terms of the teaching of comparative
religion, and that its presence in the syllabus is necessary as
religion is part of our culture and history. Just like history,
geography, philosophy, belief studies and citizenship studies, it needs
to be taught and taught well. Clearly, some variation is needed to
ensure that children of a particular belief are taught about it. It
would be bizarre for the content in a school that had lots of Muslims,
or that was a Muslim faith school as it currently exists, to be related
mainly to Christianity. The curriculum must ensure, however, that those
of all beliefs and none are covered.</p><p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="61102-0009.htm_para22"><a name="06110287000422">Were that part of the national
curriculum or, as I would like, a minimum curriculum entitlement, there
would be no need for a parental opt-out on religious education. Because
that is not currently part of the national curriculum, however, there
is a parental opt-out, and rightly so. For reasons that I have
explained, I have never argued against that opt-out. Where that opt-out
exists for parents, because of their human rights need for their wishes
to be respected, it must also apply to young people who are old enough
to decide for themselves, rather than it being imposed by parents or
authority figures. After all, the House should be concerned about the
radicalisation of some young people by older people, potentially
including their parents, teaching them a brand of religion that they
might want to resist. If young people cannot excuse themselves from
rather directional teaching at school, we cannot even start the battle
to ensure that they are immune from such proselytisation. After all, we
do not allow political inculcation, which is a brand of belief
inculcation, in our schools.</p>

accepts that religious education should be just that&#151;education,

existence of opt-outs is due to the local variation that is allowed,
and the fact that faith schools may include in their lessons materials
such as instructional videos from a pro-life group, showing abortion in
graphic terms. One school allowed just such a video to be shown
recently. The young people at that Catholic sixth-form college objected
to having to attend compulsory collective worship for long periods, and
to receiving such education or instruction. When they rebelled and
refused to attend, they were excluded

hon. Gentleman runs is that the kind of education that he mentions is
lost at the moment to those children whose parents withdraw them from
religious education lessons. There is a good argument for including
such information, which I agree is vital&#151;I have said so
twice&#151;in a religious education and beliefs or citizenship
curriculum, in which pupils could examine their responsibilities to
others, and their own beliefs, or lack of them. That would be fair
enough. I hope that that point is understood. However, because the
system does not work like that, and because, in some cases, lesson
content is not as balanced as the hon. Gentleman suggests it should be,
there is a parental opt-out. The Joint Committee on Human Rights was
firm in its view that, if an opt-out is deemed necessary for parents,
it must also be available to young people who are competent.</p><p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="61102-0010.htm_para1"><a name="06110287000426">To finish, I shall deal with

Standing Committee, and following the report of the Joint Committee on
Human Rights, the Government consulted the faith community on the
issue, but very narrowly. It consulted only on collective worship, and
only in respect of sixth-formers, rather than all those competent to
decide. They did not ask about some of the other issues in the Joint
Committee&#146;s report&#151;indeed, the consultation did not refer
to the report&#151;and they did not refer at all to the human rights
issue at the heart of the subject.</p><p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="61102-0010.htm_para2"><a name="06110287000427">After that consultation, the

pocket that concession, and I thank the Minister for it, but he should
accept that one is either in breach of human rights or not; we cannot
say, &#147;Well, ensuring 25 per cent. of those rights is
okay&#148;. The concession left out the half of our amendment that
dealt with religious education, as well as the issue of 15 or
16-year-olds who are not in the sixth form, but who know that they do
not want to attend compulsory prayer&#151;at least, not the

Government&#146;s provisions might well open the door for a case to
be brought under the Human Rights Act 1998. Why should the Government
wait? What is their fear? It has been argued that it would be difficult
for schools to decide what Gillick competence was, but that was not an
argument against ensuring rights in respect of the provision of medical
treatment. I have not heard that argument advanced&#151;especially
not by Liberal Democrat Members&#151;in discussion of pupil choice, a
subject on which we have a policy to ensure that pupils, after
receiving advice, have more choice over their curriculum. Nor was that
argument used on the subject of the rights of a child to be consulted;
there was no worry about whether the child was not competent to feed
into that consultation. It seems to the Joint Committee, and to other
human rights authorities to which I have spoken, that that is not a
problem; schools can make a decision when a child comes to them and

balanced religious education, taught in our schools, and worship. As
the Secretary of State said earlier this year, all the faith
communities have agreed to ensure that pupils are taught about all
faiths in their schools. The days when religious education was
synonymous with religious instruction are long gone. Indeed, learning
about other faiths is increasingly important to ensure the community
cohesion that we discussed earlier. I agree with what my hon. Friend

schools are obliged to do so as public authorities under the Human
Rights Act 1998, although it would be for the courts to decide whether
human rights have been breached on the facts of a particular case. If
RE is taught appropriately and parents can withdraw their children, It
is unlikely that pupils&#146; right to freedom of thought, conscience
and religion will be breached. The distinction between collective
worship and RE centres on the notion that teaching covers all religions
so that sixth-form pupils are not taught religious

pre-existing inability of older students to excuse themselves from
collective worship and religious instruction is incompatible with their
right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion in article 9 of

is not the legal point that we were trying to make but, nevertheless,
we welcome it as a pragmatic solution. I think that the Government knew
that they were bang to rights, so they caved in, and did not listen to
our persuasive arguments as much as we would like. As my hon. Friend my
hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said, the Joint

religious education really is multi-faith, really does broaden young
people&#146;s minds and really is an aid to social cohesion, we shall

Christian children, or children whose parents have no faith at all. I

parental consent is required for any child to opt out&#151;which,
again, is entirely appropriate. The amendments suggest that that should
not apply to children over 16, which would bring the Bill more closely
into line with human rights legislation, although, as the hon. Member

increased restrictions that have been an unintended consequence of work
force reform. Subsection (1) allows the head teacher of a religious
foundation or voluntary controlled school in England and Wales to be a
reserved teacher&#151;that is, appointed specifically to teach
religious education in accordance with the tenets of the
school&#146;s specified religion.</p><p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="61102-0011.htm_para13"><a name="06110287000502">Religious foundation and
voluntary controlled schools should have the same flexibility as that
currently enjoyed by voluntary aided schools, namely, the ability to
appoint a head teacher specifically to teach religious education at the
school, as well as to carry out their duties as a head teacher. Such
flexibility is particularly important in small primary schools, where
the existing restriction is unnecessarily burdensome. Should a
voluntary controlled school chose to appoint the head teacher as a
reserved teacher, that appointment will count towards the one fifth of
the teaching staff that are permitted to be appointed as reserved
teachers, and hence there is absolutely no increase in
discrimination.</p><p><a name="st_o297"><a name="06110287000503"><b><a name="61102-0011.htm_spnew27"><a name="06110287001555">Dr.

voluntary controlled and voluntary aided schools. Will the Minister set
out what they are? Will he note that in voluntary controlled schools,
100 per cent. of capital and running costs are provided by the state,
and not by the religious foundation or religious interest that has the
ethos? Indeed, only a minority of the governors are religious. So there
is a reason why VA schools and VC schools have separate consideration
in their freedom to apply a faith test at all. Therefore, arguably it
should not be that the head of that school should be one of those who
are entitled to be sacked, promoted or not appointed on the basis of
their religion.</p><br>

genuine occupational guidance would not apply. It states:</p><a name="61102-0012.htm_brev3"><a name="06110287001192"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A GOR cannot be claimed
unless some or all of those duties, or the totality of the role, are
covered by a specific exemption and an assessment has been made showing
that it would be unreasonable to require other employees of the
appropriate religion or belief to undertake these duties...Where
the organisation has a religious ethos, a GOR exemption cannot be
claimed if the nature of the role and the context within which it is
carried out is not of sufficient profile or impact within the
organisation to affect the overall ethos of the
organisation&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="61102-0012.htm_para7"><a name="06110287000538">That is
particularly relevant to occupations such as a school secretary, a
school caretaker or a dinner lady. It is important to note that this
provision will not automatically extend the degree of freedom available
to those schools; it will simply allow them to make a case for having
regard to the religion or belief of an individual member of staff in
certain cases, in accordance with existing anti-discrimination
legislation.</p><p><a name="st_o324"><a name="06110287000539"><b><a name="61102-0012.htm_spnew17"><a name="06110287001582">Judy

regulations will be written in a comprehensible form, because I did not
understand the wording that he just read out? Will they specifically
exclude groups such as school dinner ladies, caretakers and cleaners?
Because those groups have contact with children, a particular school
might prefer to take somebody who, for example, it knew because they
went to the local church. Will the regulations specifically exclude
some of those jobs on the ground that they are not a genuine
occupational qualification, and will they clarify exactly what is a
genuine occupational qualification? Will my hon. Friend make that clear
to us
now?</p><p><a name="st_o327"><a name="06110287000542"><b><a name="61102-0012.htm_spnew20"><a name="06110287001585">Jim

clear as we possibly can. I am not a lawyer, and sometimes the language
of the lawyers who draft these provisions can be a little confusing,
but I will seek to ensure that the regulations are as clear as
possible. I have discussed this issue and we can look at whether
specific roles can be identified as carrying, or not carrying, a
genuine occupational requirement. In my constituency, for example,
support staff have been taken on to perform a number of different
functions. Such a person might carry out the crossing patrol first
thing in the morning and then work as a teaching assistant at some
point before becoming a dinner lady. Such flexibility of working in
schools might mean that it would be difficult to rule certain functions
in or out, because that might adversely affect some support
staff.</p><p><a name="st_o328"><a name="06110287000543"><b><a name="61102-0012.htm_spnew21"><a name="06110287001586">Jeremy

However, if someone appointed to one of those posts was, as part of
their duties, also required consistently to lead acts of collective
worship or carry out religious instruction, it might be reasonable for
the school, in appointing that person to perform a range of duties, to
make a case for a genuine occupational requirement. That would be
testable at an employment tribunal, and one would hope that individuals
would belong to trade unions that would help them to fight that

does he believe that a school would have recourse to the exception
under genuine occupational requirement for a secretary who was asked to
lead prayers, when it would not apply to a maths teacher who had to be
Catholic, say, to work at a certain school? At the moment, voluntary
aided schools are allowed to appoint all their teachers on the basis of
their faith, with a specific right to do so under the employment
regulations, which specifically mention sections 58 and 60. As the
amendment amends those sections, how can the Minister be confident that
there will be any access, post facto&#151;after someone&#146;s

assure me that the regulations will be tightly defined so that the

the letter he sent to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East

29 relates to the employment of staff at a school. At present, as the
Minister so ably explained, the head teacher of a foundation or
voluntary controlled faith school cannot be included among the 20 per
cent. of teachers who can be selected for their fitness and competence
to give religious education and specifically appointed to do so. The
Government have argued, and we agree, that it should not be necessary
for a foundation or voluntary controlled faith school to convert to
voluntary aided status simply to be able to appoint a head teacher who
will also lead religious education at the
school.</p><p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="61102-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06110287000572">The amendment
also removes a restriction in section 60 of the School Standards and
Framework Act 1998, which prevents voluntary-aided schools from
employing support staff on the basis of their religious beliefs. It is
designed to ensure that faith schools are able to appoint non-teaching
members of staff, such as pastoral assistants, who follow the religion
and ethos of the school. One of the key features of a faith school is
its ethos and it is important to protect it. One thing that always
strikes me on visiting faith schools is that a school is a community
with shared values that permeate it, so where a school considers it
necessary, it should be able to appoint teachers who
reinforcethat ethos.</p><p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="61102-0013.htm_para3"><a name="06110287000573">The religious aspect of faith
schools is not something that stops outside religious education lessons
or collective worship: it lies at the very heart of every activity that
the school engages in. In the words of the canon law of the Catholic
Church:</p><a name="61102-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="06110287001195"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
instruction and education in a Catholic school must be grounded in the

life.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="61102-0013.htm_para4"><a name="06110287000574">The same principle
should apply to other staff involved with the pastoral care of children
in the school. That is particularly the case in view of the impact of
work force remodelling, which the Minister mentioned, as an increasing
number of support staff are involved in pastoral roles. Our approach to
employment is the same as our approach to admissions. We welcome
schools that embrace teachers and staff from outside the faith in the
same way as we welcome the Church of England&#146;s decision on
admission policies, but we believe that it should absolutely be a
matter for the schools, not for prescription and
legislation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="61102-0013.htm_para5"><a name="06110287000575">I

that. We currently face an unprecedented shortage of good leadership in
schools, so we are particularly concerned about the effect of the
amendment on head teachers. The Government will face critical problems
in respect of attracting the right people into schools and, given the
impending crisis, it seems idiotic further to narrow the pool from
which schools can choose good leaders. The criteria are, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon pointed out earlier,
highly restrictive. It is one thing to expect the head teacher to be in
sympathy with the views and the faith of a school, but another to
extend that to practice and conduct. That may have huge
implications.</p><p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="61102-0013.htm_para8"><a name="06110287000579">For
example, let us consider a Catholic head teacher who had been married
and subsequently remarried. If the first marriage had been recognised
by the Church, the second would not be recognised. Head teachers in
that position could not take communion under Catholic rules. Would that
put them in breach of the rule on conduct? I suspect that it may,
regardless of whether they are practising Catholics. Such aspects of
private life, which should not normally be a consideration when
choosing good quality teachers, let alone good quality leadership, may
come into play. That would be unacceptable, and the Government need to
clarify exactly what they mean by conduct and practice of the
faith.</p><p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="61102-0013.htm_para9"><a name="06110287000580">We are also

outset of my brief contribution, I wantto make it clear that I
have worked closely withfaith schools in my constituency and
in wider Wolverhampton for more than 30 years. My relationships with
them have been overwhelmingly good and the teachers, head teachers and
workers have had one thought in their minds&#151;giving the children
the best possible education.</p><p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="61102-0013.htm_para10"><a name="06110287000584">The essence of the
Government&#146;s proposal will not bring people together but divide
them even more. In 1998, I was not happy to support the idea that
schools could appoint 20 per cent. of their staff on the ground of
religion. I support the idea of religious education, which should be
wide, liberal and tolerant. I understand that faith schools wish to
present a specific point of view&#151;a spin, in modern parlance, on
their faith. I do not especially have a problem with that. However, we
have now reached the stage where the20 per cent. is no longer
the point. We are now asking, &#147;Can we include a head
teacher?&#148; and &#147;Can we appoint non-teaching staff to carry
out pastoral duties?&#148;</p><p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="61102-0013.htm_para11"><a name="06110287000585">I regard pastoral care as
central to children&#146;s education. Many children bring to school a
whole package of difficulties, trauma and deprivation. I expect trained
teachers&#151;and trained social workers&#151;to provide genuine
help, guidance and support for children in that position. Teachers,
through their training, understand the importance and centrality of
pastoral care to their role and that they carry it out diligently and
properly. There are always those who are poor at what they do, but that
applies throughout society.</p><p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="61102-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06110287000586">If we agree to this measure

for schools is now so abundant that there is room in work force changes
to have specific posts. May I have one in every school in my
constituency? However, the appointment does not need to be made on the
basis of the person&#146;s religion. We need someone

trade union interest. This is the biggest issue in the
Bill&#151;outside of the provision to have trust schools, and so on

stripping away from us our essential humanity&#151;our ability to

infinitesimal compared with the baggage and problems that children

it away from them, but please do not take away from me, and from other
human beings, that essential part of our character that says that,
regardless of differences, we can help, support and guide young people

religion in the provision of education in a state school, especially
one where salaries are 100 per cent. funded by the state, which is all
VA and VC schools, or one where capital costs are only 80, 90 or 100
per cent. funded by the state, which again is all schools, that is not
justified. We should oppose it on principle, as the hon. Member for

teaching in a state school is an occasion for proselytisation, and that
as long as teachers are able to uphold the ethos of the school, they
should not be required to attend a specific church on a Sunday. They
merely have to uphold the ethos of the school. They do not require a
faith test, and their private lawful conduct, for example, with regard
to their sexual orientation, should not be permitted to be a factor in
their employment prospects, whether for promotion, appointment or
dismissal.</p><p><a name="st_o367"><a name="06110287000618"><b><a name="61102-0014.htm_spnew10"><a name="06110287001625">Dr.
Pugh:</b> So the ethos of a Catholic school could therefore,
in my hon. Friend&#146;s opinion, be sustained entirely by a
non-Catholic staff? That is what he is
saying.</p><p><a name="st_o368"><a name="06110287000619"><b><a name="61102-0014.htm_spnew11"><a name="06110287001626">Dr.
Harris:</b> Yes, that is correct. Otherwise, on what basis
would one oppose discrimination? Obviously, the Catholic may faith
argue that every single teacher and member of staff in its schools must
be Catholic in order to uphold the ethos. I would argue that an ethos
is an ethos and is not dependent on the religious views of individuals
in that state school. The job of the school is to teach. There is
already difficulty, as we have heard, in finding enough people of the
correct faith to appoint to specific schools, particularly head
teachers. My hon. Friend will have to defend a situation which is the
logical consequence of what he says, in which every teacher must
undergo a faith test if the ethos is to be fully
upheld.</p><p><a name="st_o369"><a name="06110287000620"><b><a name="61102-0014.htm_spnew12"><a name="06110287001627">Mr.
Purchase:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman understand that the
Government&#146;s position is that religious education should be
taught across a broad curriculum by a professional teacher with an
understanding of the various religions? It does not call at any point
for a teacher of a particular religion to be employed to do that job.
That is the Government&#146;s
position.</p><p><a name="st_o370"><a name="06110287000621"><b><a name="61102-0014.htm_spnew13"><a name="06110287001628">Dr.
Harris:</b> Quite so, and community schools that are not faith
schools have an ethos that is not religious. I would not call for them,
and they do not seek, to apply a non-religious test to the teachers
applying to work in those schools to ensure that they uphold a
non-religious ethos. What sort of society are we becoming when teachers
in state schools are required to be of a faith, or not be of a certain
faith, in order to teach? Those who wish to teach religious education
in a Catholic school may well be Catholic. That may be why

That is fair enough, but when the state is employing people, it is no
one&#146;s business to ask the religious belief of the people
concerned.</p><p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="61102-0014.htm_para15"><a name="06110287000622">The
Minister said that head teachers can already be subject to a faith test
by virtue of section 60(4) of the 1998 Act. I put it to him that
section 60(4) is not a faith test. It
states:</p><a name="61102-0014.htm_brev10"><a name="06110287001207"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In

being introduced by making that person a reserve teacher. Instead, the

section 60(5) of the 1998 Act. There is no mention of ethos in that
faith test. It is a faith test, not a test of ability to uphold the
ethos. I hope the Minister will accept that that is the
case.</p><p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="61102-0014.htm_para19"><a name="06110287000626">On the question
of consultation, the National Association of Head Teachers and the
National Union of Teachers are the two unions which almost exclusively
represent head teachers, and the NUT is a major representative of
potential head teachers. When the matter was debated in the Lords, the
Government gave the impression that the trade unions principally
concerned had been consulted. In response to Lord Avebury&#146;s
suggestion that they knew nothing about the proposals until the last
moment, Lord Adonis, a decent man whom I like, said:</p><a name="61102-0014.htm_brev14"><a name="06110287001211"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;My Lords, that is

&#147;thoroughly consulted&#148;. The NUT, however, says that it
was not consulted. Its letter to the Secretary of State, which has been
distributed to Members,
states:</p><a name="61102-0014.htm_brev15"><a name="06110287001212"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I
wrote to you yesterday concerning amendment 54...I have now had
the benefit of reading the comments of Lord Adonis in Hansard. It is my
view that the manner of the development of this amendment is an example
of poor Government...Neither the NUT nor the NAHT have been
involved in any consultation. This situation is totally
unacceptable&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="61102-0014.htm_para21"><a name="06110287000628">It goes on
to complain further about the Minister&#146;s representations in the

very strong
terms:</p><a name="61102-0014.htm_brev16"><a name="06110287001213"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No
attempt is being made by Government to involve all representatives of
the teaching profession in taking forward these important matters. It
seems to me that the way the Government is conducting this matter is
likely to lead to division and poor
decisions.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="61102-0014.htm_para22"><a name="06110287000629">I
do not mean to echo criticism of the Government per se. However, does
the Minister accept that consulting after the statute has been passed
is not the appropriate way to consult, that it is not in line with the
Cabinet Office guide on consultation, and that ideally it should have
been brought in separately rather than as it was? Unison and the GMB

said that in respect of non-teaching support staff, the measure will
apply to teachers in a pastoral role. I suggest that that is exactly
the sort of role where an obvious religious leaning might not be
helpful. I do not know how many pupils come to their teachers with
religious crises, but I know that a large number do so with crises
regarding their personal lives and health, particularly their sexual
health. It wouldbe entirely possible for a faith school to
have a non-religious figure doing that job who can refer pupils who
turn up with a religious crisis to the appropriate faith-based person

a full picture of the implications of removing a foundation for assets.

foundation proposals in the case of voluntary schools or existing
foundation schools. That ensures that schools ask permission from their
faith groups, foundations or dioceses before they propose to become
foundation schools, or change the instrument of government to allow a
majority of governors to be foundation governors. The amendment
therefore strengths the oversight of faith groups and existing
foundations over the control of the schools that they serve. It means
that no existing voluntary school could become a trust school without
seeking proper permission. Given the historic role that the Churches

if a trust provided a school with resources, it would be extremely
unwise for the school to attempt to remove the trust if it would lead
to the return of all those assets to the original owners. The amendment

existing foundation school with a foundation to &#147;become&#148;

that parents must still form a majority on the council. This is a
welcome amendment, because it recognises the role that schools can play

education system if it requires their child to be bussed across town
simply to satisfy an arbitrary quota on ability range, especially when
that is imposed contrary to the wishes of the school. Schools need to
be free to decide to adopt banding when that suits the school&#146;s
ethos and circumstances, and it should not be used to push social
agendas that lack the support of parents. Therefore, we welcome the

levels of selection at partially selected schools, provided that they
did not increase them over the 1998 level. He is right to say that that

for instrumental and vocal tuition are not logical and that they lead
to many anomalies. That is especially true for those instruments that
almost always have to be studied in a large group, and for large groups
such as orchestras and wind bands. However, it is almost impossible to
learn instruments such as the piano in groups of more than
one&#151;or possibly two, if a school is lucky enough to have two

peripatetic music service, which probably had more impact on my views
and development than almost anything. We in Leicestershire were lucky
to have fantastic music tuition, and it was available to almost every
student who wanted it. I fondly remember being one of a dozen or so
students scraping away at violins in a cold school hall on a Monday
evening, yet the tuition was so good that three years later I had
achieved grade 8&#151;although I still had not graduated to full-size
violin.</p><p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="61102-0016.htm_para8"><a name="06110287001058">My parents

are unwilling or unable to do so. We are seeking clarification about
the remissions arrangements that the Government expect to put in place.
Enabling regulations elsewhere in the Bill will ensure that remissions
arrangements are put in place for charging for school travel on the
basis of free school meals, for instance, and we do not understand why
the Government have not adopted a similar approach to music
tuition.</p><p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="61102-0016.htm_para9"><a name="06110287001059">I hope that

integrated into mainstream schools at both primary and secondary level
and their education is of the highest standard. However, as the
teaching unions and others have recognised, balancing the various
aspects of education, where excellence is required, is difficult. It is
critical that needs and targets are balanced, that resources are put in
place and that schools are co-ordinated appropriately. I wonder whether
it would have been better if the Government saw the problem as part of

Society campaign, &#147;Make School Make Sense&#148;, shows that it
is important that every teacher in a school understands autism. That
knowledge and the techniques associated with it must emanate from the

barriers between different groups in society, so that they can engage
constructively together. We should also recognise that giving
responsibility to young people from troubled backgrounds has an
extremely beneficial effect on their attitudes to their fellows and to
society at large. We need to recognise that, in addition to punishing
irresponsible behaviour, Government should do more to encourage and
reward young people who engage in exemplary behaviour, as the vast
majority do. In that spirit, I am happy to welcome and support this

include some of the typical youth service outreach projects, which

rather than somebody else&#146;s territory. That is important.
Because of the cuts in youth services that have taken place over many
years&#151;way before 1997, as well&#151;it was important that
there was not a diversion to, say, activities at a leisure centre,
thereby losing the traditional youth work that has been of such great
value to us over many years. We strongly support the

the kind of criteria that the Government envisage are ones such as the

present, the Bill uses the phrase &#147;normal school hours&#148;
to refer to the time when a child is at school, but that is ambiguous.
Section 32 of the Education Act 2002 gives school governing bodies the
authority to set the time of school sessions, rather than hours. Given
that some schools permit pupils to leave the premises during the day,
it is better to use the term &#147;sessions&#148; rather than

John Butterfill (Bournemouth, West) (Con):</b> I rise to deal
with a problem which is becoming increasingly common and on which I
have corresponded in some depth with Citizens Advice. It relates in
particular to one of my constituents, a lady whom I shall call
Mrs. B because she is not in good health now and she does
not wish to have any personal publicity or the media chasing after her.
The Minister knows her identity because we have corresponded regarding
her case.</p><p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="61102-0017.htm_para23"><a name="06110287001131">When I first
wrote to the Minister, I said that the case was rather unusual, but I
have come to realise that it is far from unusual and relates to a
matter of considerable public concern. My constituent, Mrs.
B, became the carer to her father in 1996 and had no contact with
social services until 2000. During that time she did not claim
carer&#146;s allowance or attendance allowance for her father, and
she did not therefore qualify under the rules as they now exist for
home responsibilities protection. That has meant that her own
retirement pension is reduced by the gap in her employment record that
would not have existed if she had qualified for that
protection.</p><p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="61102-0017.htm_para24"><a name="06110287001132">The
situation is difficult. Mrs. B has appealed on two occasions
and on each occasion there has been no questioning her entitlement to
those benefits&#151;carer&#146;s allowance and her father&#146;s
attendance allowance&#151;and she would therefore have qualified for
home responsibilities protection. The law in this respect needs
changing. It cannot be right that people who are ignorant of their
rights in this matter should be penalised both by losing the original
allowances, which would have been considerable, and by having their own
retirement pension reduced through lack of an adequate national
insurance record.</p><p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="61102-0017.htm_para25"><a name="06110287001133">I
am sure that that is not what Parliament intended when it passed the
legislation, but Parliament unfortunately seemed to believe that
everybody would be aware of their entitlement to such benefits and
would apply for them in the usual way. I accept, as the Minister has
pointed out to me, that there have been campaigns to try to make people
aware. Nevertheless, it is clear that a huge number of
people&#151;possibly as many as 50 per cent.&#151;are not aware of
their entitlement. There are large numbers of people who during their
lifetime have never had any contact with social services or the
Benefits Agency. To them, all this is a complete mystery. There is
another group of people who have regular contact with such agencies and
they are perfectly qualified to
claim.</p><p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="61102-0017.htm_para26"><a name="06110287001134">When I quoted

evidence, no dispute by social services, and nobody in either tribunal
ever questioned that my constituent would have been entitled to home
responsibilities protection or that she and her father would have been
entitled to the benefits that they could otherwise have claimed. If we
were to change the law so that tribunals could take into account
suitable evidence of this nature in a retrospective claim, it would go
a long way towards removing the considerable injustice that exists in
the present system.</p><p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="61102-0017.htm_para31"><a name="06110287001139">We must remember the extremely
valuable role that carers play in our society. They are unpaid and they
look after elderly people who would otherwise be a great burden to
social services or to the national health service. It is largely an
unsung role, but without people who perform this service
unstintingly&#151;usually for relatives, one must accept, but not
always&#151;society would be a great deal poorer and we would
probably have to raise a lot in extra taxation to pay for the caring
service that would be provided in another way. It is important that we
remedy this injustice. I therefore suggest that certain deserving cases
should be reviewed by a tribunal and benefit paid retrospectively, or
home responsibilities protection reinstated.</p><p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="61102-0017.htm_para32"><a name="06110287001140">We must be more imaginative
about making the availability of these benefits known to those who act
as carers. It is extraordinary, given that my constituent&#146;s
father was extremely ill and had had spells in hospital and a great
deal of medical care, that nobody told my constituent that she and her
father would be entitled to these benefits. They were not told by the
family doctor, or by anybody in the hospital or in social services,
which must have been involved at some point. I hope that I can persuade
the Government that those who deal with people in this position should
have some form of statutory obligation to provide such information to
those who act as carers. It needs to be far more widely disseminated
and additional to notices that may already be available, such as
leaflets in doctors&#146; surgeries. The Government must take firm
action to ensure that people are aware of their rights. I hope that
they will also create legislation that will enable a retrospective
claim.</p><br>

Minister for Pensions Reform (James Purnell):</b> I
congratulate the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John
Butterfill) on securing the debate. I want to start by placing on the
record an apology, on behalf of the Department, for the fact that the
information provided to him in August concerning his constituent was
misleading and confusing.</p><p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para0"><a name="06110287001142">The Government entirely echo
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s sentiments about carers. The effort that
they devote to caring for disabled or ill relatives, friends or
neighbours is absolutely vital, and we want to ensure that we continue
to support them. As he said, with an ageing population, the demand for
care and support from friends and relatives is only going to
grow.</p><p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para1"><a name="06110287001143">That is why the
Government believe that we should reform the system to ensure that we
provide support for carers in their pension arrangements, and that
caring contributions should be recognised in the same way as work
contributions are. The hon. Gentleman will know, because he is an
expert on pensions, that our recent White Paper set out how we will
help carers to build up a full record, both for the basic state pension
and for the state second pension. In particular, we will reduce the
number of qualifying years for a basic state pension to 30, and
introduce a new carer&#146;s credit, so that people who are caring
for about 20 hours a week or more can build up credits towards their
state pensions. We believe that this reform will make a significant
difference to carers&#146; pension outcomes. For example, someone
caring and working for about40 years can now expect to retire
on a state pension of up to &#163;135 a week, which is well above the
means-tested level for the pension credit.</p><p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para2"><a name="06110287001144">These reforms build on the
arrangements that are already in place to ensure that carers receive
pensions in retirement. Those are delivered through the carer&#146;s
allowance and through home responsibilities protection. We entirely
agree with the hon. Gentleman that there should be a proactive approach
to publicising these arrangements. Indeed, there was an extensive
national publicity campaign during January and February this year to
make carers aware that they might need to apply for home
responsibilities protection in order to gain additional state
pension.</p><p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para3"><a name="06110287001145">Let me go
into a small amount of detail regarding the background, so that I can
answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns about Mrs.
B&#146;s case. Carer&#146;s allowance is a non-contributory and
non-income-related benefit for those providing informal care for a
severely disabled person. It helps carers who are not entitled to other
non-income-related help, or who have net earnings of &#163;84 a week
or less. To qualify for the allowance, the carer must be providing
regular and substantive care for at least 35 hours a week to a person
who receives attendance allowance, an equivalent rate of the disability
living allowance care component, or a prescribed level of constant
attendance allowancewith industrial injuries disablement
benefit or a war pension. Focusing on these benefits ensures that the
carer&#146;s allowance helps the carers of severely disabled people
who need regular and substantive
care.</p><p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para4"><a name="06110287001146">Most carers
protect their state pension entitlements through the carer&#146;s
allowance, because the allowance generally entitles them to receive a
class 1 national

<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>2 Nov 2006 : Column 553</b><br>insurance credit for each week that they receive it. This means that
their entitlement to the basic state pension is protected as though
they were working. To help them to build up entitlement to the state
second pension, carers receiving carer&#146;s allowance throughout
the year are treated as though they had earnings of &#163;12,500 and
are credited into the state second pension at that level. So carers who
receive carer&#146;s allowance build up an entitlement to the basic
state pension and to the state second pension. That is how most carers
build up their entitlement to a state pension.</p><p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para5"><a name="06110287001147">We recognise, however, that not
all carers of severely disabled people want to claim carer&#146;s
allowance. That might be the case, for example, if their receipt of the
allowance would mean that the person for whom they care would end up
with a lower entitlement to the severe disability premium in their
income-related benefits. In such circumstances, we have ensured that
the home responsibilities protection is able to fill the gap. The
conditions for getting home responsibilities protection are very
similar to those for the carer&#146;s allowance, but the
carer&#146;s allowance is more valuable because it is both a cash
benefit and a source of credits towards the state pension. Home
responsibilities protection is only the latter; it is not a cash
benefit.</p><p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para6"><a name="06110287001148">Only those
who are not able to get carer&#146;s allowance&#151;because, for
instance, they have not made the claim at the right time, or because it
might have an adverse effect on the overall benefits that their
household receives&#151;need to depend on home responsibilities
protection. While it may be possible to apply for home responsibilities
protection for a past period, it is not possible to do so where the
person being cared for was also not claiming disability benefits. That
is the nub of the problem that the hon. Gentleman has identified. This
will not be welcome to him and his constituent, but the Department
believes that that follows well-established principles of social
security payments.</p><p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para7"><a name="06110287001149">For attendance allowance and
disability living allowance, there is no entitlement for any period
before the date on which a claim is made. There are a few exceptions:
for example, where the postal service was disrupted by industrial
action; or where the decision maker&#151;the person making the
decision on behalf of the Department&#151;is able to treat as a claim
a document or letter received before the formal claim form. That did
not happen in this case, so the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituent was
not able to rely on that when making her claim or at appeal.</p><p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para8"><a name="06110287001150">There are good reasons for not
backdating in those circumstances. Deciding entitlement to attendance
allowance or disability living allowance depends on the decision maker
having up-to-date information about a person&#146;s disabilities and
their effects on the need for personal care and, in the case of
disability living allowance, their walking difficulties. To seek to
ascertain with certainty what a person&#146;s disabilities, needs and
difficulties might have been some years beforehand, and whether and
when they were first sufficient to qualify for the benefit, would be a
difficult, perhaps unreasonably difficult and even impossible
task.</p><br>

to the backdatingof carer&#146;s allowance claims. However,
recent improvements ensure that carer&#146;s allowance can be
received from the date from which attendance allowance or disability
living allowance is paid to the severely disabled person, provided that
the qualifying conditions for carer&#146;s allowance have been
satisfied since that date, and that the allowance has been claimed no
later than three months after the decision on the person cared for. We
have therefore provided for the carer to be able to claim, but we have
only been able to find a way of doing that where the person being cared
for was in receipt of the relevant benefit.</p><p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para10"><a name="06110287001152">As the hon. Gentleman says, it
is not unreasonable to expect the Government to publicise the benefits,
which we have done. The Department publishes a wide range of
information to help to ensure that disabled people, and carers, are
aware of the benefits available to them. As he said, that includes
leaflets, which are available from social security offices, Jobcentre
Plus offices, pension centres, doctors&#146; surgeries, advice
surgeries and libraries. We have also sought to make the benefits
widely known through the internet and through people who work for the
Department.</p><p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para11"><a name="06110287001153">I do not
think that there is evidence to substantiate the claim that 50 per
cent. of people are not aware of the benefits. It is interesting to
note that the number of people claiming carer&#146;s allowance has
increased by60 per cent. over the past five years and now
reaches 754,000, and that the number claiming DLA and attendance
allowance has also grown significantly. We want to continue to find
ways of publicising the benefits, but we believe that we are doing a
significant amount. The figures suggest that people are increasingly
aware of their rights to claim</p><p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para12"><a name="06110287001154">For the future, we want to
ensure that experience of the current benefits system is fed into
making sure that the new carer&#146;s credits are widely taken up. As
part of our wider plans for pension reform, we have, with a number of
organisations such as Carers UK, the Princess Royal Trust for Carers,
Carers Scotland and Carers Wales, set up a stakeholder working group,
to focus on benefit and employment-related policies for supporting
carers. We intend to build on that by making sure that we feed those
views into the package of reforms that we hope to propose in a pensions
Bill in the foreseeable future.</p><p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para13"><a name="06110287001155">We will work with carers, their
representatives and other Departments, particularly the Department of
Health, on how GPs and social services can ensure that carers&#146;
needs are taken into account. The hon. Gentleman may want to raise that
issue with Department of Health Ministers. We want to reach all those
who may be entitled to the new carer&#146;s credit, regardless of
whether they have been in contact with the benefit system. We will
continue to work with interested parties to determine how best to do
that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="61102-0018.htm_para14"><a name="06110287001156">In conclusion,
I am sorry that I do not have an answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
problem. I understand his constituent&#146;s frustrations, but it
would be difficult to award benefits retrospectively in cases in which
no claim had been made by the person receiving care. It would put a
difficult burden on the person assessing
