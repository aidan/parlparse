 The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that we are building on a model that is already out there&#151;schools that can acquire a foundation. Voluntary-aided schools are a good example of that in practice, and there are many others. We propose to put safeguards into the Bill to ensure that external partners that want to get involved with schools are committed to raising educational standards, have charitable objectives, are able to avail themselves of the power to innovate, and have a duty to promote race relations and social cohesion.

 (Lab/Co-op): Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Government have been hoist on their own hyperbole by talking rather carelessly about independent trust schools? The fact is that, as it says in the White Paper, they will be part of the family of local authority schools and will not have the independence that academies have. In many ways, the local authority relationship will be just as it has been in the past.

 (DUP): According to newspaper reports this week, restricted policy documents circulating within the Minister&#039;s Department state that trust schools will be able to decide on the admissions criteria that are in their best interests. Will the Minister confirm that such a document exists? Does she accept that that means that schools could use academic selection as part of their criteria? Does she accept that the Prime Minister, the White Paper and education experience in Northern Ireland have proved that that is the fairest and best way of selecting youngsters for post-primary schools?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51124-01_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s case. I have been clear about this, and the White Paper is clear about it. Trust schools have to operate with regard to the code of admissions, within the law, which means that there will be no return to selection and the divisive 11-plus. If any unfair criteria are used, they can be overturned by the adjudicator, which acts on a statutory basis in the public interest.

<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51124-01_spnew12"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 It will be up to the school&#039;s governing body to decide whether it wants to bring in an external partner, following consultation with parents. As a last resort, the local authority will have the ability to decide whether the trust is in the best interests of the pupils in that area, whether educational standards would rise and whether the majority of parents would feel happy with adopting a trust.

<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51124-01_spnew14"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right that we need a clear right to discipline. We are committed to introducing that in the legislation. However, trust schools will make it easier to replicate success. For example, when they tailor education specifically to the needs of pupils in their area or link up with a local business on a charitable basis that can provide work placements and use the flexibility to tailor the curriculum to meet the needs of pupils in the area, it will be much easier via the trust school mechanism to replicate that model. All the trust model is trying to do is encourage collaboration throughout an area where a trust has a specific plan to encourage that sort of education.

 (LD): Will the Secretary of State publish before the recess all the research that she has on the impact on social segregation of allowing schools to set their admissions policy? Does she regret the fact that a few schools already discourage from attending and weed out local disadvantaged children? How would allowing thousands more schools, including primary schools, to set their admissions policies stop those unfair practices?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51124-01_spnew16"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman and I had a good discussion about that yesterday. I drew to his attention the fact that the Department is working on drawing up a measure on social segregation. We do not believe that existing measures in the public domain do justice to the issue. In comparing local authorities and considering the impact of own-admission policies on social segregation, the preliminary conclusions of our research show that there is no correlation between the number of own-admission authorities and social segregation. Indeed, they show that, in some areas where the vast majority of schools are community schools, social segregation has been much higher. When we have finished the research we will be in a position to publish it.

<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="51124-01_spnew18"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 If my hon. Friend is asking whether we are prepared to make the code of practice statutory, I do not believe that that is necessary to achieve the objectives that he sets for the policy and the Department. The code 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Nov 2005 : Column 1644</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is established on a statutory basis, but there is discretion and flexibility in it to adapt admissions to meet the specific ends of a school and the pupils in the area. For example, if a school wanted to develop a specialism, the code provides that it could choose 10&nbsp;per cent. by aptitude. The adjudicator operates on a statutory basis and can make binding decisions for all non-religious schools. My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the code&#039;s importance in ensuring that all schools in the maintained sector operate on the basis of fair admissions.

<p>




</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_o4">We support that principle. Part of it is giving the new trust schools, such as the academies and the foundation schools, control over their admissions. Instead of endlessly reassuring her Back Benchers, will the Secretary of State explain what benefits she thinks the new freedom will bring?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="51124-01_spnew21"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 It can be important for a school in certain circumstances to have control over the criteria that it sets for its admissions. For example, if a school operates in an area where specific ethnic groups are highly concentrated, it might be appropriate for it to move away from a catchment-area system towards one that promotes a mixed-ability intake from a much broader area. On the other hand, it may be appropriate, as I explained to my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor), for a music college to be able to select 10&nbsp;per cent. by aptitude to build up an orchestra in the school. It could then share best practice on music with other schools in the area. That is the sort of freedom that I want. I do not want the sort of freedom that the hon. Gentleman talks about when he says that his only objection to the city academy programme is that it cannot select on ability.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="51124-01_spnew22"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 Three weeks ago, the Secretary of State said that the code of practice on admissions would not be made a statutory code. Today, she said that she did not think that that was necessary. Can I ask her to go a bit further and rule out that change?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="51124-01_spnew23"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the code achieves its ends of ruling out selection by ability on its current statutory basis. He is confused&#151;the code already operates on a statutory basis. Schools take it into account, and then the adjudicator, which is also statutory, can use its discretion to say whether the school has interpreted it correctly. Interpretation of the code, however, is very important for schools that want to create their own distinctive ethos.

<b>24 Nov 2005 : Column 1645</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="51124-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Maria Eagle): </b> 
 Bookstart is administered by Booktrust, an independent charity that invites all UK publishers to submit books for consideration. If accepted, they are generally acquired from sponsoring publishers at a fraction of the usual retail cost. Booktrust chooses books on the basis of quality and adherence to safety standards, as well as content and suitability. It operates a selection panel that meets approximately every six to 12&nbsp;months. The panel consists of librarians, health visitors, speech and language therapists, early-years educationists and Bookstart team members. It is independent and has no Government involvement.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="51124-02_spnew0"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 May I add my support for the invaluable work that Booktrust does and for the Government&#039;s support for the Bookstart programme? We all know that reading between parents and very young children, which is an important part of attachment theory, can help their development later. What is she doing to ensure that as many parents as possible are able to access this scheme, particularly if they have reading difficulties themselves? Given the great expertise shown by this charity, which has been going since the 19th century, will she ensure that the choice of books and materials is left to the experts at the charity, and is not undermined by the heavy hand of political correctness and interference from within her Department?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="51124-02_spnew1"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 We do not interfere with the way in which Bookstart carries out its functions. We encourage all parents, local authorities and Sure Start units to make sure that they take advantage of it. Between 2005&nbsp;and 2008, we expect to give out 4.5&nbsp;million books. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman supports the aims, which are to enable and support children&#039;s early communication, language development and social and emotional development, and to get parents used to reading to their children and sharing storytelling and rhymes. That will assist all children who are able to access the scheme to develop to their full potential.

<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="51124-02_spnew3"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 We always evaluate such schemes. Obviously, it is too soon to do so in this case. The scheme is going national, in its three different phases, from this year. There will be evaluation, but it stands to reason to expect that children who read early and often, and who get into the habit of doing so with their parents, will develop earlier the kind of skills that they need to succeed in school.

<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="51124-02_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 Sir Andrew Foster published his report &quot;Realising the Potential: A review of the future role of further education colleges&quot; on 15&nbsp;November. We think that it is an excellent report. It sets out clearly and convincingly the priorities that we must address. We want to take time to consider the report in discussion with colleges and other stakeholders. We shall announce in the spring the next stage of our reform of further education.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="51124-02_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Dorries: </b> 
 The Minister will be aware of the significant funding gap between FE colleges and mainstream schools. She has said that she will close that gap by only half. Given that, according to the Association of Colleges, our FE colleges take many children from poorer backgrounds, does she really believe that teachers in FE colleges should be paid less than those in secondary education?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="51124-02_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is confusing two things: the funding gap and how we fund further education colleges, and the use of the money that we grant to further education colleges. Over the past eight years since 1997, funding for further education colleges has increased by 48&nbsp;per cent. in real terms. Furthermore, last week, I was able to tell the Association of Colleges that we have proposals that will narrow the funding gap by 5&nbsp;percentage points by the 2006&#150;07&nbsp;academic year. From 2008, further measures will narrow it by another 3&nbsp;percentage points. I should have thought that she would welcome those measures.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="51124-02_spnew7"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has made an important point. It is a fundamental requirement of social justice for those who do not acquire basic skills at school, or do not secure the equivalent of five good GCSEs, to have a second, third or even fourth chance to do so later in life. I recently announced that more than 1&nbsp;million adults had taken advantage of our skills for life initiative, and had acquired basic skills in the work place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o5">The way to deal with my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns is to give individuals the entitlement to receive that training and extra help free of charge.

We are ensuring that public funds are used to give the most effective support to the learners who need it most.

Will she ensure that the refurbishment links in closely with the new opportunities fund, which I believe is still lagging a little behind? It is important to make strategic choices about where the sports facilities go in local schools to match the needs of local communities.

<p><a name="st_o47"><a name="51124-03_spnew5"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 Yes, my hon. Friend is right to mention both extended schools and the possibilities that they provide for children and young people to have somewhere to go and things to do. He is also right to stress the importance of sport and ensuring co-ordination between different capital funding streams. He will be aware that, during the spending review period, &#163;17.5&nbsp;billion of capital investment is going into our schools. That should equate to many new sports facilities all around the country.

They have been there for five and a half years, following a serious fire. To date, the Conservative-controlled county council has not even submitted a planning application.

<p><a name="st_o53"><a name="51124-03_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 On 21&nbsp;October, the Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning, my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Bill Rammell), wrote to all MPs setting out the strategic direction for the learning and skills sector for 2006&#150;08. This includes a greater funding focus on our priorities of ensuring a place in school or college, or an apprenticeship, for all young people; and&#151;as was mentioned earlier&#151;a focus on adults who lack a solid foundation of employability skills. These priorities are spelled out in the 14-to-19&nbsp;White Paper and in the two skills White Papers that were agreed with the Treasury. They are also reflected in our FE allocations to providers in Somerset, which increased by 4&nbsp;per cent. above inflation this year.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o54"><a name="51124-03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: </b> 
 Will the Minister comment on the fact that if a 16&nbsp;to 18-year-old goes to a secondary school, they attract automatic funding for the school, but not if they go to a tertiary college? That puts Somerset at a severe disadvantage, because we have five excellent tertiary colleges that attract a lot of pupils from outside the county boundary, where funding does not follow the pupil. The situation is made much worse by the Government&#039;s cut in adult education funding to those colleges. Will the Minister look again at the particular problems faced by such colleges in Somerset&#151;problems caused by his Department and the Treasury?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="51124-03_spnew11"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 There has been no cut in FE funding; indeed, it has increased by some 48&nbsp;per cent. in real terms since 1997. That contrasts starkly with the four years in the run-up to 1997, when the average funding unit per FE student fell by about 14&nbsp;per cent. So let us be clear: resources have been going into FE. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the differing funding rates for young people in different institutions. If he was in the Chamber earlier, he will have heard my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State point out that we are closing the funding gap between FE and sixth forms. It will be down to 8&nbsp;per cent. next year and we will narrow the gap further. That will mean that young people can look forward to continuing investment in their education&#151;in Somerset and elsewhere.

 (Con): Is the Minister aware that in my part of Somerset, Weston-super-Mare college, of which I am a governor, is suffering&#151;along with many other colleges throughout the country&#151;from a problem that the Association of Colleges has identified as arising from the introduction of the new entitlement to free level 2&nbsp;courses? That has meant a substantial loss of fee income to FE colleges from large employers in industries such as construction, engineering and catering. Such money must now be made up by the taxpayer as a dead-weight cost of the new policy, before any additional educational benefit is achieved.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o57"><a name="51124-03_spnew13"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has raised the question of level 2&nbsp;funding for adults in the workplace. We have a huge skills gap, as Members in all parts of the House recognise, and we need to shift our focus&#151;as we are doing&#151;in the way that the Foster report described, on to providing funding for adult skills 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Nov 2005 : Column 1651</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in the workplace. This system will provide a huge opportunity for colleges in the next two years, as the demand-led roll-out of the national employer training programme gives employers free, full-level entitlement. They will be able to choose the colleges that provide the training that they want, at the time when and in the place where they want it. That demand-led system will drive up skills in the work force, and provide a good opportunity for investment and for the provision of training by FE colleges.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o58"><a name="51124-03_spnew14"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome)</b> 
 (LD): To return to the county of Somerset, does the Minister appreciate the difficulties that we are experiencing, as even a cursory comparison of funding for FE colleges in Somerset with that for other authorities in the south-west shows? The disproportionately high number of 16&nbsp;to 18-year-olds in Somerset who go to FE colleges&#151;rather than school sixth forms, of which there are very few&#151;has produced a distorting effect that has squeezed substantially adult education in Somerset&#039;s FE colleges. Will the Minister talk to the Learning and Skills Council about this and look again at the figures? We are concerned that some very good college education is being lost as a result.


</p>








<p><a name="st_o59"><a name="51124-03_spnew15"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 I want to make two points. First, to meet the needs of young people in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency and its neighbours, funding for 16&nbsp;to 18-year-olds in Somerset has gone up by no less than 12&nbsp;per cent. Secondly, although there has been a shift in public funding for adult places, the hon. Gentleman should ask his local colleges about their fee structure. We are asking colleges to collect more fee income from adult learners as part of the process of rebalancing what is provided by taxpayers, learners and employers. We believe that there is scope to increase colleges&#039; fee income so that they can maintain the courses that people value.

<p><a name="st_o62"><a name="51124-04_spnew1"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 The amount of money that the hon. Gentleman quoted goes towards a wide range of measures, most of which, contrary to press reports, are focused on behaviour rather than truancy. However, Opposition Members need to understand the real story, which is that the 1995&#150;96&nbsp;absences total of more than 7.5&nbsp;per cent. of half-day sessions missed was a record high since statistics were first collected. Since the Government took control and started bearing down on absences as a whole, the figure has fallen every year for the past four years and is now down to below 6.5&nbsp;per cent. The hon. Gentleman must also understand that head teachers are trying to bear down on authorised as well as unauthorised absences&#151;for example, by refusing to give parents permission to take their children out of school for holidays in term time. That is bringing down the overall level, but it has resulted in a very small increase on last year in authorised absences. He has to take the picture as a whole&#151;

</p>








<p><a name="st_o65"><a name="51124-04_spnew4"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 Unfortunately, the hon. Lady is very ill informed. As I have just explained, unauthorised absences cover circumstances that go well beyond persistent truancy. We reckon that about 2&nbsp;per cent. of pupils are persistent truants, and Government action has caused schools to bear down on that in a very deliberate way. Hot spots have been identified, and there is a fast-track system of individual case management for the young people involved. Various measures for parents, including penalty notices and prosecution, are helping to tackle the problem in a meaningful way. It is also important to give support to young people, some of whom truant because of self-esteem problems or family difficulties. For the first time, those problems are being dealt with in a real way.

 My hon. Friend is right. Persistent truancy will not be tolerated: that is the bottom line, and the approach that we are encouraging schools to take. However, pupils truant for a variety of reasons. Poor self-esteem is the reason for some, while others feel that they are not doing well in school or experience serious problems at home, with parents who cannot help them to go to school regularly. It is very important that those

</p>








<p><a name="st_o73"><a name="51124-04_spnew12"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 Schools are operating a fast-track case management system that requires them to identify persistent truants and develop an individual action plan that involves their parents. It enables schools to use penalty notices and the threat of prosecution if parents cannot within 12&nbsp;weeks show an improvement in their child&#039;s attendance. It is an individualised, focused approach that enables schools to address some of the needs of young people and parents. It is showing good results. There has been an overall 11&nbsp;per cent. improvement where the fast-track management system is being used.

 Since 1997, when the Government&#039;s first White Paper on schools made clear the presumption that setting should be the norm in secondary schools, we have used our national strategies, the gifted and talented programme, case studies and research evidence to help schools to consider a range of ways to group by ability. That is why there is more setting by ability in secondary schools now than there was in 1997.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o76"><a name="51124-04_spnew14"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 I think that the hon. Gentleman has let political dogma get in the way of, first, listening to my answer and, secondly, understanding what the Government have put in place. In 1997&nbsp;we made it clear in the first schools White Paper that, unless a school can demonstrate that it is getting better than expected results through a different approach, we would presume that setting should be the norm in secondary schools. We backed that up with support for our national strategies through guidance to teachers&#151;the sort of guidance and support that, in the 11&nbsp;years I spent as a teacher, I never received from the previous Government.

Streaming can have negative effects. It can reinforce social class divisions, it can lead to bias and inconsistency in the allocation of pupils to sets and it can reduce the teaching expectations of the less able. Does my right hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o78"><a name="51124-04_spnew16"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and he speaks from knowledge. The advantage of setting is that it enables a sophisticated targeted approach for different subjects, where it would be appropriate in some cases and less so in others. That is why, for example, there is variance across subjects, with more than 80&nbsp;per cent. of maths lessons being set, but probably less than 10&nbsp;per cent. in classes such as physical education. It is for head teachers, with the support and guidance of Government, to make the decisions that, in their professional judgment, are right for their schools. That is the approach that the Government take&#151;not trying to run schools from Whitehall, as I suspect the Opposition propose.

So why today are 60&nbsp;per cent. of academic lessons in secondary schools still being taught in mixed-ability classes? Why, if the Government are serious about encouraging setting in secondary schools, did they remove from Ofsted inspection criteria the requirement to monitor and record whether lessons are setted?

The key point, as I emphasised earlier, is that we have made clear our support for setting. We have put more guidance and practical support into schools to deliver setting. There is more setting in our secondary schools than there was when we came into government. The hon.

<p><a name="st_o87"><a name="51124-05_spnew4"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 The Minister will know that, in boroughs such as mine, in most of inner London and in much of the rest of the country, people will be extremely unhappy with that answer. Given that some schools have a 60&nbsp;per cent. turnover in classes in the same year and, in many, a third of the pupils change between the first and second sets of tests, will she look again at what the Prime Minister&#039;s strategy unit said only two years ago and at what the Association of London Government report said in June this year, both of which make it clear that a fair funding formula to reflect rapidly changing pupils in classrooms is necessary for equal educational opportunity?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o88"><a name="51124-05_spnew5"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman rightly makes the case that the challenge with respect to pupil mobility rests on the individual schools in which a large proportion of pupils are mobile. That is why it is absolutely right that local authority funding formulae can and should take account of differential funding for schools with high mobility. Given the wide spread of mobility across a range of local authorities, the effect of distributing between authorities on the basis of mobility would have been to flatten and reduce the extra contributions to those authorities with additional educational needs on the basis of deprivation, not to benefit authorities such as the hon. Gentleman&#039;s. That is why the decision was taken.

 Under &quot;No Witness, No Justice&quot;, the pilot witness care unit opened in Sefton in March. It helps to increase witness attendance at court by about 20&nbsp;per cent. As a result of that success, a new centralised witness care unit is being set up in Liverpool to cover a wider area, and I understand that it will open next Monday.

 I very much welcome both the opening on Monday and the increased attendance of witnesses that the scheme has brought about.

Victims will have a single point of contact to ensure that they get information about how their cases are proceeding. The unit will keep them informed of progress, offer help with issues such as child care, transport to and from the court or referral to witness support if they need it. We will also seek to ensure that, when people attend court, the witness service meets them and looks after them while they are there. The aim is to get a better deal for witnesses and victims, and a better deal for the public because more offenders are brought to justice.

<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="51124-05_spmin4"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 Currently, offences of causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by careless driving while unfit because of alcohol or drugs are triable at the Crown court. Careless driving is dealt with at magistrates courts. The Government intend to create two new imprisonable offences of causing death by careless driving and causing death while driving while disqualified, unlicensed or uninsured. Magistrates will decide the appropriate venue for sentencing, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, including the driver&#039;s culpability.

<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="51124-05_spnew7"><b> Bob Russell: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for that very encouraging response, but does he not accept that, on some occasions when a guilty plea is made at a magistrates court for careless driving, the magistrates are not made aware of the fact that there has been a fatality? Does he not agree therefore that, on every occasion where there has been a fatality, the court needs to know and, preferably, the case should go to Crown court for sentence, even on a guilty plea?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="51124-05_spmin5"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 It is certainly my view that if a fatality has occurred following a traffic incident, magistrates should be informed. It is then for the court to decide the appropriate venue for sentencing. The court is, to a considerable extent, best placed to make that decision. The sentence depends on the culpability of the defendant, rather than the consequence. Obviously, the death of someone is a horrendous consequence, but&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; culpability inevitably varies according to the circumstances of a case. Cases involving a momentary lapse of concentration are different from those involving consistent erratic driving. Magistrates will have to judge whether they are able to deal with a case, or whether it should be dealt with at the Crown court, but they should certainly be aware of the fact that a fatality has occurred.

The offence will carry a maximum sentence of five years, so it is likely that most cases will be dealt with in the Crown court, provided that the prosecution charges manslaughter&#151;at the worst&#151;death by dangerous driving, or the new offence. Will my hon. and learned Friend give me a commitment that he will issue guidance to prosecutors throughout the country to ensure that one of those offences is charged in every case of death for which there is some culpability?

 It will be for the CPS to assess the appropriate charge in individual circumstances under the code of practice and based on the evidence. Clearly, guidance will be provided. I cannot give entirely the undertaking that my hon. Friend wants. I want to examine the way in which the guidance should be drawn before I reach a decision.

Does he agree that there will be cases in which although the consequence might have been tragic, the extent of culpability will be such that the matter should stay in the magistrates court? Moreover, can he tell the House anything further about how a distinction will be made between dangerous driving and careless driving, given that the maximum penalty of five years for careless

</p>








<p><a name="st_o98"><a name="51124-05_spmin7"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 We must carefully examine the way in which the courts will deal with the new offences in practice. That was why I was careful when I responded to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) about the guidance. Following the consultation that was completed in May, we took account of the views of hon. Members and people outside the House who thought that we needed to introduce the new offences in the Road Safety Bill. During the consultation, it was clear that the initial suggestion that the matter should be dealt with primarily in the Crown court was not viewed by the professionals as the right approach&#151;they thought that it should go either way. There will thus be circumstances in which the magistrates court can appropriately deal with cases, so we must look at the detailed guidance for prosecutors on how they address magistrates on the matter.

 Every effort is made by the Crown Prosecution Service to make decisions within a reasonable period. However, owing to the complexity of some cases, some decisions obviously take longer.

The problem is that too few teachers are prepared to teach those subjects in secondary schools, which therefore reduces the number of students who go on to study them at university. Chemistry and physics are vital to the future of this country.

Is he aware that it is an insult to the Chamber and to the police to suggest that an hour and a half in Westminster Hall is sufficient? The right hon.

Friend to do all that he can to help settle the dispute with the House of Commons contract cleaners, perhaps by asking the House of Commons Commission to get involved? Yesterday I went to a meeting with other hon. Members in which the cleaners were supported by a delegation of cleaners from Europe, who have much better pay and conditions than the people working in this building. The dispute has been going on for six months, and I urge him to do what he can because it is humiliating that it is happening in the heart of democracy. Will he do all that he can to get it settled before Christmas?

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="51124-10_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to raise the matter and it is important to try to move towards a settlement. However, I emphasise that the House of Commons authorities are not party to the contract. It is important that negotiations continue between the employer and the employees. I recently met the deputy general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union and the Trades Union Congress, when the issue was raised. I made it clear that I am willing to meet other representatives of the cleaners to try to resolve the matter fairly and properly.

 Does the Leader of the House agree that crime is a local problem that should, as far as possible, be tackled locally and that communities lie at the heart of the criminal justice system? If so, will he ask the Home Secretary to come to the House to explain his proposals for the probation service, which deals with 300,000&nbsp;offenders annually? The Home Secretary is proposing to take control of it before parcelling it out and selling it off to the private and voluntary sectors, with which the probation service has worked successfully for a long time. Next year will be the 100th year of its existence. Should not we allow it to celebrate its successes rather than wave farewell to it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51124-10_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right that it is important that all agencies that deal with crime locally be adequately staffed and have the appropriate resources to make a difference as close to the problem as possible. However, I hope that he agrees that, to make the resources available, it is only sensible to examine the management and organisational structures of the different agencies to ensure that they generate maximum efficiencies and do not, for example, simply duplicate services in small areas that could be tackled better regionally. We need to balance the importance of effective local services with the best management structures.

 May I urge the Leader of the House to reconsider the cancellation of the debate on police amalgamation, which was scheduled for next Thursday? There is clearly widespread, cross-party concern about it. Losing that important debate is symptomatic of the Government&#039;s approach to police amalgamation. When the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety commissioned the O&#039;Connor report, which will result in the changes, she asked for publicity on the matter to be kept low key. Are not the Government trying to rush through the proposals with little or no debate either here or elsewhere?

On Monday, when we discussed part 2&nbsp;of the Equality Bill on religious equality, Labour Members said that the &quot;proper&quot; withdrawal of Bibles from hospitals was nothing to do with political correctness but that they were agents of the spread of MRSA. I have a Reuters report, which states that Gideons International was so shocked by the implication that the Bibles might be harbouring disease that it commissioned a study by a micro-biologist and a surgeon who said that it was nonsense. The Government and Gideons International cannot both be right, so what is the answer?

 The Leader of the House was careful in the way in which he quoted from the national grid winter outlook. He made no comments about its prospects for major manufacturing industry. When the all-party aluminium group met leaders of the aluminium industry on Monday, they were extremely worried about prospects for the winter. Their next meeting after the all-party group was with officials at the Department of Trade and Industry who had invited them there and wanted to know from manufacturing industry the impact on it of interruptions in supply this winter. Why on earth should DTI officials want to know from manufacturing industry what would happen if there were interruptions to supply if the Department were not worried that there might be power cuts? Please may we have a debate on energy policy in Government time soon, because manufacturing matters to Conservative Members?
</p>








<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51124-10_spnew17"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 And to Labour Members. Perhaps in contrast to the long period of Conservative Government, when many people lost their jobs, we do something about manufacturing industry rather than simply talking about it. However, the hon. Gentleman raises an important point about security of energy supplies. Speaking in a slightly different capacity, I made it clear to the House that planning, preparing and ensuring that we had contingency plans in place in the event of a severe winter was part of Government policy. That is the reason for the sort of meetings to which he referred.

 The Turner commission on pensions is due to publish its report soon. May we have an assurance that there will be not only a statement when that happens but an early debate in the House on an important matter to the pensioners of today and tomorrow? It appears from reports today that the Chancellor is already ruling out any link between pension rises and earnings. When in opposition, the Labour party supported restoring the link, which is vital for the future prosperity of Britain&#039;s pensioners.

 Is the Leader of the House aware that the fourth Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in a year announced on the &quot;Today&quot; programme this morning that there would be a statement next week on the Turner report? Why is the Leader of the House not able to tell us, when he announces the business, what statements are planned? Is it because, from week to week, the Government are in such chaos that they cannot tell us what the programme will be?
</p>








<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51124-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 In the dim and distant past, as a very young member of the Opposition Whips Office, I used to admire the skill and ability of the Conservative Whips Office in its management of parliamentary business.

 Will the Leader of the House arrange a debate on the scope of the NHS, at a time when GPs are being encouraged by Ministers to turn people away who are not critically ill or elderly? The flu jab costs &#163;25. The average wage is now &#163;12&nbsp;an hour. Therefore, if the jab prevents the flu, the cost is saved in two hours.

 On the contrary, the Government have made tremendous progress in extending the availability of flu jabs each year. This year, something like 14.6&nbsp;million doses will be available.

That is a huge change in the numbers of people available to serve her constituents. Clearly, they require paying for, but in paying for those extra resources available to her constituents, it is important that the management of those resources is as effective as possible.

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="51124-11_spnew14"><b> Mr. Gerald Howarth  (Aldershot) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I want to follow up the point of order that I raised on Tuesday. As you will recall, I raised the question of the Ministry of Defence holding a press briefing in advance of the publication tomorrow of the National Audit Office&#039;s major projects report. You kindly responded that you would look into the matter, and you have written to me, with a copy to the Secretary of State and a copy placed in the Library, saying that you do not find it desirable that a Department should arrange a briefing so close to the publication of the NAO report. I thank you, on behalf of all Members of the House, for your vigilance on our behalf and the protection that you seek to give to us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_28">Nevertheless, may I point out to you, Mr. Speaker, that the briefing given by the noble Lord Drayson as Minister with responsibility for defence procurement was headed, &quot;Major Projects Report 2005&quot;? When I raised the matter with you on Tuesday, I was concerned that the debate about such an important report, as the Leader of the House knows, in the annual cycle of Ministry of Defence activities might be tainted or pre-empted by the Ministry of Defence, which had sought to present a favourable gloss on it. I understand that I could have had access to that report earlier this week, as you have pointed out to me in the letter placed in the Library. The fact is, however, that Members generally are not able to use those reports until they are available from the Vote Office.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_29">The headline written up by journalists in yesterday&#039;s newspapers was that the Ministry of Defence had cut the overspend by &#163;699&nbsp;million&#151;the precise figure contained in the report to be published tomorrow. I submit that the Ministry of Defence did not say in its briefing to journalists that the NAO&#039;s conclusion was that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;The decrease in forecast costs results mainly from changed requirements or reductions in the quantity or capability of equipment being procured.&quot;</p>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="51124-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_30">In other words, the savings have not come from Ministry of Defence efficiency savings but from cutting the capability or numbers of major projects to which the report refers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_31">It therefore seems that the noble Lord has been somewhat cavalier with the House in presenting a partial view of what the National Audit Office was due to release tomorrow. I have written a note to you, Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaker, and I would be grateful if you could consider the matter again on behalf of the House.

Let us not forget that it was only 15&nbsp;years ago that Ceausescu was overthrown in Romania and communism collapsed in Bulgaria. Today both states meet the European Union&#039;s criteria for membership, which is an enormous achievement.

 There are criteria that must be adhered to. We look forward with interest to the Commission&#039;s next report, which will be issued in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spring. It will contain the Commission&#039;s latest guidance on the progress that has been made. However, recognising the legal requirements&#151;the adoption of the acquis, for example, is necessary for all countries to become full members of the EU&#151;does not diminish the further progress that can be made once countries are members. One needs to consider, for example, the continued economic progress that has been made by the so-called A10&nbsp;countries joining the EU in 2004. There was no arbitrary stop to the progress that those countries were making towards the European mainstream when accession took place, but we should recognise that there should be rigour and transparency in the process. That is why I applaud the efforts of Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner responsible for enlargement, when he published the last report. I cannot prejudge the outcome of the next report.

That has already been one of the drivers that has led to some of the progress secured to date. I fully accept, in the light of my hon. Friend&#039;s question, that further progress needs to be made.

If either Romania or Bulgaria fail to meet their obligations in the accession negotiations, does it not remain the case that accession can&#151;and, indeed, should&#151;be refused?

<p><a name="st_116"><a name="51124-13_spnew5"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I yield to no one in my admiration of the elegance of the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell), who could certainly teach many of us lessons in elegance, but not in bluntness. The level of rigour being applied to Bulgaria and Romania easily bears comparison with the A10&nbsp;countries that entered the EU in 2004. That is why there is tighter provision in respect of the transparency of the standards to which they need to adhere and in the transparency of the process itself than was the case in 2004. Provision has been made for a so-called super safeguard clause&#151;sometimes alternatively described as the emergency brake procedure&#151;whereby accession would be delayed by a year from 1&nbsp;January 2007&nbsp;until 2008. There are also safeguard clauses in respect of areas in which further progress was identified as necessary in Romania.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_37">We also need to emphasise that powerful safeguard mechanisms are available to the European Commission in respect of any accession country for three years following its entry into the EU. Those measures are not time limited, but there are clear processes whereby steps can be taken if difficulties emerge once a country joins the EU, and serious infraction procedures can be brought, which would have a very direct bearing on the interests of the countries concerned. Thus there are safeguard clauses and super safeguard clauses and it remains the case, as we have repeatedly said, that we stand four square behind the European Commission in having both transparency and rigour in assessing the necessary standards.

 My right hon. Friend was talking a few moments ago about privatisation in Romania and Bulgaria. Is privatisation being made a requirement for those countries before they enter the EU or are they just being encouraged to privatise where appropriate? Given that many of the larger industries in western Europe are still under public ownership and do very well in the public sector, are we to press those two countries to privatise beyond what is expected here?

 I sense that, as far as my hon. Friend is concerned, that debate is not restricted to the Romanian or Bulgarian economy. We have had the opportunity and privilege of debating similar matters in respect of the UK, never mind the potential accession countries to the EU in the past. It is a commonsense point that the EU is a union of liberal democracies that operate on the basis of market economies, so I make no apology for the fact that transition was necessary in Romania and Bulgaria from the state-controlled industries of the communist era&#151;under the leadership of Ceausescu and others&#151;to the position today, whereby impressive levels of economic growth have been achieved year on year. In the light of the domestic policies followed by Bulgaria and Romania, it might be challenging for my hon.

It is important to note that the accession treaty does not create new powers for the Parliament; rather, it increases the geographical scope of the existing powers by making provision for the future participation of MEPs from Bulgaria and Romania. It consequently applies those existing powers to nationals of states to whom they could not otherwise have been applied before the treaty&#039;s entering into force.

<a name="stpa_45">Progress is being made in tackling corruption and organised crime, but the importance of doing so cannot be overstated, not least in the context of accession to the EU itself, and of the implications within a single market once these countries have joined EU-funded programmes. We should bear in mind the possibility of very large sums of British&#151;and other EU countries&#039;&#151;taxpayers&#039; money going in to Romania and Bulgaria at a time when they perhaps lack the administrative capacity to manage such sums in an acceptable way.

However, that must happen if we are to accommodate the more diverse and larger EU that is emerging, and make it easier for countries such as Turkey to join.

If that is true, it raises major questions about the principle of equality of arms&#151;that is, the status of the prosecution in relation to the defence. There is a major question about the quality of justice if the defence is put at a disadvantage in court, in breach of article 6&nbsp;of the ECHR.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-15_para9">
<a name="stpa_57">Secondly, I draw the House&#039;s attention to the detail of the conduct of the trial, and of the pre-trial phase. Stephen Jacobi, the renowned human rights lawyer and director of Fair Trial Abroad, was the international observer at the trial of Michael Shields in Varna. In a written report, he has stated that the way in which identification was authenticated was &quot;quite appalling&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_58">In addition, there appears to have been no protection of the crime scene and no forensics were undertaken to assist identification of witnesses. In court, witnesses resiled from their police statements that they could not remember the face of the assailant. Dock identification was permitted&#151;a practice that Stephen Jacobi says was outlawed 50&nbsp;years ago in the UK. The prison governor produced a prejudiced statement in court, but it was not questioned by the defence, and there were major queries concerning the identity parade and pre-trial publicity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-15_para11">
<a name="stpa_59">Moreover, witness accounts differed. People in the bar said that they had not seen the whole incident, but all of them claimed that a stone had been clutched to the assailant&#039;s chest before being dropped on Martin Georgiev. People outside the bar saw more of the incident, and said that the stone had been brought down from above the assailant&#039;s head.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-15_para12">
<a name="stpa_60">Another problem has to do with the new witness, Mr. A. His eye-witness evidence has been notarised and legalised, and he has stated that he is absolutely certain that the perpetrator was not Michael Shields. When he returned to the scene of the crime the following morning, a witness whom he had seen the night before told him that he and at least another 10&nbsp;people would testify that the perpetrator was

<a name="51124-15_para13">
<a name="stpa_61">Mr. A. therefore felt assured that there were numerous witnesses, and so did not offer evidence himself. However, those same bar witnesses said in court that the fair-haired Michael Shields was the guilty party. Mr. A. has now come forward and given a legalised and notarised statement, and is willing to testify in Bulgaria.

<a name="stpa_64">The facts are very different. The facts, as authenticated by our Home Office, are that the Bulgarian authorities issued a summons for Graham Sankey incorrectly. The summons arrived at the Home Office on 11&nbsp;July, giving the United Kingdom central authority nine days rather than the required six weeks to serve it. The UK authority did not attempt to serve the summons, so the Bulgarians tried to speak to Graham Sankey before he made the confession. They handled that wrongly. Their record of what happened is factually incorrect yet, when he made the confession, the Bulgarians did not attempt to question him. As the matter is under Bulgarian jurisdiction, it is entirely a matter for the Bulgarians. They can, of course, ask the United Kingdom police to inquire on their behalf, but they have failed to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-15_para17">
<a name="stpa_65">I am also extremely concerned to see contradictory information in official reports from Bulgarian judicial authorities in reference to this case. The indictment issued by the Varna prosecutor&#039;s office stated:

The illustrations from Michael Shields&#039;s case demonstrate that principle in a clear way, and I am extremely concerned. I therefore ask my right hon. Friend the Minister to reject Bulgaria&#039;s accession pending further investigation of this unacceptable situation and to enable consideration to take place of whether it is indicative of the wider concerns expressed by the Commission on Bulgaria&#039;s judicial processes. This is a matter of justice for Michael Shields, but it is also about the suitability and readiness of Bulgaria to become a member of the EU in January 2007.

The treaty of accession provides a short-term safeguard clause that could jeopardise the final entry of Romania and Bulgaria into the EU, but only for 12&nbsp;months. The hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) raised that issue on Second Reading. It is a legitimate one, and it has been echoed by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady).

<a name="stpa_71">What happens if Romania and Bulgaria are proved to have failed in their final preparations to become members of the EU? I fear that we are caught in a cleft stick. The accession treaty commits us to accepting Romania and Bulgaria into the EU almost come hell or high water. While there is a safeguard clause, it only defers but does not permanently postpone or put off accession. At a political level, once they have joined, the ability of the EU authorities to exercise any leverage over the domestic reform process is significantly weakened.

What could we possibly do? The Minister referred to a period of three years during which the EU would be able to take some exceptional safeguard measures, but I should be grateful for any further detail he can provide about how they would operate during that crucial period, after which, I take it, there would be almost no meaningful leverage over the domestic reform process.

<p>
<a name="51124-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_79">In other accessions to the European Union, we have seen rushed privatisation and a degree of corruption. In Hungary, for example, the leader of the alleged Socialist party made a personal fortune from privatisation. His party is now so keen on privatisation, so right-wing and so free market, it is no longer a socialist party in any sense. Indeed, the <i>New Statesman</i> cast a slur on the character of Baroness Thatcher by suggesting that, if she were Hungarian, she would vote for the Socialist party. That is unfair, because it is not at all a nice party. It is significant, however, that the Hungarian opposition party, which is Catholic-based, conservative and anti-communist, resists the privatisation of public services, and has become the party of the left.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_80">The Catholic collectivism that was typical of Christian Democrats in Europe is being broken down by a rush to neo-liberalism and the free market. That is where the real division is occurring, significantly in Germany where Angela Merkel is trying to move away from Catholic collectivism and towards the market. That causes tension in Germany, even in her party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-16_para11">
<a name="stpa_81">I look forward to Bulgaria and Romania becoming members of the EU. Neo-liberalism and the free market should not be conditions of their membership. One reason I am so keen on enlargement is that it would inevitably mean a much looser association of member states, where each country could determine its own economic policy according to its democratic choices. That is the Europe I want and I think one or two Opposition Members want that, too. They may choose to take a much more conservative approach to running economies. I might choose a more social democratic or democratic socialist approach, but we would have that democratic choice; it would not be determined by the EU.
</p>








<p><a name="st_151"><a name="51124-16_spnew4"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have attempted to put those arguments on a number of occasions. Does he agree that it would be better to try to reform the system before it implodes with possibly extremely dangerous consequences for democracy throughout Europe? We can draw on the example of what happened in France recently, which some of us predicted, as an indication of the creation of a compression chamber that simply does not work.

 I have some sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman says. In Hungary, the economy is doing well in some senses, but poverty&#151;certainly relative poverty&#151;has increased. It is said that some people were better off under communism. If the market leads to poverty and to a serious division between rich and poor in those countries, people will say such things.

 We have lived in a market economy since the second world war, but the extent of the state&#039;s role in the economy and the degree of public or private ownership is for each country to choose. Since the second world war, we have had a mixed economy, which worked extremely well in the first three decades. I advocate that approach to running our economy even now. It certainly worked better than what has happened 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Nov 2005 : Column 1694</b>

<p>
<a name="51124-16_para12">
<a name="stpa_82">In Russia, after the collapse of communism, there was a rush to privatisation and at the same time the adoption of a hard rouble policy, which caused economic chaos. There was a serious reduction of output and living standards fell. Only when the rouble was floated and the process slowed down did the Russian economy begin to recover.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-16_para13">
<a name="stpa_83">Each country should be able to choose the exchange rate appropriate to its economic needs. One reason why I support the Chancellor so strongly in keeping us out of the euro is that we can choose the exchange rate suited to our needs. Exchange rates are essential springs and buffers between economies. They are necessary; they can be stable, there can be a pegged system, but they should be changeable. That is how we should operate with the new member states. They should not be encouraged to join the euro. While they are weaker, they should be able to decide what is best for their economies&#151;choosing their own exchange rates, interest rates and fiscal balance between tax and spend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-16_para14">
<a name="stpa_84">Bulgaria and Romania should be allowed to decide what is best for their economies and not be told how to run them from outside by the EU. That may lead to problems and voices may call for a return to the old authoritarian system, although that would not be the wish of the democrats in the EU. The EU should not press strongly that those economies operate in a particular way; it should allow them to operate as is best in each case. We should open our markets to some of their goods and allow them to depreciate their currency if that would make them more competitive. We should urge them to adopt proper rules for their workers, such as good trade union standards and employment rights, so that workers have a proper share of the benefits of their developing economies, but we should not insist that they privatise their economies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-16_para15">
<a name="stpa_85">Recently, I visited Austria and Hungary with the Rail Freight Group to look at rail freight facilities. In Hungary, we spoke to senior figures in the Government and the railway industry about rail freight. The bulk of the rail freight system is still publicly owned and it is doing well. It makes a profit and provides the Government with funds that help the Hungarian people. There is a small private sector that is losing money but there is still pressure to privatise. If the Hungarian rail freight system was privatised and bought up, perhaps by a Russian oligarch with plenty of spare cash, the profits would not go to the Hungarian people. It could go towards buying expensive football clubs in Britain&#151;who knows? At present, the benefits of that publicly owned freight system go to the Hungarian people. That is what we should allow those countries to do, not force them to privatise.

 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. There is a serious debate both in the EU as a whole and in its member states. I hope that I am participating in that debate and making a strong point for the social democratic systems that worked so well after the second world war, which are being systematically dismantled. That is a great mistake. Opposition Members may choose a neo-liberal approach. We might choose a social democratic approach, but we should be able to choose democratically in our own countries. We should not be told, or even advised, by the bureaucracy of the EU to operate in a particular way.

<p>
<a name="51124-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_86">I finish by referring to corruption, which seems to be almost endemic in the EU. The European Court of Auditors has failed to approve the EU&#039;s accounts for 10&nbsp;or 11&nbsp;years running. The European aid system is inefficient and corrupt and the aid does not go to the right places. The Department for International Development does a much better job, and we have made that point many times as well. The EU must look hard to itself if we want to stop corruption developing or even getting worse in countries such as Romania and Bulgaria, which are much weaker.

I have repeatedly stated that I am in favour of enlargement, but I have asked as a rider to that argument what kind of Europe we want and what kind of Europe we should have. The problem is exacerbated or illustrated by, for example, what has been going on in France and the Netherlands. The rejection of the referendums in those two countries illustrates the political divorce that has emerged between the people and the elites, whether in individual countries or the EU as a whole.

We are still waiting for the Government to announce what they will do having secured the Second Reading of the European Union Bill, which dealt with the constitution. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not know what the Minister is chuntering about&#151;perhaps he would like to intervene.

 I regard that as a pretty irrelevant comment. The nature and form of the EU will be affected by these accession arrangements. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says that the current gross domestic product per capita of the 25&nbsp;member states is $21,800. That figure happens to be half that of Norway and Switzerland, and it will inevitably decrease when Bulgaria and Romania join. The important point is that we have a regressive, declining EU economy, which will be made worse by bringing in countries that will inevitably drag that figure further down. We could avoid a lot of those difficulties if we were to have a different kind of Europe.

<a name="stpa_90">The kind of Europe that I should like would be based on associate status, along the lines of the European Free Trade Association.

Indeed, a recent ICM poll showed that, when the people of this country were asked what kind of EU they wanted&#151;whether they wanted one as it stands now, or one with associate status along EFTA lines&#151;60&nbsp;per cent. of all those asked and 68&nbsp;per cent. of 18&nbsp;to 24-year-olds said that they wanted the latter.

<a name="stpa_91">I refer, for example, to the Treasury pamphlet that the Chancellor of Exchequer produced the other day in which he clearly repudiated even the social model for Europe. I should be interested to know whether or not the Minister was party to that pamphlet, which amounted to a repudiation of the existing European economic model. The Chancellor called for more global markets and more competitiveness. He illustrated his concern that the Lisbon agenda was not functioning properly.

 Is the hon.

Gentleman would agree? Does he not agree that his stereotype of what it is to be sceptical or pro-European is wildly out of date, when fervent pro-Europeans such as Jacques Delors agree with him, at least in part, on something as crucial as social policy?

 I am extremely glad that that is taking place. It certainly was not when I met Mr. Delors in the 1980s, since when things have changed significantly and, I am glad to say, in the right direction. Indeed, my point about the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister shows that the glimmerings of realism are coming into the picture. The hon.

<a name="stpa_93">The application of the Maastricht surveillance criteria is about as deadly, boring and tedious a subject as one can possibly imagine, but I was glancing at a book in the Library last night about the impact of EUROSTAT case law. I suspect that no one has the faintest idea that such a book is there to be read, even if they had the time or inclination to do so. However, the application has an extremely serious impact on the way in which the criteria for each member states are collated by the European Union through EUROSTAT. That is the basis on which economic forecasting is made and economic criteria are judged for member states, including&#151;under the Bill&#151;accession states such as Bulgaria and Romania.

 I would go further&#151;I cite the idea that such countries should be fined, although countries that are not members of the eurozone do not suffer a fine. Look at the situation regarding Italy, for example. The stability and growth pact is such an enormous failure because it is simply unrealistic. It does not work, and the remedies that are applied to ensure that there can somehow be compliance with the rules impose further penalties on countries, which makes it even less likely that they can achieve their objectives.

Members in the Chamber that the charter is alive and kicking. It did not go down with the constitution&#151;I can say that unequivocally. Although it appeared to have done so, it did not in practice. The European Court of Justice itself is applying the criteria of the charter, so that will be of direct relevance to countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, especially given the problems to which the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) referred in her important remarks. For example, there is the problem of the Roma.

As the Commission is able to do that due to its right of initiation under the existing treaties, nothing can stop the charter from being brought in piecemeal through every piece of legislation that is initiated.

It will be enforced by our courts and by the European Court of Justice. The Bulgarians and the Romanians will find that the problems with their economies, which have already been explained by the Minister and my hon.

That was the root cause of the reason why the French and the Dutch rejected the constitution. People said, &quot;Oh, that was because the French didn&#039;t like Chirac,&quot; but they did not like Chirac because the economy was not working, and the economy was not working because of these crazy rules, all of which are based on an ideology that does not work&#151;it does not work for the developing world, either.

I shall not mention their names because that would be unreasonable. They said that they had been enthusiastic about entry to the EU, probably, one must say, because they knew that they would get a lot of money out of it, as well as stability and improved relationships with other countries to address the vacuum in central and eastern Europe on matters of defence and foreign policy. However, they said that their enthusiasm was becoming significantly reduced. What they had anticipated is not what is happening. They criticised the regulation and interference of European legislation and said that before joining the EU, the Czech Republic had been self-sufficient in agricultural products, but owing to European regulations, it is now a net importer. The sugar beet market had been badly hit by the imposition of EU regulations, and unemployment is coming out of that. That is all because of crazy European rules, which are doing devastating damage to countries that have just come into the EU.

 I am glad that my hon. Friend has done that research. Again, that is the realistic position.

If they have to come in on terms that simply will not work for them, the case for reform is crystal clear. As I said, the Czechs have discovered serious drawbacks to the system.

If we continue to pursue such policies, an implosion is on its way. The Prime Minister knows that because of the failure of the Lisbon agenda, his presidency and the French and Dutch referendums. Those failures are indicative of what is to come, and the warnings have been given. It is up to those in government to listen. If they do not, when Europe dissolves into greater difficulties, and perhaps even chaos, with movements to the far right on the back of instability and racial tension, the responsibility will lie with the Government, their Ministers and the European Union.

<p><a name="st_175"><a name="51124-18_spnew8"><b> Mr. David </b> 
: This has developed into an interesting and broad debate. I hope that the House will forgive me if I try to bring things back to Bill and the clause in particular. I shall also keep my comments brief.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_106">I have visited Bulgaria regularly for a number of years and have seen at first hand the remarkable progress there. There is genuine political consensus and, I believe, a feeling throughout the country that joining the EU is essentially desirable because it will enhance the economy and reinforce Bulgaria&#039;s democratic development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_107">Successful negotiations have led to the treaty that we are considering. The European Commission has conducted various reports. Recently, however, it concluded that there are serious shortcomings in Bulgaria and that problems need to be addressed rapidly and firmly before it is adjudged ready to join the EU. The comprehensive monitoring report set out clearly and starkly both what progress has been made and what needs to be done. We are waiting for the final recommendation of the European Commission to the Council in April or May next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_108">Among the concerns expressed by the European Commission about Bulgaria are the large number of uninsured vehicles, shortcomings in the veterinary sector, and the need to reinforce the administrative structures, in particular with a view to administering European agricultural and structural funds effectively. Concerns have been expressed about the criminal justice system and, as has been mentioned, how the Roma minority are treated.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_109">Some of those issues were discussed yesterday in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; European Scrutiny Committee. The Bulgarian ambassador took part in that discussion. He went to great lengths to reassure us that the concerns were being taken seriously and were being addressed effectively. It is worth reinforcing that great strides have been made in Bulgaria. The country is now a true democracy. Democratic reforms are firm and, in my view, irrevocable. Most of the European acquis communautaire has been implemented in Bulgarian law. Economic growth is consistent. In 2004, for example, the rate was 5.6&nbsp;per cent. It undoubtedly has a functioning market economy, as the European Commission concluded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-18_para14">
<a name="stpa_110">In fairness, however, it is true to say that over the past few years there was a decline in the momentum towards reform, but since the election of a new Government in June this year, the reform process has gained momentum. A new penal code has been introduced, and there cannot be any doubt that there is a strong political commitment to ensure that the remaining reforms are implemented effectively and speedily.

<a name="stpa_111">The European Commission should give an objective analysis of what is happening in Bulgaria. It is important, both for the interests of both Bulgaria and the EU, that the Commission make a firm assessment. However, there is danger of being too insistent that all the i&#039;s are dotted and all the t&#039;s are crossed so that things are meticulously in place before Bulgaria can join the EU. In the last wave of accession, a number of countries expressed concern about Slovakia&#039;s preparedness to join the EU, given that other accession states had made advances. Nevertheless, the benefit of the doubt was given to Slovakia, and since it joined the EU, it has made remarkable progress. Arguably, it has done so quicker than any other country that joined at the time.

<a name="stpa_112">We should look fairly and objectively at what is happening in Bulgaria, but we must also look at the way in which things are changing before we determine whether a one-year delay would be detrimental to progress in that country or would enhance it. We should be firm but fair. As well as looking at what is happening in Bulgaria and Romania, we must always keep at the back of our mind the centrality of the process of enlargement to Europe&#039;s development. A vision of the EU is developing not as a union of elitist or exclusive nation states but as an expanding union always seeking to embrace more countries. That is a positive process.

 The hon. Gentleman is right that there is move away from elitism, but does he not accept that the problem will not be resolved without radical reform of the system? However, when reforms are proposed, particularly on the acquis communautaire, nothing happens.

<p><a name="st_177"><a name="51124-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. David: </b> 
 It is important to acknowledge that reforms are under way in the EU. Reforms introduced by the Government both before and during their presidency have struck a chord with many EU states, particularly central European countries that have recently joined. There is an increasing acceptance that what we want is not a highly integrated centralised state but a loose association of sovereign countries that pool their interests from time to time.
</p>








<p><a name="st_178"><a name="51124-19_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bone: </b> 
 I am pleased to hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but does he not agree that the EU and states party to the North American Free Trade Agreement should join together to create a transatlantic free trade area?

<a name="stpa_113">To return to the central point that I was making in response to the hon.

That is the best definition that I can give off the top of my head of what the EU is developing into, and I believe that enlargement will reinforce that development.

<a name="51124-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_114">In conclusion, having visited Bulgaria on many occasions over a number of years, it is my impression that most Bulgarian people take that view. They do not want a giant, centralised European Union that will rob them of their national identity, but they do want to be part of a progressive, forward-looking EU that gives them security both politically and in broader defence issues. That is extremely positive, and it is why I trust that in the near future&#151;hopefully, in January 2007&#151;both Romania and Bulgaria will meet the terms of entry and become full members of the European Union.
</p>








<p><a name="st_180"><a name="51124-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Dodds </b> 
: I, too, intend to be brief. In general, I welcome the enlargement of the European Union, because it will help it to become the loose association to which the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) referred, and diminish the centralised, unified approach that has characterised it thus far. The Bill is therefore welcome.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_115">It is important to remember how far countries in the former Soviet sphere of influence have come. Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and parts of the former Soviet Union are now members of the EU, and are party to discussions about the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. That demonstrates how far they have come in recent years, as the Minister said. We welcome that progress, but we accept that there is still much more work to be done in those countries. Leverage can be exerted to reinforce human rights, tackle corruption and improve the judicial process, particularly in Bulgaria and Romania, both in the coming period and for a short time following accession. After that, however, the pressure that can be brought to bear will dissipate rapidly, so a signal should be sent to Romania and Bulgaria that accession is not an automatic process. Genuine progress must be made in a number of areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_116">I should like to focus on human rights, the judicial process and the rule of law in Romania. I sympathise greatly with the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman), who spoke forcefully about her constituent&#039;s family. I trust that everything will be done to assist her in her efforts to achieve justice. A church in my constituency that helped to run an orphanage in Romania approached me because it was concerned about child trafficking&#151;an issue raised earlier in our short debate&#151;and the way in which the Romanian authorities can interfere arbitrarily in children&#039;s welfare. Laws on adoption, for instance, are loosely applied. The church has expressed genuine concern about children&#039;s welfare and the attitude of the Romanian state towards the subject. In the coming period when, as I said, leverage can be applied, I urge the Minister and the Government to do everything in their power to ensure that such matters are progressed, particularly in relation to human rights and the rule of law. It should not be a question of turning a blind eye to some of these issues for the greater good. We should make Romania and Bulgaria, particularly the Romanian authorities, live up to their responsibilities as part of a wider Europe.

<a name="stpa_117">I shall be brief, as I spoke at some length on Second Reading. We should not underestimate the importance of the accession treaty. Although we are dealing with only two countries this year, whereas last year we were dealing with the accession of 10&nbsp;nations to the EU, there are some important strategic objectives and changes that need to be borne in mind.For the first time, the EU will reach to the Black sea, and Greece will be connected to the rest of the EU. Romania will have the seventh largest population in the EU, after Spain, Poland and the big four. This is a significant enlargement, not just a tidying-up exercise.

<p>
<a name="51124-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_118">I agree with other speakers about the changes that have taken place in Bulgaria and Romania over the past 20&nbsp;years. I first travelled to those countries in the late 1980s as a student. The changes since then, in the space of one generation, are incredibly dramatic and could serve as a model for many other countries seeking to introduce free market economies, democratic systems and so on. It was the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher who first outlined in the Chamber the possible accession of these two countries. The first mention of the possibility of Bulgarian and Romanian accession to the European Union came on 31&nbsp;January 1990&nbsp;in a speech made by the then hon. Member for Warwickshire, North, now my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude), who said that he was looking forward to seeing various countries join the EU, including Bulgaria and Romania. Accession and enlargement have long been on the Conservative agenda.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_119">I shall outline some of the problems that we need to bear in mind with the accession. Bulgaria and Romania are not necessarily perfect candidates, but I am not sure that three or four years back, Poland and others were perfect candidates. The first problem is corruption, about which other hon. Members have spoken. It is a problem in Bulgaria more than in Romania. The second is organised crime, mafia-style crime problems and assassinations. Only about four weeks ago in Bulgaria, one of the country&#039;s most senior bankers was assassinated. Significant improvements still need to be made on environmental matters in towns such as Ruse and in areas of Transylvania.

<p><a name="st_191"><a name="51124-20_spnew0"><b> Mr. Brady: </b> 
 As we come to consider the part of the Bill dealing with the free movement of workers, one of the unintended aspects of free movement of workers applies to the Conservative Benches: my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh), who was to have dealt with the amendment, has to be in another Committee shortly, so I am moving into her shoes&#151;an unwise thought, perhaps.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_126">Clause 2&nbsp;and the amendment tabled by the Opposition Front-Bench team, No. 9, relate to an important aspect of the Bill and some of the implications of membership. It is particularly important because of the recent history of the accession of new member states to the EU. Clause 2&nbsp;represents a welcome acceptance by the Government that their projections of the consequences of the free movement of workers from the accession countries last year were wrong by a significant factor. Whereas they suggested that only a few thousand workers would come to the UK following accession, some 277,000&nbsp;workers have come under the registration scheme. I accept that that process has gone smoothly and there have been no particular difficulties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_127">It is interesting that the Government none the less saw the importance of putting the measures in place in clause 2. As was alluded to by a number of hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) and Opposition Members, the two accession countries that we are considering today are quite different from 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Nov 2005 : Column 1706</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>many of those that came into the EU last year. The difference in economic strength is much more profound. The provisions that the Government are putting in place and the powers they are seeking to take to control the free movement of workers in that context are wise. It is inevitably possible that, given the marked difference in income between Romania and Bulgaria and the existing member states, especially some of the wealthier member states such as the United Kingdom, there could be significant pressure of migration. It is sensible that the Government should take a precautionary approach regarding the free movement of workers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_128">That is particularly important in view of the geographical perspective provided by my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands), relating to the routes into Europe that the new accession countries constitute both for people trafficking and for the drugs trade. Bulgaria is known to be a major transit country for illegal drugs, as well as a producer country. It is important and appropriate that the measures should be taken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_129">The Government have, however, not yet enlightened the Committee about the outcome of their assessment or analysis, whether they anticipate using the powers in clause 2, and whether they envisage instituting any major control for a transitional period, making use of the available derogations to prevent significant unforeseen movement of people into the United Kingdom. That is why my hon. Friends and I have tabled amendment No. 9, which seeks to introduce some transparency to the process. It would require the Government to lay before Parliament no later than four months before the date of accession a report on the Government&#039;s assessment of the effect of the free movement of workers from the acceding states, and it would also require subsequent reports on the actual effect of such movements of workers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_130">As I have said, given the marked difference between the predictions about the previous 10&nbsp;accession countries and the actual number of migrants who have come to the United Kingdom, it seems important and appropriate that the Government should publish a frank and detailed assessment of what they anticipate will happen and provide this House with regular, detailed updates as the accessions move forwards.

I do not know what our way of life is in the United Kingdom, and I do not exactly know what our way of life is in Europe. Our way of life is internationalised and we operate in a global world. The movement of people is one of the key features of a global economy and an internationalised society, which is not something new&#151;if one reads biblical history, there were lots of movements of people in the period before Christ. If one considers the history of the United States and Canada in the 19th century in particular, there were massive movements of people. From time to time, people have moved into EU countries. In the 1960s, Turkish immigrants into Germany specifically serviced the up-and-coming light engineering industries. In this country, especially in the 1950s and 1960s, we experienced waves of immigration from the Caribbean and elsewhere, again to meet our particular labour needs.

In the case of the ALMO in Newcastle, we need to train local people as best we can, but we should not be embarrassed if we fail to train sufficient numbers and must look elsewhere to find skilled labour.

<a name="stpa_137">When I ask the Government to be positive in their interpretation of clause 2, my central point is that migration has changed the nature of our economy in the same way as Mexican migrants have changed the American economy. When I studied economics a very long time ago, we referred to overheating in the south and the lack of heat in the north&#151;the main reason why we had to adopt deflationary policies was that the south overheated when the necessary labour was not available. Labour demand shot up wage rates, which had a detrimental effect on the whole economy.

<a name="stpa_138">Migration has enabled a number of countries, including our own, Scandinavian countries and Ireland, to maintain a high level of aggregate demand and to continue to have growth without having wage inflation. Jobs have been filled by people from other parts of Europe, particularly. That is the same pattern throughout the developed world. In that context, migration has been a positive factor in the UK economy. It has not been a negative factor for those who have been left, for instance, in Moldova, Romania or Bulgaria. People working here have been remitting funds to their own countries. That has helped to raise living standards in those countries. Statistics show that more than 40&nbsp;per cent. of Moldova&#039;s GNP is the result of remittances from countries in the EU. That is positive for everyone.

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. I would not deny that in the short term. However, there is the relationship between Ireland and the United States. It could be said that 15&nbsp;or 20&nbsp;years ago the immigration of skilled technicians in the IT industry and in other industries to the United States denuded the Irish economy of key workers. Once those people have enjoyed some life in the United States and perhaps picked up other skills, many of their skills have returned to Ireland. For example, some of my wife&#039;s family have returned from making their money, so to speak, in the United States. They have come back to Ireland, where they continue to run businesses and so on. The same has happened to some extent already in Poland. Some people have returned to Poland who perhaps have been within the EU for some while. An optimistic prospect is that the same will happen in Romania and Bulgaria.

<p><a name="st_198"><a name="51124-21_spnew3"><b> Nia Griffith  (Llanelli) (Lab):</b> 
 The Bill sets out the necessary legislation for the freedom of movement of workers from Romania and Bulgaria. Hand in hand with the Bill, we need to examine carefully what happens when migrant workers come to this country from new EU member states. Many of these workers are enticed here by promises of terms and conditions that sound better in theory than they do in reality. We need particularly to tighten up on the use of zero-hours contracts by agencies, which mean that workers who come here to take up full-time posts can find that sometimes they have so few hours of work in a week that they do not earn enough in that week to pay their rent. We need to improve agency regulation to eliminate sharp practices and ensure a level playing field between agencies that abide by the rules and those who ruthlessly exploit workers. We need to ensure that the increasing use of migrant labour does not undercut our workers and depress wage levels.

<a name="51124-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_142">We also need a better transfer of information between all EU member states about dangerous offenders to avoid a repeat of a dreadful incident in which a nasty sexual attack was carried out by a man who had come from eastern Europe to work in my locality. Only afterwards did it became clear that he was a known offender with a previous conviction for rape in his own country. I was horrified to discover from the local chief inspector of police that there is no transfer of information about sex offenders from original or from new EU countries. We must develop a proper unified system of notification of such offenders across the whole of the EU to reassure and protect local people.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_145">Both parts of the amendment are extremely sensible. The first part would ensure that an assessment takes place no later than four months before the accession. That is not fundamentally different from what happened last year, when the Home Office announced the worker registration scheme on 23&nbsp;February 2004, in advance of accession. In other words, an assessment was, rightly, made at that time, and the rules were changed slightly. It would be sensible to make an assessment four months in advance to judge what the effects are likely to be based on how the previous accession has gone, and so on.

<a name="stpa_146">The second part of the amendment would ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny of the system. That does not mean that we should review the two countries&#039; membership of the European Union but that we should review worker registration from those two countries over a period of seven years. That is an eminently sensible provision. If we are to have the worker registration scheme, it is sensible to use the data that arise from it to see whether it is working properly. Last year, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart), said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;The purpose of the scheme is to allow us to track properly our commitment. It will give good information to the authorities and the Home Office about how, in practice, the right to work of people from accession countries is operating.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_149">I do not say that because I believe that a flood of people will come in from Bulgaria and Romania. I think that a healthy number of people will come to this country bringing very useful skills. However, it would set a good precedent to do this now for the purposes of future EU accession. If, say, Turkey or Russia become EU accession countries, there may be genuine concerns about a very large number of people coming into this country and distorting our labour market. It would be useful to have a precedent in place to ensure that Parliament assesses the likely impact of the accession four months beforehand and then monitors the actual impact every six months for seven years. It is better to set that in stone in 2005&nbsp;rather than some point in the future when large countries may join the EU.

As a dedicated Everton supporter, I emphasise that rivalries are put aside in such cases. She knows that the solidarity between football supporters in our city runs deep and our thoughts are with her. She will have the solidarity of football supporters everywhere and I wish her well in her campaign. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary leads on such matters. Through me, he would like to reiterate the offer of a further meeting with her and the family to ascertain whether we can make some progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_152">Clause 2&nbsp;is consistent with the Government&#039;s managed migration agenda, which makes decisions on the UK&#039;s labour market dependent on the number and type of gaps that exist. The clause provides enabling powers, which will allow the Government to set the terms on which any access will be granted to Bulgarian and Romanian workers after accession during a transition period. That can range from maintaining a form of the current work permit arrangements to full, free access to the market, including a version of the worker registration scheme that is in place for nationals of the eight accession countries. A decision will be made closer to the accession date. I listened to the remarks of the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) but I hope that he understands that it is right to make the decision when we know more about the date of accession for the two countries.

 That is precisely one of the factors that we would seek to ascertain in the run-up to accession, which is why it is premature to make any firm commitments about the situation.

<a name="stpa_156">We believe that it is the right approach, with the approval of Parliament, to judge the decision in response to circumstances at the time of accession, whether that be 1&nbsp;January 2007&nbsp;or 2008.

<a name="stpa_157">My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) made a helpful contribution, in which he urged me and other Home Office Ministers to consider the positive side of migration, and to take a positive view of the measures before the House. He is right to put it in that way, as we should conduct this debate positively. If some of the newspaper headlines at the time were to be believed, the world was going to end the day after the last round of enlargement. Of course, that did not happen. As he rightly pointed out, a story is run in parts of the media

<br>&nbsp;<br>that migration is wholly bad, or is to be tolerated at the edges for bringing a marginal benefit. He is right to take those arguments head-on, and the Government should do so. As he said, the experience of opening our labour markets and allowing greater access than do some other European countries has been good for the UK economy, and for the regional economies of this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_158">I would wager a lot of money that those 293,000&nbsp;people have put far more into this country than they have taken out. As the figures show, there has been very little recourse to in-work benefits and other social security support. Their contribution is therefore huge. They are filling gaps in our labour market and performing a vital role. I accept my hon. Friend&#039;s basic point that our precise decision must be guided at the time by relevant factors such as those that I have laid out. I agree, however, that our earlier decision has been good for business and the regional economies of this country, and for our standing in the European Union, particularly among the 10&nbsp;member states that we are talking about today.

<a name="51124-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_159">I want to run through some of the structure of the clause before turning to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West. Subsections (1) and (2) allow regulations to be made that will grant Bulgarian and Romanian workers the rights of European economic area nationals to enter and work in the UK. Subsections (3) and (4) provide for the implementation of a possible compulsory registration scheme. Subsection (5) provides for supplementary or transitional measures which may be required, for example, to move Bulgarian and Romanian nationals currently in the UK under a work permit scheme to a future registration scheme. It also allows for the regulations to make different provision for different cases. They could, for instance, distinguish between Bulgarian and Romanian workers, or indeed between plumbers and doctors. That relates to some of the information sought by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West a moment ago, which I shall try to provide for him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_160">Subsection (5) relates to an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen). I am relieved that he is not here to speak to it, as it was entirely pointless, and the Committee will not now be delayed by unnecessary debate on it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_161">Let me correct a popular misconception about the free movement of persons within the EU. That right exists outside clause 2, and it is important for that to be made clear. Free movement is a fundamental principle of the European Union. Under the accession treaty, nationals of Bulgaria and Romania will have the right to enter and reside in all the existing member states for a wide variety of purposes, including holidays, study, retirement and indeed business activity. That was agreed unanimously by the 25&nbsp;current member states.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_162">The transitional measures allowed by the treaty relate solely to the free movement of workers. Nationals of Bulgaria and Romania affected by the measures will not automatically be allowed to enter and reside in the 25&nbsp;EU member countries for the purpose of employment, but they will be able to do so for the other purposes to which I referred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_163">For those reasons, the transitional periods are limited in scope. They are also limited in time. All the measures for which clause 2&nbsp;provides will be relevant for a

<br>&nbsp;<br>maximum of seven years after accession. Free movement for workers across the Union remains the medium-term objective, and it is essential for the efficient functioning of the single market. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe made that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_164">That is why the accession treaty requires the Council to conduct a review of restrictions on access to workers about two years after accession. Indeed, we are close to the date for the review of restrictions imposed on new member states in May 2004. The Government will communicate their decision on any further arrangements in spring next year. It is likely that, following the review, several more of the 15&nbsp;EU member states will join the UK, Sweden and Ireland in allowing full access to their labour markets. That will be a positive development for them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_165">As I have said, our experience of enlargement has been extremely positive. Most of the workers who have travelled to the UK since May 2004&nbsp;are young and have taken jobs throughout the country that have been left vacant. They have been employed in a broad range of industries, from health care to business administration to farming&#151;industries in which there are serious gaps. They are contributing to our economic growth and to our tax revenues. It seems that many young people are coming for short periods to find out what living in this country is like, and then going back. That can only be a positive development, and I believe that it will benefit both countries in the long term.

<p><a name="st_207"><a name="51124-22_spnew6"><b> Mr. Brady: </b> 
 Does the Minister share the view expressed&#151;I think&#151;by the hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) that one effect of the arrival of a large number of young migrant workers has been the depression of UK wage rates?
</p>








<p><a name="st_208"><a name="51124-22_spnew7"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 All those working under the worker registration scheme have full employment protection and full access to the national minimum wage. There is no difference between a British worker and another EU national in that respect. As these workers are filling gaps in the labour market, I am not sure that I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s analysis. He probably speaks to the CBI often, and I expect he is aware that it strongly supports these measures. I suspect that it will continue to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_166">I believe that amendment No. 9&nbsp;is premature. It asks us to include a requirement for a report on the effect of the free movement of workers from the acceding states. Actually, it assumes that we have taken the decision to allow that. However, as I have explained, that decision has not yet been taken, so building such a commitment into the Bill is premature.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_167">I hope to offer the hon. Gentleman some assurances that we can meet the effect of the amendment, so that it will not be necessary for him to press it. For example, as I have already mentioned, we undertake to carry out research into the potential effects of opening access to the UK labour market before a decision is taken to do so, and we would of course share that information with the House. We will continue to monitor the position and, should the decision be taken to open access to our labour markets, he will know that regulations would create the basis for any transitional arrangements. He will also know that those regulations would be subject to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Nov 2005 : Column 1715</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the affirmative procedure, so there would be an opportunity to give them full parliamentary scrutiny. That also meets the point raised by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham: parliamentary scrutiny is guaranteed under clause 2. I can also give a commitment to laying as much research as possible before the House in order to have a fully informed debate on the effect of the regulations. The amendment, which would place a rigid requirement directly in the Bill, is therefore unnecessary.

 The Minister is being very helpful and I am grateful. Can he be just a little more helpful by undertaking to publish regular analyses to update the position following accession?
</p>








<p><a name="st_210"><a name="51124-23_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 I certainly will. The hon. Gentleman will know that, since we set up the worker registration scheme, the Home Office, together with the Department for Work and Pensions and other Departments, is monitoring the effect on the labour market by analysing the figures relating to that scheme. In respect of A8&nbsp;nationals, the statistics are published on a quarterly basis via the accession monitoring report and the latest figures were issued this week. I hope that I have persuaded him that his amendment is unnecessary as we fully intend to continue the arrangements whereby regular quarterly reports are made available. The whole point of the scheme is to enable us to track and monitor the effect on the labour market and on the take-up of social security benefits. As I say, we will want to share such information with the House as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_168">I hope that I have dealt with all the points raised in the debate. The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) made an important point about human trafficking. The Home Office wholly concurs in emphasising the importance of making progress in that respect. As part of our presidency of the EU, we have given considerable priority to that matter and we have sought to make concrete progress in that regard. Work is being carried out by Europol and others, particularly with respect to Romania. We most certainly are focused on dealing with that matter, though the Bill does not include direct provisions relating to it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_169">My hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) raised an important point about the potentially criminal behaviour of people in the worker registration scheme. She mentioned a case from her constituency and I assure her that such people, if they were imprudent enough to commit offences during their stay here, would be subject to the full force of the UK criminal justice system. Powers remain at the disposal of the Home Office to deal with European nationals in respect of removal where criminal behaviour is involved. The main point is that the full force of British law will apply. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend.
</p>

<a name="51124-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_170">We have had a good and encouraging debate. It is pleasing to see the Conservative party coming round to acknowledging the benefits of managed and legal migration to this country.

<p>
<a name="51124-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_171">We have had a good afternoon&#039;s debate, with stimulating and thoughtful contributions from all parts of the House. Let me begin, as I did on Second Reading, by paying heartfelt and genuine tribute to the all-party nature of the consensus in this debate at every stage of the Bill&#039;s passage. I welcome the strong and powerful arguments that we have heard in support of enlargement, and in particular of Romania&#039;s and Bulgaria&#039;s accession. It is clear that all Members recognise the important role that enlargement has already played in developing the prosperous and stable Europe in which we live today. Romania&#039;s and Bulgaria&#039;s accession will further contribute to political stability and security in our neighbourhood, and create new economic opportunities for British citizens and companies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_172">As we have discussed, it is clear that there are a number of areas in which more work is needed if Romania and Bulgaria are to be ready for European Union membership in 2007. The Commission&#039;s comprehensive monitoring report, which was published in October&#151;it has been the subject of debate already this afternoon&#151;set out a range of issues in the fields of justice and home affairs, agriculture, environment and administrative capacity that require urgent attention. I know that this was a matter of concern to the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds), and I can assure him and the House that we are working closely with both Governments to help them to implement these&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outstanding commitments. In recent meetings with both countries&#039; Europe Ministers, I underlined the importance of tackling the remaining problems. I am pleased to say that both expressed a real commitment to implementing the necessary reforms, and they set out a number of areas where progress is already being made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_173">This Third Reading is an important and historic moment. The Bill may be small, but its impact will be substantial. For 30&nbsp;million people, European Union accession represents a new dawn and the final step in a difficult journey from dictatorship to democracy. The impact of accession will not, of course, be limited to Romania and Bulgaria; their accession will bring benefits to all of Europe. I know that I speak on behalf of the whole House when I say that the United Kingdom looks forward to welcoming Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union. I commend the Bill to the House.

<a name="stpa_174">We have had some very useful contributions to this debate, including a helpful one from the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham). He gave us some assistance, thereby enabling us to withdraw our amendment on the free movement of workers. My hon.

<a name="stpa_175">I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) has returned to his place. He was quite right to raise some of the more profound issues to do with the future shape and direction of the EU as a whole and the type of EU that Romania and Bulgaria might join. In not too many years&#039; time, other countries such as Turkey and Croatia will become members, and even Russia may do so one day, although that may take a little longer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_176">The Opposition are pleased to welcome the progress being made on enlargement, both with this Bill and with the beginning of the accession talks for Turkey and Croatia. Our proceedings have been very consensual so far, so I cannot resist saying that it looks increasingly as though the steps to enlargement may be the only achievements of the UK&#039;s EU presidency. This week, Foreign Ministers from various member states have commented on the discussions about the future EU budget. For example, the Finnish Foreign Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;As there is nothing new to discuss, I have got nothing new to say&quot;,</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_178">and the Portuguese Foreign Minister said:

<a name="51124-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_179">I am pleased to restore a little contention and rancour to our debate, as we do not like to have too much uninterrupted consensus in our proceedings. However, it is fortunate that we have something to show for the UK presidency, especially in respect of the more difficult talks about Turkey, and I have given the Minister and his colleagues credit for that before. The accession of Bulgaria and Romania should bring both countries great benefits, as it will ultimately to all member states.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_180">Enlargement is hugely important, both for the progress that it brings in the candidate countries and for what it does to aid the development of a more diverse and flexible EU. Recent discussions about the future EU budget have sometimes given the unfortunate impression that the whole point of membership for some of the newer members and applicant countries is to obtain grants and cash transfers from the EU or the wealthier members. That is entirely wrong, as it leads to the absurd proposition that has been raised this week&#151;that the new members are paying for the UK rebate. Given that the UK is a major net contributor to the UK, that is clearly nonsense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_181">Yet we must stress that the real value of EU membership for Bulgaria, Romania and the others that have joined recently is that it will reinforce their

We very much support the proposed accession that we have debated this afternoon, but the Minister knows well that the path to membership for Romania and Bulgaria will not be easy. The enthusiasm for the objective behind the Bill is shared by all parties, but that should not lead the Government or the EU to proceed uncritically in their assessments of the readiness of the two applicant countries for entry in 2007&nbsp;or 2008.

 I should also like to join in this festival of cross-party consensus, which I trust will be a rare, if valuable occasion. It underlines the importance of this positive step not only for Romania and Bulgaria but for the European Union as a whole. I join others in reminding the House that the vision of an ever-wider and more diverse EU has for a long time been a particularly British vision of the European Union and before it the European Community, which has united political opinion across parties for a long time. It is good to see that that fundamental view has held true here today. It is not a view that is shared in other parts of the EU. I doubt that in Paris one would find quite the same amount of cross-party consensus on this latest step in the journey of EU enlargement. It remains an expression of great strategic vision on the part of Britain as a whole that we have prosecuted this process as successfully as we have.

<a name="51124-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_184">Some important points have been made during the consideration of the Bill about the final steps of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria into the EU and the absolute need for real rigour in ensuring that the outstanding measures that need to be taken in those two countries are taken and that the safeguard measures are used in all seriousness and not merely as a fig leaf for enlargement and accession at all costs. That concern about the final stages of accession should not be viewed as some last-minute series of obstacles to their rightful claim to join the EU. It is born of a serious belief that if further enlargements are to occur in a politically, economically and socially sustainable way in the decades ahead, we must set the right precedent today.

 I was disappointed that the Bill was not amended in Committee, but I was grateful for the comments made by both Ministers. I broadly welcome the Bill. Enlargement of the European Union is good for everyone. The larger the single market, the more prosperous its peoples become. Clearly, the addition of 30&nbsp;million consumers from Bulgaria and Romania is to be welcomed. It is an added bonus that we are bringing in people who have been freed from the tyranny of communism. I would go on to argue for the enlargement 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Nov 2005 : Column 1719</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of the EU to such an extent that it joins with the North&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American Free Trade Agreement to create a transatlantic free trade area, which would create a huge market and be of enormous benefit to its peoples. In this regard, we should welcome and encourage Romania and Bulgaria into the EU.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_185">I have concerns on two fronts. One is the process of Bulgaria and Romania&#039;s accession. The other is the effects on the UK of these countries joining the European Union. Bulgaria and Romania are two countries that are only now emerging from the throes of Soviet domination. The defeat of communism in those countries and the creation of freedom and democracy were of course championed by Baroness Thatcher and her Conservative Governments. The two countries are now entering into the most fundamental change since the fall of communism. However, one of the great freedoms that the people of Bulgaria and Romania have gained from the fall of communism is the right to determine their own affairs and to vote on issues that affect their lives. Yet the Bulgarian and Romanian people have not been given the chance to vote on this fundamental change. That shows the ultimate failing of the system and highlights how undemocratic the process of EU accession is.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_186">The EU can demand all sorts of regulations and laws and practices, but the one thing that it does not demand is that the people of the countries acceding to it have a choice in whether they want to be part of the EU. Is that because the EU fears the verdict of the people? Has it not learned from the fiasco of the European constitution? Should it not be a condition that every country that wants to join the EU should hold a referendum?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_187">As the citizens of those two countries have not been given the chance to vote on whether they want to be part of the EU we have only the views expressed in opinion polls to show the strength of opposition to accession. Every second person surveyed in Bulgaria was concerned that their country would have to contribute more than it would receive from the EU budget. More than half of those surveyed in Bulgaria feared that accession would create difficulties for the country&#039;s farmers. In a survey commissioned by the delegation of the European Commission in Romania, 56&nbsp;per cent. of Romanians believed that accession would bring more drawbacks than advantages in the short term.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_188">The Minister may rightly point out that no such referendum was held in the United Kingdom. One sunny morning, I woke up and the people of the United Kingdom found that they were no longer in the European Community but in the European Union. The people of Britain were never given the chance to say whether they wanted to be in the EU. They were never asked whether they wanted to be in a European superstate, with its own Parliament, its own President, its own flag and its own Court, all of which is costing billions of pounds a year and represents a significant loss of British sovereignty. However, that strengthens the argument that Bulgarians and Romanians should have the right to a referendum. The citizens of those accession countries are denied a fundamental democratic choice.

<a name="51124-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_189">My second concern is that the Government have not made clear what restrictions, if any, will be imposed on the accession countries with regard to free movement to the UK, notwithstanding the Minister&#039;s earlier comments. The Government&#039;s prediction of immigration from the 10&nbsp;accession countries fell severely short of the actual figure. Surely, they need to outline the restrictions they will impose on the two accession countries before it is too late, because it could be little more than a year before Romania and Bulgaria are admitted to the EU and I do not see why we should have to wait to hear what our partners say about the issue before we make our decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_190">It is not unreasonable to ask for details about the restrictions that will be imposed on the free movement of workers from Bulgaria and Romania. There are no details in the Bill about whether people coming to the UK from Bulgaria and Romania will automatically be entitled to benefit. Will they be entitled to housing benefit, jobseeker&#039;s allowance or incapacity benefit and if so, when? The Bill does not answer those questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_191">Many of my constituents are concerned that migrants from eastern Europe are automatically entitled to benefits. I am not making that point to produce headlines; in fact, it is the reverse. It can be argued that migration has not significantly increased the number of people on benefit, but because it is not clear in the Bill what the restrictions might be, we may attract headlines when Bulgaria and Romania accede.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_192">My greatest concern about free movement, which is shared by all Members, is that human trafficking will be made easier under the Bill. I am particularly concerned about the hideous trafficking of young women in the sex trade. Young women from eastern Europe are promised a new life with legitimate employment and opportunities in the UK, but they finish up as sex slaves sold from one degenerate to another. They are subject to the most appalling violence and intimidation, which goes as far as telling them that back home, perhaps in Bulgaria or Romania, their child will be killed if they do not continue to serve as sex slaves. That is worse than the intimidation and violence suffered by slaves in the 19th century. Will the Government bear that outrageous and disgraceful trafficking in mind when drawing up regulations for work permits?

<a name="stpa_197">The mailbag to my constituency office is dominated by health queries, and one of the most common problems is access to essential medications. I acknowledge the extra funding that the Minister has announced recently for high-cost medications, but I want to know how much of that is genuinely new money. Perhaps the Minister can detail that during his remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_198">Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence does not extend to Northern Ireland. However, I understand that the Minister has given consideration to the matter, and perhaps he will take this opportunity to detail the latest position. In Northern Ireland, patients do not have the luxury of NICE guidelines to ensure that they receive critical treatments. The health boards can allocate their budgets as they please and can choose not to spend money on any of those essential drugs if they so desire. The Minister must give clear direction on access to those drugs.

<a name="stpa_199">Herceptin has gained significant press coverage in the Province during the past few weeks, particularly in relation to whether it can be used in the treatment of early breast cancer. An aggressive media campaign has been waged and concerned patients have threatened legal action. Those waiting for other drugs now fear that they may suffer as Herceptin is now provided to those who need it. Can the Minister guarantee that those with other cancer conditions will not suffer as a result of the funding for Herceptin?

<a name="stpa_201">That young woman is currently off work.

 I have absolutely no doubt about that.

 I commend my hon. Friend on securing the debate. Democratic Unionist Members admire her work to highlight in the local media the problem in Northern Ireland. Does she agree that many illnesses that require specialist treatment are stress-related? There is evidence to link the higher incidence of stress-related illnesses in Northern Ireland to the troubles, so we must think about the necessary funding to help people there, who are coming out of a traumatic situation. The Government must think about the problem in that context, rather than considering simply funding under the traditional methods used in the national health service.

The imbalance in the number of people on waiting lists from board to board raises fears that there will be another postcode lottery for treatment if funds become available.

We desperately need more funding for Betaferon as it is the only specific drug available for patients suffering from this dreadful debilitating disease, in that it will help to slow down the progression of their symptoms. I was told yesterday, by Dr. Hawkins when I saw him for my appointment at the City Hospital, that I no longer have remitting relapsing MS, but have now got secondary progressive MS. Even though I have been suspecting this for quite a while myself, it still came as an awful shock when it was actually confirmed. Of course it causes all kinds of emotions to run through your mind. I was very tearful when first told&#151;it was almost like being told your original diagnosis all over again. I was suddenly very frightened all over again, having got used to learning to live with it and learning to cope with the fact that everything is just starting to slow down&#151;now having to fear that I am definitely just going to get progressively worse. I was a nurse, and so this probably sounds very naive, but it&#039;s incredible how much your mind can block out when you&#039;re in self-denial. When I was told that I met the criteria for Betaferon, it at least seemed like a light at the end of the tunnel&#151;until&#151;I was told that there was a long waiting list, and it would be quite some time before I would be able to get the drug that I so desperately needed now.

Waiting times in Northern Ireland for anti-TNF medications such as Enbrel and Remicade are four times longer than they are in England, and are much worse than they are in the rest of the United Kingdom or Europe. Rheumatology provision in the Province is much worse than in Great Britain. The recent strategic review of rheumatology services in Northern Ireland called for root and branch modernisation. We have the lowest number of rheumatologists per head of population in Europe, and we need more consultant rheumatologists, specialist nurses and allied health professionals. We also need a properly resourced paediatric rheumatology service, because young people with juvenile arthritis currently have to wait four months for a first appointment. We need an appropriate paediatric rheumatology service with a lead consultant and a paediatric rheumatology nurse specialist.

The message from the Department is that there will be a generous allocation in the next financial year, but those hospitals were given to believe that that would be the case this year. Arthritis sufferers fear that the publicity over the breast cancer drug Herceptin will result in treatments such as anti-TNF medications losing out. As I said earlier, I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that the &#163;14&nbsp;million of additional money that was provided in the recent announcement will aid the availability of those drugs.

This is despite the fact that our anti-TNF waiting list now stands at well over 2&nbsp;years.

It is the only new licensed treatment for multiple myeloma in the past 10&nbsp;years, but patients in Northern Ireland cannot gain access to it, even though patients in Scotland, Wales and England can. Velcade offers both increased life expectancy and improved quality of life for patients with myeloma, who would otherwise face a terminal decline in their condition. Myeloma receives much less attention than other more notable cancers, but is a far bigger killer than both testicular and cervical cancer. Survival rates for myeloma patients have not improved in the past 10&nbsp;years, with only 23&nbsp;per cent. of patients living for more than five years.

<a name="stpa_219">In Northern Ireland a very small number of patients would be suitable for Velcade. The cost would not be great, but the difference that it could make to the patient&#039;s quality of life and life expectancy would be immense. Velcade is a licensed drug. The decision to prescribe in Northern Ireland is not dependent on any assessment authority. Denying myeloma patients the treatment is a purely financial decision. Every year in Northern Ireland between 85&nbsp;and 120&nbsp;people are newly diagnosed with the disease. In 2003, 63&nbsp;people died of it, including one young person in their 30s.

It is funded and available on the national health service in Scotland and in Wales. Although universal access to Velcade is not expected in England until NICE produces guidelines, a number of trusts already prescribe the drug. Clinicians are free to make a clinical judgment to prescribe unappraised drugs such as Velcade. Indeed, Department of Health circular 99/176&nbsp;makes that clear to all primary care trusts.

Clinical trials for Velcade carried out in Northern Ireland were so promising that one trial was halted early to ensure that as many people as possible received the treatment. It is extraordinary, therefore, that the place where so much effort was put into testing the drug is the one UK region where it is not available.

She is indeed a doughty champion, as I know from my own postbag. She passes on the letters of every constituent who writes to her and raises many of these matters in written questions. I am well aware that few MPs could claim to have such a proud record as she has in taking up the health needs of her constituents.

<a name="stpa_224">The hon. Lady asked me to make a number of guarantees, and she will understand that I may resist making them as guarantees. However, one of the questions that she posed was from a constituent, who asked, &quot;What is the point of paying all my taxes?&quot; Well, the fact of the matter is that health spending in the current year in Northern Ireland will exceed &#163;3.5&nbsp;billion. For the next two years, I have secured an additional &#163;450&nbsp;million for the health service, which is &#163;50&nbsp;million more than the previous budget. I recognise that even that sum of money, which matches the best figures in England, is not enough in Northern Ireland. In that context, I announced major reforms to the health service this week in order to find more efficiencies and put that money into front-line services.

<a name="stpa_225">Of the &#163;3.5&nbsp;billion that we will spend this year in Northern Ireland, some &#163;400&nbsp;million will be spent on prescribed medicines. The majority, &#163;340&nbsp;million, will relate to GP prescriptions, while the balance, some &#163;60&nbsp;million, will be spent in the hospital sector. Those costs represent only a proportion of the total cost of treating a patient with a particular drug. For specialist drugs, many of which the hon.

That &#163;55&nbsp;million is effectively being wasted in Northern Ireland because of prescribing habits, which must change.

In those circumstances, difficult decisions will need to be taken, and the drugs may need to be withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_230">One very recent example of a drug with huge potential is, as the hon. Lady has mentioned, Herceptin, which has been licensed and is available to patients in Northern Ireland for use in advanced breast cancer. Early results from clinical trials indicated potential benefits for suitable patients with early-stage breast cancer, which understandably led to calls from patients and their elected representatives, including the hon. Lady, for Herceptin to be made more widely available for this new indication.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_231">I took the view then&#151;I still hold it now&#151;that the decision to use Herceptin or any other drug in a new way should always be a clinical decision and that it should not be driven by political campaigns or the media, although I recognise the role that the media may play in drawing further attention to the positive effects of certain drugs. In that specific context and in what must be regarded as exceptional circumstances, I announced on 11&nbsp;November that doctors should be free to make clinical decisions about the prescription of Herceptin for patients in the earlier stages of breast cancer. It was also important, as I made clear on 11&nbsp;November, that despite what was undoubtedly an excellent campaign in the media, and an excellent campaign fought by a number of politicians for the prescription of Herceptin for early-stage breast cancer, few people in that campaign discussed the negative effects of Herceptin, and the extremely serious side effects reported in <i>The Lancet</i>, which may occur in some patients and which may include heart failure.

 Would the Minister accept that if someone is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, and despite, possibly, the downside of using a drug, if that drug gives people hope they will ask to be the guinea pigs, as might be said; and that we cannot fault people for wanting something that possibly offers a higher percentage positive outcome than a negative one?
</p>








<p><a name="st_236"><a name="51124-27_spnew1"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 Of course we could not fault anybody who is facing a life-threatening illness for asking for a new treatment. It follows also that we have a responsibility to ensure that because a patient asks for something, they are prescribed something that will make them better. Further, it follows that if we are aware of serious side effects that may occur, we have a responsibility to make them aware of serious side effects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_232">It is worth remembering that in Northern Ireland we have a very good record of dealing with breast cancer. Obviously, no doctor would want to prescribe a drug for a patient that may lead that patient to an even worse condition as a result of the application of that drug. I am reminding the hon. Lady that when we have campaigns for the prescription of drugs, often the downside of prescribing the drugs is forgotten. There is a responsibility in media campaigns and in political campaigns, when we are trying to get the application of certain drugs, to be responsible in telling patients, &quot;Yes, let us all hope that this is a wonder drug.&quot; I think that every Member of this place would want to recognise that if Herceptin holds out that hope for women in the early stages of breast cancer, it would indeed be a wonder drug if it turned out to be everything that everyone hopes of it. However, we are not yet sure of that. It is extremely important, particularly important for very vulnerable people who are facing life-threatening illnesses, that expectations are not raised to a point that we cannot at this stage fulfil.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_233">I am committed to improving access to specialist medicines that offer the potential for significant improvement in patient care. In recent years we have made some progress, although we still have further to go.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_234">For example, the number of people receiving anti-TNF treatment for severe inflammatory arthritis has doubled between April 2004&nbsp;and April 2005. In April, 178&nbsp;people were on these drugs. There are now 361&nbsp;on them. This represents an additional investment in this one area alone of about &#163;2&nbsp;million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_235">There has also been a significant increase in the number of people with multiple sclerosis receiving disease-modifying therapies such as beta interferon. The number of people receiving these drugs has increased from 442&nbsp;in April 2003&nbsp;to 577&nbsp;at present. This represents about 17&nbsp;per cent. of people with MS in Northern Ireland, and compares favourably with other areas of the UK. New drugs have also been made available to combat hepatitis C, HIV, inherited genetic disorders and cancer.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_236">Not for one moment should I or anybody in my Department be complacent. Despite the increased number of patients receiving specialist medicines, the hon. Lady rightly draws our interest to the numbers of people waiting for these drugs. I share with her the concern for the number of patients with severe inflammatory arthritis waiting for anti-TNF treatment, and the numbers waiting for treatment for MS. As the hon. Lady said, 146&nbsp;patients 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Nov 2005 : Column 1730</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are currently waiting to begin disease-modifying treatment for MS. Some of these patients have been waiting for more than 12&nbsp;months.
</p>








<p><a name="st_237"><a name="51124-27_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bone: </b> 
 Last week, the Secretary of State for Health led us to believe that nobody in the UK had to wait more than six months for treatment. That needs to be corrected because, to me, that is fundamentally untrue.
</p>








<p><a name="st_238"><a name="51124-27_spnew3"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 Unfortunately, I cannot answer for my right hon. Friend. I am the Minister with responsibility for health in Northern Ireland. Undoubtedly we will draw the hon. Gentleman&#039;s remarks to the attention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_237">Four hundred and fifty-six patients are currently waiting to begin anti-TNF treatment for severe inflammatory arthritis. Some have been waiting for more than two years, in pain and frustrated that they cannot access the treatment they need. I agree with all hon. Members that that is intolerable. Behind every waiting list there are desperate personal stories of patients experiencing great difficulty because of their condition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_238">We intend to improve access to these drugs, which undoubtedly have the potential to transform patients&#039; lives. We will not be able to turn the current position around overnight. I have, however, taken initial steps to bring about real improvements. First, an additional &#163;5&nbsp;million has already been invested to improve access to specialist medicines in Northern Ireland in the current year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_239">Secondly, I expect to be able to invest a further &#163;9&nbsp;million in 2006&#150;07. That money will be invested to fund new drug treatments and the infrastructure required to administer them. Next year, there will be significant additional investment in anti-TNF drugs, beta interferon for MS, and existing and new specialist medicines for cancer treatment. The additional investment of &#163;9&nbsp;million will help to reduce waiting lists for specialist treatments and to ensure that patients in Northern Ireland have access to the very latest specialist drugs. But even those investments will not be enough to meet the growing demand for new and existing drugs. Resources and funding will always be an issue. If we want these drugs, the Government have a responsibility to work out how we are going to pay for them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_240">The hon. Lady is aware that next week I will bring forward my proposals for water charges in Northern Ireland. Although I know that she and her hon. Friends bitterly resist those proposals, it is worth putting it on the record that the money that will come from water charges in Northern Ireland will bring an additional &#163;300&nbsp;million into the Exchequer over the next three years. We can put that money into essential services in Northern Ireland. I understand that until now the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends have resisted the introduction of water charges. However, it is important that she face up to the fact that when she asks for more money for drugs&#151;I absolutely understand that we have a responsibility to find the money for those drugs and to deal with the waiting lists&#151;we in Northern Ireland have a responsibility, where we can, to find that money from our own resources. That is appropriate if we are to create parity with the rest of England, Wales and Scotland.

<p><a name="st_239"><a name="51124-27_spnew4"><b> Mr. Donaldson: </b> 
 What assessment has the Minister made of the savings that will accrue from the changes in the governance of health in Northern Ireland outlined in the proposals published this week under the review of public administration? Will he give a commitment that savings that accrue from the structural changes in the health service will be channelled towards extra funding for specialist treatments?
</p>








<p><a name="st_240"><a name="51124-27_spnew5"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that issue. As I said this week in my statement on reform of the health service in Northern Ireland, the cost of administering the health service and social services in Northern Ireland is some &#163;155&nbsp;million. We have a population of just over 1.7&nbsp;million people. That is about the same as Kent, yet Kent has fewer than 10&nbsp;trusts and we have 19. We have four boards that in effect work as strategic health authorities. I propose to turn the 19&nbsp;trusts into five plus an ambulance service trust and to get rid of the four boards, which employ 600&nbsp;people, and replace them with one strategic health authority. Also, four patient councils will be replaced by one patient council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_241">I hope that at least &#163;15&nbsp;million&#151;perhaps &#163;30&nbsp;million&#151;can be found out of the current cost of running health and social services. I have already undertaken that all the money from the savings that are achieved by reforming the health service infrastructure should go into front-line patient services and into doing something about the application of new drugs and the misery that people suffer while waiting for them.
</p>








<p><a name="st_241"><a name="51124-27_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Robinson: </b> 
 Although my point is not about drug availability, have the Government made an assessment of the savings that will accrue through our introduction of the no-smoking ban in public places in Northern Ireland? That will have a major effect on all sorts of illnesses that derive from smoking.
</p>








<p><a name="st_242"><a name="51124-27_spnew7"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 We did that when we made the impact assessment. In the long-term, the proposals will save a huge amount of money. Three thousand people a year die from a preventable illness caused by or related to smoking and passive smoking. However, in the short-term, we are unlikely to experience any savings because, regrettably, much of the damage will have already been done to people and the health service should look after them, regardless of whether they should have smoked.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_242">I intend to put money into health promotion campaigns to encourage people to stop smoking and into cessation services to enable people to stop smoking. In the short term, I expect to spend more money on encouraging people to stop smoking than will accrue in savings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_243">Infrastructure savings can undoubtedly be made given the inefficiency and the waste of the bureaucracy of the current health and social services system. As I said earlier this week, that is not a reflection on the staff&#151;the doctors, nurses, consultants or many people who form part of the secretariat. We have managed to create a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Nov 2005 : Column 1732</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>highly inefficient system in Northern Ireland that is too bureaucratic. We can slim it down and put the &#163;30&nbsp;million into drugs and patient services.

<p><a name="st_243"><a name="51124-28_spnew0"><b> Mr. Dodds: </b> 
 I am interested in the amount of money that the Under-Secretary is talking about saving and putting into front-line services. We are all in favour of that. When is that money likely to find its way to front-line services?
</p>








<p><a name="st_244"><a name="51124-28_spnew1"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman knows, the proposals that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set out in the review of public administration could take three to four years to be implemented. Although the proposals that I announced this week are related to the RPA, they are not dependent on it. I intend to change the number of trusts from 19&nbsp;to five plus one and to start work on it in January 2006, with a view to the five new trusts being up and running for April 2007. There will be redundancy costs and I anticipate that the substantial savings will probably not start for the best part of 18&nbsp;to 24&nbsp;months. However, I am ensuring that, for the long-term future of people in Northern Ireland, we make the decisions now and tackle the issues. That means that we can deal with the outrageous, intolerable and almost immoral waiting lists for the drugs that we are considering.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_244">We will therefore be relentless in driving through the reforms to pay for the drugs. Again, I wish to add a cautionary note. Despite additional investment in the next two years, the changes that I am making in the efficiency structures of the health service of Northern Ireland, the Appleby report and the savings that will derive from the RPA, demand will continue to grow.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_245">Matching resources to that demand will always involve making difficult choices and selecting priorities. The emergence of new specialist medicines has provided an opportunity to treat diseases that were considered untreatable until recently. Patients have the right to expect to be able to access those medicines when they need them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_246">The hon. Lady mentioned the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Its guidelines currently have no formal status in Northern Ireland. The Department is finalising links with NICE which will give its guidance formal status in Northern Ireland. I expect the new arrangements with NICE will be in place by spring 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51124-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_247">I would prefer to deal with the hon. Lady&#039;s specific points in writing. They are very specific and they should be given the proper consideration that they deserve. The current waiting lists for some specialist medicines are a serious priority for the health service in Northern Ireland. We will make improvements as quickly as we possibly can. The hon. Lady made her case strongly this afternoon and I shall do everything I can to improve access to the drugs that she mentioned and ensure that the new treatments and new drugs that people want in Northern Ireland are made available as quickly and as effectively and&#151;critically&#151;as safely as possible.
