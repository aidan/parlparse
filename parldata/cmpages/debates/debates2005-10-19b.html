<p><a name="qn_o0">1. <a name="51019-01_wqn0"><b> Sir Robert Smith  (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</b> 
 (LD): What factors were considered in the decision to limit the revised part L of the building regulations so that only extensions to a commercial building over 1,000&nbsp;sq m require consequential work upon the original building in order to minimise its overall carbon footprint. [19109]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51019-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Yvette Cooper): </b> 
 Part L of the building regulations covers improvements to new buildings. It will lead to savings of 1&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon and also includes the measure from the European directive on buildings above 1,000&nbsp;sq m. Existing buildings will be covered by the new review we have set up, which will consult stakeholders next year.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51019-01_spnew0"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for her answer, but what she has not told us is why the Government chose to water down the proposals that they originally put out for consultation, under which the savings would clearly have been far greater. Will she explain why the proposals were watered down and why the announcement was made in the middle of the recess and not while the House was sitting, so that questions could be asked at the time? If the Government do not address the issue of existing housing stock, we shall not be able to reach our targets of tackling global warming through carbon emissions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51019-01_spnew1"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s interest in climate change. I notice that his entry in the Register of Members&#039; Interests includes Shell, Texaco and Rio Tinto. He raised an important point about the timing of the announcement. I wrote to the Chair of the Select Committee to apologise for making the announcement over the summer, but we thought it important to introduce the details about the part L regulations because the building industry has to implement them from April of next year and needs time to prepare.

<p>
<a name="51019-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">The hon. Gentleman made a wider point about the impact on existing buildings and about other measures. The overall impact of the changes is a 40&nbsp;per cent. improvement in the energy efficiency of new buildings, which is equivalent to emission savings on about 1&nbsp;million semi-detached homes. That is a big impact and it should be welcomed. It is right that we should go further and we are looking into a wider review of existing buildings as a whole range of measures need to be taken into account&#151;not just regulations, but incentives and issues such as home information packs.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="51019-01_spnew2"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): The Minister will recall that I wrote to her on behalf of the British Flue and Chimney Manufacturers Association and a member firm in my constituency about the proposed part L building regulations, as they are based on a house model with neither flue nor chimney. Does she agree that there will be health, aesthetic and economic problems if we do not amend the regulations and that we risk seeing the slow death of the British chimney and the hundreds of jobs that are based on it in constituencies such as mine?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51019-01_spnew3"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has written to me and I have looked into the issues he raised and written back to him extensively. He will know that the building regulations do not make it impossible to have chimneys in buildings, but they set stretching standards. We must recognise both the impact of households on energy emissions and our responsibility to future generations to make improvements in that area. I hope that the chimney industry will respond to that challenge.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="51019-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister agree that as a nation we should be trying to move towards zero emissions from new build? Given the hundreds of thousands of new houses planned by her Department, tens of thousands of which will be in the Kettering constituency, is not the issue even more important than it was before the general election?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51019-01_spnew5"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we need to make improvements, and those that we have set in train with the part L revisions are substantial and stretching. We shall also be introducing a new code for sustainable development, which will be published before the end of the year. He may be interested to know that, as a result of those improvements, current plans for 1.1&nbsp;million new homes across the wider south-east, as part of the sustainable communities plan, can actually be introduced with 23&nbsp;per cent. fewer emissions than the previous Government&#039;s plan for 900,000&nbsp;new homes.

<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51019-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Malik: </b> 
 May I take this opportunity to congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister, his ministerial team and the social exclusion unit on an excellent report? Does the Minister agree that as Departments have seen record investment, that no longer remains the main challenge? Departments are still perceived as working in silos, so what reassurance can my right hon. Friend offer me that the concept of cross-departmental or joined-up working is being implemented on the ground to maximise impact in the fight against poverty and disadvantage?
 
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="51019-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point. To build on the 2&nbsp;million more people in work, the 700,000&nbsp;children taken out of poverty and the 75&nbsp;per cent. cut in the number of rough sleepers, it is right that we look at the way government works. As it happens, I have an example from my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, which I am sure will be of interest to the whole House because of its implications for national policy The Ravensthorpe neighbourhood management initiative brings together police, probation, the Court Service and business to help tackle drug and related problems.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51019-01_spnew8"><b> Tony Baldry  (Banbury)</b> 
 (Con): Is it not somewhat hollow for the Minister to talk about social inclusion while his Department is cutting the supporting people budget? I hope that he has read the Audit Commission&#039;s report, which, at best, shows that for every two steps forward the Government are taking three steps back. People in Oxfordshire find that reference to social inclusion really hollow when, in practical terms, that budget is being slashed and there are cuts in their services and those for people with mental health problems and learning difficulties.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="51019-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 What does ring hollow is the Conservative party, which went into the last election pledging to slash the budgets for such initiatives&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) will contain himself, I will answer the question. My hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government met Oxfordshire MPs recently to discuss that issue. The hon. Gentleman will also know that the Audit Commission report congratulates the Government on the success of the supporting people programme. I hope that he will bear that in mind when rendering the House with the benefit of his views.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51019-01_spnew10"><b> Alistair Burt  (North-East Bedfordshire)</b> 
 (Con): Social exclusion concerns us all. If the Government&#039;s good intentions were translated into their statistics, it would presumably no longer exist. However, as the Government&#039;s rather aggressive &quot;respect&quot; agenda identifies, social problems are still deeply rooted in our most disadvantaged communities and the gap between rich and poor continues to widen in Labour Britain. Why does the Minister think that is so? Is he worried about it?


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51019-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 As a matter of fact, the growth of income inequality has been arrested in this country over the past eight years, in contrast to every other advanced western industrialised country&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman to give him the statistics on income inequality. As for the position in our most disadvantaged areas&#151;I know that he has taken a long-standing interest in this&#151;I think that he will agree that we should both be pleased about the fact that employment and education have improved faster than the national average in the 88&nbsp;most deprived parts of the country.

 (Con): If he will make a statement on progress with the consultation resulting from the Local Government Pension Scheme (Amendment) Regulations 2005. [19111]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="51019-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Local Government  (Mr. Phil Woolas): </b> 
 Good progress is being made by local authority employers and trades unions, within the framework of the local government pension scheme tripartite committee, to determine what further amendments are necessary to the scheme by April 2006 to ensure its ongoing affordability and viability in light of the statement of 13&nbsp;July. A further meeting of the tripartite committee is scheduled for 2&nbsp;November.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51019-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 Council tax payers in my constituency are likely to face a 3&nbsp;per cent. rise in their council tax bills next year just to pay for the pension hole caused by the Government&#039;s weakness in the face of union pressure. Could the Minister give me an explanation that my constituents would find comforting as they write out the cheque?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="51019-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman were to read the statement of 13&nbsp;July, he would see that it makes it clear that the Government have proposed to the tripartite committee abolishing the 85-year rule by April next year, and talks are taking place on how we can implement that. Far from caving in, the viability of the local government pension is a priority for us. I have to say that if it had not been for the decisions taken more than 10&nbsp;years ago by the previous Government, we would not be in this situation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51019-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. John McFall  (West Dunbartonshire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): In the consultation on the pension scheme, will the Minister give thought to boosting the number of people over 65&nbsp;who work if they so desire? There would be great benefits to industry if the Government ceased requiring employers to pay national insurance contributions for employees over 65. That initiative would help individuals, help employers and help the country in general. It would be a win, win, win situation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="51019-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend, who makes a very interesting point. The discussions are taking place precisely to modernise the scheme, which the unions and the employers are asking us to do. Let me use this opportunity to clarify the fact that the local

</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o1">However, is it not the case that yesterday&#039;s announcement fails that criterion and is simply a compromise bought on credit and paid for with more council tax?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51019-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I understand the hon. Lady&#039;s point and I know that she has tabled several questions about the matter. However, I must emphasise that the local government pension scheme is a funded scheme. It was not part of the discussions that took place yesterday, and previously, on other public service pension schemes. Those schemes are not funded and applying principles from one type of scheme to the other leads to a misunderstanding of their nature.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="51019-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Clive Betts  (Sheffield, Attercliffe)</b> 
 (Lab): There is a feeling among some local government employees that although there must be changes to the pension scheme generally&#151;that applies to schemes for all public sector workers&#151;they are being asked to make changes more quickly than other public sector workers, to pay bigger contributions and to accept worse terms and conditions. I was interested in the agreement reached the other day by the Government with the civil service, education and health unions on a statement of principles on which all could work. Despite the different nature of the local government funds, would it be possible to bring discussions on them back into that orbit so that all public sector workers feel that they are getting equal treatment?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="51019-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s point and accept the integrity of it. The Government&#039;s role in the local government pension scheme is that of regulator. We are addressing two issues. In the immediate term, we are examining the cost implications for the scheme of the abolition of the 85-year rule, which we desire and which equality law requires of the scheme. Secondly, we are discussing a more medium-term strategy for the future of the scheme. We wish to address the cost viability of the scheme as part of that because it has a &#163;27&nbsp;billion deficit. We also want to bring the scheme up to date to address equality, especially for low-paid and women workers.

<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="51019-02_spmin2"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 As the hon. Lady knows, we are strengthening planning requirements on flooding and introducing a much more risk-averse policy than that which presently exists. I am pleased to say that we have warned local authority planning bodies that they should take the advice of the Environment Agency into account. Since we did that, the number of applications that were contrary to advice given by the Environment Agency on flooding risk has fallen quite considerably. The hon. Lady probably knows that I am involved in consultation on whether to strengthen the Environment Agency yet again and to put a requirement for consultation on a statutory footing.

 (Lab): My right hon. Friend will be aware of the &#163;46&nbsp;million investment in flood defence systems in the upper Calder valley in my constituency, which will make a huge difference to an area in which there is little flat land for development. Will he assure the House that steps will be taken through the new planning guidance to ensure that rogue developers do not take advantage of new flood defence systems to build on land that experienced a massive problem with flooding in the past?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="51019-02_spmin3"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 One of the requirements of new planning policy statement 25&nbsp;is to take account of all matters that might contribute to further flooding, in order to reduce that risk. Following my hon. Friend&#039;s inquiry, I will bring the matter to people&#039;s attention again.

Will the right hon. Gentleman share with the House the timetable for action on that serious danger?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="51019-02_spmin4"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 There have been considerable discussions on further flooding in the Thames Gateway and action has been taken to prevent that. Indeed, advice is taken from the Environment Agency and other bodies on the matter. I do not think that any serious flooding has taken place in the area since the building took place, and I think that only one application was granted against the advice of the Environment Agency. We have doubled the resources for flood protection, increased resources for the emergency services and warning systems and strengthened the planning situation. All in all, that has led to a major improvement, and a report from the Institution of Civil Engineers only this week made it clear that our actions had tremendously improved the situation.

<a name="stpa_o2">That contrasts well with the proposal that the Opposition made during the election to cut the resources of the Environment Agency.

I suggest that the hon. Lady shops around the three candidates and asks them whether they are likely to change it if they are elected as leader.

Does he recall that in 2000, after my town of Lewes had been badly hit by floods that forced hundreds of people on to the streets, he said that he had had a wake-up call to deal with flood defences? Five years on, almost nothing has been done in Lewes to deal with our flood defence problem and nothing is planned for the next few years. Has he gone back to sleep after his wake-up call?

 I can inform my hon.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. I know that he understands the misery caused by overcrowding and all the other problems associated with the lack of a suitable housing supply, so he will also understand the need to do even more than has been done so far, although we welcome it greatly. Will he take an interest in and, indeed, support the work being done in Plymouth to explore the role of community land trusts and the mutual home ownership model in helping us to increase the housing supply in Plymouth and the south-west?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="51019-03_spnew1"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b>

 (Con): When the Minister and his Department consider affordable housing, will he not forget the contribution made by the tens of thousands of almshouses throughout the country? The evidence from the Almshouse Association is that some of the smaller and weaker almshouses are being overwhelmed by regulation, to such an extent that they are applying to the Charity Commission for permission to change their charitable objectives so that they can sell their housing stock and become grant-making charities, which helps no one.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o36"><a name="51019-03_spnew3"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. The Government have made it clear that housing and affordable social housing are at the top of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s agenda. We are spending some &#163;3&nbsp;billion this year and next investing in affordable social homes and we will provide 100,000&nbsp;homes for new buyers between now and 2010.

 On 20&nbsp;September, my right hon.

 I do not think I had better answer that last part too specifically, in case I have not spotted the catch. It is important that people understand that for the council tax, the Government have increased support to local authorities substantially over the past few years. Most council tax bills in Conservative and, if I may say so, Lib-Dem-controlled areas, are already over &#163;1,000, whereas most council tax bills in Labour areas remain below &#163;1,000.

But I think that the Prime Minister will find that most people are more interested in here and now and the future. I was quoting from the Item Club, which uses the Treasury&#039;s own model, and it says this week that the Chancellor&#039;s growth forecasts are now &quot;completely untenable&quot;; he has been &quot;looking around for scapegoats&quot;; he is left &quot;short of excuses&quot;; and

</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_o7">Why did the Prime Minister let him do that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o62"><a name="51019-04_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 If we are talking about the present or the future, I rather prefer the OECD economic survey that said that our macro-economic performance over the last decade has been a &quot;paragon of stability&quot;, and that we have delivered economic stability, record growth, the lowest levels of unemployment, the lowest interest rates and lowest inflation that this country has seen for decades. I tend to take a trip down memory lane, but memory lane is not very good for the country. Let me just remind the right hon. and learned Gentleman that when he was in government&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Oh!&quot;] Oh yes, because this is what would happen if they ever got their hands back on the British economy again&#151;inflation peaking at over 10&nbsp;per cent., interest rates at 15&nbsp;per cent., and when he was Employment Secretary, unemployment rose by 1&nbsp;million. That is why, whether we compare the present, the past or the future, the Labour party outperforms the Conservatives.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o63"><a name="51019-04_spnew4"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 Let us look at some of the things that the Prime Minister has mentioned. Inflation is higher now than it was in May 1997; unemployment has gone up for eight months in a row; the growth forecasts have been downgraded; mortgage rates have risen; the trade gap is at its highest level ever; and business investment is at its lowest level ever. So I do not think that there is much for the Prime Minister to crow about there. Is not the reason why the Chancellor tried to dress the public finances up for the election very clear? Is not the naked truth that he did not want to come clean on the tax rises that we all know are coming?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o64"><a name="51019-04_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Let me just remind the right hon. and learned Gentleman that employment is 2&nbsp;million higher under this Government; long-term youth unemployment has been virtually eliminated under this Government; people remember the old skivvy schemes under the Conservatives; and the new deal that he is still opposed to has delivered opportunities in work and training for over a million of our citizens. If we look at a comparison between this country over the past few years and any other major developed country, this country comes out top. That is the fact, and people remember what it was like under the Conservatives. It is not just a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 837</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>question of a trip down memory lane; it is exactly the same polices as the Conservatives advocate today. Past, present or future, we are better.

<p><a name="st_o65"><a name="51019-04_spnew5"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 The Prime Minister seems to be unaware that our growth record is actually lower than that of the average for developed countries in the world, and the House and the country will have noticed that he did not even pretend to deny that the reason why the Chancellor fiddled the figures before the election was to pretend that it would not be necessary to increase taxes. Is not that also the reason why the Chancellor has moved the goalposts on the economic cycle&#151;so that he can borrow &#163;13&nbsp;billion more without appearing to break his golden rule?

 I do not accept that. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman looks at public sector debt and deficits, he will find that they are among the lowest in the G7. We have a record on unemployment, on growth, on inflation and on interest rates that compares extremely favourably with that of other countries&#151;interest rates are about half of what they averaged during the Conservative years. As we are quoting, I shall quote this to the right hon. and learned Gentleman:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o5">&quot;Fifteen per cent. interest rates, sky-high mortgage arrears, negative equity, bankruptcies, entrepreneurs giving up the ghost on private-run companies and a lot of people losing their jobs.

<a name="stpa_o9">Not my words, but those of the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood).

</p>








<p><a name="st_o67"><a name="51019-04_spnew6"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend shares my view that that was because of our entering the exchange rate mechanism. Conservative Members have learned our lesson, because we are firmly committed to not joining the euro. Let us return to the record of this Government and this Chancellor: is it not the case that it is the Chancellor who thwarted the Prime Minister&#039;s public reform agenda, that it is the Chancellor who is guilty of dressing up the public finances and that it is the Chancellor who is ramping up taxes on hard-working families? If the Prime Minister&#039;s legacy is important to him, why on earth does he not stand up to the Chancellor, instead of planning to hand over to him?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o68"><a name="51019-04_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Without going back over all the statistics that we have been trading on the economic performance of his Government compared with ours, I am not sure whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman can blame two recessions and millions of unemployed on the exchange rate mechanism. Has he checked that with the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who did not say that at the time and does not say that now? We all know that the last Conservative Government was a disaster in terms of boom-and-bust economics and that this Government have produced economic stability. Incidentally, when we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 838</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are talking about reform, this Chancellor introduced one very important reform, Bank of England independence, which played an important part in giving this country stability, and I remind the right hon. and learned Gentleman that he opposed it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o69"><a name="51019-04_spnew7"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 We agree that that was the right thing to do eight years ago. As the Prime Minister is so keen on the figures, let me give him some figures about his Government&#039;s performance: growth forecasts are down and the trade deficit is up; manufacturing jobs are down and taxes are up; competitiveness is down and red tape is up; and productivity growth is down and borrowing is up. We have fallen from 4th to 13th in the competitiveness league table; we are 15th out of 27&nbsp;in productivity; we are 51st in the league table for Government regulation; and we are 67th on the efficiency of our tax system, 28&nbsp;places behind Cambodia. Yet the Prime Minister preens himself on his conduct of the economy. Why does he not use the time that he has got left to stop being hoodwinked by his Chancellor and face up to the reality of the true state of the British economy?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o70"><a name="51019-04_spmin8"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I now have 67&nbsp;statistics that I want to read out&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am joking&#151;fortunately. We can compare economic records, but our economic record stands comparison with the best not only of our past, but of other countries. It is true that growth has slowed, as it has in all major countries, but I think that I am right in saying that this is the only major economy anywhere in the world that has weathered the economic storms of the past few years without a recession. It is true that there have been small increases in the unemployment claimant count, but employment has continued to rise and unemployment is way down on a few years ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_o10">The right hon. and learned Gentleman has said that we agree about Bank of England independence. I must point out that he did not agree at the time and that he opposed it. At that time, he also opposed extra investment in our public services, the reform of student finance and the minimum wage. I understand that he has converted himself on all those propositions, and I suggest that he convert himself on this one: the steady progress in investment and reform in our public services has seen record school results, falls in waiting times and waiting lists, and people getting better cancer and cardiac care. That is why we should continue with this Government&#039;s policies.

 (Lab): Can my right hon. Friend look again at the delays in compensation for the survivors of the attack by the mass murderers on 7&nbsp;July? In doing so, will he also look at the inadequacy of that compensation? For example, the final compensation sum for one of the victims, a young female who had her legs amputated above the knee, is &#163;110,000. That is totally inadequate. There is a need for all of us in this House not only to try to protect people from terrorists but to ensure that those who survive such attacks are properly looked after, including financially. This matter should be looked at very urgently by the Government.

<p><a name="st_o72"><a name="51019-04_spmin9"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 In general terms, of course I agree with the sentiments that my hon. Friend expresses. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority has been dealing with claims relating to 7/7&nbsp;as rapidly as possible, as it does with all claims. We have recognised the unique nature of the attack through the payment of additional sums of money into the London bombings relief fund. However, I understand the concerns that still exist. I can tell my hon. Friend that officials are considering the possibility of introducing a scheme to provide compensation for, for example, UK victims of terrorism, wherever that may happen. We will also look at how we can speed up the provision of payments to the victims of 7/7. The CICA is separate from Government, so there is a limit to the degree to which we can push it, but we have made our views clear. To be fair, I understand that it has made some 30&nbsp;offers of payment, 13&nbsp;of which have been paid.

That being the case, may I return to the question that I asked him in June, which he chose not to answer? Is it his intention to use the Parliament Act to push the Bill through the House of Lords, based on his 35&nbsp;per cent. mandate from the country in the House of Commons?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o74"><a name="51019-04_spmin10"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I am not going to base my answers on the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s pessimistic assumptions. ID cards are an important part of our manifesto. They are also an important part of trying to protect this country and to deliver a better way for people to protect their identity in the modern world. The reason why this is happening is perfectly simple, and it is happening in many other countries as well. The new biometric technology, combined with the fact that identity fraud and identity abuse are far more common in today&#039;s world, make the adoption of an identity card over time the sensible way for this country to go. Rather than arguing about who is going to win and who is going to lose in the House of Lords, let us have a serious debate on the issues.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o75"><a name="51019-04_spnew10"><b> Mr. Charles Kennedy: </b> 
 No clear answer in June; no clear answer today. The Prime Minister must therefore understand why so many people, including, as we heard in the exchanges yesterday, more than a few of his own Back Benchers, see his Government as becoming more authoritarian as every day goes by. I say this to the Prime Minister: just look at a checklist which involves questioning the principle of innocence until proved guilty, promoting the concept of summary justice, picking fights with the judiciary, and saying that he wants to lock people up for 90&nbsp;days without charge. If that is not an authoritarian approach, what is?

<p><a name="qn_o10">Q3. [19096]<a name="51019-04_wqn2"><b> Paul Flynn  (Newport, West)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree with the statement by the late Robin Cook that our nuclear weapons are hopelessly irrelevant to the task of dealing with terrorism and helping our vital role in international peacekeeping? Will he answer the question of which I gave him notice earlier today and tell us that, before any decision is made about spending a massive amount of money&#151;at least &#163;10&nbsp;billion&#151;on a replacement for Trident, we can have a debate and a vote in the House?
</p>



<p><a name="st_o80"><a name="51019-04_spmin14"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I am sure that there will be a debate as my hon. Friend suggests, and I have no doubt that there will be a great deal of discussion on the issue as the months and years unfold. I do not think that anyone pretends that the independent nuclear deterrent is a defence against terrorism; none the less, I believe that it is an important part of our defence. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has already made it clear that the Government will listen to hon. Members before making any decisions on replacing Trident. No decisions on replacing it have yet been made, but they are likely to be necessary in the current Parliament. It is too early to rule in or rule out any particular option. As we set out in our manifesto, we are committed to retaining the UK&#039;s independent nuclear deterrent. My hon. Friend will doubtless make his views clear, as will other hon. Members, and we will make our decision ultimately in the best interests of the country.

 (Con): Given the experience of West Berkshire primary care trust, will the Prime Minister give an assurance that, in future, no PCT will have to tear up its budget a few weeks into the financial year and make savage cuts in health care to pay off the deficit in another PCT?
</p>



<p><a name="st_o81"><a name="51019-04_spmin15"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I am afraid that I do not know enough about the circumstances of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s PCT, but I am happy to correspond with him about it. However, according to my information, the PCT for his area has &#163;89&nbsp;million in funding&#151;a considerable increase on a few years ago. There are also more nurses, more consultants, more general practitioners and more doctors in training in his area since 1997. I cannot answer the question about the details of his particular PCT, but I can say that, in common with other PCTs, it has had a considerable increase in its financial resources.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o82"><a name="51019-04_spnew12"><b> Mr. Gordon Prentice  (Pendle)</b> 
 (Lab): Is my Friend aware of the huge disquiet on this side of the House about his plans to force health workers such as health visitors, midwives, occupational therapists and physiotherapists out of the NHS and into the private, voluntary and not-for-profit sectors? Why are we doing this? Is it a matter of ideology?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o83"><a name="51019-04_spmin16"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 No. There is a consultation going on at the moment about primary care trusts and their structure which, as I have said, will give us the right configuration for health services for the future. This is not a matter of ideology; it is a matter of delivering the best service we possibly can for patients. It is also a matter of realising that, as we build up the resources going into the national health service over the next few 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 842</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>years, the British national health service will be up around about the average of EU funding for health care for the first time in decades. It is important that we continue to get value for money for that investment, and people will expect us to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-04_para10">
<a name="stpa_o13">These reforms are subject to consultation at the moment, but the lesson of our reform programme so far is that it is that programme, along with the money, that has delivered real falls in waiting times and waiting lists. For example, we now have a maximum of six months, whereas when we came into power it was 18&nbsp;months. Over the next few years, if we keep the investment and reform going, there will be a maximum 18-week wait from the door of the GP to the door of the operating theatre. That will have transformed the position that we inherited in 1997.

 (Con): Eight years ago, on coming to power, this Government abolished the right of successful schools to break free from local authority control, yet they are going to publish a White Paper next week that will effectively hand back that option to certain schools. In the twilight of his premiership, has the Prime Minister finally discovered his reverse gear?
</p>



<p><a name="st_o84"><a name="51019-04_spmin17"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 No, because what we did was abolish the fair funding restrictions. The fair funding that we have introduced to schools was the exact opposite of what happened with the grant-maintained schools, which were given special incentives to opt out of local education authority control. I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is way out of date. Specialist schools and others have had greater freedoms in the last few years&#151;since the beginning of our second Parliament, in fact. Not only are additional freedoms going to be given, but additional resources as well, so that every school in the country&#151;not a small minority of schools, which is all that the grant-maintained schools ever were&#151;will have the resources and the freedom that it needs to improve education for its children.
</p>








<p><a name="qn_o13">Q6. [19099]<a name="51019-04_wqn5"><b> Clive Efford  (Eltham)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend is aware that there is widespread concern about the restructuring of primary care trusts, especially in London, where there are plans to remove their link with local government boundaries. May I urge him to review those proposals and, in particular, to reconsider the plans to impose a one-size-fits-all, dogmatic approach to commissioning by imposing a purchaser-provider split? He will be aware that such an approach was an integral part of the internal market of the NHS under the Tories. It became much hated by the public, and is one of the reasons why they will never be trusted with the NHS again. Should we not be wary of going down that road?
</p>



<p><a name="st_o85"><a name="51019-04_spmin18"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 We certainly should. However, there are two separate issues here. One is the reorganisation of the PCTs, and full consultation on the new boundary arrangements proposed by strategic health authorities will take place. Stakeholders and those interested in the issue, including my hon. Friend, will be able to make their representations clear. The second thing is to ensure that we introduce greater contestability in the health service. I believe that to be absolutely vital in order to introduce greater patient

<br>&nbsp;<br>choice. Despite what people have said over the past few years, every time we have offered patients the ability to choose so that they get swifter access to NHS care, they have wanted it. Exactly as I want the law-abiding citizen to be at the centre of the criminal justice system, and the interests of parents and pupils to be at the centre of our education system, so I want the interests, desires and influence of patients to be at the centre of an NHS that is free at the point of use but modernised for today&#039;s world.

 (DUP): May I associate my hon. Friends and myself with the Prime Minister&#039;s remarks of condolence? Is he aware of the fact that an important announcement is to be made in a written statement from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland today? According to what I have heard in the Lobby, that statement purports to restore the money to IRA-Sinn Fein that the House voted to stop. Why is this statement not being made on the Floor of the House so that the representatives from Northern Ireland can at least voice their opinion on the matter?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o87"><a name="51019-04_spmin19"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I am sure that people will voice their opinion about the matter, but it is important that we make step-by-step progress in Northern Ireland. In July, we had major progress with the report of the Decommissioning Commission. Over the coming months, I want to make sure that we arrive at a situation in which we can get the institutions back up and running again in Northern Ireland. Along the way, difficult things will be done on all sides, but that is the step that we must take, and I would have hoped that the Democratic Unionist party, along with others in Northern Ireland, would support the objective.

<a name="51019-04_para11">
<a name="stpa_o14">I understand the strong feelings on the matter. Sometimes, on other issues, we do things that Sinn Fein, the Social Democratic and Labour party and others do not like. I believe this to be a sensible step in trying to revitalise the institutions and devolved government in Northern Ireland, however, and that is our aim. We have come a long way in doing that, but we must complete it.

<a name="time_0">
<a name="51019-05_time0"><h5>12.32&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51019-05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Francis Maude  (Horsham) (Con):</b> 
 I beg to move,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require an audit of existing or planned infrastructure in areas of significant housing development.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">This Bill requires the Government to be joined up. There is a huge disconnect between the Government&#039;s diktat that many tens of thousands of new houses are to be built in West Sussex over the next 15&nbsp;years and the provision being made to support infrastructure. I am especially concerned about the secondary health infrastructure, which is already in deep crisis and deteriorating fast. There are also major problems with transport and water capacity, neither of which is being addressed seriously by the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The Government&#039;s approach to housing development is totally prescriptive: they call it predict and provide; it feels much more like accept and obey. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has made it clear to our county councils that the number of homes ordered to be built in the south-east is non-negotiable. That means that the number of new homes to be built in West Sussex is set to be 2,900&nbsp;each year for the next 20&nbsp;years. That would rise to 4,200&nbsp;a year if the Barker proposals were accepted, as the Government seem to indicate that they might be, or if the Deputy Prime Minister sought to overrule the South East England regional assembly recommendations already made. On the smaller basis, West Sussex would have an extra 58,000&nbsp;homes and an extra 85,000&nbsp;people, which is equivalent to building another town the size of Crawley in West Sussex.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">That level of house building is among the highest in the south-east, but West Sussex has not been designated as one of the Government&#039;s growth areas. The result of that is that we get all the new housing but without the provision for new infrastructure that accompanies growth area status. Of course, funding for key public services like health and education is based on GP lists and school rolls, which inevitably means a lag of at least two years between population increases and the increased funding. In the meantime, of course, schools and hospitals are strapped for cash.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">According to the all-party Environmental Audit Committee,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;The Government&#039;s ambitions for new housing in the South East, if met with undue haste and an absence of thorough environmental appraisals, will lead to significant and effectively irreversible environmental damage.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">We are still waiting for those environmental appraisals, but people in the area know that the implications for the environment are dire. Not surprisingly, there is overwhelming local resistance to the proposed levels of house building. Recent polls suggest that two thirds of local people oppose the increases, and about the same number simply do not believe that the supply of infrastructure, particularly NHS hospitals, will keep pace with new house building.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Those people are right to be concerned. Not only are hospital services not being enhanced, they are being actively and daily run down. The Surrey and Sussex healthcare trust, which runs both Crawley hospital and East Surrey hospital at Redhill, has languished at the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 846</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>bottom of the Government&#039;s star rating system for the last four years. Regrettably for its long-suffering staff and patients, it has never been given more than one star, and for the last two years it has been awarded none. That places it in the bottom 5&nbsp;per cent. of all acute hospital trusts in England.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The trust is battling to live within its existing income. It has a rolling &#163;30&nbsp;million deficit, which is likely to reach &#163;60&nbsp;million by the end of the year. According to its chairman,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;Surrey and Sussex healthcare trust would be bankrupt if it was a company.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">In recent years, there has been a consistent pattern of acute services&#039; being moved from Crawley to Redhill. On each occasion, we are assured that this will be the last service to be removed from Crawley; then, a few months later, off goes another service. Acute trauma, maternity, and accident and emergency services have gone. More recently, operating theatres have closed, and redundancies now seem likely.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">We would mind less about all that if the Redhill hospital could cope with the extra work being driven to it, but it cannot. Members may have seen television coverage of ambulances queuing outside the accident and emergency department. At Redhill, it is not how long people wait on a trolley that is measured, but how long they wait in the ambulance before even getting on to a trolley.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">There is a similar picture in Mid-Sussex, with consultant-led maternity services moving from the Princess Royal hospital at Haywards Heath to Brighton. It is not absurd to speculate, given the current trends, that pretty soon there will be barely any acute hospital cover in West Sussex. The public feeling, however, is that more, not fewer, hospital services are required. The south-eastern county councils have estimated that the region will need an additional 1,800&nbsp;acute and 900&nbsp;general hospital beds over the next 15&nbsp;to 20&nbsp;years, which is equivalent to six medium-sized hospitals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">The Department of Health&#039;s own inquiry produced a recommendation that there should be a new hospital at Pease Pottage to serve this fast-growing area, but, in a classic example of disjointed, dysfunctional government, the Secretary of State himself turned down the proposal. The new hospital really is needed, however. Since the Government vetoed it, attracting permanent staff to the Surrey and Sussex trust has been increasingly difficult. In the last three years the trust has spent &#163;58&nbsp;million on temporary staff, and &#163;21&nbsp;million has been spent in the past year alone. Probably about &#163;30&nbsp;million of that was wasted; it could have been invested in hospital infrastructure to attract top teams of staff to rival those at the best London teaching hospitals. I strongly urge the Secretary of State to reopen the files, have another look at the Bagnall report of three years ago, and re-examine the case for a new hospital at Pease Pottage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">I mentioned the water capacity problem earlier. That problem is already severe, and it is growing. The Government&#039;s own favourite think-tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, recognises the seriousness of the problem. Its commission on sustainable development in the south-east observes


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;Only with significant water efficiency savings in existing and new homes, and the timely provision of new water resources, will there potentially be enough water to meet rising demand for new housing and domestic consumption.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">The Bill would force a serious rethink about those infrastructure shortages. It would require a full audit of existing or planned infrastructure in areas of significant housing development. It would not preclude the Deputy Prime Minister from continuing to impose excessive housing development on the south-east, but it would make it much more embarrassing for him to do so without proper provision being made for the necessary infrastructure. It would lay bare for public scrutiny the deficiencies in Government thinking and planning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-05_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">As I have said, I oppose the huge increases in house building currently being contemplated. However, this Bill would ensure that any new house building was matched with adequate infrastructure. For West Sussex, it should lead to a new hospital being built at Pease Pottage.

<a name="stpa_17">I do not intend to make a long speech to propose this motion, but I do need to give the House a little of the background to it before Members decide whether or not this matter should be considered by the Standards and Privileges Committee. In November 2001, I was a member of the Transport Sub-Committee, under the chairmanship of the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody). It was six weeks after Railtrack had gone into administration, and we were in the midst of an inquiry into the future of the railways and the circumstances that had led to administration.

 May I say how much I welcome the views just expressed by the Leader of the House? There is a well-established mechanism within the House for dealing with these matters&#151;through the Standards and Privileges Committee. It is a Committee on which I served during the last Parliament, so I know how seriously it takes its responsibilities. Notwithstanding the comments of the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers) in his personal statement on Monday, on which I say nothing at this stage, I believe that there is a prima facie case for investigation. It is right for the Committee to have the opportunity to investigate further. Although this is a House matter, I recommend that my right hon. and hon. Friends support the motion if it is put to a vote today.

 What a difference a few short months make in the Government&#039;s view of the world. It seems but a moment ago&#151;the mere passing of slight time&#151;that I was standing at the Dispatch Box extolling the virtues of abandoning a council tax revaluation, only to be met with vitriol and abuse from Government and Liberal Democrat Members. In fact, it is only the Liberal Democrats who remain in favour of an immediate and complete revaluation. Three times that once great party has voted for revaluation and I suppose that those votes were not entirely wasted. In modern politics, we are supposed to have a degree of empathy with other people and the Liberal Democrats can now feel empathy with Labour Back Benchers, because they also now know how it feels to be let down by Labour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_28">The Government were steely in their determination to bring about revaluation and unwavering in their support for an immediate one. For example, the Prime Minister commented in the <i>Daily Star</i> on the Conservative pledge at the last general election to cancel revaluation. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;It&#039;s a complete con. From the Conservatives this really is the most desperate opportunism.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_29">We had an even more robust view from the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)&#151;it is a pleasure to see him in his usual place&#151;in July, when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;it is intellectually and economically illiterate to suggest that one can have a system of council tax without a need for periodic revaluation. That is why we introduced arrangements for a regular, 10-yearly revaluation.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 4&nbsp;July 2005; Vol. 436, c. 51.]</p>

<a name="stpa_30">I expect that he was surprised when, within 11&nbsp;short weeks of those words, they blew up in his face.

<a name="51019-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_31">What has caused the Government&#039;s near Damascene conversion to the Conservative position? I say &quot;near&quot; because the Government propose a postponement, not a cancellation. There are two possible explanations for the U-turn. The written statement on 10&nbsp;October announced that the Government intended to introduce legislation to postpone the revaluation for council tax in England. It stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;The case for council tax revaluation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is linked to wider questions about the structure of the council tax, and to the operation of council tax benefit. It is also relevant that there are a number of other imminent changes in the local government finance system, including the move to three year budgets, the review of the local government finance formula, and the creation of a dedicated schools budget.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 10&nbsp;October 2005; Vol.437, c. 5&#150;6&nbsp;WS.]</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_32">I was surprised only that the statement did not add that the revaluation had to be postponed because the letter &quot;r&quot; appeared in the month of September. Every single thing mentioned in the statement was known when the Lyons review was set up and revaluation was planned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_33">The second explanation therefore has a ring of truth, and it comes from the mouth of the Minister of Communities and Local Government. When asked outside the Table Office by one of his colleagues from the west midlands why the Government had postponed the revaluation, he said that it would be too difficult, too hot to handle and had to be dropped. It is a sad fact that, on occasions in this place, having a clear voice can be a disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_34">This is not a policy; it is a postponement for others to pick up when the Minister has moved on to pastures new. Many will agree with the judgment of the right hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_35">Why revalue? A myth has grown up around the need to revalue, but it is a conventional wisdom that needs to be challenged. I know that because I was once seduced by the conventional orthodoxy. I was once persuaded that the emperor was wearing a shiny new suit rather than being naked of ideas or legitimacy. I was not alone. Even such august bodies as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have been persuaded that the emperor is not in the altogether. In its otherwise excellent brief prepared for this debate, it states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;Fundamental to the fairness of the tax base for Council Tax is an up to date valuation list supported by frequent and consistent revaluations. The current valuation list is based on 1991&nbsp;values. Since 1991&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. average house prices have increased by some 216&nbsp;per cent.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_36">It is neither fundamental to the council tax nor to its fairness that revaluation takes place&#151;and it entirely misses the point. As my colleague Lord Hanningfield said in the other place:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;Statutory revaluations will take council tax further towards being solely a property tax&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_37">When the council tax was first introduced, there was no provision for revaluation. The purpose of a revaluation is to correct grossly disproportionate movements in the housing market. It may be that, over a 10-year period, those movements are negligible, and that going through the expense of a revaluation cycle is unnecessary. What matters in council tax valuation are comparative prices between different parts of the country. Those have remained unchanged for the last decade. That is why Northern Ireland has operated quite happily on valuations set 30&nbsp;years ago and that is why Scotland&#039;s First Minister, Jack McConnell, has been at pains to make it clear that

 The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting speech, but is he saying that he would never favour a revaluation? Would he support a revaluation if property prices were to diverge?

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51019-07_spnew1"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 I could not make it clearer that the Conservative party would support the abandonment of the revaluation. It is absurd to pursue revaluation when there is no divergence in the property market and the Government propose to postpone it. Why spend millions of pounds on a revaluation for no purpose? Would not that money be better spent in our schools, on teachers and children? Would the hon. Gentleman prefer that money to be spent on computer programmes?

<p>


</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51019-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 That does not work. The Minister may recall the last opportunity we had to debate this issue, when I stood like a supplicant before the inquisition, confessed that I had made a mistake and apologised to the House. Where is the gracious response from the Minister? He should encourage such forthright confession. I admit that I was fooled, but I have realised that the emperor is naked and a revaluation would be pointless. People should be prepared to admit when situations have changed. The Minister presumably wishes to try to persuade me that the emperor is wearing a handsome suit.
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51019-07_spnew3"><b> Mr. Nick Raynsford  (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab):</b> 
 As it appears that hon. Members on both sides of the House are making a virtue of making U-turns, can the hon. Gentleman tell us why he is not prepared to take his logic further? When a property changes hands it is subject to revaluation, so why does he not propose that that should also cease?
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51019-07_spnew4"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 Because that falls within the existing rules and, over a period of time, there would naturally be a change. I understand why the right hon. Gentleman wants to pursue the original policy. Indeed, in my mind&#039;s eye, I can see the great handover between him and the Minister of Communities and Local Government. There may have been a glass of sherry. Pleasantries were uttered and, to be helpful, the former Minister handed the new Minister an envelope&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister says that it was a six-course dinner. How very new Labour. No doubt there was a choice of wines.

 I have listened to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s arguments carefully both today and in previous debates.

<br>&nbsp;<br>and revaluation? Does he stand entirely by that, except for revaluation, or is he suggesting that there should be a new council tax or a completely new tax? If so, it would be interesting to hear what it is.
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51019-07_spnew6"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 I think that I can rely on the assessment of the incoming new Labour Government. Perhaps I may be permitted to quote from their document &quot;Modern local government: in touch with local people&quot;, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;The council tax is working well as a local tax. It has been widely accepted and is generally very well understood. This has been borne out by the responses received to the consultation paper.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_39">We have established that the same level of valuation has existed in Northern Ireland for 30&nbsp;years. Scotland will have none of it, while Wales has seen the effect of revaluation, which I suspect played a part in the Government&#039;s decision to make a U-turn. However, the full effects of revaluation in Wales have yet to be felt. In 2005&#150;06, initial bills were kept down by transitional relief to limit sharp increases, yet most of that relief is for only one year, meaning further automatic tax hikes next year. Relief is to be phased out completely within three years. Why should the Welsh have to suffer when the English are temporarily spared? When the postponement Bill is debated, we shall move amendments to retain transitional relief for Welsh revaluations until decisions in England have finally been made.

</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51019-07_spnew8"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b>

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51019-07_spnew9"><b> Mrs. Maria Miller  (Basingstoke) (Con):</b> 
 Is not the simple truth that council tax rebanding is just another stealth tax? In my constituency, there will be a double whammy. House price increases are up to 13&nbsp;per cent. higher than the regional average over the past year and all those houses will face rebanding, with bills soaring by more than &#163;300&nbsp;a household. At the same time, Hampshire county council is warning of an inflation-busting council tax rise next year because it received one of the lowest grants in the country.

 Although I accept that all parties recognised the principle of revaluation, does the hon.

<a name="stpa_40">The costs of revaluation were spiralling out of control.

<a name="stpa_42">Thanks to the Audit Commission, we all know why council tax has risen since Labour came to power. There are three reasons: changes in the grant formula, the implementation of often unfunded Government initiatives, and national pay rates. Each year, the fiasco drags on; each year, it gets worse. The imbalance between local and central Government funding grows, which, in turn, will force Ministers towards crude, universal capping in the vain hope that the public&#039;s ignorance of the arcane details of council tax gearing will pass the blame for the unacceptable increases on to local authorities.

 I wonder whether my hon. Friend is aware that Members of the Welsh Assembly voted to support revaluation when they were specifically told by the Labour Minister responsible for local government that there would be as many winners as losers. They had no conception that she could have misled them by creating a system whereby one in three people were moved up by at least one band&#151;two or three bands in several cases&#151;and only one in eight went down.

<br>&nbsp;<br>revaluation whenever it is undertaken. Often, it is not just the house price at a certain moment that is of importance, but how it has changed over the past three, four or five years. For example, in the Rhondda we had virtually no house price changes for several years, but suddenly over the past three years we have had dramatic changes in house prices. In the past year, they have gone up by 56&nbsp;per cent. Sometimes, it can seem extremely unfair merely to base revaluation on a snapshot. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would like to reconsider the Tory party position. Although delay might be a good idea because we might need to ensure that any future revaluation is more sane than other revaluations that have happened, I merely point out to him that, in the Rhondda, quite a lot of people went down a band, not up.
</p>








<p><a name="st_40"><a name="51019-08_spnew16"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 I think that council tax has gone up by eight times the rate of inflation in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, so I can understand the pain that he feels. However, the important point is not the relationship between individual properties in Rhondda, but how that affects the difference between prices in our constituencies and the relative values in the various parts of the United Kingdom. A revaluation should exist for the process of realigning the housing market, but the rise in the market is not out of line and is much the same as 10&nbsp;years ago. I suppose that there was a time when it looked as though it was starting to get out of line. That is why we consider such things over a long period. A decent period is needed for the housing market to readjust.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the debate is somewhat missing the point? It is not a question of preventing future rises in council tax. The current level of council tax is unacceptably high. Even if we introduced a system that pegged the current levels, it would not be good enough. We need to consider radical reform to reduce current bills.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. If the debate is missing the point, all I can say is that I am doing my absolute best. Ultimately, there would have been no U-turn nor any question of revaluation but for the fact that council tax has simply got out of control.

In plain English, council tax bills in Northern Ireland will soar. Northern Ireland is being selected for another experiment that involves a variation on the council tax: the death tax, in which a deferred local tax bill can be paid by pensioners. Vulnerable people must either forfeit their children&#039;s inheritance or face the prospect of bailiffs at the door.

<a name="stpa_47">We know that the Government are examining information technology as a way of bringing in more money. They sent out a questionnaire on tax rebanding to IT firms in which they asked about four additional council tax bands and higher band multipliers so that people in higher bands would pay more money, although the band of their properties had not changed. They have suggested cutting eligibility for discounts and exemptions. They have also considered discount schemes to cushion millions of council tax payers who move up two or more bands. The Government claim that the suggestions are not proof of likely reforms, but if that is the case, why are they asking such questions?

<a name="stpa_48">The Lyons review is just another depressing example of the ping-pong between structure and finance. We seem to go through a process of trying to change the way in which local councils are financed or structured. Revaluation and regionalism are two extremes of the massive ping-pong process. That is a great pity, because changes in local authorities are taking place without anyone really understanding their impact. Strategic partnerships and local area agreements clearly show how adaptable local authorities can be.

<a name="51019-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_49">I firmly believe that function and finance are two sides of the same coin. If we were sensible, we would give local authorities the ability to share their sovereignty, responsibilities and resources. We would allow money to follow services and function to determine structure. Local authorities with a common concern could thus band together to provide better services for their electorates. It will be a good thing if Lyons recognises that change, but it will be bad if the review just leads to a further extension of the salami-slicing that has affected local government for so long.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_50">Local government is one of the most adaptable of our institutions. We should give it freedom, and instead of trying to control the way in which local grant is distributed, we should allow money to follow services. We should work for local diversity. If we could do that, we would have the chance of building a real consensus, instead of worrying about the knock-on effects of one specific change.

The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) has tabled questions about the matter and made points about it, but not all the money spent could fairly be described as having been wasted. The vast bulk of the money was for computerisation and data collection, and that work will be valid in the future. If we had continued the work and waited until the House had returned to make the announcement, she could have made such a charge.

Copies of the full text of the 20&nbsp;September announcement are of course available in the Library. Nevertheless, I think that it is important that I set out fully what it says.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-09_para11">
<a name="stpa_58">The House will recall that the Government appointed Sir Michael Lyons in July 2004&nbsp;to carry out an independent inquiry into local government funding. He has made good progress with that remit and I should stress that the original remit stands. We have extended the remit, not replaced it. Sir Michael has discussed with Ministers his work so far. His initial conclusion is that well-founded recommendations on possible reforms to the funding of local government cannot sensibly be made in isolation from a proper consideration and understanding of the developing role and functions of local government, not only by central Government but by the population at large.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-09_para12">
<a name="stpa_59">Sir Michael has made it clear that any proposals for reform of the funding system raise complex issues. The Government have agreed that they need to be set firmly and explicitly in the wider context of a clear and shared understanding of the role of local government and of the accountability of councils to service users, residents and taxpayers. It was for that reason that my right hon. Friends the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Deputy Prime Minister extended the terms of reference of the inquiry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-09_para13">
<a name="stpa_60">The Government have agreed with Sir Michael that he will review, through a series of discussion documents, the current and emerging strategic role of local government in the context of national and local priorities for local services, including the implications of that for accountability. He will also review how the Government&#039;s agenda for devolution and decentralisation to local councils, together with changes in decision making and funding, could improve local services, the responsiveness of those services to users and, of course, local authorities&#039; financial efficiency. In the light of that work, Sir Michael will address critical funding issues, including fairness, accountability, clarity, efficiency and effective management. He will produce his final report at the end of 2006. I know that when taking forward the new remit Sir Michael will want to work closely with local government as well as drawing on the assistance of Government Departments. I hope and expect that other parties present will participate in those discussions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-09_para14">
<a name="stpa_61">The additional work that Sir Michael will undertake will add value to the Government&#039;s current work on a strategic view of the role and functions of local government under the local vision programme, about which I shall say more later. It will also contribute to the comprehensive spending review 2007, which will set the path for local government funding for the medium term. To set the scene for that work, later this autumn Sir Michael will set out his preliminary thinking and publish research and analysis undertaken so far, drawing out the relationship between local government function and finance.

<a name="51019-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_63">I was outlining the importance to the country and to communities of the role of local government. That has to be placed in the context of our manifesto commitments to public service reform. From continuing the improvement in our schools to making social services more responsive to the people who use them, local government will be in the forefront of driving up performance. However, the communities that our local councils serve are growing ever more diverse, with a greater range of needs and higher aspirations than ever before. We should celebrate that, but we should also acknowledge that it means that local government&#039;s role will have to change along with the communities that it serves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_64">There are several pointers to that debate, in which we are now engaged. The local council must lead and represent the local area by harnessing the efforts of local people and representing their interests. It must lead the community through building partnerships with other local service providers, voluntary and community groups and the private sector. Hon. Members may know that every area in England will have a local area agreement by April 2007. In my view, local area agreements, whereby councils come together with other public service partners, the voluntary and community sector and the private sector to serve their area in a joined-up way, are a significant development in local government&#151;one of the most significant developments since the second world war.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_65">The debate on the role of local government within the local area agreement takes place alongside other debates&#151;for example, the debate on neighbourhood and community empowerment, the debate on how we achieve a step change in service delivery to users, and the debate on how we involve the disadvantaged and improve services to them as well as to everyone else. Those significant local government changes are in the pipeline, which is why the decision to postpone the revaluation was the right one.

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="51019-10_spnew7"><b> Andrew Selous </b> 
: Does the Minister agree that the test of the worth of local area agreements will be based on highly practical issues&#151;for example, the junction between the medical assessments of children with special educational needs and the services that they receive?

Crime can be tackled better if the police have the active co-operation and participation of other public service agents, such as schools, the probation service and local councils.

Sir Michael has stated on the record that he understood why Ministers would seek to postpone for one year, but, by inference, he is not supportive of the Government&#039;s position.
</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="51019-10_spnew12"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 In fact, Sir Michael did not even go that far: he said only that there was a case for postponement of a year. I acknowledge that he did not recommend a postponement such as the one that we announced. I hope that we have never given the impression that we are hiding behind Sir Michael. We have extended his remit because it is the job of Government to ensure that reviews of financing such as his complement other areas of public service reform and wider social and economic policy. The advancement of local area agreements to ensure that they cover the whole of England by April 2007&nbsp;is a significant step change in our policy that builds on the tremendous work of my right hon.

 I agree that local area agreements are a sensible and practical way of joining up things that have been divided because of the way in which central Government organise their financial regime for local authorities.

 We would all agree with the sentiments behind that, but, although I hate to use the word, the hon. Lady is being naive. Of course, it is desirable that public service agencies work together and there are many good examples of them doing so. Local strategic partnerships existed for many years before Government guidelines were issued, and the best ones work well together. Public services use taxpayers&#039; money, and the review is predicated on the belief that the funding system is not as fair as it could be. If we give that responsibility to local authorities, as devolution allows, we have to give them the financial mechanisms to work

 Further to the question about deferral asked by my right hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_72"><a name="51019-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 My hon. Friend&#039;s question allows me to put the situation on the record again. In the statement announcing the postponement of revaluation, we made it clear that we did not believe that revaluation would take place during this Parliament. We went no further than that, and it is for Parliament to decide the future. Second Reading of the Council Tax (New Valuation Lists for England) Bill is imminent, giving us an opportunity to debate these issues in more detail. The decision rests with Parliament but, none the less, the Government&#039;s policy is that revaluation has been postponed, not cancelled. The exact timing partly depends on any actions that may arise from the recommendations of the Lyons report.

<a name="stpa_68">It is right to maintain a fair alignment between house prices and council tax bands. The case for council tax revaluation is linked to wider questions about the structure of the tax and to the operation of council tax benefit. A number of other changes in the local government finance system are in the pipeline, including the move to three-year budgets, the review of the local government finance formula and the creation of a dedicated schools budget located in the Department for Education and Skills.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_69">The Government have decided that it would not be sensible to proceed with the current timetable for revaluation. Sir Michael&#039;s analysis so far has led him to conclude that there may be a case, as I told my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), for a delay of up to a year in the implementation of revaluation. However, the Government concluded that the balance of advantage lies with allowing the flexibility to revalue as part of a fully developed package of funding reforms, rather than as a precursor to them, and at a moment of greater financial stability for local authorities. That is the background to the decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_70">I should like to make the Government&#039;s position on council tax quite clear. First, as we said in our response to the balance of funding review, we accept that council tax should be retained but reformed. That was why we appointed Sir Michael Lyons in the first place. Secondly, as I have said, we remain committed to council tax revaluation even though 2007&nbsp;is not the right time for it. Council tax is related to property values. As we said in our 2001&nbsp;White Paper, the Government fully recognise the importance of keeping property values up to date. That remains our position. We are postponing, not cancelling, revaluation. We need to ensure that we get revaluation and reform of council tax right, and that is why Sir Michael is conducting an extended inquiry. There was a great deal of unnecessary scaremongering by the Opposition about the effects of revaluation. Revaluation would not mean that individuals would pay more council tax just because their house had gone up in value. Nevertheless, many people believed that it would because of statements made to that effect. Many properties would stay in the same band. That has been made perfectly clear all along, despite reports that appeared in the press. Thirdly, the Bill that we have introduced and which we will debate in due course is simply concerned with timing requirements. All the other provisions are unaffected. I trust that the Bill will receive the full support of the main Opposition party, as it is keen to cancel the 2007&nbsp;revaluation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_71">I must now address some myths and accusations about council tax. The Government are often accused of letting council tax rises get out of control. That accusation misses an important point. It is local councils that set council tax levels, not the Government. We have reserve capping powers, which we have used to deal with excessive increases over the past 2&nbsp;years. There is no excuse for excessive council tax increases, but we should not confuse the principles of the council tax with council tax increases. There is an important difference.

<a name="stpa_72">Since coming to office, the Government have provided local councils with grant increases of 33&nbsp;per cent. in real terms. Local authorities know that we are serious about capping and that we will use those powers if we have to.

We will shortly be announcing the provisional local government finance settlement for 2006&#150;07. That will see a move to three-year settlements for individual authorities, with allocations for the authorities covering next year and 2007&#150;08. We will also be announcing individual allocations for those two years for specific grants which it is possible to allocate in advance. For others, such as performance-related grants, it is not possible to do so.

<a name="stpa_74">After the considerable extra funds provided this year&#151;an increase of 6.3&nbsp;per cent. overall compared with last year&#151;and the transfer of schools funding, the overall increase in formula grant for local authorities is likely to be lower than in previous settlements. However, it is important that the spending power that this grant will deliver for authorities is taken into account. Because of the shift to 100&nbsp;per cent. Government funding of schools, council tax will fund more of the other local services, so unless the whole picture is looked at, the increase next year cannot be compared with grant increases in earlier years.

<a name="51019-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_75">It is often said that the present system is unfair to pensioners. The Government recognise the concerns of many pensioners, particularly those on low or fixed incomes, about excessive council tax increases. However, as I have already said, it is local authorities, not central Government, that set the increases in council tax. Keeping council tax increases down is only one side of the coin; improving pensioner incomes is the other. We have already done a great deal in that regard, spending nearly &#163;11&nbsp;billion extra on pensioners in 2005&#150;06, compared with 1997. On average, after allowing for inflation, pensioner households are about &#163;1,500&nbsp;better off this year than they would have been under the system that operated in 1997. The least well-off third of pensioner households are, on average, &#163;2,000&nbsp;better off.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_76">We are providing money to pensioners specifically to help them pay their council tax bills. We gave &#163;100 to households with someone aged 70 or over in 2004&#150;05. In 2005&#150;06 households with someone aged 65 or over will receive an extra &#163;200. The money will usually arrive with their winter fuel payment and is in addition to that, unless they are receiving the pension credit guarantee. People getting the guarantee element of pension credit are already entitled to a 100 per cent. rebate of their council tax bills. Households with someone aged 70 or over getting the pension credit guarantee will receive &#163;50 to help with general living costs.

 The Conservatives have accused the Government of confusion over revaluation, but as the debate has been relatively good natured, let me give the Labour Government credit. They have been consistently in favour of revaluation until a few weeks ago, when they did a giant U-turn, more out of political cowardice than out of ideology. The Conservatives, on the other hand, have held half a dozen diametrically opposed positions over the same period, with no obvious guiding ideology, and as we heard again from their Front-Bench spokesman today, the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), no obvious views about how local government finance should be reformed in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_78">Let us consider Labour&#039;s record. When the council tax was introduced, countless Labour shadow Ministers argued passionately that a property tax required a revaluation in order to be valid, as we heard again today. Fast-forward to 1998&nbsp;when the Labour Government were in power and produced a White Paper, &quot;Modern Local Government&quot;. Their position then was essentially that revaluations are necessary, but not yet. Four years later, in 2002, the Government decided that the time had come. The Local Government Bill set out a timetable for revaluation in 2005&nbsp;in Wales and 2007&nbsp;in England, and every 10&nbsp;years thereafter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_79">A few weeks ago, as we know, the Government got extreme cold feet about the political repercussions of revaluation and retreated to the comfort of the old position. As the Minister for Local Government told an audience yesterday at the meeting of SIGOMA&#151;special interest group of municipal authorities&#151;in the House of Commons, the Government postponed revaluation only after analysis demonstrated that there would be about 2.2 million losers as households moved up one or more bands. They predicted that the money that would need to be set aside for appeals could destabilise local government finances altogether. I guess their position remains, &quot;We need revaluations, but not now, please. Not on our watch.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_80">Sadly, Wales has not been quite as lucky. We argued for the Welsh Assembly to have powers to introduce primary legislation so that it could, for example, abolish the unfair council tax system, but the Labour Government would not give such powers to the Welsh Assembly under devolution. Revaluation was therefore foisted on Wales by the Government in the 2003&nbsp;Local Government Bill. Wales was used as an experiment, just like Scotland for the poll tax. The experiment has gone horribly wrong.

<a name="stpa_98">Council tax penalises the old and the low paid. Remember, it was brought in as a replacement for the poll tax&#151;the most regressive system imaginable. It was only in contrast to the poll tax that council tax appeared to have an element of fairness and was accepted by the British people. Nearly 15&nbsp;years on, it has become painfully apparent that council tax is not a fair tax. That is why there are protests, demonstrations and petitions up and down the country and in this place. That is why pensioners feel the need to go to prison in protest rather than pay their bill. Council tax is Britain&#039;s most unfair tax. The Conservatives invented it, so it is hardly surprising that they still think it is good enough. But it is a tax that Labour should be ashamed of. The poorest 10&nbsp;per cent. of pensioners pay nearly 10&nbsp;per cent. of their income in council tax, and that is after council tax

How can that be fair? How can a Labour party member defend that situation? The poorest 20&nbsp;per cent. Spend four times as much of their income on council tax as the richest 20&nbsp;per cent. A pensioner couple on a modest pension could find themselves paying as much council tax as an investment banker who lives next door. Earlier this year, the &quot;Gloucester Citizen&quot; newspaper uncovered the case of a retired farmer who makes ends meet by running a bed and breakfast, and who pays more council tax than his near neighbour, Prince Charles.

<a name="stpa_106">Freedom and autonomy for councils is only possible with a wholly reformed financial regime. The Government&#039;s freedoms and flexibilities agenda is nothing without the one freedom that must precede them all&#151;the freedom for councils to raise and spend their own money. However, the Government see fit to retain a system that cripples councils by making them dependent on central Government for most of the money that they spend, and councils too often have no choice over how much they raise in council tax because of the crude capping system, which Margaret Thatcher introduced, but which this Labour Government operate with great zeal&#151;earlier this year, we saw that zeal in the House.

Six million pensioners would pay nothing at all, because their incomes are so low that they do not pay income tax. Local income tax would also encourage people back into work.

 The hon. Gentleman says that the council tax is a property tax, and in one sense that is so.

Does he agree that there is sometimes confusion between a property-based tax and a wealth tax, and that the council tax is not the latter?

<p><a name="st_120"><a name="51019-15_spnew1"><b> Dr. Whitehead: </b> 
 It is true that council tax as a tax on property does not bear an exact relationship to wealth, but neither does a local income tax, given the way in which it might be collected. On the other hand, a local property tax can define what are the properties in a particular area and collect the funds from them in an easy and straightforward way. The amount of evasion under the poll tax compared with the council tax differs by an enormous order of magnitude.

<p>
<a name="51019-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_118">If we agree in principle that a property tax might be a way forward in collecting taxes for local government, it is inevitable that we have to revalue its basis from time to time. One cannot, as the Conservatives apparently do, support a property tax without accepting that it must reflect the way in which it is likely to be collected over a period of time. The idea that using bands means that one escapes from revaluation was one of the less well advised of those that were floated when council tax was first introduced.

<a name="51019-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_119">What does one do about it? Despite what the Conservatives say, several things need to be recognised about council tax. It builds inflation into council tax demands by settling the amount of money that local government will have from central Government grant before the decision is taken on raising council tax locally, thereby introducing a gearing effect into local government spending in a way that is not structurally necessary. There is potentially a problem of inflation because revaluation means that people jump between bands, although one can get round that by attempting to organise a revenue-neutral rebanding. Perhaps a council tax that is not based on bands but on points is a more sensible way to proceed.
</p>

<a name="51019-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_120">Business rates are capped at the rate of inflation, whereas council tax is not. Over a period of time, that draws the yield from business rates away from the yield from council tax and places a greater burden on domestic council taxpayers.

Let&#039;s spend it on bureaucrats and consultants.&quot; It would not be so bad if they had decided to scrap the revaluation, but they have postponed, not scrapped it. Revaluation will hit the elderly and the vulnerable hardest. How much more money will be wasted on consultants and advisers before proposals are presented to the House?

I detected through my listening campaign that council tax revaluation was a ticking time bomb, long before it became the national issue that it is today.

 I am interested in the spin that the hon. Gentleman puts on that.

The Government have placed many obstacles in the way of pensioners claiming relief&#151;many pensioners who should get relief do not receive it. Labour Members also acknowledge that the forms are complicated and the people who deserve the help do not get it.

<a name="stpa_133">Revaluation would mean that our council tax bills would hit the roof. Revaluation of properties in England would give local authorities the gift of increasing their base tax and blaming the Government for the resultant increases in council tax. If the Government are trying to claim that council tax revaluation would be broadly neutral and that there would be both winners and losers, they are living in cloud cuckoo land. All council tax payers would lose out from revaluation because it would be an opportunity to increase a stealth tax by the back door.

<a name="51019-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_134">If hon. Members do not believe me, let us consider what happened in Wales, where only 8&nbsp;per cent. went down a band. However, the greater problem is that, for the change to be neutral, the rate of council tax would have to be reduced because so many properties would go up a band. There would therefore be an automatic increase in tax revenues. Does any hon. Member believe that that would happen?

<a name="stpa_135">We need a Government who reduce council tax and introduce proposals to change the way in which local councils are funded centrally. Talking is not good enough. The Government make the excuse that they will not introduce revaluation yet, because it needs to be considered as part of a wider review of how local authorities are funded, but they have been reviewing since 1998. Is not it time for action or are another four years of talking shops and wasted millions in store for the people of England?
</p>

<a name="51019-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_136">Local councillors often tell me that the Government require local authorities to take on more and more responsibility and more portfolios but without the necessary money from the centre to fund it. Wellingborough council has been consistently underfunded by any objective formula.

<br>&nbsp;<br>by echoing the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead), that if we are in favour of a property tax&#151;I know that the Liberal Democrats are not, but the Conservatives apparently are&#151;it is illogical never to revalue a property to bring it into line with the current situation. It does not matter whether the system is based on bands or on the actual value of the property; at some point, a revaluation is needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_138">Are the Conservatives seriously saying that, while they support a council tax or similar property tax, they would never revalue, even after 20, 30&nbsp;or 40&nbsp;years? The longer we go on without revaluation, the more irrelevant the tax becomes and the less people are able to see any reality in it. And all the time, we have the nonsense of artificially revaluing new properties. That is an unsustainable position. The Conservatives try to pretend that the Government have changed their position for reasons of political advantage, but I suspect that the Conservatives&#039; position is very much one of political advantage, in that they do not want to be associated with any revaluations whatever.

</p>








<p><a name="st_128"><a name="51019-16_spnew4"><b> Mr. Betts: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman should read his party&#039;s motion. Members on his own Front Bench have drawn the distinction between deferral and cancellation, and the Government&#039;s position is clearly one of deferral.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_139">As I have said, I have some reservations about the Government&#039;s position. It has already been established that 10&nbsp;years is about the right period between revaluations. The timetable that had been agreed would have taken it to 15&nbsp;years, and now we are talking about perhaps 20&nbsp;years. My concern is that the longer we go on, the greater the scope for differences between the changes in the value of different properties. I can certainly see that happening in my constituency. I also have reservations about carrying out a revaluation at the same time as introducing other potentially significant changes in local government taxation, as that could lead to confusion among the public as to which change had affected which element of their bill. That could be very difficult to disentangle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_140">However, the Government are right to lay down that we should establish the precise functions of local government&#151;I welcome the widening of Sir Michael Lyons&#039;s remit in that regard&#151;and then agree on an appropriate financial system to fit in with those functions. Local authorities have an important central role to play as the strategic authority for their area, covering a wide range of services. May I suggest that my hon. Friend the Minister has a friendly chat with his colleagues in other Departments to ensure that they are on board with this agenda as well? With regard to the regional government proposals, when it became clear that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was in the business of devolving and decentralising functions, it was not equally clear that Departments such as the Department for Transport and the Department for Education and Skills were on the same wavelength.

 I was expressing my reservations about the deferral and my concern that the revaluation might get confused with lots of other issues, rather than being helpful.

<a name="stpa_143">I want to return to the point made by the Lib Dems. I do not accept their argument that the only fair form of tax is income tax. If they are arguing that a tax has to be related to people&#039;s income, will they at some point also suggest that VAT or excise duty should be replaced by income tax? The reality is that we tax a whole range of different things, and that those taxes collectively form the revenues of government. I believe that it is perfectly reasonable to have some tax on property, as most countries do. I accept that for a minority of people who rent a property, that property does not represent a store of wealth for them. However, most of those rented properties are in band A. Many people do have a store of wealth in their property, and it is not unreasonable to tax someone&#039;s major store of wealth. Council tax is also easy and cheap to collect, and difficult to evade. Those are important elements of a taxation system.

<br>&nbsp;<br>reasonable to tax it. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was arguing for the complete abolition of property tax. I am arguing that the principle of a property tax is fair. The key question is how it is implemented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_144">I would argue strongly that we have to find a way for local government to become more accountable and responsible for raising its own revenue. The key to that will be to bring the business rate back into the orbit of local authority responsibility. It is wrong that increases in business rates have been restricted to the annual inflation rate. That has inevitably resulted in a greater percentage of the money for local services having to be raised from council tax payers than from business rate payers. Business rates should be brought back, and if there has to be a restriction&#151;as there was on the domestic rates and business rates before the poll tax was introduced&#151;the two should be linked. It is possible to link increases in council tax with increases in business rates so that local authorities do not put the entire burden on business rate payers. That would also mean that any increases in revenue that were needed locally would be spread across a wider base, which would reduce the problem of gearing. That would be one significant reform that could come out of this process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_145">I know that there are differences between the incomes of people in different groups, but broadly speaking, council tax is not regressive; it is usually neutral. However, it is regressive if we compare the amount that people pay with the value of their property. If we compare the &#163;40,000&nbsp;value of a property at the top of band A with the &#163;320,000&nbsp;value of a property at the bottom of band H, the difference is about eightfold. Yet the council tax payable on the band H property is only three times that paid on the band A property, so the burden is greater on people at the bottom end of the scale. When we come to examine council tax seriously, we need to look at how the burden is spread across the bands, and probably at the bands themselves. Perhaps we shall need another band A, and perhaps a splitting of the top band. Those are all possible ways in which we can more fairly relate what people pay to the actual value of their property.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_146">We should also consider the proposal that pensioners who do not want to give up their house, but who are struggling because they are on a fixed income&#151;I take the point made by the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)&#151;should be able to defer payment of their council tax until they sell their property. I have no problem with that at all. The proposal has been referred to as a death tax, but that is frankly silly. There would be no compulsion on people to defer payment, and it would have to be done in a way that did not impose a penalty on other council tax payers. But that is a possibility, and it could deal with the problem of pensioners being forced to sell their home.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_147">I also accept some of the criticisms of council tax benefit. The reality is that council tax benefit is taken up fairly well by people in social rented housing. Only about 50&nbsp;per cent. of owner-occupiers who are eligible take it up, however. That is a real challenge. Certainly, we must do more in terms of publicity, but perhaps we should consider the whole issue of council tax benefit and its structure to see whether we can find a better way 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 884</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to encourage people to take it up. Certainly, making the tax more progressive would be helpful and would deal with a particular group of people who are currently hard-hit by not taking up their benefits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_148">The Local Government Information Unit has produced an interesting pamphlet, which I hope that Ministers will read. It identifies another problem, which relates to the point made by Liberal Democrats that some people will be better off with local income tax. The reason that some working families on relatively low incomes are better off under a local income tax is that people start paying income tax at a higher earning level than that at which they start paying council tax, which means that they start losing council tax benefit. If we could bring into line the points at which people pay income tax and council tax, we could deal with another element of unfairness in the current council tax system in terms of how it impacts on low earners who are struggling to make their way and to get a better income than if they simply relied on benefits.

 In May 1997 I was elected to Northamptonshire county council, and exactly one year later was handed the shadow finance portfolio and tasked with preparing the Conservative group for county government. On that self-same day, our current Prime Minister was given the immediate task of running our country. There is a bit of a difference between those two tasks, but I was allowed to experience at first hand the impact that the newly elected Government would have on the quality of local government in my county and on the welfare of its citizens. I was especially well placed to judge that impact from a financial perspective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_150">I well remember some of the promises concerning local government that were made in the Labour party&#039;s manifesto prior to that election. I want to remind the House of a few of them, not least because the Minister referred to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_151">First, the manifesto promised that local government would be less constrained by central Government. How I wish that that promise had been kept.

It is another example, however, of not following through on a promise.

That is hardly an example of fair distribution, bearing in mind the impact of year-on-year revenue expenditure on services.

Almost everybody in local government, however, will have horror stories to tell of the best value regime&#151;as I am sure you will have heard, Madam Deputy Speaker&#151;of the money it wasted, and the time and effort that it cost to so little avail.

Recent events have especially drawn our attention to the seeming unfairness of the current system for certain sections of our community&#151;we have already mentioned our state pensioners, many of whom have seen up to 40&nbsp;per cent. of their basic pension increases clawed back by council tax increases over the past eight years. The decision to supersede that review with the Lyons review, which was programmed to report at the end of 2005&nbsp;but was then extended further by widening the terms of reference to include the functions of local government and its future role, suggested a wish to delay and prevaricate rather than to act and progress.

<a name="stpa_158">Since Labour came to power, the average council tax bill has increased by 76&nbsp;per cent., and by even more in my county, because revenue support grant has fallen and public sector inflation has increased way beyond inflation in the economy generally.

It therefore increased by more than twice the rate of general inflation, and that was in a very benign quarter.

That is the inflation figure that local government must deal with, and it is in many respects created by the Government themselves. I wish that the Government would show some humility in that regard.

Not only did they fail to address the subject of the debate, revaluation, but they demonstrated a rather depressing failure to understand the difference between rhetoric and reality. I want to deal directly with the important issue of revaluation, and I begin by saying that I have little or no sympathy with the stance taken by either Opposition party today.

<a name="51019-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_166">The Conservatives were consistent only in their opportunistic criticism of the Government, which revealed a vacuum in place of any positive policy of their own&#151;despite the characteristically good-humoured presentation from the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), whom I am always delighted to see here. As was pointed out by my hon. Friends the Members for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) and for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), it is nonsensical to support a council tax system based on property values without making any provision for revaluation from time to time to reflect changes in values.

<p>
<a name="51019-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_167">The Liberal Democrats could lay claim to consistency, but only in terms of economic illiteracy. We heard two extraordinary propositions today. The hon.

<a name="stpa_168">The hon. Member for Brent, East has already had a good opportunity and made a mess of it. She should hear a few facts. There is a problem with take-up of council tax benefit. Had she put the case for those who do not receive it, I would have had some sympathy with her, but she advanced the extraordinary proposition that the circumstances she described applied to the poorest pensioners after their receipt of benefit. I am sorry, but that is economically illiterate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_169">The second example of economic illiteracy was the response to the challenge issued by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe, who asked how a PAYE-based system of local income tax would deal with those outside the PAYE system. The hon. Member for Brent, East said that they would be subject to a different form of taxation, based to some extent on business rates. That would of course mean every property in the country having to be valued, yet the hon. Lady persisted in her claim that ending property valuations would save &#163;300&nbsp;million. That is typical of the Liberal Democrats. They do not do their sums, or their sums do not add up, and no one believes that a local income tax would generate the benefits that they claim for it.

<a name="51019-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_170">Having said that, I should add that I have serious reservations about the Government&#039;s wish to postpone revaluation.

<a name="stpa_172">As I was saying, an area in my constituency that was an industrial wasteland with no properties is being regenerated very effectively as a result of Government policies, and there are many new properties there.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 889</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_147"><a name="51019-19_spnew3"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman bears with me, he will understand that although stamp duty is an interesting subject for a debate in which we could engage on another occasion, it is not relevant to this debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_173">I return to a point on which I challenged the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar. When a property changes hands, it is revalued. People who live in a property whose value has risen or fallen significantly in relation to the average since 1991&nbsp;will experience the consequences when they sell it, but someone living next door whose house has not been sold will not be affected in the same way. There will be increasing anomalies and inconsistencies between properties, which is another sound reason why we cannot have a valuation system without periodic revaluations. The anomalies become worse. The longer the situation continues, the more problematic it becomes, and the more difficult changing it becomes. That is why it is essential that there be arrangements for revaluation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_174">The Government&#039;s case for postponement of revaluation is related to the Lyons review, and I welcome the wider remit for that inquiry. My hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government rightly highlighted the benefit of a wider look at this issue, but I fail to see why revaluation should be postponed. If council tax is to continue as an important and not necessarily the only element in a framework for local government finance, it will not provide a fair basis for funding unless it is subject to revaluation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_175">Sir Michael has made clear his view that a one-year postponement would have been acceptable&#151;I understand, however, that he did not recommend it&#151;but he has also clearly expressed reservations about the indefinite postponement proposed by the Government. Although such a postponement might be acceptable, pending the completion of the Lyons inquiry and the Government&#039;s assessment of it, I see no basis whatever for removing the obligation in the legislation for a review thereafter, within a minimum of 10 years. Regular, periodic reviews are essential in order to keep council tax valuations up to date, and to avoid excessive turbulence if the revaluation is delayed unreasonably&#151;a point made forcefully by the RICS in its submission.
</p>








<p><a name="st_148"><a name="51019-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hands </b> 
: I am intrigued by the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s support for revaluation. He referred to a report on the issue, and I wonder whether he has read the report from the New Policy Institute on the effect of revaluation of London properties. They will be by far the worst affected&#151;at least, that is, until the recent falls in property prices. I have in my hand a photograph of a property reckoned to be one of the worst affected. The right hon. Gentleman will know it well&#151;a band D council flat in Sulivan Court, in Fulham&#151;because he used to be the Member of Parliament responsible for it. It will suffer the largest increase of any property in the country under the revaluation that he supports.
</p>








<p><a name="st_149"><a name="51019-19_spnew5"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 That rather rambling and incoherent contribution indicates the hon. Gentleman&#039;s lack of understanding. The New Policy Institute gave detailed evidence to the balance of funding review that I chaired, making it clear that as part of the revaluation exercise it is important that changes be made, such as the introduction of new bands or regional banding perhaps, in order to avoid precisely the anomalies and injustices that the hon. Gentleman has conjured up. I am afraid 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that he is seizing opportunistically on a piece of evidence without understanding the implications of the NPI&#039;s position. That is rather characteristic of his party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_176">There has been much focus in this debate&#151;the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar gave an example&#151;on the scope for losses resulting from revaluation. &#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Members should bear with me, because there is an important lesson to be learned. Wales was much quoted, and in Wales 33&nbsp;per cent. of council tax payers were losers and only 8&nbsp;per cent. were gainers. That reflected the decision taken under the devolved framework&#151;
</p>

: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?

<p><a name="st_151"><a name="51019-19_spnew7"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 No. I have given way already and I am not doing so again. We are time limited, as the hon. Gentleman will understand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_177">The decision taken in Wales was that there should be an increase in yield. It is perfectly proper for such a decision to be taken within a devolved framework, but it is not a decision to be taken in England. Indeed, the Government have been absolutely consistent in saying that there should be no increase in yield in England as a result of revaluation&#151;a point also endorsed by the RICS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_178">So in England, it is likely not that there would be a large number of losers and very few gainers, but that there would be broad parity between losers and gainers as a result of a revaluation, with no increase in yield. That of course means&#151;I ask Opposition Members to listen to this point&#151;that many people will continue to pay more council tax than they should post-2007, because they will remain in bands that are higher than they should be in terms of current values. If we are talking about justice and fairness, it is important not to be opportunistic in picking out single examples; rather, we must look seriously at the pattern across the country of current liabilities for council tax, and consider how that would be changed by any particular form of revaluation. Value judgments are made in the course of a revaluation, and how it is done is clearly important to the outcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_179">So I put it to my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government that the House and I would find it helpful to have the benefit of the evidence that Ministers examined concerning the gains and losses that are likely to apply to individual households under different revaluation scenarios. The hon. Member for Brent, East quoted my hon. Friend as saying in a meeting with SIGOMA that there were just over 2&nbsp;million losers. The Halifax, however, estimates that there might be more gainers than losers under revaluation. That certainly implies that there must be at least 2.2&nbsp;million people&#151;perhaps more&#151;who would have gained from revaluation, had it taken place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_180">The House is owed a detailed statement setting out the full implications of postponement. I therefore hope that my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government will be willing to publish the evidence that he and my right hon. Friend the Minister of Communities and Local Government saw before they decided to postpone revaluation. As my hon. Friend acknowledged, the change of policy that he outlined will require new

<a name="51019-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_181">Local government provides a range of absolutely vital services, and it is important that it has a finance system that underpins its work and enables it to get on with its job effectively. The Lyons inquiry is rightly looking at a long term, more sustainable basis for local government finance, and we should give that inquiry full support. We should encourage Sir Michael to come forward with practical and, where appropriate, radical proposals, and I hope that the House will have a good opportunity to debate them in the reasonably near future. It is in all our interests to have a more sound, more sustainable basis for the long-term future of local government funding.

 I want to take this opportunity to share with the House the impact that council tax revaluation has already had on Wales. That impact unquestionably serves as a warning to the people of England of what will occur if council tax revaluation goes ahead here. Wales was ripped off, tucked up and had over. That will happen here and we will face the same hardships as our Welsh brethren if we are not very careful. For the benefit of those in the House who are unfamiliar with this tale of Labour greed and incompetence, I will explain why the council tax revaluation has failed in Wales and consequently left hundreds of thousands of hard-working home owners greatly out of pocket.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_182">During the past eight years and even before taking into account the impact of revaluation in this financial year, council tax has risen by an average of &#163;426&nbsp;per household&#151;a whopping 86&nbsp;per cent. Areas such as Blaenau Gwent have faced increases of &#163;546, which is 12&nbsp;times the rate of inflation. Monmouthshire has suffered council tax rises of &#163;514, which equates to a 128&nbsp;per cent. increase since 1997, or 13&nbsp;times the rate of inflation. In Swansea, council tax has increased by 84&nbsp;per cent.; in Cardiff it is up by 80&nbsp;per cent. Pembrokeshire has experienced the lowest increase&#151;just 57&nbsp;per cent.&#151;but that is little consolation to Pembrokeshire home owners, who still have to find an extra &#163;256.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_183">The move towards revaluation began in September 2000, when the National Assembly for Wales began its consultation on possible changes to local government finance in Wales. That consultation was superseded by the introduction of the Local Government Act 2003. As the House is aware, the outcome was that all homes in Wales were assessed with a view to being rebanded. At the time, the Opposition opposed the measure, and we continue to believe that this mistake has left Welsh home owners with the burden of more taxation than is either appropriate or necessary.

<p><a name="st_159"><a name="51019-20_spnew6"><b> Julie Morgan  (Cardiff, North) (Lab):</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman fails to bring to the House&#039;s attention how much lower council tax is in Wales, after revaluation, than it is in England. In fact, the average council tax payment in England is &#163;1,009, whereas it is &#163;790&nbsp;in Wales, after revaluation. On average, council tax in England is 24&nbsp;per cent. more than in Wales.
</p>








<p><a name="st_160"><a name="51019-20_spnew7"><b> Bill Wiggin: </b> 
 I understand why the hon. Lady wants to make that point, but she faces a difficult time over this matter. Cardiff has seen increases of more than eight times inflation. The hon. Lady&#039;s city has a total population of 136,575, but 67,775&nbsp;people have had their council tax moved up one band; 17,923&nbsp;by two bands; 921&nbsp;by three; and 58&nbsp;by four bands or more. Perhaps she will tell us whether she lives in one of those houses.
</p>








<p><a name="st_161"><a name="51019-20_spnew8"><b> Julie Morgan: </b> 
 I should draw the hon. Gentleman&#039;s attention to the fact that a band D household in Cardiff, after revaluation, pays &#163;872&nbsp;compared with a band D household in Bristol, which pays &#163;1,296. My point is that council tax in Wales has been kept consistently lower than in England. It is important that the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that point in his discussion.

<a name="51019-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_187">On 1&nbsp;April 2005, the Valuation Office Agency&#039;s rebanding of Welsh properties came into effect, leading to significant numbers&#151;one in every three&#151;of Welsh home owners having to pay a higher rate of council tax on being moved into a higher band. As a result of council tax rises and rebanding in Wales, the average council tax bill has risen by 9.1&nbsp;per cent. for the financial year 2005&#150;06. The average Welsh home owner will now have to pay a post-revaluation council tax bill of &#163;790&nbsp;as opposed to the &#163;724&nbsp;they paid pre-revaluation. Some of that increase can be attributed to council tax inflation, but the rest can be attributed only to the profiteering from the post-revaluation rebanding. Wages have not risen by 9.1&nbsp;per cent., and nor have inflation and pensions, which makes that increase seem all the more unjustifiable.

<a name="stpa_188">The statistics clearly contradict the assertion made by Sue Essex in 2003&nbsp;that a quarter of Welsh households would move down a banding scale and a quarter would move up.

 That poses the question of what would have been a bad policy development, if that was a good one. Surely the answer to the hon.

<a name="51019-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_191">I welcome the fact that the Labour Administrations in Whitehall and Cardiff have recognised the financial insecurity that the rises are causing the people of Wales, but I do not think that the extra &#163;11&nbsp;million proposed for transitional relief will make enough of a difference, especially when one considers the fact that most of that relief is available for one year only. In addition, by 2008, the revaluation will lead to a further 5&nbsp;per cent. of Welsh home owners paying higher council tax bills as a result of moving upwards into another band. That is why we want to end the need for those increases&#151;by stopping the planned upward movements by more than one band.

<a name="stpa_192">My hon.

The grant given to local councils in Wales from central Government increased by only 40&nbsp;per cent. That is why Welsh council tax payers are now paying for some 20&nbsp;per cent. of all local government expenditure, as opposed to the 15&nbsp;per cent. that they were paying back in 1997.

No Government can justify taking more money from the public and not providing hard-pressed taxpayers with adequate value for money. In Wales, despite the increases in council tax, hospital waiting times are still the highest in Britain and education standards are still the lowest in Britain. Welsh home owners are paying for increased red tape, paying for more waste and paying for further misadministration. That is the sad truth behind revaluation and the truth that the Labour Government are trying to shield from us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_194">Having drawn to the House&#039;s attention the problems that the revaluation of council tax in Wales has caused, it is important to highlight the lessons that must be learned. First, we have seen added financial misery, to hundreds of thousands of people. Secondly, the Labour Government revaluation can never be revenue-neutral, as the taxpayer will always have to pay more. Thirdly, the revaluation legislation muddies the waters of responsibility and it is not always clear who is responsible for the bills that have been created. We find ourselves asking who will take responsibility. The only thing that I can say with some certainty is that it is the Labour party that must take the blame.

 I shall address some of the points made in the debate and then make one point of my own. When the Minister winds up, I hope that he will take up a point that the Minister of State mentioned when he opened the debate, which was of great interest to those of us who spent a long time in local government. He implied that the financial settlement for local government this year is likely to be ungenerous, especially outside education. The figure of 1.5&nbsp;per cent. has been bandied around, and that would cause extreme difficulties, especially for district councils, and lead to severe reductions in services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_195">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) mentioned pensioners and council tax benefits. Large numbers of pensioners do not receive council tax benefits, for two reasons. First, as the right hon. Gentleman said, many do not claim the benefit. Secondly, even quite modest savings take pensioners above the capital limit. Both factors put together mean that many pensioners do not receive council tax benefits, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_196">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) made the point about local income tax and foreign nationals, but that point is easily answered. A foreign national is either resident for income tax purposes or not. If resident for income tax purposes, a foreign national will pay local income tax. For those not resident for income tax purposes, we will introduce a second home tax based on land value. That will not require all properties in the country to be valued&#151;only those used as second homes.
</p>








<p><a name="st_170"><a name="51019-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 When a local authority does not at the beginning of the year know who will occupy a particular property, how will it be able to make the appropriate valuation on which the supposed land value tax will apply?
</p>








<p><a name="st_171"><a name="51019-21_spnew2"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 It will work on the previous year&#039;s figures. The Treasury will guarantee the funding on the previous year&#039;s figures when working out the funding on the following year&#039;s grant. That is standard practice in local government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_172"><a name="51019-21_spnew3"><b> Adam Afriyie: </b> 
 My concern is not the effect of the local income tax on the overseas visitor resident here, but its effect on two schoolteachers&#151;or two nurses, two doctors or two firemen&#151;on average salaries who share a flat. Under the Liberal Democrats&#039; scheme, such people would have to pay far more than under the council tax. Is the hon. Gentleman not concerned about those groups?
</p>








<p><a name="st_173"><a name="51019-21_spnew4"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East said, whether such people would pay more depends on their incomes and what band house they live in now. Under a local income tax, people living in a band H house can earn up to &#163;60,000&nbsp;between them before losing out. The hon. Gentleman should remember that average household income is &#163;26,000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_197">The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe, who is unfortunately not in his place, claimed that the council tax is not regressive. In fact, it is the most regressive 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 896</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>major tax and it makes the tax system as a whole regressive. That is why replacing it with a local income tax would make the whole system progressive.
</p>








<p><a name="st_174"><a name="51019-21_spnew5"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis: </b> 
 May I remind the hon. Gentleman that during the election campaign the leader of his party was gravely embarrassed when he logged on to the Liberal Democrats&#039; own website on air and made some comparisons using the website&#039;s calculator. In nearly every case with more than one wage earner in the household, the local income tax would have cost people a great deal more. The hon. Gentleman cannot escape that fact, however much he tries to spin it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_175"><a name="51019-21_spnew6"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 I repeat that the cost will depend on the band of house that people already occupy. People who live together in large houses are, by definition, in high band houses, so the comparison with the average house is not valid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_198">I come to my single main point. Contrary to what the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said, this debate is not only about revaluation. It is also about the Lyons review. As several hon. Members have said, both the motion and the amendment mention the important point about asking the Lyons review to consider the strategic role and accountability of local government, so that local government finance can be reviewed in the context of the functions of local government. One might point out that the Government should have realised from the beginning that the options for local government finance cannot be understood without understanding and making choices about local government function. The obvious question is why the Government have taken two and a half years&#151;since the beginning of the balance of funding review&#151;to realise that obvious fact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_199">There is a more fundamental and important point. The functions, role and accountability of local government are not a matter for expert committees; they are political questions that the Government must make up their mind about rather than asking somebody else. The question for the Government and for the Labour party is: what should be the proper relationship between central and local government?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_200">There are three important aspects of that&#151;three central questions that the Government need to sort out. First, do the Government believe in pluralism? Do they believe that local government should be able to follow its own political objectives and not merely be an agent of national Government? More profoundly, do they believe that local government is valuable because it can act as a check and a balance on central power&#151;that it is a way of dispersing power in society? There is an historical problem for both parties. For the Conservatives, there is the problem of the Greater London council, which they abolished precisely because it provided an alternative political base and political opposition to the Government. Many people disagreed with what Mr. Livingstone was doing with the GLC at the time&#151;many still do&#151;but supported his campaign to maintain the existence of the council because it provided an alternative centre of political power.

<p>
<a name="51019-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_201">For the Labour party, the equivalent problem was the Militant Tendency in Liverpool. There was a great speech by Mr. Kinnock at the Blackpool conference&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_176"><a name="51019-21_spnew7"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 Bournemouth.
</p>








<p><a name="st_177"><a name="51019-21_spnew8"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 Sorry, it was Bournemouth. It is good to see that there is an even greater political nerd than me in the Chamber.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_202">There is a direct link between the political embarrassment of those times and the constitutional centralisation that the Labour party has followed in office since 1997. Both those troublesome local authorities could have been dealt with by a simple solution: the introduction of proportional representation in local government elections. However, that solution would bring political embarrassment to both sides of the House, because it would mean further questions about the legitimacy of elections to this place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_203">My first central question was whether the Government believe in pluralism. Do they believe in the dispersal of power through local government? We do. The second fundamental question for the Government to answer instead of putting things off to the Lyons review is whether they believe that local government can provide experiment and variety in policy making. There is a temptation for central Government to believe that they are omniscient, that they can solve all problems from Whitehall and impose uniform solutions on the country, but everyone in local government knows that that is not the case.
</p>








<p><a name="st_178"><a name="51019-21_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hollobone: </b> 
 In the original remit for the Lyons review, Sir Michael was charged with considering the implications for the financing of possible elected regional assemblies. In the light of the vote in north-east England, does the hon. Gentleman still support that remit of the Lyons inquiry?
</p>








<p><a name="st_179"><a name="51019-21_spnew10"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 The question of regional assemblies still needs to be in the Lyons remit, but the Government should make some political judgments before the report to give Lyons more direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_204">To return to my point about experiment and variety, schools offer an example. Policies such as school choice work in densely populated urban areas with good public transport systems&#151;at least, they are good from the point of view of people in the rest of the country. Those policies would not necessarily work in an area such as rural Norfolk, where the population is widely dispersed and school choice is limited due to transport difficulties. The Government and the Labour party must wean themselves off easy headlines such as, &quot;Minister steps in to solve problem&quot; or &quot;Minister takes charge&quot;. It is easy to obtain such headlines, but the long-term consequence of seeking them is to undermine the ability of local government to experiment and work out solutions for its area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_205">The third fundamental question for the Government is whether they believe that local government provides a place where there can be democratic accountability and democratic participation. Every power of national Government&#151;to appoint people, to control total budgets and to direct their budgets&#151;should also be reviewed, to consider whether those powers could 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 898</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be better used and allocated locally, especially to local government. So the Government need to work out their own political direction first and to understand local government in terms of pluralism, experimentation and democratic accountability. If they get that done, they can move on to the Lyons report. The Liberal Democrats know where we stand on all those questions; we do not need an expert to tell us. I just hope that the Government work out their own position sooner than the next election.

<p><a name="st_180"><a name="51019-22_spnew0"><b> Angela Watkinson  (Upminster) (Con):</b> 
 This has been an interesting and revealing debate. All Opposition Members are only too well aware of the worry that has been felt by our constituents while the revaluation of their homes has been hanging over their heads. The main concern every year when councils set their budgets is how much the council tax will go up. In particular, retired people on modest fixed incomes have seen their disposable income reduce year on year. Many of them have been living in the same homes for decades: homes where they have brought up their families, homes that hold a lifetime of memories, homes that have increased in value beyond their wildest dreams and because of that fact&#151;one that is outside their control, incidentally&#151;homes that attract such high council tax bills that they can scarcely afford to continue living in them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_206">What of young families, with all the attendant expense of bringing up children, whose clothes seem to either wear out or be grown out of before they even reach the washing machine, mortgages with creeping interest rates and the increased costs of running the family car and buying season tickets to work&#151; all the normal nuts-and-bolts expenses of everyday life? A huge hike in council tax that results from property revaluation and goes up one or more bands, as the Welsh experience indicates, could have been the straw that broke the camel&#039;s back for some family budgets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_207">The knowledge that the Government were planning to revalue all properties has caused enormous concern and people are oh so relieved at the Government&#039;s recent policy U-turn&#151;at least for the time being. But, for how long will the revaluation be postponed? We have heard that Sir Michael Lyons recommended that it should not be postponed for longer than a year. We know that a Bill is coming up soon. So the revaluation has not been cancelled; it is still hanging there like the sword of Damocles&#151;it has not gone away. The Council Tax (New Valuation Lists for England) Bill will allow the Government to determine the date of the revaluation of properties in England by secondary legislation. The Government will be able to slip it through with little debate in Parliament.
</p>








<p><a name="st_181"><a name="51019-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Betts: </b> 
 Let us be absolutely clear what the Opposition&#039;s policy is on this matter. The hon. Lady is speaking to a motion that refers to cancelling the revaluation. Does that mean permanently cancelling it? In other words, there would never be a revaluation, according to Conservative party policy.
</p>








<p><a name="st_182"><a name="51019-22_spnew2"><b> Angela Watkinson: </b>

<a name="51019-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_209">The Lyons report refers to the complexity of local government funding, the strategic and expanding role and functions of local government, devolution, decentralisation and more accountability. We now have communities that are far more diverse, with much higher expectations of what their councils can provide for them. Local government needs to foster partnerships with the local community, the police, health authorities and all the other statutory bodies and the private sector in local area agreements. That will happen by 2007. There are already several highly successful strategic partnerships, and my council of Havering has the successful Havering strategic partnership. All its partners have an enormous amount of good will and wish to contribute in whatever way they can to try to improve services for the benefit of local people.

<a name="stpa_210">My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), who is not in the Chamber, referred to the need for the health service and educational services to work together to help special needs children. It is difficult to meet the growing needs of the ever-increasing numbers of children with special educational needs, many of which arise from medical conditions. Speech therapy, especially, has been under-provided for many decades. I examined the matter a year or so ago to determine how many colleges provided courses for speech therapists, whether those courses were fully attended and whether there was an unusually high drop-out rate. I did not find any problems with the training, but there is no tracking of what happens to qualified speech therapists after they have finished their courses. Where do they go? They do not go into education&#151;certainly not the state sector&#151;or the national health service, so where all the qualified speech therapists go is a mystery. Overcoming such a problem is an example of the way in which councils, health services and other partners could work together.

<p>
<a name="51019-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_211">The Minister said that a process of revaluing to align property values with council tax was fair, but how often would properties have to be revalued to make the system continuously fair? What will happen if property values flatline for several years, as they have in Westminster? How would local government funding be adjusted to take account of a fall in property prices?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_212">The Minister blamed councils for high council tax, which gave the impression that councils have the freedom to set their council tax at a level of their choice. However, we all know that central Government funding comes with many strings&#151;or statutory duties&#151;attached and with so much ring-fencing that only a small proportion of councils&#039; funding represents disposable income. Their freedom to set their budgets is thus severely restricted. They have of course received extra money, but the cost of their additional statutory duties, which are unfunded, has greatly outstripped that increase.

 That is a very good point. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman makes it because local government funding cannot be considered in isolation.

<a name="stpa_214">In 1997&nbsp;Labour inherited a system that was working. Most people understood and accepted it, so what did Labour do? It seized on council tax payers and made them the milch cows of the nation. Council tax has gone up 76&nbsp;per cent. in England and 86&nbsp;per cent. in Wales. The Government who promised not to increase income tax have put up council tax by the equivalent of 3&nbsp;per cent. on income tax.

 My hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government opened his speech by saying that he was genuinely excited at the prospect of today&#039;s debate.

<a name="stpa_216">Before I respond to specific issues raised by hon. Members, I feel obliged to emphasise what my hon. Friend said about council tax. He stressed three aspects that I wish to address: how the Government are already helping many people, not least pensioners, with their council tax bills; how we are taking firm action to ensure that council tax levels stay low; and how we are taking forward reform of the system through the inquiry by Sir Michael Lyons. Our aim is to ensure that high-quality services can be funded in a way that is both fair and sustainable in the long term.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_217">First, let me remind the House how much the Government are already doing to help people to pay their council tax bills. Help with those bills is available 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 901</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to those who are least well off through council tax benefit&#151;an important part of the picture. In 2005&#150;06, of the total council tax requirement of &#163;21.3&nbsp;billion, about &#163;3&nbsp;billion, or 14&nbsp;per cent., is being met through council tax benefit. The operation of the council tax benefit scheme is the responsibility of my right hon. and hon. Friends at the Department for Work and Pensions; however, both they and we at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are concerned that many people, especially pensioners, are not taking up their entitlement. Help is being offered to pensioners to try to resolve that. The focus in the short term is, rightly, on getting better take-up of council tax benefit, but for the longer term the DWP aims to make the council tax benefit system as automatic as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_218">In addition to council tax benefit, the Government are giving pensioners extra money specifically to help with council tax bills. We gave &#163;100&nbsp;to households with someone aged 70&nbsp;or over in 2004&#150;05, and in 2005&#150;06, households with someone aged over 65&nbsp;will receive &#163;200&#151;unless, of course, they are already entitled to a 100&nbsp;per cent. rebate. We are giving a lot of additional help to pensioners generally, spending almost &#163;11&nbsp;billion more on pensioners in 2005&#150;06&nbsp;than in 1997&nbsp;as a result of measures introduced since then. The help we are giving includes the &#163;200&nbsp;winter fuel payment for everyone aged over 60, which benefits more than 11&nbsp;million pensioners; there will be free local area off-peak bus travel for pensioners from April 2006; television licences are free for anyone aged over 75, which benefits more than 4&nbsp;million people; value added tax on fuel has been reduced from 8&nbsp;per cent. to 5&nbsp;per cent.; the over-60s receive free eye tests; and women aged 50&nbsp;to 70&nbsp;receive free breast screening. There have been record increases in the basic state pension, and pension credit, which guarantees at least &#163;109&nbsp;a week for single pensioners and &#163;167&nbsp;a week for couples from April this year, is set to rise in line with average earnings until 2008.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_219">Secondly, we are working hard to keep council tax down. We delivered another good settlement for local government in 2005&#150;06&#151;one that ensures that councils can provide a high level of service. We have provided an extra &#163;3.5&nbsp;billion&#151;6.3&nbsp;per cent. more than in 2004&#150;05. In total, local government has had a 33&nbsp;per cent. real-terms increase in funding since 1997.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_220">Thirdly, we are working to reform the system. The Government acknowledge that the current system is not perfect. As we said in response to the balance of funding review, our position is that council tax should be retained, but reformed. Sir Michael Lyons is already examining how the council tax system might be reformed and he is aware of the issues that have been raised by pensioner groups and individual pensioners. It is, however, entirely right that before giving us his recommendations on council tax, he take a step back to consider the current and emerging strategic role of local government in the context of national and local priorities for local services. Any proposals for reform of the funding system should be set firmly and explicitly in the wider context of a clear shared understanding of the role of local government and of councils&#039; accountability to service users, residents and taxpayers.

<br>&nbsp;<br>outrage among Conservative Members, almost regardless of what she says. However, she appeased them somewhat by announcing that she has persuaded her colleagues to vote with the Conservative party today. She announced that the poorest pensioners must pay 10&nbsp;per cent. of their income as council tax. My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) pointed out that that was inaccurate, and it was not the case. The hon. Lady said that a local income tax would be simpler to operate, but the balance of funding review chaired by my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich concluded that local income tax should be introduced only as a supplement to council tax to shift the balance of funding. We have therefore asked Sir Michael Lyons to look into a supplementary local income tax as part of his inquiry into local government funding. The balance of funding report flagged up the fact that considerable further work would be required to address substantial technical and administrative issues and costs associated with local income tax as well as the impact on individuals and employers before firm conclusions could be reached on its feasibility or desirability.

My hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government has read the Local Government Information Unit pamphlet, and the key question of the lower income threshold raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe is being examined by Sir Michael Lyons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-22_para19">
<a name="stpa_225">In his inimitable style, the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) challenged the Government to respond to concerns about his local council tax rates. I am sorry, but we do not recognise the figure that he cited of 0.9&nbsp;per cent. If he writes to me, we can examine what Northampton received, whether at the level of the shire, the district or Northampton, South itself. He sought an expression of humility from the Government. While there is genuine humility on the part of the Government its manifestation is not always apparent and it is not always reported.

<a name="51019-22_para20">
<a name="stpa_226">My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich spoke, as ever, with the authority that becomes someone with his experience. I acknowledge his strong feelings on the issue and his disagreement with the Government&#039;s position although, naturally, that is disappointing. The hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) took us back to Wales. If he will forgive me, I will not go there as time is against me and Welsh issues were fully aired at the beginning of our debate in a series of interventions. I am not sure if he deliberately used the word &quot;rebranding&quot; as opposed to &quot;rebanding&quot;, but I understood his point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-22_para21">
<a name="stpa_227">The hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) delivered his own winding-up speech, the point of which was entirely valid. There are political choices to be made and we will have to make them, but after we have taken advice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-22_para22">
<a name="stpa_228">In conclusion, today&#039;s debate has been a good opportunity for the Government to state their position. There will be further opportunities when the House debates the Council Tax (New Valuation Lists for England) Bill in due course. The future of local government is crucial for the future well-being of the country and the Government are determined to create a strong and sustainable role for it. We are convinced that we have the right approach for the reform of local government funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-22_para23">
<a name="stpa_229">We need a clear and complete picture of what we want from local government&#151;only then can we tackle the question of how it should be funded. We are confident that Sir Michael Lyons&#039;s extended work will provide an opportunity for fundamental and lasting reform. I invite the House to give him its full support in his endeavour, to vote to oppose the motion tabled by the Opposition and to support the amendment in my name and that of my right hon. and hon. Friends.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">That this House expresses its deep appreciation of the response of the emergency services and Transport for London to the terrorist outrages of 7th and 21st July 2005; urges heightened efforts to ensure that preparedness for emergencies is comprehensively pursued; believes that the appointment of a Minister for Homeland Security would contribute to effective co-ordination within government; calls for increased efforts in communicating with the public in respect of major threats, including both terrorist attacks and an influenza pandemic; regrets delays in the publication of an influenza pandemic contingency plan and the procurement of anti-viral drugs and disposable medical products; is concerned at the lack of public information and resulting confusion; and urges that pandemic influenza preparedness be achieved urgently, with effective communication to the NHS and public of the nature of the threat and planned responses.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_237">This debate has three purposes: first, to give the House its first opportunity since 7&nbsp;July to consider the implications of that terrorist attack on our contingency plans and preparedness; secondly, to put to the Government the case for further co-ordination and communication measures designed to increase our preparedness; and thirdly, to focus in detail on our contingency planning and current measures to combat the threat of an avian flu pandemic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_238">The House will be aware that there is a wide range of emergencies in response to which the Government are seeking to build resilience under the capabilities programme. Some of those concern natural disasters. As a vice-chair of the all-party group on flood prevention and a representative of a constituency affected by flooding in October 2001, I am only too aware of our developing plan for flood defence. There is an increasingly well-defined population who, all credit to them, actively seek information and means of protecting themselves. The Environment Agency, which, as I know from personal experience, learned some bitter lessons about flaws in its alert system in 2001, is introducing remodelling of the flood risk patterns to increase the advance warning that might be given. That is a good example of ways in which emergency preparedness can learn from past deficiencies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_239">Extremes of weather present other threats. The heat wave in France in the summer of 2003&nbsp;caused 5,000&nbsp;excess deaths. During winter in this country, as things stand at the moment, we have more than 20,000&nbsp;excess deaths&#151;twice the relative number in Germany. With the Met Office warning of the risk of severe cold weather this winter, now is the time for Government, local authorities, the NHS and housing associations to act, and for families to consider how they and their friends and neighbours are looked after.

<p><a name="st_191"><a name="51019-24_spnew2"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 I do not want to dwell on that at great length, although I was a member of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry when it undertook an inquiry into fuel poverty and highlighted excess winter deaths in this country. They derived from a combination of factors, including the relative cost of fuel as a proportion of the income of people on very low incomes, and building regulations and standards of insulation. That is one reason, apart from many others, why I will join warm homes week in my constituency in November to encourage the fight for such insulation. Those are the things that we should be doing in the weeks ahead.

<a name="stpa_240">In Cambridgeshire&#151;I am sorry; I will stop talking about my constituency after this&#151;the big freeze on the M11, which some of my hon. Friends were caught up in, illustrated how severe weather can rapidly lead to a deterioration of services. If that freeze had continued for only 12&nbsp;more hours, it would have interrupted just-in-time deliveries of supplies to clinics, pharmacies and the like. We need to be aware of the way in which severe weather could have an adverse impact very quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_241">The principles of preparedness for a range of emergencies often have much in common: prevention, when possible; preparation; effective co-ordination and chains of command; proactive communication with professionals and the public; and a continuous, active engagement with the possible risks and solutions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_242">Clearly, terrorist attacks are a major threat that we continue to face. In recent times, as distinct from Northern Ireland-related terrorism, the threat became real in this country on 7&nbsp;and 21&nbsp;July. On 7&nbsp;July, we were deeply thankful for the work of the emergency services, Transport for London and all those involved. After 21&nbsp;July, many of us heaved a sigh of relief as the House rose in the wake of a failed bombing attempt. The summer may have allowed people to let the threat of terrorism slip from the forefront of their minds. We should not let that happen. The newspapers tell us that, as recently as two weeks ago, a group was prevented from carrying out another series of attacks, probably suicide attacks, in this country. A cool look at what we have done between July and now is needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_243">First, there is no doubt that a huge effort has been put into devising legislation that might prevent, should deter and will punish terrorists. However, we must ask ourselves how much laws can achieve against a form of terrorism whereby our enemies care nothing for their lives. Indeed, the loss of their lives is their aim. While legislation might protect us against conventional terrorism&#151;if one can describe terrorism in those terms&#151;can it do the same for the new kind of radicalism? We need concrete measures to protect our citizens and make it much more difficult for terrorists to operate in our midst.

We need a well formulated and articulated campaign of public information about the flu pandemic and we need precisely the same for terrorism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Secretary and his Ministers stick to the mantra that we must be alert but not alarmed. The Minister talks about striking a balance between telling people enough and not

</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_246">Nearly 18&nbsp;months ago, the Government published a booklet telling us how to prepare for emergency. It partly dealt with terrorism but the message was muted and 1.5&nbsp;million households have yet to receive their copies. We can do better. There have been spasmodic poster campaigns on the underground and other parts of London transport and we are rightly told not to leave our baggage on the tube. However, do not we need to know what the threat is and how to deal with it? For example, why are not we told publicly what the national alert status is? Why do we need to depend on leaks from the BBC to tell us what the security services perceive as the danger level?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_247">If, as must be the case, an alert and vigilant population is among our best defences against terrorism, we must engage the public actively in that task, explaining what they need to do and why raising the alert status is not crying wolf, however often we do it. We must also explain the sheer scale of information and intelligence that needs to be pursued if we are to be more likely to intervene successfully against future attacks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_248">We need a concerted campaign of public information because we know that knowledge dispels fear. To back that up, we must start basic public training. I do not mean that we should all practise running to the air raid shelter and donning our gas masks, but we need basic pointers about what we should do. If the Government need some guidelines on that, they need only examine how the people of Northern Ireland were taught to recognise the sort of vehicles that terrorists might use as bombs. Indeed, I recommend that the Government look closely at the way in which we handled similar threats over 30&nbsp;years in Northern Ireland. New Labour has a habit of ignoring the lessons of history but lessons learned in Ulster could save lives in Britain today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_249">Beyond that, we need a single point of contact and a single Minister who has the authority to control and co-ordinate all the different elements of preparedness. I understand and appreciate the co-ordination necessary for the many agencies that are required. It depends on many different chains of command being effectively linked together. However, the essence of what is required is early action, constant examination of plans and leadership to ensure that the responses to risk are swift and effective. That is often achieved in respect of each of those chains of command by someone with authority from outside looking creatively and constructively&#151;sometimes destructively&#151;at their plans to see how genuinely robust they are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_250">Ministers are responsible for the effectiveness of our emergency preparations, and it is to Ministers that civil servants and Government Departments respond. In circumstances in which Ministers determine priorities in their Departments, we cannot look to the civil contingencies secretariat to carry the burden of securing the necessary priority and action across government. The most effective way of securing the necessary priority is a Minister for homeland security with sufficient seniority to have the single-minded focus to achieve it. On Monday, for instance, during the urgent question on avian flu, it was instructive that, when the Secretary of State for Health was asked what poultry farmers should

<a name="stpa_251">How many different agencies were involved in the response to the events of 7&nbsp;July? The emergency services did a magnificent job, but we need to be sure that the co-ordination worked, and continues to work, and that it offers the greatest effectiveness.

 The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that many of the subjects that he mentioned relate to devolved issues. Is it the position of the Conservative Opposition here that Scottish Executive Ministers should be directly answerable to a UK Government Minister on this question?
</p>








<p><a name="st_193"><a name="51019-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 Not all the issues are devolved. The functions involved in a response to avian flu are clearly not devolved and the Scottish Executive will be directly responsive to a UK-wide plan in those circumstances. The way in which the hon. Gentleman asks the question slightly begs a question. Scottish Ministers should not necessarily be answerable, but they should be accountable for adherence to one single plan. It is difficult to achieve the necessary co-ordination within the UK in the absence of that kind of responsiveness and responsibility.

 I am following with interest the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument for a Minister for homeland security. I presume that his proposal is for a Minister of Cabinet rank.

<p><a name="st_197"><a name="51019-25_spnew5"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 My proposal is for a senior Minister, but not necessarily one of Cabinet rank. He could indeed have their own Department within the Cabinet Office. As someone who has worked in the Cabinet Office, I am familiar with the way in which it can support a Minister in that way. The Minister would have to be someone with sufficient authority&#151;in this case, that authority would be derived from the Prime Minister&#151;to implement the necessary co-ordination and linkages across the services that were required.

What risks for failures of communication were disclosed by those events? Why is breathing apparatus not compatible between the emergency services? Why were there not enough stretchers pre-positioned at King&#039;s Cross, which is a prime terrorist target? We have to look at such issues. The present combination of natural

However, I want now to take this opportunity to deal with the specific threat of an avian flu pandemic. I shall not speak about seasonal flu, although the EU Health Commissioner, Mr. Kyprianou, might have unhelpfully confused the public last week into believing that the seasonal flu jab offered some protection against a future flu pandemic. There are good reasons, of course, for at-risk groups to get their seasonal flu jabs, and I wrote to the Secretary of State for Health on 5&nbsp;October about delays in the availability of vaccines. I am afraid that she has not replied. It was denied on Monday that there were any such problems, so I should be grateful if the Minister would procure a reply for me on the matter, and perhaps even respond today.


</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_254">The issue concerns an emergency: lack of preparedness for an avian flu pandemic. The House will be aware of the scale of the threat. On Sunday, the chief medical officer referred to the planning assumption of 50,000&nbsp;excess deaths, based on an infection rate of one quarter of the population, assuming a mortality rate of 0.37&nbsp;per cent. A range of mortality rates up to 2.5&nbsp;per cent. have been considered. We simply do not know what the virulence of a flu virus that is readily transmissible between humans will be. The worst case scenario implies as many deaths in the 15&nbsp;weeks of the first wave of a pandemic as would normally occur over a whole year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_255">We know that the H5N1&nbsp;strain present in bird populations is highly virulent, with 117&nbsp;cases contracted by humans who were in intimate contact with birds, of whom 60&nbsp;died. We have no evidence of sustained transmission between humans. A genetic mutation leading to human transmission can be expected substantially to reduce the virus&#039;s virulence and the mortality rate among humans affected. We must assume, however, that we are dealing with a dangerous virus, in respect of which we have virtually no natural immunity in the population. We do not know when a virus capable of human-to-human transmission will occur, and given the increasing prevalence among large bird populations in south-east Asia, it must be far more likely that such a mutation will occur there, and the time at which it will occur must be approaching. As the World Health Organisation says, the question is not if, but when.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_256">I do not now doubt the Government&#039;s awareness of the threat. The publication today of an updated contingency plan by the chief medical officer shows that the key issues are identified. Let me be clear, however: the threat has been evident for a long time. In June 2004, I pressed the Government to produce a contingency plan and prepare a stockpile of antiviral drugs. The French Government, for example, published their plan and procured 13&nbsp;million courses of Tamiflu on 13&nbsp;October last year. For a long time, Ministers were complacent. The multi-phase contingency plan was published shortly before the 1997&nbsp;election&#151;I emphasise that because the Secretary of State said that the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 913</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government had published a plan in 1997, but it was the Conservative Government who did so&#151;and it was not updated until March this year. Then, an order was placed for antivirals. The stockpile will not be complete until September 2006. On Monday, I called for an advance purchase order for pandemic flu vaccine. Today, the Government responded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_257">I should not have to do this&#151;the Opposition should not have to come to the Dispatch Box to call for action by the Government and for such measures to be taken. It is all very well the chief medical officer saying, on about 14&nbsp;October, &quot;Not this year&quot;&#151;I am not here to criticise the CMO, as I think that he does a fantastic job and Ministers are responsible. The issue is that we cannot exclude the risk of pandemic flu next year and we are not yet ready.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_258">In comparison with previous pandemics, we could do very well: we have the best science in the world, an NHS that has shown itself able to respond to emergencies, and new antiviral and vaccine technologies. All those resources, however, must be brought into action well in advance if we are to obtain the full benefits. As we shall see, however, we do not have the antiviral stockpile that is necessary, nor the millions of face masks and gloves needed. Research into vaccines, and priming the vaccine manufacturing capability, has not happened. Contingency plans, including today&#039;s, do not show how the NHS would cope with the tripling of demand for critical care beds that would result. The public and NHS professionals are confused and uncertain about how we would cope. All those things must change.

<a name="stpa_259">The United Kingdom Government&#039;s plans may be better than those of many other countries. Indeed, many countries have no plans. They have been slow off the mark, however, and the delivery of key elements has not even begun in some cases.

<a name="51019-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_260">I am grateful for the presence of the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw). I want to say three things about avian flu in the bird population. First, we think it is time to warn free-range poultry keepers of the restrictions that may be placed on them, although not necessarily now, if there is evidence of high pathogenic avian influenza entering the United Kingdom in migratory birds. They need to know the plans for containment and how they can be helped to prepare for it now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_261">Secondly, poultry workers and those involved with game birds need information about what to look for and the personal protection measures for which they may be responsible in due course. Thirdly, there is the need to monitor wild birds. The Government and, indeed, scientists are not yet clear about the manner in which avian influenza is being transmitted among bird populations as a result of migration. It is all the more important in the game-shooting season for game birds to be sampled to establish whether the virus is present, and in what part of the wild bird population it occurs.

<br>&nbsp;<br>evidence from modelling in both this country and the United States suggested that the use of antiviral drugs and other public health measures where an outbreak of pandemic flu first occurred&#151;in south-east Asia, for instance&#151;could achieve significant progress in containing the outbreak at the outset, and could give everyone, worldwide, a breathing space in which to complete preparations for, say, a vaccine. Can the Minister tell us what specific measures our Government have taken to ensure that some of our resources and those of other countries in the developed world can be used to support an aggressive containment strategy?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_263">We know that we do not yet have a stockpile of antiviral drugs, but we should ask how such a stockpile would be used. The pandemic flu contingency plan tells us that the stockpile should be the size recommended for treating the infected population&#151;roughly enough for a quarter of the UK population to be treated. On page 150, the plan states


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;It should be emphasised that those national stockpiles provide no allowance for prophylaxis to protect key workers or maintain business continuity.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_264">Earlier parts of the plan, however, make it clear that part of the intention is to use antiviral drugs for prophylaxis for health care workers in the initial stages of an outbreak, and post-exposure prophylaxis for people in confined communities such as nursing homes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_265">A good question, to which we increasingly need an answer, if there is one, is whether post-exposure prophylaxis&#151;not for the whole population, as that would not be cost-effective, but in the event of initial outbreaks in populations, and perhaps in families when one family member has contracted the disease&#151;can be used to constrain the spread of the disease and reduce the severity of symptoms. Is there a viable strategy for such a preventive measure to be employed? There may well be, but at the moment the stockpile being procured on the UK&#039;s behalf makes no such provision. The plan and the stockpile are not matching up. The Government should have procured a stockpile for treatment purposes. Moreover, by this stage they should have considered the need for prophylaxis and placed orders beyond September 2006, so that they could not only replenish the stockpile when necessary, but add to it for prophylaxis purposes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_266">There is also a limited risk of resistance developing to Tamiflu, which is the antiviral stockpile of first choice. I ask again the question that I asked on Monday but which the Secretary of State did not answer: have the Government considered making, or do they intend to make, Relenza available as a second-line antiviral drug?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para15">
<a name="stpa_267">On vaccines and their preparation, the Government say that they are going to buy 2&nbsp;million doses of the H5N1&nbsp;vaccine, which is a generic vaccine for treating avian flu itself, not the virus that might develop in humans subsequently. What exactly is its intended use? According to the plan, it will be piloted to see whether it is effective in treating those who are, or might be, in direct contact with avian flu, and also in treating health care workers. Is 2&nbsp;million doses the right number, therefore? If the vaccine is likely to be effective in treating health care workers, does it not follow that it is likely to have some effect on the wider population? What assessment is being made of such effectiveness? The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation discussed whether an H5N1&nbsp;vaccine should be

<br>&nbsp;<br>developed for the whole population in order to prime its immunity against an avian flu strain that transfers to the human population, but which retains characteristics closely linked to the original virus. The French Government intend to do exactly that, and we need to know whether our Government are working on such a plan.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para16">
<a name="stpa_268">On face masks and gloves, the Australians have purchased 50&nbsp;million face masks and a similar number of syringes, needles and so on. They placed the order in May, and they anticipate that they will be available in December. The French are contemplating ordering 200&nbsp;million face masks for use by health care and social care workers. Let us get this in perspective. On the outbreak of pandemic flu in this country, within the space of just weeks we would need that number of face masks for our health care, social care and emergency service workers alone. In the course of a typical year, the NHS routinely purchases some 31&nbsp;million face masks, so there is an enormous difference between what we will require and what we currently have. No order has been placed, no tender has been made, no action taken on the part of the Government. This is a simple, straightforward measure that should arise from any contingency plan, but it is not being adopted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para17">
<a name="stpa_269">The Government have today placed the order for vaccines that I called for on Monday, but as the Minister will know, according to the pandemic flu plan published today, there are other issues with which to deal. Curiously, those issues are framed as questions. The appendix on vaccine policy points out that there are constraints on vaccine production, such as the availability of suitable hen&#039;s eggs. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;Contracts could be put in place to secure year-round supplies of eggs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para18">
<a name="stpa_270">Have they been put in place? Should they be put in place? Will they be put in place, and if so, when?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para19">
<a name="stpa_271">The appendix also points out that research into adjuvanted vaccines could be undertaken. That is interesting, given that last Monday, <i>The Times</i> reported that exactly such research into adjuvants to an H5N1&nbsp;vaccine had been proposed by a combination of researchers, including researchers from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control. They produced the proposal in the spring, but they have received no response. We need to know exactly what the Government are doing about that research. The Chancellor apparently plans to spend &#163;2&nbsp;million, but on what we do not know. We need to know whether it amounts to a response to that sort of research proposal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para20">
<a name="stpa_272">Let us remember the importance of manufacturing capability. The public are being told that the Department of Health has purchased 120&nbsp;million doses of vaccine for when pandemic flu occurs. It is not like that at all, though I am not blaming the Department: some press reports seem to suggest it, but that is not what is going on. What is really going on is an advance purchase order for 120&nbsp;million doses, once we have been able to develop a vaccine, but significant manufacturing constraints have to be overcome before that can happen. The Government need to take certain measures.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para21">
<a name="stpa_273">To put it in perspective, 300&nbsp;million doses of flu vaccine are produced worldwide each winter for seasonal flu, yet one country, the UK, would need 120&nbsp;million doses to deal with pandemic flu. Just imagine the scale of the increase in production capability that would be required. Back in April, the influenza sub-group of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said that, ideally, we should have an additional vaccine production facility in the UK. We are clearly not in such an ideal position, so we need to understand how the Government will minimise the constraints on manufacturing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para22">
<a name="stpa_274">Critical care beds are another important issue. Professor Menon of Addenbrooke&#039;s hospital set out clearly in an article in <i>Anaesthesia</i> that the draft contingency plan published in March did not deal with the problem. He found that the requirements for critical care capacity in respect of beds and staff to support them would be so dramatic that they would literally overwhelm the NHS, which would be


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;unable to cope with the increased demand provided by an influenza pandemic.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para23">
<a name="stpa_275">That shows how important it is to manage demands on the NHS effectively. Professor Menon saw contingency planning as essential, but the contingency plan published today does not set out the necessary response. The NHS is told to respond in many respects, but at the local level, the NHS has proved unable to do the work or agree on what responses are necessary. In some cases, it is unable to put in place the resources for an effective response.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para24">
<a name="stpa_276">On communications with the public, the House should reflect on the communications plans set out in the back of the contingency plan published today. It states that there is virtually no recall of the launch of the Government&#039;s pandemic flu contingency plan among the general population. It also states that unless health professionals are directly involved in the planning for pandemic flu, they are likely to have only mixed awareness of its potential impact, of antiviral treatment and of the current contingency plan. An article in <i>The Observer</i> on Sunday pointed out that 77&nbsp;per cent. of doctors did not know what the response to an avian flu pandemic would be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para25">
<a name="stpa_277">I am sorry to have to take the House through all those details, but there are a range of deficiencies in our current preparedness. If action is taken now, major strides can be achieved in the coming months. This time next year, we will be better prepared for a flu pandemic, but if a contingency plan had been published a year ago, as it was in France, we would be better prepared now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-25_para26">
<a name="stpa_278">Today, the Minister has an opportunity to clarify whether the Government will take the actions that we have called for. This week, we secured action from the Government on advance purchases of vaccines, but much more remains to be done. I commit the Opposition to work proactively and constructively to secure the best possible preparedness against pandemic flu. In pursuit of that objective and on behalf of all those we represent, I urge the House to support the motion this evening.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;pays grateful tribute to the excellent work of the emergency services, of Transport for London and of all involved in responding to the terrorist outrages of 7th July and 21st July; congratulates the Government on its comprehensive approach to preparedness for emergencies; notes the effectiveness of current Departmental responsibilities for emergency preparedness; further congratulates the Government on the steps taken to enhance communication with the public in respect of major threats; notes that supplies of vaccines, antibiotics, antidotes and specialist equipment are strategically placed around the UK for rapid deployment in the event of a mass casualty incident, and that spending on the stockpile to date exceeds &#163;120 million; further notes that NHS organisations have well-established, comprehensive plans in place for dealing with pandemic influenza, and that the Government&#039;s updated pandemic flu contingency plan is being published today; welcomes the fact that the Government is stockpiling key drugs and equipment, and will have enough antiviral drugs to treat 25 per cent. of the population by September 2006; and recognises that good communication with the public and with health professionals is crucial before and during a pandemic and therefore congratulates the Government on making accurate and up to date information widely available to doctors and the public through various agencies.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_279">Let me start by completely endorsing the first statement in the Opposition motion, which is also reflected in our amendment. We all share a deep appreciation of the response of the emergency services&#151;and, as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) mentioned, Transport for London&#151;to the terrorist outrages in July. In last week&#039;s debate on the emergency services, hon. Members from both sides of the House praised those who work on the front line, and I am sure that that will happen again today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_280">I am also sure that we would all agree that the tragic events in July underlined how important it is for the Government to prepare for major incidents, whether intentional or accidental, caused by conventional, chemical or biological material, or as a result of a natural disaster. That is why the Government have put in place a programme across all Departments to cover all parts of the United Kingdom. That is the capabilities programme, as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire said, and it identifies the action that each Department would need to take in the event of a major incident to ensure resilience across the UK. For example, my Department leads on ensuring that essential services for health care, such as pharmaceutical dressings, would be available in the event of a major incident. Each Department has such plans in place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_281">At central Government level, we identify future risks. The civil contingency secretary to the Cabinet Office considers the potential impact on the UK of any risks. The Civil Contingencies Act 2004, and the accompanying non-legislative framework, set out the arrangements and responsibilities at local, regional and national level for preparation for, and response to, emergencies. Regular major incident exercise and training programmes are undertaken across all agencies, involving international partners if appropriate. Those exercises enable us to test out the plans and familiarise staff with their roles in the event of an incident, and to update and improve the plans if necessary. We also learn the lessons of tragic events, such as those in July, and

<p><a name="st_199"><a name="51019-26_spnew0"><b> Mary Creagh  (Wakefield) (Lab):</b> 
 Has my hon. Friend had a chance to learn the lessons from hurricane Katrina? It seems to me that our Government could learn several lessons from that event, not least the advisability of putting hospital emergency generators underground&#151;because they were flooded in that incident. There were also clear weaknesses in evacuation plans and half of the civil service has been laid off, because of the inability to pay public sector workers. Does my hon. Friend also agree that the American experience demonstrates that having a Minister for homeland security is no guarantee of an effective response?
</p>








<p><a name="st_200"><a name="51019-26_spnew1"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 We are considering the lessons that can be learned from hurricane Katrina and the recent earthquake. The former demonstrated the need for proper co-ordination at all levels, which sadly appeared to be lacking in that instance. We are confident that the processes that we have set in place ensure that such co-ordination is possible, at local, regional and national level, as well as between Departments.
</p>








<p><a name="st_201"><a name="51019-26_spnew2"><b> Jonathan Shaw: </b> 
 An example of emergency services working together on the ground occurred at Boscastle, although it was a considerably smaller incident than those mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh). It was a natural occurrence that saw examples of great co-ordination, even though we did not have a Minister for homeland security. What is essential is good communication between Government and confident, well-resourced local agencies.
</p>








<p><a name="st_202"><a name="51019-26_spnew3"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right; the issue is about co-ordination between agencies and, as he says, ensuring that we consider what happened in each case. My right hon.

 I agree with the hon. Lady that the American political system is different from ours and the federal system does not easily translate, so not everything is applicable. What is of enormous interest, however, is the American investment in the Centre for Communicable Disease Control in Atlanta, which deals not only with epidemic and pandemic science but with animal and human infections and, indeed, zoonoses. Has the Department considered that? Could it give us some pointers to link the efforts of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department of Health to deal with communicable diseases?

 I shall be coming to some of the work that we are doing internationally, especially on pandemic flu, but there is of course a read-across in terms of relationships with other research bodies. I draw the hon. Gentleman&#039;s attention to the Health Protection Agency, which does excellent work in that field.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_283">I want to examine the work that we are doing internationally, nationally and locally on pandemic influenza. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire began his contribution with questions about some of the action that DEFRA was taking. I am sure that he is aware that DEFRA published a contingency plan in July, which addresses issues such as forewarning poultry farmers about the action that they need to take. Surveillance is already under way both in the UK and across Europe, and I can assure him that DEFRA is taking all necessary action. We have close co-ordination with the Department on the issues that he raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_284">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health told the House on Monday, we take seriously the issue of an influenza pandemic. As has been said, up to 25&nbsp;per cent. of the population could be affected and we have to plan for at least 50,000&nbsp;deaths, but it is important to stress that so far avian flu has not mutated to a form that can be transmitted from human to human.
</p>








<p><a name="st_205"><a name="51019-26_spnew6"><b> Mr. Graham Stuart  (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):</b> 
 We are all equally grateful that mutation has not taken place, but from previous pandemic experiences we know of the speed with which viruses can travel across the world and the likelihood of that can only increase. Why did it take until March 2005&nbsp;to produce the plan that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) raised with the Minister in October 2004, when there is a limitation on resources to access vaccines and antivirals?
</p>








<p><a name="st_206"><a name="51019-26_spnew7"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I remind the hon. Gentleman that a plan was in place; it was introduced in 1997&nbsp;and we hold regular meetings to look into its implementation. In addition, the hon. Gentleman should be aware that we have been implementing parts of the plan and were able to learn certain lessons when we updated it in March and July. Our preparations for pandemic influenza are among the best in the world. The World Health Organisation has recently said that we are one of the leading countries in the world in terms of our plans and preparations.

<p><a name="st_207"><a name="51019-26_spnew8"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) for asking that question, to which he has not received a good answer. The multi-phase contingency plan, published in 1997, did not refer to the preparation of an antiviral stockpile because antivirals were not available in that form with that proven effectiveness at that time. Yes, we are ahead of many other countries, but the French, Belgians, Dutch, Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians and Americans, to a limited extent, and Germans were negotiating to purchase an antiviral stockpile before the point at which the British Government entered into a contract to purchase a

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, we have been planning the purchase of antivirals and considering vaccine immunisation. I will come to that later in my contribution, by the end of which I hope to have illustrated and reassured the hon. Gentleman that the plans that we have in place are adequate, that they are kept under constant review and that, as I have said, they are considered to be among some of the best in the world.

<a name="51019-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_285">We work with international partners, including the European Union and the World Health Organisation, to enhance global preparedness for an influenza pandemic and to support vaccine development. We have been at the forefront of international work on mathematical modelling and surveillance. We jointly chair the flu pandemic preparedness strand of work of the global health security action group of G7 countries. Earlier this year, we hosted an international mathematical modelling conference, which was the first of its kind on pandemic flu.

 I hope that the debate will provide an opportunity for us to ensure that we explain the situation. Of course, the chief medical officer has taken action today to update the plan and to issue communications to the public and the health service about our preparedness in the UK. Let me stress again that we were one of the first countries to publish a pandemic contingency plan. The plan, which was updated in March, is being reissued today by the chief medical officer, as I have said. It provides the overall framework for an integrated UK-wide response, and it sets out what action we should, and can, take before a pandemic strikes and what we need to do when it arrives. Obviously, the plan examines how we can reduce the health consequences of a pandemic as much as possible. It also analyses the disruption that a pandemic could cause to essential services and people&#039;s daily lives. As we have said, measures such as antiviral 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 That will include public information, too. It is important for all of us with responsibility for the matter to ensure that we get the message right so that the public understand the necessary action that must be taken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_288">The updated copy of the plan, which is based on new mathematical modelling, shows that a pandemic could be over more quickly than we thought, but could affect more people at its peak than was thought. It shows that the same overall number of people would be affected as was thought, albeit in a shorter time. That obviously means that the NHS must examine its local plans. The plan has also been updated to reflect our antiviral strategy. For example, there is consideration of the use of walk-in centres and pharmacists for the distribution of antivirals.

<a name="51019-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_289">I thought that the hon.

However, they are an extremely important aspect of the work that must be done, especially on research and development, which is key to the effective preparedness for pandemic flu. The Medical Research Council&#151; the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) also asked about this matter&#151;is actively involved in our preparations and its chief executive is going to south-east Asia shortly to determine what further research the council can do.

<br>&nbsp;<br>avian flu and seasonal flu absolutely clear. We need to indicate what we currently have a vaccine for and what we must develop a vaccine for in the future. For example, we need to make it absolutely clear that it is important for people to get their seasonal flu vaccinations. We need to emphasise that even more than ever. However, we have to ensure that people understand that that is not a vaccine against what avian flu might become if it mutates into a pandemic influenza. We want to reassure people that we are doing all we can to develop a vaccine if the virus mutates into a form that can be transmitted from human to human. In addition, we need to make it clear that there is no conclusive evidence that the H5N1 strain of bird flu, even though it can be passed to human beings, can be passed between them. Those are the sorts of messages that we need to get across. We also need to communicate our messages to the NHS, but we have been very effective in doing so as part of our contingency plans.

We estimate that, once the strain has been identified, it will take between four and six months to start production. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire asked when that will happen. The chief medical officer announced today that a request for tenders will be placed tomorrow for that advance purchase of vaccine. As I said, we are one of the first countries to do that: I understand that out of potentially 180&nbsp;countries, only four other countries&#151;Australia, Italy, France and Canada&#151;have already placed so-called sleeping contracts in the past few months. We are therefore well ahead in terms of placing our contract.

 As I explained, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs contingency plan for avian flu was published in July and is regularly updated. It contains up-to-date biosecurity and health advice and can be found on the DEFRA website. Earlier this week, the National Farmers Union praised the action being taken by DEFRA to ensure that poultry farm workers are aware of what to look out for. I can assure him that DEFRA is working closely with the industry, which supports the Government&#039;s current assessment of the risk and the advice that is being given.

<a name="stpa_291">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire asked for details about the H5N1&nbsp;vaccine. We are going to stockpile 2&nbsp;million to 3&nbsp;million doses of the H5N1&nbsp;vaccine, and are about to place the order. We did not do so earlier, because we wanted to use the latest research to inform product development. A traditional vaccine for H5N1&nbsp;would not create a high enough immune response in people vaccinated with it, so we used the best and most recent research to ensure that we will get the best product. As the hon. Gentleman will know, H5N1&nbsp;vaccine protects against human transmission of the virus. At the moment, birds with avian flu can give it to humans but, as I have said, there is no conclusive evidence that it can be transferred from human to human. The French contract is not for H5N1&#151;it is exactly the same as our sleeping contract, and is for whatever vaccine is required to deal with a pandemic once we know the strain that has developed if, indeed, it does. We will use the H5N1&nbsp;vaccine for NHS workers only if appropriate&#151;it may well be the case that it is not suitable for what develops from the H5N1&nbsp;influenza.

<a name="stpa_292">This is a precautionary measure, but the JCVI said this afternoon that if the risk assessment of H5N1&nbsp;coming into our poultry flock rose we would add seasonal flu vaccine to the existing recommendation on Tamiflu treatment. If a poultry worker became ill we would treat them with Tamiflu, and we would give other people who were not ill but exposed to the virus prophylactic treatment with Tamiflu. Vaccination for seasonal flu would be given at the same time to stop anyone getting the seasonal flu virus. If they had that virus and the avian flu virus there would be a risk of recombination and an extremely dangerous human-to-human infection. We shall therefore use that combination of two treatments for affected poultry workers.

<p><a name="st_223"><a name="51019-28_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 If the risk assessment suggests that that is the right action it is a very good protective measure for poultry workers. Clearly, there will come a point&#151; I accept that it may not be now&#151;where the evidence suggests that there is a risk of a genetic shift so that the virus that is transmissible between humans bears a close relationship to the H5N1&nbsp;virus. In that case, the vaccine that has been developed using reverse genetic engineering may be effective. Presumably, that is when the Government would say that they would use the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>vaccine for NHS workers, for example. If that looks like it might be effective, is there not a prima facie case for population vaccination, rather than just NHS vaccination? I am asking that that be considered, and that we be informed as soon as possible if the evidence points in that direction. We need to know whether that is likely to happen. We would have to wait about five months for the minutes of the JCVI to find out what was discussed and agreed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_224"><a name="51019-28_spnew2"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 If it became obvious that the H5N1&nbsp;vaccine was appropriate for a mutation that had occurred and could be transmitted between humans, we would ensure that our sleeping contract delivered the vaccine for the whole population. At present, however, there is little point in our ordering 120&nbsp;million doses of a vaccine that we are not sure would work in those circumstances. We have ordered 2&nbsp;million to 3&nbsp;million doses so that we have that ready in case it works. That is precautionary. It would not be wise for us to order 120&nbsp;million doses at this stage without knowing whether it worked.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_293">We have set in train our ability to order as soon as we can. If we know the strain, we can order the vaccine that is needed. In advance of that, antiviral drugs are the most effective way of treating patients and reducing the impact of the pandemic. We spent almost &#163;200&nbsp;million to create a stockpile of 14.6&nbsp;million treatment courses of antivirals. That will be enough to treat the 25&nbsp;per cent. of the population who may become ill with pandemic flu. As the hon. Gentleman said, the stockpile will be complete by September 2006. We have 2.5&nbsp;million treatment courses available at present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_294">The hon. Gentleman asked about our strategy for antivirals. We would use antivirals for treatment of those who become ill with pandemic flu. As I said, they are not generally intended for prophylactic use. The stockpile is intended to be large enough to treat all those who become ill, based on the estimates that we have received from experts. The question who should receive priority ought not to arise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_295">Of course we are aware that there is a risk&#151;currently a very small risk, we believe&#151;that the pandemic might strike before the stockpile is complete. In those circumstance, we would prioritise the treatment of front-line health care workers and then those in at-risk groups. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we have not completely ruled out the use of antivirals for prophylaxis&#151;for example, we would keep under review the need to protect poultry workers where there is an outbreak of avian flu among birds, or to protect the close contacts of someone arriving in this country with symptoms of avian flu.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_296">Comparisons have sometimes been made with France&#039;s Tamiflu order. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is exactly the same as ours. It will not be complete until the end of the year. It has been ordered in powdered form, which means that it then has to be turned into capsules, whereas we have taken the decision to order it in capsules so that it can be distributed quickly, as soon as it is needed. We have taken what we believe is the simplest course in that respect. Roche, the manufacturers of Tamiflu, announced on Tuesday that the United States Food and Drug Administration had granted approval for an additional manufacturing site

<p>
<a name="51019-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_297">It has been suggested that we should also be stockpiling the other antiviral drug that is available, Relenza, but the issue is not quite as straightforward as it might seem. Relenza is given by inhalation and is licensed only for those aged 13&nbsp;and over. It also needs to be used with great caution by people with asthma, and there is also some evidence that elderly people might find an inhaler difficult to use. However, we will continue to review our policy if new evidence emerges.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_298">The challenges facing the health and social care system would undoubtedly be on an unprecedented scale and would be felt across all sectors. The hon. Gentleman asked about critical care capacity, and we are very much aware of the paper prepared by Professor Menon and have set up a group chaired by the deputy chief medical officer to look at the very issues that he raised. We have invited David Menon and other experts on to the group and we will keep that issue under constant review.

 I should be grateful if the Minister could clear up one matter that has caused some confusion.

It would seem sensible to make provision for prophylaxis for NHS workers if for no other reason than to give them confidence, because I suspect that sickness absence might be significant in the event of an outbreak.

<a name="stpa_305">I, too, want predominantly to focus on preparation for a flu pandemic, but I want briefly to comment on whether the best way to respond to emergencies is to have a dedicated Minister for homeland security. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 927</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>This afternoon&#039;s debate has helped to clarify the Conservative proposal. I entered the debate with an open mind, which I try not to do very often, but the Conservative proposal is paradoxical, because the Minister is supposed to be a senior Minister, but not necessarily a Cabinet Minister. The Secretary of State for Health is currently taking the lead and working with other Departments on avian flu. The proposal is to appoint a Minister junior to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is not a household name: I had to ask my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) who holds that post. It seems implausible that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&#039;s junior will have enough clout in government to make things happen. Because of the rest of the text, I encourage my hon. Friends to support the Conservative motion, but I want to register the point that we are not convinced by that proposal.
</p>








<p><a name="st_232"><a name="51019-29_spnew3"><b> Adam Afriyie: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that having a single Minister of whatever rank who is responsible for homeland security, which is one of the key issues that we all face, is sensible and reasonable in principle?
</p>








<p><a name="st_233"><a name="51019-29_spnew4"><b> Steve Webb: </b> 
 I certainly think that having a Minister with overarching responsibility for these matters is a good thing. The Home Secretary is already that person in relation to preparation for a terrorist emergency. I would be surprised if the Conservatives wanted to create more Ministers and extra bureaucracy and duplication. The debate is a funny mixture&#151;it is almost as if there were two very different things that they wanted to talk about and which they lumped together. The Minister with the expertise to respond to a pandemic would be a very different person from the person who has to prepare the country for a terrorist attack. Using the same debate to cover two different areas does not help.

<a name="51019-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_306">We have discussed how far in advance the Government were alerted to these issues. I place on record my tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome, who had the foresight to raise them in the House in March 2003&nbsp;in a debate called, &quot;Viral Pandemics&quot;. As long as two and a half years ago, he challenged the Government on their state of preparedness for them. The then Health Minister, the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy), said:

 We have been throwing brickbats at the Government&#151;some of which are perhaps deserved&#151;but I wonder how good we, as a Parliament, are at dealing with civil contingencies. The answer is that we are very bad at it. We have Select Committees that inquire into their own Departments, but that misses the point.

Is our Select Committee system remotely fit to monitor that range of inter-departmentalism? No, it is not.

We sought to break away&#151;I should not say &quot;we&quot;, because I am no longer a member of the Defence Committee&#151;from that very limited approach to the role of the Select Committee. There are other mechanisms that can be used. We have the Liaison Committee, and there was a Joint Committee on the Bill that became the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.

An expurgated version of what one Minister is alleged to have said to us is, &quot;What the devil is the Defence Committee doing walking all over my Department?&quot; That was a classic example of stove-piping. Yet the result was the best report that the Defence Committee has ever produced, because we considered the issue across a broad base. I suggest that we, as parliamentarians, start to put pressure on our colleagues to consider an alternative model for the way in which we and those up the Corridor&#151;like it or not, the House of Lords is also part of the parliamentary process&#151;scrutinise the decision-making process, so that we can do it more effectively.

The then Home Secretary was not ecstatic about our proposals, because he thought that we were attacking him, which we were not. We did not want a director of homeland security&#151;a Tom Ridge-type character&#151;and events have shown that the American model is not very appropriate for the United States, let alone the United Kingdom. Any Home Secretary is overburdened with a range of activities, one of which is contingency planning and counter-terrorism. The Defence Committee proposed that there should be a very senior Minister because, as has been pointed out forcefully, someone who operates in Cabinet as an observer at Minister of State level in the hierarchy will just be used as an office boy. Therefore, it would be a good idea to have someone devoted to cutting across this whole range of activity as it is more than a full-time job. That idea is not getting very far, however.

<a name="stpa_334">I am not totally convinced about the lead Department concept, for a number of reasons. One might be a very good permanent secretary and able to operate one&#039;s Department pretty well in the normal crises that might unfold in the course of a working day, week, month or year. But we are now talking about leading the Department&#039;s response to a humdinger of a massive terrorist attack&#151;not one or two on the Richter scale but 10&#151;that has gone through the military and intelligence system just like the first attack in July this year. One wonders whether all Departments have done what the Ministry of Defence has done, which is to train a core of people who will head that response on behalf of the Ministry of Defence&#151;professionals who are trained and have the psychological make-up to deal with such a crisis, who have attended relevant courses and spent a great deal of time eliciting information. I hope that all Departments are prepared to do that. Criticism of the permanent secretary by me and Members of Parliament is not something that Departments like, but the idea should be considered.

<a name="51019-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_335">It is not a failure of this Government that causes me anxiety but of government in general: has anybody seen an organisational chart of central Government Departments, regional and local government, the health service, the intelligence services and the private sector, showing who is involved in the process of trying to pick up the pieces should there be an attack? In my experience, it is sometimes difficult for the Ministry of Defence to talk to the Ministry of Defence. What we have here is almost the entire spectrum of Government, and government in society, all of it heaped together in a labyrinth of decision making and input. Have we reached the point at which we can say that each component is trained for the task and prepared to respond? Is there the necessary glue and are there the necessary mechanisms for co-ordination? Is the decision-making process adequate?

<a name="stpa_336">We can learn much from our own exercises, our own mistakes and other people&#039;s mistakes, of which there are many. I understand why a small country, or a poor country such as Pakistan, cannot respond effectively. It is more reprehensible for the largest country in the world to fail so miserably. Why has that happened? The reason may be cronyism. Perhaps those who reached the top positions were appointed for their party political loyalties rather than their expertise. Perhaps the federal system, deliberately constructed more than 200&nbsp;years ago, is to blame. The country should have stuck with the United Kingdom if it wanted an example of centralised decision making. The process of fragmented decision making was created with the intention of rendering decision making almost impossible, and that is what has happened.

 The chief medical officer warned earlier this week that at least 50,000&nbsp;people can be expected to die in this country if the flu virus mutates into one that can be transferred from human to human. We thus face two distinct threats: that of avian flu and that of a pandemic flu outbreak. The threat from a mutated avian flu is serious and material to all of us and our families. At least

<a name="stpa_346">That is why it is so important that we and the wider British public are able to trust the authorities when they give guidance for public safety. Experts believe that the H5N1&nbsp;strain could be as devastating as the strain of flu that went round the world after the first world war, killing literally millions. Yet when I talk to constituents, I find little trust in the Government or their spokespeople, however eminent. It seems that the culture of spin, misinformation, untruths and gibberish, by which we have been governed in the last eight years, has done more than undermine the reputation of this Parliament and a once proud political party opposite.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_347">The fact that a Minister can mislead a Select Committee, but remain a welcome member of the new Labour project, undermines public trust. The fact that thousands of animals could be slaughtered and billions of pounds of public money spent on foot and mouth without a public inquiry undermines public trust. The fact that terrorist horror is seen as a good opportunity to bury bad news undermines public trust. The fact that intelligence reports prior to a war were doctored by a spin doctor undermines public trust. Those things have done more than bring shame on principled Labour Members and more than weaken our civil service&#039;s independence, for they undermine the whole relationship between the Government and the people.

Any hint of cover-up, any refusal to accept that mistakes may have been made, will increase the likelihood that vital advice will be ignored or distrusted. It would be a calamity if the words of the excellent chief medical officer were set aside because the public saw him in the same light as the Chancellor sees the Prime Minister&#151;as in the phrase, &quot;You can&#039;t believe a word he says&quot;.

At home, the Government must prepare and be open and transparent.

 Much has been written and said in the past week about pandemics and influenza, and some of the reporting has bordered on the alarmist. It is therefore appropriate that we should discuss the issues in a more measured way here&#151;and, incidentally, without making cheap political points.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_354">As the amendment states, our NHS organisations have well-established, comprehensive plans in place for dealing with pandemic influenza. The prime objectives in dealing with influenza pandemics are to save lives; to reduce the health impact of the pandemic; and to minimise the disruption to health and other services, while maintaining business continuity. Given that the vaccine may not be available to all in the first wave of the pandemic, clear and transparent policies are needed for prioritising vaccine use, as and when it becomes available. I wish to refer to one aspect of that prioritisation, in terms of building on the principles established for dealing with seasonal flu.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_355">The overall uptake of vaccination against seasonal flu has improved, and in recent years more than 70&nbsp;per cent. of those aged 65&nbsp;or over have been vaccinated. Variations occur by area, but the two primary care trusts serving my constituency achieved a 70&nbsp;per cent. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 937</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and a 72&nbsp;per cent. uptake, so we are on target. This year, the influenza immunisation programme has been extended to include two further groups: people with chronic liver disease and the main carers of elderly or disabled persons, whose welfare may be at risk if their carer falls ill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_356">I congratulate the Government on recognising the need to include carers. For some years now, carers&#039; organisations have campaigned for health measures such as free flu jabs to be targeted at carers. Many organisations have also employed primary care workers to work with GPs and primary health care teams to identify and support carers in their practice populations. Many of those primary care projects have been in existence for years and have had successful programmes prioritising flu jabs for carers. In places such as Leeds, Milton Keynes, Bristol and Salford, the primary care trust carers projects have ensured that all carers can be offered free flu vaccination by their GPs. The benefit of such work is that it not only protects the carer from flu, but supports their caring role by helping them to safeguard their health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_357">Although there are 5.2&nbsp;million carers, only some 20&nbsp;per cent. care at the heavier end of commitment of more than 50&nbsp;hours a week. In a GP practice population of 2,000, there are likely to be 200&nbsp;carers, only 40&nbsp;of whom will be caring at the heavier end. Put that way, the numbers of additional flu vaccinations look manageable for GPs and their staff. I therefore hope that the Government will consider the idea of extending flu vaccination not only to those who care for an elderly or disabled person, but to all heavily committed carers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_358">It is increasingly understood that caring has an impact on the carer&#039;s own health, so it is right to treat carers as a vulnerable and at-risk group. Increasingly, too, carers at the heavier end of commitment are seen as partners in providing health care. NHS employers are directed to offer influenza immunisation to employees directly involved in patient care, and that practice extends to staff in nursing and care homes. In cities such as Leeds, Milton Keynes, Bristol and Salford, primary care trusts have offered vaccination to all carers, so I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Health, can look into extending influenza immunisation to all groups of carers in subsequent winter seasons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_359">The principle implemented this year, of recognising carers as partners in health care who need to be protected by vaccination, is important. I hope that it will continue and be extended to all carers in future years, as well as providing a basis for their inclusion in the priorities for vaccination in the unlikely event of an influenza pandemic.

<a name="51019-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_363">One of the features that characterised the Government&#039;s response to both crises was recognition that the public required reassurance. Unfortunately, the reassurance the Government tried to provide was through communication rather than action. As my hon.

The only effective reassurance at times of crisis is tough action to resolve the problems, not a Minister appearing on television attempting to calm us down when the evidence on the streets is of a crisis spiralling out of control.

We have no real idea whether we have the extra bed capacity to deal with the scale of pandemic envisaged by the chief medical officer. We have no real explanation of the Government&#039;s delay in stockpiling vaccine.

He stated that the finger of blame should be pointed only at one group of people&#151;the terrorists responsible&#151;but he also asked whether we could have a proper commission of inquiry into the events of that day. When the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety comes to the Dispatch Box, I should be very interested if she would tell us what lessons have been learned, what systems have been put in place to enable those lessons to be made public, what inquiries have gone on, what we can know about the events of 7/7&nbsp;and what the Government are doing.

<p>
<a name="51019-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_367">The Government are very keen to trumpet the legislative changes that they wish to make to deal with the terrorist threat, but we also know that operational behaviour counts, and that is the Government&#039;s Achilles heel. Consider the scenes at Heathrow, when we knew that there was a real threat&#151;I do not doubt for a moment that there was one&#151;and tanks and other armoured vehicles were mobilised. What signal did that send? The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), acknowledges that that was a mistake. Why was that mistake allowed to happen on his watch? What lessons will the right hon. Lady tell us have been learned from that episode?

<a name="stpa_369">I have in mind the broader question of when lethal force should be used by agents of the state. I am no lily-livered liberal on this matter&#151;I recognise that lethal force was used to great effect in Northern Ireland, not least in Loughgall&#151;but we need sophisticated rules and good intelligence when it comes to the use of lethal force. Rules of engagement need to be debated in public. We had clear rules of engagement&#151;a red card and a yellow card system operated in Northern Ireland&#151;and when we were operating in very difficult conditions in Bosnia, we also had clearly laid-out rules of engagement that were influenced by moral and operational factors. We need to have that debate in public; we do not want such decisions to be left either to the Metropolitan police or to Ministers alone.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that it is absolutely astonishing that such a fundamental shift in Metropolitan police policy&#151;a lethal policy&#151;was not agreed by the Prime Minister but was left to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner himself?
</p>








<p><a name="st_246"><a name="51019-33_spnew2"><b> Michael Gove: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. We naturally recognise that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner has heavy responsibilities on his shoulders, but we need to recognise that lethal force may well be used in dealing with the terrorist threat and that its use must be subject to open debate in the House. The taking of life, even in the defence of innocents, is a momentous task to devolve on to any public servant, and we must ensure that we have proper debate about how such force is used.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_370">We need not only proper debate about the rules of engagement, but a proper recognition of the role that intelligence can play. It would be otiose for me to mention some of the issues on which intelligence services and their decisions have been questioned in the House over the past few years. Suffice it for me to say that both MI5&nbsp;and MI6&#151;the intelligence and counter-intelligence services&#151;are underfunded by the Government. Ever since the 1990s, not only has counter-subversion activity been wound down, but the co-ordination of the work of MI5&nbsp;and MI6&nbsp;has been less than effectively prosecuted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_371">We need to ensure not only that there is proper funding and staffing for counter-subversion, but that MI5&nbsp;and MI6&nbsp;talk to each other effectively. We must recognise that many subversive elements in this country will have received training and funding from abroad, often from regimes that the Government have unfortunately coddled or been insufficiently robust towards. We must be aware of those links when we debate not only funding, but the operational guidance that we give to our intelligence and security services.

<p>
<a name="51019-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_372">Ultimately, the best preparation for any emergency is action to avert it from taking place. The most effective action that we can take is to assure those who act in our name that they have the resources that they need, clear rules by which they operate and a guarantee that when their actions are scrutinised in the House and elsewhere, there will be no shuffling off of responsibility and no spin, but honesty, authority and grip.

<a name="stpa_374">I examined London&#039;s emergency preparedness when I was a member of another place&#151;the London assembly. The assembly conducted full scrutiny of the various organisations involved in dealing with London&#039;s security. I assure my right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George) that the 25&nbsp;elected members of the assembly had robust discussions about the matter, albeit inevitably in private, and that all the recommendations that we made were taken on board and came into full effect on 7&nbsp;July.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_375">Among the recommendations was the suggestion that the London Mayor should have a clear role in communicating with Londoners. He was heavily involved in the discussions and emergency preparedness for London. We recommended that communication with Londoners should be better&#151;several hon. Members have mentioned that point&#151;and that links with local government should be made clearer. We suggested that the gold command should include someone from local government because we realised that many needs in any emergency would be provided for by London&#039;s local government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_376">I hope that I can be forgiven for talking about my constituency for a moment. The Mayor recently launched the &quot;Spirit of London&quot; bus. It is a special bus in Hackney because it is usually used on the No. 30&nbsp;bus route. Of course many of us remember that it was the No. 30&nbsp;bus that was blown up on 7&nbsp;July. The No. 30&nbsp;bus goes to Hackney Wick. Two weeks later, the No. 26&nbsp;bus, which was on its way to Hackney Wick, had a bomb on it, too. One of the dead on the day was a student at Hackney community college, so Hackney sorely appreciates the importance of emergency preparedness in London. We all recognise that the emergency services did an excellent job that day and should be congratulated by us all. I am pleased that hon. Members have said that today, as do the motion and the amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_377">I put on record my personal congratulations to the local borough police command in Hackney and especially the borough commander, Simon Pountain. He and his team have done an excellent job developing community relations in Hackney and have been praised by the excellent inter-faith forum in Hackney. The forum brings together rabbis, imams and priests to work together on community relations and they universally respect Simon Pountain. His officers were busy building community relations after the bombs of 7&nbsp;July. They conducted bus searches on that day and have since been engaged continually in a highly visible policing strategy to reassure the citizens of Hackney, South and Shoreditch. I commend Hackney as a model for such work on community relations to my hon. Friend the Minister of State and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety.

<a name="51019-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_378">Despite today&#039;s erudite debate, I am not exactly sure how a homeland security Minister would have helped Hackney or London on 7&nbsp;July. The hon. Member for Northavon mentioned an article in one of today&#039;s papers that cited an expert who talked about how we deal with the weak, not the strong. I will not go into it, because time is short, but I think that how we deal with the elderly and with vulnerable disabled people is a clear issue in relation to a flu pandemic. The comments of my hon. Friend the Minister of State about a combination of the two viruses show how critical it is that flu jabs take

Friend the Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley) went into the details, so I do not need to do so. Again, however, I do not understand how a homeland security Minister would tackle such issues.
</p>








<p><a name="st_248"><a name="51019-33_spnew4"><b> Mr. Tobias Ellwood  (Bournemouth, East) (Con):</b> 
 The hon. Lady should compare how the London Mayor dealt with the events of 7&nbsp;July with what might happen if an event occurred that affected Britain as a whole. There is a direct comparison between what happened on 9/11, when one mayor took ownership of co-ordination, and the events after hurricane Katrina struck, when there was complete confusion because there was no focus for activities&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> There was a breakdown in communication, which would not happen on such a scale in the United Kingdom. I agree that America has a different system for emergencies, but does the hon. Lady agree that a homeland security Minister here could avoid such problems because our nation is far smaller?
</p>








<p><a name="st_249"><a name="51019-33_spnew5"><b> Meg Hillier: </b> 
 No, I do not agree&#151;in fact, the hon. Gentleman has caught himself out. We have an excellent Labour Mayor of London and an excellent Labour Prime Minister, and the latter would be the person responsible for taking a lead in any national event, as he did on 7&nbsp;July, together with other Ministers. The model that we have recently seen in action in America is not one that we should emulate.

<a name="stpa_379">I have no particular local perspective on avian flu. Not many people keep chickens in Hackney, South and Shoreditch&#151;although I recommend to the House Hoxton Manor honey, which is delicious and is made by bees who live in Hoxton&#151;but the debate has encouraged me to visit the local city farm.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_380">To end on a serious note, we should not be making party political jibes about emergency preparedness, which is a serious issue facing the country. I am heartened to know that the work of Ministers is thorough and good. We cannot say that a single overarching Minister&#151;certainly not one junior to the Cabinet&#151;would be the right person to co-ordinate the response to a range of events. We have the Secretary of State for Health taking the lead on avian flu, and the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister took the lead on 7&nbsp;July. We have horses for courses, and Labour has some excellent horses on those courses.

 I am delighted to begin by echoing the praise of our emergency services and of the many unsung heroes&#151;the people who continue to go to work in the face of disasters, natural and otherwise. Like the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier), I have first-hand experience of natural disasters in my capacity as a Member of the Welsh Assembly. In my experience, the devolved bodies did not make such a good job of responding as she implied the Greater London assembly did. In the past few years, we in Wales have faced two major problems: foot and mouth and severe localised flooding in the town of Monmouth.

<p><a name="st_252"><a name="51019-34_spnew2"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 If we have a Minister for homeland security, I am sure that he will go to see what the GLA is doing. I would like to show him what the Welsh Assembly managed to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_381">The response to foot and mouth was an absolute disaster&#151;that is the nicest thing that I could say about it. I saw at first hand the problems we had getting people in to deal with culling. In some areas, carcases piled up. There appeared to be no clear lines of accountability&#151;no one seemed to know who was in charge, even the people who were supposedly running the show. Monmouthshire is on the Welsh side of the border with England, so technically the Welsh Assembly was in overall charge, but an office of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Worcester was running things; yet on one occasion when we rang the Worcester office to talk to the people who were dealing with the problems, they did not seem to know what the Welsh Assembly was. That was totally unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_382">In the case of the flooding, nothing could have been done to prevent it, but every effort was made to alleviate the problems that people experienced. I give particular credit to the meals on wheels service operated by Monmouthshire county council, which risked life and limb to ensure that hot meals and drinks were delivered to people. We have no complaint about the way in which the situation was dealt with, but in the years since people have continued to face the problem of flooding because no one can cut through the thicket of bureaucratic regulations that have to be overcome to put in place a decent flood defence scheme. It is therefore important to make the case for a Minister for homeland security who can take overall charge of dealing with those problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_383">We now face threats more serious than flooding or foot and mouth in the form of terrorism and avian flu. No one could say that the Government have failed to be proactive in talking about terrorism, but sometimes they have talked it up to try to gain more draconian powers for themselves. I draw Members&#039; attention to a headline a few years ago that appeared in the <i>Daily Mail</i>. [Hon. Members: &quot;It must be true&quot;.] I rather think that it was not. On 23&nbsp;November, a report headed &quot;Target Canary Wharf&quot; said that a group of al-Qaeda terrorists was apparently planning to hijack planes and fly them straight into Canary wharf. The story came from intelligence sources, which had taken it upon themselves to talk to the <i>Daily Mail</i> just two days before the Queen&#039;s Speech, in which the Government were seeking extra powers for themselves, purportedly to combat terrorism. If there was any truth in that story why on earth were arrests not made and why did we never hear anything more about it? Why did the Government allow security sources to talk to the <i>Daily Mail</i> and if they did not give such authorisation, why did they not hunt them down in the same way that they hunted down David Kelly?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_384">In the minds of many, the story is an utter fabrication given to a right-wing tabloid just hours before the Queen&#039;s Speech announced all sorts of controversial

<br>&nbsp;<br>powers for the Government. That is why people do not have any confidence or trust in them when they talk about terrorism. They have told us what they are going to do about avian flu, yet we are well behind other countries. The Government say that they are going to reach their targets, but the target for vaccination courses in the United Kingdom is about 25&nbsp;per cent. as opposed to 30&nbsp;per cent. in France and the Netherlands and 50&nbsp;per cent. in Italy. The Minister could not answer my question about masks and gloves. The Australians have purchased those items from the UK so we can no longer purchase them ourselves. She said that the Government had to talk to the health and safety people. Presumably, the Australians, who belong to a health and safety-conscious nation, did so several months before the British could.

<a name="stpa_398">I have no doubt that the Minister will refer to OSIRIS II, the only exercise that has been conducted to make our tube any safer than it is at the moment. I also have no doubt that the group that intended to attack this country two weeks ago was Ansar al-Islam, and that it intended to attack the tube again. As an example of the paucity of planning across the country, our tube is no safer to travel on today than it was on 7&nbsp;July. I challenge the Minister to show me that I am wrong.

<a name="stpa_399">As I have said, the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), has been horribly complacent and self-congratulatory about the methods and measures

<br>&nbsp;<br>that have been implemented. I ask her to reflect on why the Secretary of State for Health referred that particular problem to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_400">We had our wake-up call in September 2001, so I was shocked by how shocked Ministers were in July this year. I ask the Ministers to ensure that we are much better prepared and much more resilient next time.

<p><a name="st_258"><a name="51019-35_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety  (Hazel Blears): </b> 
 The single point on which I agree with the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) is that we have had an excellent debate, although it has been a little bit awkward because we have tried to bring together two distinct issues. In my winding-up speech, I will endeavour to deal with some of the points concerning health, as well as some issues surrounding homeland security and terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_401">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) raised a range of issues, which the Minister dealt with in her measured and specific response. He asked whether we have learned lessons from our experience in Northern Ireland. We have learned lessons, but I am sure that he accepts that the nature of today&#039;s terrorist threat is significantly different from the terrorist threat in Northern Ireland, given that today&#039;s terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers and are unconcerned by the number of casualties that they inflict. Although we can learn lessons, we face a different terrorist threat today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_402">The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) discussed Tamiflu and asked whether we consider it effective. We have been careful about the claims that we have made for antivirals: Tamiflu will reduce the length and severity of illness and reduce complications, and we currently have no reason to believe that it would not be effective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_403">The hon. Gentleman raised the important issues of capacity and supply. We are already holding discussions with the manufacturer, Roche, and we have secured an agreement to use another factory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_404">The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of sub-licensing. Again, we are continuing active consideration and discussion with the company to make sure that we can expand capacity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_405">The hon. Gentleman asked whether the primary care trusts and strategic health authorities have implemented plans around the pandemic. The PCTs and SHAs have implemented such plans, and an ongoing checking process is making sure that the plans, which will be audited, are effective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_406">Several hon. Members asked whether we can help to contain any outbreak&#151;the hon. Member for Northavon said that we will be judged by not only the strong, but the weak. We have contributed &#163;600,000&nbsp;to support World Health Organisation surveillance in south-east Asia, and we have also contributed to the WHO stockpile. Furthermore, Roche has said that it will donate 3&nbsp;million doses of antivirals to the WHO, and we are ready to help internationally wherever we can.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_407">The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) raised several issues concerning poultry&#151; I confess to not being a poultry expert. Apparently, DEFRA runs not only its website, but an excellent helpline that provides advice for large-scale poultry farmers and people who keep a small number of chickens. If free range chickens must be taken indoors, a committee&#151;I think that it is in Brussels&#151;will consider maintaining their free range status in those circumstances, although we are not there yet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_408">On homeland security, I join all hon. Members in congratulating our emergency services on their magnificent response in the wake of 7&nbsp;July, and I know that many countries from across the world were equally impressed. The attack took place when the G8&nbsp;was meeting, and all the delegates at the G8&nbsp;meeting were hugely impressed by the response from all our emergency services&#151;the police, the health service, the fire service and local government. However, that was no accident&#151;it was the result of good planning, extensive exercise programmes, and people who knew what their role and responsibilities would be. The fact that they had trained together as agencies was key to the fact that it all worked on that day and worked again a couple of weeks later when we had the attempted bombings. It was an exemplary response. I am not at all complacent. There are still many lessons that we can learn from the incidents that happened not only in this country but right across the world, and we have excellent international relationships to ensure that that happens.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_409">The hon. Member for Newark asked what kinds of exercises we do. I genuinely accept that he wants to make a contribution in this subject, but he really ought to know that exercises take place on a weekly basis. We do tabletop exercises and command post exercises, we have three live counter-terrorist exercises every year on a national scale, and local authorities continually exercise at a very local level. We recently had live exercises involving hijacked aircraft, a terrorist occupation of off-shore oil wells and ships, and the threatened release of chemical and biological agents and improvised nuclear devices. If those are not high-level, complex planning exercises, I do not know what are. The exercise that happened at Bank in September 2003&nbsp;involved scenarios very similar to those that we encountered on 7&nbsp;July, and the practised ability to get people out of the tube probably saved more lives than were unfortunately lost during the incident.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_410">Several Members proposed the idea of having a Minister for homeland security. I welcome the Liberal Democrats&#039; view that that is a confused policy, because that is exactly what it is. We have a Minister responsible for co-ordinating this action across Government&#151;he is the Home Secretary, who chairs a committee of Ministers right across Government who take the lead in their Departments. I would say this to the hon. Member for Newark: really think carefully about this. Is there any benefit in stripping out of Departments the expertise that resides there to bring it together in one area? It would simply mean that those Departments no longer had ownership of the issues involved in emergency planning, resilience, counter-terrorism and all the work that we need to do. We have found that having that expertise embedded in Departments, with a proper co-ordinating machinery through the cross-Government committee co-ordinated by the Home 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 949</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Secretary, works extremely well. I do not feel that a Minister for homeland security, whether at Minister of State or Cabinet level, is going to work. The hon. Member for Newark said, &quot;I am he&quot;; well, I am afraid that I am not she. There is no vacancy. Although I know that he is looking for work, I am afraid that I will not be able to offer him any help on those terms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_411">Members asked about public information. That is important. We published a booklet on preparing for emergencies that went out to every household. It had very good reach across the community, and our research shows that the public welcomed the practical, down-to-earth advice that it gave them&#151;not only about terrorism, but about a whole range of emergencies from floods and fires to the things that we have discussed today. We also have the anti-terrorist hotline.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_412">I can tell the hon. Member for Newark that a huge amount is going on in relation to safety on the tube in terms of mandatory searches, CCTV and trying to make sure that we are as safe as we can possibly be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para16">
<a name="stpa_413">My right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George) made some important points, especially about our parliamentary scrutiny processes, and ascertaining whether we can find a better cross-cutting method of scrutinising some important issues. We should consider that. However, my experience shows that business is increasingly taking those matters very seriously. I have attended several events with business, for example, to discuss continuity plans. The London Resilience Forum has an excellent record on business continuity. There are also some good initiatives to involve the private security industry&#151;in which my right hon. Friend has an interest&#151;especially in working with the Metropolitan police.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-35_para17">
<a name="stpa_414">Hon. Members also mentioned resources. The resources for the police and the Security Service have increased enormously to give us capability and resilience. The Security Service will grow from approximately 1,800&nbsp;employees to 3,000. Spending on police services has doubled. I am not complacent, but I believe that we have one of the best systems for emergency preparedness.

 I am most grateful for the opportunity to raise the case of my constituent, Mrs. Summerbell. Both she and her son have been failed badly by the Child Support Agency, and I hope that the Minister will be able to put that right in his response tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_425">Mrs. Summerbell&#039;s child will be 10&nbsp;years old in November, and in her file, which I have in my office, there is evidence that the same three steps have been repeated over and over again. Sadly, I hold in my hand a letter sent to me earlier this year that contains the immortal phrase,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">&quot;To be honest I had come to my wit&#039;s end&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_426">I am sure that that sentiment is echoed by many people when dealing with the CSA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_427">The pattern is as follows. Mrs. Summerbell collects evidence about her former partner&#039;s means and presents it to the CSA. The CSA tries, and fails, to collect outstanding arrears from the absent father. It tells Mrs. Summerbell that there is nothing more it can do, unless she accepts a departure to a maintenance procedure. It would be rather like a formal and rigidly patterned dance, were it not so frustrating for the parent with care, and were it not for the fact that, in the end, it is a young child who is effectively the victim. Believe it or not, it is seven years since Mrs. Summerbell approached the CSA, and the matter is far from resolved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_428">Mrs. Summerbell tells me that she has seen it stated in the press that the CSA has the power to employ private detectives or to take away an absent parent&#039;s driving licence, but none of these sanctions has been used in her case, to the best of my knowledge. If no new evidence existed about the absent father, the CSA understandably might say that it had tried and failed, but with the best will in the world that cannot be said in this case. This is yet another example of the CSA&#039;s administrative failures compounding and ultimately supporting&#151;I do not say that lightly&#151;the attempts of an absent parent to avoid the financial duty of paying maintenance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_429">The latest frustration for my constituent is that after her having supplied further information, the CSA announced that its computer does not recognise the postcode of the address at which the father is resident. Given the existence of databases such as electoral rolls and postcode directories, it beggars belief that the CSA can come to a grinding halt. However, that only ties in with what we have learned to our regret about the computer records of many Government agencies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_430">Mrs. Summerbell told me that as of 13&nbsp;October, the case file is still not on the computer. Given that it is described as a &quot;new case&quot; in the CSA&#039;s own nomenclature, the address could be put on the system manually. The irony is that the postcode remains unchanged from the previous occasions on which the CSA used it successfully to locate the person concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_431">This case also demonstrates a glaring deficiency in the joined-up government of which this Government boast. One of the pieces of evidence in the case concerns 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 957</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>payments to the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise. One would think that such information would be simple to check, but the CSA claims that it cannot do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_432">This case points to the total inadequacies of the system when it comes to providing for the child of a single parent where the absent parent appears determined to conceal his financial position. It is a situation where the mother struggles while the absent parent is wealthy. Cases such as these reveal the pressures that can be placed on the parent with care. Children can be used as pawns. The actions of the CSA should always be to foster the welfare of the child, not to appear to tolerate or turn a blind eye to unreasonable behaviour, nor to pressurise a parent into the acceptance of unreasonable behaviour. If duress is being placed on any party, matters such as access, level of maintenance or educational opportunity cannot be accepted as legitimate bargaining chips in pursuit of the settlement of the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_433">In my view, the agency must take those aspects into account when seeking a departure agreement. Ultimately, if the circumstances of the family are such that there is a strong likelihood of unreasonable pressure being exerted, the CSA should be able to examine another route&#151;not just to declare that nothing further can be done. That may require legislation, but if it will secure a mechanism to ensure adequate financial provision for young children who are growing up without such provision at the moment, I hope that the Minister will consider it. In the short term, it is unacceptable that the CSA can refuse to examine an apparent inconsistency between the lifestyle of a parent and the assessed level of income on the grounds that something seems to be wrong with the agency&#039;s computer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_434">Parents with care who are looking after their children are, by definition, living on a shoestring; otherwise, they would not be seeking the CSA&#039;s intervention. They do not have the resources necessary to invest in chasing up the agency. In fact, as I was preparing for this debate, I received another letter from my constituent, saying that she had been told that her file had been sent from the head office in Dudley to an office in Plymouth, which she now needed to contact, and, by the way, the case number had also changed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_435">Mrs. Summerbell asked me to clarify that she asked the CSA to look into the previous case file, which would have shown how much information she had collected in the past. Sadly, my constituent&#039;s circumstances have not changed; nor have those of her child. After seven years, the delays continue. Mrs. Summerbell contacted the CSA at the end of June and was recently told that her case would have a commencement date of September because the agency did not make contact with the absent parent until August. That is when the agency file became live&#151;nearly three months later&#151;and I understand that it is still pending.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_436">On that basis, parents with care need the skills of an archivist and the patience of a saint to keep track of all the documentation, the telephone calls, the personnel involved and to mark the time ticking relentlessly away as nothing happens. All that is quite apart from the expenses involved, which weigh heavily on families with slender purses. I believe that that is an injustice for parents and children such as my constituent and her son 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 958</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and I hope that the Minister will seek to right it, and do so with the immediate speed that parents and children in those circumstances deserve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para16">
<a name="stpa_437">In that context, Mrs. Summerbell has reminded me of a GMTV programme in which a mother was assured by a Minister in the other place and by the Secretary of State that her case would be dealt with expeditiously. That mother had been appealing for help for four years. I remind the Minister that Mrs. Summerbell first appealed to the CSA not four, but seven years ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para17">
<a name="stpa_438">In conclusion, I would also like to raise my concern that, as I understand it, under the new chief executive of the CSA, the senior case worker role is about to abolished. I believe that that role is a worthwhile one and that this case would certainly have benefited from the attention of a senior case worker. Will the Minister comment on that, because I believe that the change will result in parents with care and children being less well served by the CSA than they are currently?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-37_para18">
<a name="stpa_439">I finish by observing that the last paragraph of my constituent&#039;s letter says it all. She believes that the father&#039;s lifestyle has not changed at all: he is still flying planes, going to private health clubs, driving high-class cars and so forth. &quot;Please, please help me&quot;, she says in the letter. You have given me the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to raise this matter on behalf of Mrs. Summerbell, so I hope that the Minister will be able to help my constituent this evening.

<p><a name="st_266"><a name="51019-38_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr. James Plaskitt): </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) on securing this debate on a subject that is obviously important to her constituent, but which is also important to the lives of so many other families. The agency has fully briefed me on this particular case and I am concerned about the way some aspects of it have been dealt with. However, I understand maintenance is in payment. I will therefore address in general terms some of the issues raised by the hon. Lady in respect of this case. She will, I know, understand that data protection requirements restrict the scope I have to respond on many of the case specifics that she raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_440">I wish to start by emphasising how committed we are to creating an efficient, effective child support service. We accept that that is not where we are at the moment. We are all completely aware of the difficulties the agency faces. Too many families have experienced ongoing problems with the CSA. The staff of the agency have to deal with often very sensitive and complex issues and they deal with people who are in emotionally delicate circumstances, when relationships have broken down. I wish to take this opportunity to commend all staff at the agency for their continuous hard work and dedication. The system can let the staff down, as well as the agency&#039;s customers. That is why we are now attempting to get things sorted out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_441">In April, the agency&#039;s new chief executive, Stephen Geraghty, took up post. He brings many skills from his experience in the insurance and finance industries. We have asked him to use his experience to review the agency&#039;s operations and service delivery, with the aim of improving performance and getting more money flowing to children. His findings will be with the ministerial team shortly and will be reported to Parliament in due course.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Oct 2005 : Column 959</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_442">The hon. Lady asked me to comment on a specific proposal that she has heard the chief executive will recommend. All I can say at this stage is that that must be speculation. We have not received the chief executive&#039;s report and, until we do, we cannot make decisions or comment on any particular suggestion that she thinks that he might propose.
</p>








<p><a name="st_267"><a name="51019-38_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I understand that under data protection rules the Minister cannot give me specific responses to some of the points I raised, but I hope that the debate will trigger a written response that I can pass on to my constituent. I also appreciate that the Minister cannot comment on rumours that I have heard, but perhaps he would express his full confidence in the role of the senior case worker, because that would be reassuring to me and many others.
</p>








<p><a name="st_268"><a name="51019-38_spnew1"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 I will come to that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_443">I wish to address some of the specific points raised by the hon. Lady this evening. The agency often needs, and asks for, assistance in collecting information to trace, and gather relevant information on, non-resident parents. However, on some occasions, that information is found to be either inaccurate, or of no benefit to the case. If there is no compelling evidence of inconsistency, the agency cannot reasonably be expected to act. The agency does not hire private detectives to trace non-resident parents, or gather information about circumstances and whereabouts. But the agency does have extensive information gathering powers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_444">I recognise the frustrations that the hon. Lady&#039;s constituent has experienced with getting her case on the new computer system. That has clearly caused unacceptable delay. I understand that when a case encounters that sort of problem it will be dealt with clerically. I appreciate that that is not an ideal solution, but it does at least enable some progress.

<a name="stpa_445">The agency&#039;s preferred method of payment for working parents is maintenance direct, in which the agency calculates the amount of maintenance to be paid, but leaves the parents to make their own payment arrangements. Cases can sometimes be stopped and subsequently restarted by either or both parties involved. In the event of closure, the agency&#039;s actions will of course cease, although voluntary maintenance arrangements may continue to operate. We recognise that continuous involvement of the agency is not necessary for all parents. In future, we shall look to extend that so that we can better support working parents in making their own arrangements. It is correct that in cases where the non-resident parent persists in wilful non-compliance, ultimately, the courts can take away driving licences or commit a person to prison. Those powers have been used, but they are also effective as a deterrent.

<a name="51019-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_446">A crucial aspect of the case raised by the hon. Lady appears to be that her constituent is dissatisfied with the amount of child maintenance awarded in the past. It may be helpful to remind the House that in those circumstances either parent has the right to ask for the case to be reviewed, and ultimately to appeal to an independent tribunal. Clients of the agency can apply for a departure under the old scheme and a variation under the new

<br>&nbsp;<br>scheme. Both are designed to consider the exceptional circumstances of clients and, in some cases, there may be real grounds for varying the rate of liability. I shall go into some more detail about variations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_447">It is worth stressing that variations are different from departures. The fact that someone has been refused an old-scheme departure does not mean that they will fail to get a new-scheme variation. Grounds for a variation in the new scheme include cases where the parent with care considers that the non-resident parent has diverted income, enjoys a lifestyle that is inconsistent with the income used to calculate the maintenance or has assets of more than &#163;65,000. In those circumstances, the parent with care can apply for a variation. They may also apply if a non-resident parent, who has the ability to control their own income, has income of more than &#163;100&nbsp;a week from a company or business that is not taken into account in the maintenance calculation, which allows, for example, income in the form of dividends received by company directors to be taken into account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_448">If allowed, a variation on one or more of those grounds will increase the non-resident parent&#039;s net weekly income for child support purposes, and thus the maintenance liability. However, I would like to make it clear that the onus is on the applicant to provide the information to support their application. The other parent will have the opportunity to make representations and a variation will be given only after consideration of evidence from both sides and only where it is equitable to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_449">We should be realistic. Some parents will fail to co-operate, fail to pay and fail to take financial responsibility for their children. Indeed, some parents set out deliberately to evade their responsibilities. The lengths to which some non-resident parents will go continue to astound me: changing jobs, moving house, becoming deliberately unemployed or even leaving the country to avoid financially supporting their children. The agency&#039;s job would of course be easier if all parents accepted their responsibility and ultimately the children would benefit. I want us to head to a time when failing to pay maintenance is socially unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51019-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_450">As I said earlier, I accept that some parents with care and some non-resident parents have not received the standard of service that they had the right to expect. That was not, and is not, acceptable. It is a reality that when a relationship breaks down there is often hostility; it can be an emotionally fraught time, but it is important to remember that responsibility for a child does not end when the relationship between the parents ends. Children have a right to support from both their parents, and that right sits at the very heart of what the Government are attempting to do with the agency.
