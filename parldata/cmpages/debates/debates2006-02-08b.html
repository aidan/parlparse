 The revised curriculum aims to develop young people as contributors to society by fostering citizenship. Pupils are given the opportunity to learn about a range of religions, values and ethics, and about the importance of respecting diversity.

<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60208-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Allen: </b> 
 Thinking back to the beginning of the troubles, almost 30 years ago, where does my hon. Friend think we might be today, had we started then to introduce more secular education in Northern Ireland and not allowed further faith schools of any denomination to be built? I know that she is conducting an education review. Will she put herself in the position of being at the Dispatch Box in 30 years&#039; time and begin that process in earnest now, so that young children are not indoctrinated with one religion or another at school, but only if their parents choose to do so at home? Will she take steps, through the review, to introduce such a proposal and to have more secular education in Northern Ireland?
</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his confidence that I will be at the Dispatch Box in 30 years&#039; time. He makes a plea for integrated education and there is clearly a great unmet demand on the part of parents for such education. The Government have obligations in that regard and dealing with this issue is a challenge, but we must also meet the challenge of falling school rolls. There are 50,000 spare places and one in eight school desks are empty. The review that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has initiated will consider how we can be smarter in managing the school estate 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 860</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and how we can ensure that we meet parental demand for integrated education, along with every other form of education.

 (DUP): I am sure that the Minister views with horror the prospect of standing at the Dispatch Box in 30 years&#039; time as the Minister with responsibility for education in Northern Ireland. Does she accept that having six different education providers in Northern Ireland has wasted resources and contributed to the overcapacity in school provision to which she referred? Will she explain to the House why she did not take the chance that she had under the review of public administration to cut the number of funded providers and why she continues to open Irish-medium schools and integrated schools, for example, in areas where there is a surplus&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60208-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. One supplementary is fine.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60208-01_spnew4"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 I suspect that there is little difference between the hon. Gentleman and me in respect of the review that we are taking forward. He is right to say that having so many different education providers has proved very expensive, but the review of public administration cuts the number of education administrators. In examining the existing types of education during the forthcoming review, the key issue has to be parental choice. He suggests that parents do not want Irish-medium education and integrated education, but such demand does exist. We have to be a bit smarter in how we provide such education and see whether we can share services to cut bureaucracy and administration while still meeting parental choice.

 The Government will continue to    work with loyalist representatives to ensure decommissioning. The IMC will make itself available to talk to a wide range of organisations, but it does not disclose the nature of such contact or the level of co-operation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60208-01_spnew5"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 I am most grateful to the Minister for that perfect parliamentary response, which is entirely accurate but tells me nothing. Does he agree with the IMC&#039;s latest assessment of the progress&#151;or lack of it&#151;made by loyalist paramilitaries toward decommissioning their weaponry?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60208-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I am disappointed to note that the IMC has concluded that the Ulster Defence Association in particular is deeply involved in violence, especially in the events in Whiterock last September. The Government and I encourage organisations on the loyalist side that are involved in violence to move away from it. I am confident that we will have the opportunity to discuss proposals to ensure that those organisations do move away from violence, and I hope that progress will be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 861</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>made this year in that regard. As with all violence associated with paramilitary activity, it is not acceptable to the Government. We need to take violence and intimidation out of the politics of Northern Ireland. The IMC has identified that it still exists and I repeat that the Government find that unacceptable. We need to find mechanisms to ensure that we move on from that situation.

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">Does the Minister agree that there are three lessons to be learned here? First, much of the social deprivation in areas controlled by paramilitaries is in fact caused by paramilitaries. Secondly, socio-economic problems should be addressed irrespective of paramilitaries. Thirdly, the addressing of such problems should not be regarded as a reward for ceasing to commit crimes of violence and terror, as has happened in the past. These issues should be disconnected and socio-economic matters should be addressed irrespective of what the paramilitaries are doing.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60208-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I am happy to say that I agree with my hon. Friend&#039;s analysis of the situation. The report being compiled by my chief official in the loyalist areas task force, Alan Shannon, has identified the influence of paramilitary activities as one of the specific blocks to making progress on social and economic matters in those areas. We need to address those deep-seated problems, but the Government will not be held to ransom by a trade-off between taking action on them and decommissioning. Decommissioning is central to making political progress in Northern Ireland: we want it to happen, but we also want there to be social justice, and to tackle economic deprivation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60208-01_spnew9"><b> Rev. Ian Paisley  (North Antrim)</b> 
 (DUP): The Minister is aware of our proposals about the districts that need help and I heartily endorse what the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) said. Such aid cannot amount to a reward system for paramilitaries who say, &quot;If you do this, we&#039;ll do that.&quot; Will the Minister give me an assurance that the elected representatives in those areas will be the first to negotiate with him about these matters? They have been elected by the people to do so.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60208-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman will know that I have undertaken a number of engagements&#151;I think 46 so far&#151;in various areas across Northern Ireland, and that I have looked at these problems. It is right that paramilitary influence is one of the major stumbling blocks to making progress in many of the areas of economic deprivation, and I have met 12 or 13 Members of the Assembly from the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s own party to discuss the matter. As my hon. Friend said, we need to tackle social and economic deprivation, and at the same time take the gun out of Northern Ireland politics. That applies both to the IRA and to the loyalist paramilitary organisations and it an essential prerequisite to progress. The continuation of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 862</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>threats, intimidation and armed activity is one of the blocks to tackling social and economic deprivation in many parts of Northern Ireland.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60208-01_spnew11"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack  (South Staffordshire)</b> 
 (Con): Is not the biggest stumbling block the continued involvement of paramilitaries from both sides in organised crime?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60208-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 Absolutely. The hon. Gentleman chairs the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, which is examining that very issue. He will know that organised crime is a key problem and that, sadly, many paramilitaries&#151;especially on the loyalist side now&#151;are still involved. We must decide how to tackle that, and all the ministerial team agree that there will be no room in Government for lack of action against criminality and paramilitary involvement in crime. We must look at how, in the long term, we can take the gun out of loyalist politics&#151;a point that takes us back to the question asked by the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon). That is central to Northern Ireland&#039;s economic success, and especially to those deprived areas that in part are held back by the influence of the loyalist paramilitaries.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60208-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. David Lidington  (Aylesbury)</b> 
 (Con): There is evidence that paramilitary organisations, both loyalist and republican, are moving assets from criminal enterprises into legitimate businesses. In view of that, can the Minister give an assurance that the police and the Assets Recovery Agency will continue to pursue the profits of crime, even if they have been laundered in that way, so that no paramilitary group can benefit from preying on the communities of Northern Ireland?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60208-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I am pleased to give the hon. Gentleman an unequivocal yes to that question. It is clear to the Government that profits are being made from criminality throughout Northern Ireland. That problem is being dealt with by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and by the Under-Secretary of State, my hon.    Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr.   Woodward). They have made it clear that the Assets Recovery Agency has a mandate to pursue the profits of crime, and the hon. Gentleman will know that it has made major efforts in that respect over the past couple of weeks. People in Northern Ireland who are involved in criminality or paramilitary activity need to know that the Government will close them down and remove the assets when we find out who is responsible for their generation.

 I assure the hon. Gentleman that Invest Northern Ireland is already working with Farm Fed Chickens to look at ways in which we can help to research alternative markets. The Department for Employment and Learning is also providing advice and support for workers who have been made redundant. Invest Northern Ireland is demand-led and supports investors who want to invest in Northern Ireland. The key to ensuring that Invest Northern Ireland can attract investors is the skills of workers in Northern Ireland. That is why the skills and science fund, launched by my right hon.

I take the point about the over-reliance on the public sector, which is why the review of public administration would reduce the number of councils from 26 to seven and reduce the number of public bodies. That is also why the work being done by Invest NI to grow the private sector is so important. I accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, but he should not underestimate the gains that are being made.

 Yes, indeed. My hon.

That is why, as the report confirms, the leadership of the republican movement has set a strategic course on democratic and peaceful politics.

 Two weeks ago, the Prime Minister told the House that he would have to listen carefully to what the people were saying on the question of police restructuring. This week, the Government announced that they were pressing ahead with plans to amalgamate the Welsh police forces despite the intense opposition of Welsh police authorities. Just how loudly do the people of Wales have to shout before the Prime Minister starts to listen?

<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="60208-03_spmin2"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Surely, as the hon. Gentleman knows, there is, in fact, a disagreement within Wales as to the right way to go. There are senior police officers who are saying precisely the opposite of what he is saying. Therefore, we must listen to the representations being made, but there are circumstances in which there are different representations being made and we obviously have to come to a decision. I know that he and some other Members of Parliament had a meeting with the Home Secretary earlier in the week, but we have put forward this option because there is strong support for it from within Wales.

 (Lab): Does the Prime Minister agree that while we recognise and respect freedom of speech and expression, that does not extend to a right to insult, humiliate and hurt people, which is clearly what the irresponsible publication of the cartoons of the Prophet, peace be upon him, has done, causing deep offence to millions of Muslims around the world? Does my right hon. Friend further agree that people have the right to protest peacefully, but that those who advocate violence and condone barbaric acts such as 7/7 must be dealt with by the full severity of the law?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o57"><a name="60208-03_spmin3"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I think that what my hon. Friend says about the protests against the cartoons being conducted peacefully is absolutely right. I also think that it is particularly important that he, as a leader from the Muslim community, is making it very clear that the vast majority of Muslims in this country completely abhor the type of protests that took place that resulted in violence and in people glorifying acts of murder and terrorism. That has no place in any part of our community&#151;certainly not in any respectable part of our community.

<p><a name="st_o58"><a name="60208-03_spnew8"><b> Mr. David Cameron  (Witney)</b>

Muslims, as he has also just said, contribute an enormous amount to this country and, for the overwhelming majority, Islam is a religion of peace.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o59"><a name="60208-03_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I hope very much that the voice of the moderate majority is not drowned out because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar) made clear, the fact is that the vast majority of people in the Muslim community and across the Muslim world totally abhor acts of terrorism and those who incite or glorify terrorism. It is important that we make it clear that we use the full force of the law against people who break the law, but remain united as a country&#151;across communities of all faiths&#151;in resisting terrorism wherever it rears its head.

<p><a name="st_o60"><a name="60208-03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 On the specific point of policing that the Prime Minister just mentioned, we all agree that the existing laws on incitement must be enforced.

<p><a name="st_o61"><a name="60208-03_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 No; I agree, of course, entirely. It is extremely important that the police use the powers available to them. One of the reasons for the legislation that is currently before the Houses of Parliament is precisely to strengthen the law. It is important that we can agree on the measures that are necessary to do that because the law will be strengthened in very important ways. First, indirect encouragement to acts of terrorism will be made unlawful and glorification will be mentioned specifically as an example of indirect incitement to terrorism. Secondly, it was extremely important&#151;I should be grateful if the right hon. Gentleman would look again at the Conservative party&#039;s position on this&#151;that the original provisions in the Bill allowed us to proscribe groups that glorified terrorism. Those provisions were removed from the legislation in the House of Lords. It is important that we send out a very strong signal that any group, or people, who glorify terrorism in any way at all will be committing a criminal offence and that those groups that rely on glorifying terrorism to attract recruits should not be able to operate in our society.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o63"><a name="60208-03_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 No, of course they will not. However, in any situation, especially when other troops are under threat, as happened recently, I am sure that our troops would want to go to the help of their allies. The important thing is surely that we, together with the troops of many other countries, are in Afghanistan to help that country towards the democracy that its people want and to ensure that the Taliban or al-Qaeda cannot again use the country as a failed state for their own purposes. We can be not only immensely proud of the work that our troops do there, but immensely determined to ensure that they can carry on doing that work. I assure my hon. Friend that there is no intention that they should having a roving commission throughout Afghanistan, but if, as happened the other day, troops of another country working alongside us are under threat, of course our troops will want to go and help them.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o65"><a name="60208-03_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The reason for the proposals, as I explained during Prime Minister&#039;s questions some time ago, is that after we commissioned a report from Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary into the whole issue, it came forward with proposals showing why the present configuration of forces was wrong. There is sometimes a notion when talking about this that the number of forces that we have at the moment&#151;just over 40&#151;has somehow been the case for ever. Actually, 30 to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 871</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>40 years ago, a similar exercise was undertaken involving substantial mergers. The question is what is the most effective form of policing. Since we got the report saying that the present configuration is not effective, surely it is sensible for us to look at how we can make it better.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o66"><a name="60208-03_spnew12"><b> Sir Menzies Campbell: </b> 
 Apart from the issue of the loss of connection with local people, the Prime Minister will know that the Association of Police Authorities estimates the cost of the proposed mergers as something in excess of &#163;500 million. What will that mean: higher council tax bills, or fewer police on the streets?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o67"><a name="60208-03_spmin8"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It will mean neither, actually, because we do not accept that figure. As I have said, there are different views, including within the police service, but what is important is to get the most effective way of configuring local police forces, and community policing is best done at a community level. It is entirely consistent with proper community policing to have a proper strategic force at the right strategic level, and then to have greater devolution of power to community policing. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman looks at the history of police services in this country, he will see that there have been many changes over the years. Once those changes take effect, it is interesting how quickly the opposition dissipates.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o69"><a name="60208-03_spmin9"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is important, as the Mayor indicated, not merely that we have more British Transport police, but that we increase the number of neighbourhood policing teams. My hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>to make sure that those who abuse the licensing system are more severely dealt with&#151;fixed penalty notices, for example, for people who are drunk and disorderly, and the power that the police now have to close pubs or clubs where there are regular disturbances or fighting.

The second is in respect of the working time directive, as there is an increasing desire to make sure that we have sufficient flexibility in European labour markets.

 The fact is that many local authorities fulfil that role.

We have come an immense way in the past eight years, and there is no doubt about the improvement in schools&#151;in particular, the number of failing schools has been more than halved in the past few years. However, Labour Members will not rest while children still do not get the education that they need, which is why the programme of improvement through investment and reform will continue.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require a local authority to hold a referendum about a matter of major local importance for which it is responsible if one tenth of its electorate demand the holding of such a referendum; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_1">There is already provision under section 116 of the Local Government Act 2003 for a local council to hold a referendum, but the decision on whether to do so rests with the local council concerned. Not surprisingly, few councils have chosen to hold one. The principle of local referendums is not an issue to be debated in connection with my Bill, nor do I wish to get drawn into the wider debate on referendums such as those on regional assemblies or the euro. Representative democracy has served us well. Without taking the route of referendums being part of the decision-making process, as in Switzerland, I believe that there are occasions when Governments&#151;in this case, local government&#151;need to have a safety valve for the community to challenge what is being done in its name.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_2">My Bill would give the power of determination over a referendum to the local community. However, unlike a parish poll, as set out in the Local Government Act 1972, whereby as few as 10 people at a parish meeting can demand that one is held, my Bill has a very high threshold in order to deter frivolous actions or those on matters over which the local council has no responsibility. It would require a local authority to hold a referendum about a matter of major local importance for which it is responsible if one tenth of its electorate demand the holding of such a referendum. In the case of my own borough, that would require around 15,000 people on the electoral roll petitioning for a referendum. That 10 per cent requirement is double the 5 per cent which is all that is required to trigger a referendum to have an elected mayor as set out in the Local Government Act 2000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_3">My Bill has been prompted by the arrogance of Conservative-run Colchester borough council and its contempt for the overwhelming majority of my constituents. The council wants to shut the town&#039;s bus station and build a loss-making &#163;17.2 million contemporary visual arts facility, even though that is in clear breach of the council&#039;s own adopted borough plan. Furthermore, the council is having to make cuts in many other areas. This reveals an interesting choice of the ruling party&#039;s priorities, for the arts came 17th out of 18th in the council&#039;s recent survey of residents&#039; priorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_4">Public opinion is clearly opposed to what the council is up to. That has been demonstrated by a petition signed by more than 15,000 people who want to keep the bus station and through newspaper polls and correspondence, and confirmed by my own random sample selection of names from the electoral roll. It is not in my interests to misread or misrepresent what my constituents are telling me. However, my efforts to ascertain the true sense of local opinion were challenged by the non-elected chairman of the Colchester local strategic partnership, who questioned the validity of my survey. She had attended a special council meeting to argue against a referendum, yet had the audacity to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 881</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>challenge the town&#039;s democratically elected Member of Parliament on a matter of local democracy. It is a funny old world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_5">The most recent poll was organised last month by the <i>Essex County Standard</i>. It was good of the newspaper to do so, and it was intended for its readers. Regrettably, that phone poll was hijacked by those driving the art gallery project. Full-time staff at the town&#039;s existing publicly-funded art gallery sought to rig the vote by circulating by e-mail just the &quot;yes&quot; number to likely supporters. Two professors in the department of art history at the University of Essex also sought to influence the phone poll by e-mailing around to ask people to phone in. Is not that a misuse of public resources? Nevertheless, even their dubious antics were not enough to prevent a 3:1 vote against the council&#039;s proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_6">At a meeting in the town last year, where there was no scope for any members of the public, let alone the town&#039;s MP, to question what we were being told, I challenged one of the Tory councillors, who just happened to have been my opponent at last May&#039;s general election, saying that what we were witnessing was not democratic. He replied: &quot;I am not a democrat. I am a Conservative.&quot; That just about sums it up. His words were duly reported in Colchester&#039;s <i>Evening Gazette</i>.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-04_para8">
<a name="stpa_7">On 22 November last year, Labour and Liberal Democrat borough councillors convened an extraordinary meeting of the council at which a motion was tabled calling for a referendum in accordance with section 116 of the Local Government Act 2003. The council&#039;s Conservative and independent councillors voted this down. Most of the Tory councillors represent the rural areas of the borough. The majority of the councillors in my Colchester town constituency are either Labour or Liberal Democrat. It is the people of the town who are most up in arms at what is happening, but the rural-based Tory councillors are calling all the shots. Only one of the eight cabinet members lives in the town.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-04_para9">
<a name="stpa_8">I believe that if a referendum was held, the people of Colchester would vote overwhelmingly against what the council is inflicting on the town, aided and abetted by quangos and others&#151;generally those who do not live in the town, yet who are able to drive through an agenda that local people do not want. This is not democracy. It is not good enough to say, &quot;Oh well, the people can vote out the councillors at the next local elections.&quot; By then, a damaging, irreversible decision could have been made. The arrogance of power needs to be checked in such circumstances. My Bill would provide that check.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-04_para10">
<a name="stpa_9">Nobody in local government who is truly committed to democratic accountability and good governance will be opposed to my Bill. Only those who want to ride roughshod over the community and make decisions which they know are not in accordance with what residents support will hope that the intentions of my Bill do not materialise. I commend the Bill to the House.

The House has heard&#151;and is entitled to a broader explanation&#151;a lot of small-town politicking from him, which I fear does neither him nor the town of Colchester any credit, and under-sells what is a major project for the benefit of the people of Colchester.

I do not therefore know why he is conducting such a campaign. He is sending out a negative signal about this positive project that will attract more than 120,000 visitors annually, directly create 33 full-time jobs, indirectly create 38 new full-time jobs, create 160 construction jobs during its 18-month construction period, and offer 28 new places for undergraduate and postgraduate students at Essex university.

The Audit Commission duly conducted an investigation at his behest. The investigation cost &#163;20,000.

 I am a little surprised at the attitude of the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May). This is House business, not party political business.

 If the hon. Gentleman recalls what was said during business questions, he will know precisely what the reason is: the Leader of the House wants to have his photograph taken.

We shall also need a clear explanation of why it is felt necessary to backdate the allowances.

<a name="60208-05_para12">
<a name="stpa_22">It is important that we have long enough to ask whether the description of a representational role applies to parties in this House, because if it does, it will affect the way in which the money that is given to the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives is administered and used. I need an explanation without ambiguity of why there is a difference between the two resolutions, and of their implications in terms of what would be permissible for Sinn Fein under the new motion, were it to be passed. I also want to know the implications of the motion for parties that are already in receipt of Short money arising from the 1975 resolution.

 I fully support what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Is there not a long-standing principle that all Members of the House are equal? If that is the case, why should the members of one particular party be treated differently from Members who are here under the banner of different parties?

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="60208-06_spnew3"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 That was exactly the point that I was going to make, Mr. Speaker. It would be quite wrong to go into the content of the resolutions. My point is simply 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 886</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that the Government have, for reasons of their own, tabled a business motion that truncates our business and requires it to be completed before the time at which it would normally have to finish. They must have a reason for doing so, but they have not produced it in evidence to the House. I really cannot believe that it is something as silly as a photograph.

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="60208-06_spnew6"><b> Mr. Douglas Hogg  (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con):</b> 
 I rise to support what has been said by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath). I approach this business motion with a great deal of hostility. We start with the proposition that this is a matter for the House. It raises important questions relating to the status, rights, benefits and privileges of Members of Parliament, and hon. Members should be entitled to debate them for as long as they wish, consistent with the proprieties of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_24">A number of other fundamental questions will be raised in our debate today. Why does not Sinn Fein participate? Should taking the Oath be a precondition to participation? My view is that it should not. Should failure to participate be a disqualification? Again, my view is that it should not, because Members who are elected as Sinn Fein Members are elected by their electorate. If we believe in parliamentary democracy, we must recognise that Sinn Fein Members are as equally Members of the House as any one of us. If we deny that proposition, we are playing into the hands of over-mighty Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_25">We ought to be able to debate those questions at length, because they are a matter for the House of Commons. I agree that there are divided opinions on them, and that is all the more reason why we need time to discuss them. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), most of all, disapproves of what I am saying on this point&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="60208-06_spnew7"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack  (South Staffordshire) (Con):</b> 
 Totally.
</p>





<p><a name="st_22"><a name="60208-06_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 Indeed, he has said so on many occasions, and he may be right. However, that makes my point that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 887</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>we need to have extended time for debate. These motions are not about whether Sinn Fein has renounced violence in the Province, but about whether Members of the House of Commons should be treated differently because they have chosen not to participate in our proceedings. That is a quite different matter, and we need to debate it at length.
</p>





<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60208-06_spnew9"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that the fact that there are considerable differences of opinion within parties as well as across the Floor of the House makes it even more important that, on a matter for the House, full time should be given to the debate, not least because my experience of the views of a number of Conservative Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), is that they have quite a lot to say on these matters, and they ought to be given plenty of time in which to say it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="60208-06_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is quite right. There is a diversity of opinion within the parties on both sides of the House. Furthermore, opinions change. I have long opposed the Oath, but I have previously voted for taking away the allowances from Sinn Fein Members. I now think that that was a mistake, and I should like the time to explain my reasons.
</p>





<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60208-06_spnew11"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack: </b> 
 While I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend on the narrow issue of this timetable motion, it is possible to make a convincing case against giving allowances to those Members in a very short compass, and he could do that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_26"><a name="60208-06_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 That might be true, but a lot of people want to participate in the debate. I have no doubt that my hon. Friend can wrap up his arguments extremely succinctly, but he is of course a very concise speaker. There are quite a few hon. Members of whom that cannot be said, and quite a lot of people wish to participate in the debate.
</p>





<p><a name="st_27"><a name="60208-06_spnew13"><b> Daniel Kawczynski  (Shrewsbury and Atcham) (Con):</b> 
 I disagree with my right hon. and learned Friend, in that I am surprised that the Government are dragging this idea of giving Sinn Fein allowances through the House yet again, when international courts and courts in Northern Ireland have repeatedly stated that, under our democratic processes, Sinn Fein should not be given any allowances.
</p>





<p><a name="st_28"><a name="60208-06_spnew14"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 I suspect, Mr. Speaker, that if I were to respond to my hon. Friend&#039;s point in detail, you would tell me that it was a matter for the substantive debate that is to come. He makes a perfectly legitimate point, but I would prefer to debate it in the substantive debate rather than during this debate on the timetable motion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_26">This is a matter for the House, and we should therefore be very slow to impose a timetable. This contrasts ill with the position adopted by the late Mr. Robin Cook when we debated these matters in 2001. He made it plain at the time that the debate would be open-ended and that there would be a free vote. That is what we ought to be doing today, and I very much regret the fact that we are not. I suspect that the reason is related to the Labour party&#039;s internal jollifications, and that is pretty discreditable.

 The motion has to do with the time that we shall be allowed to debate this very important matter. The police in Northern Ireland have stated:

The latter problem is so great that one of the leading fuel companies, Shell, has pulled out of Northern Ireland. Moreover, 6 per cent. of all cigarettes sold in Northern Ireland are illegal; that 6 per cent. consists of imported and counterfeit cigarettes. Such illegal activity takes 12 billion cigarettes out of the economy every year.

 I detected through my radar that the Leader of the House indicated earlier from a sedentary position that if we sat down, he would give a reason for the motion, but the reality is that the appropriate time to do so was when he opened the debate. Of course, there are two reasons why the Government want to spend no longer than is necessary on this debate. First, doing so is for their convenience. A photograph is to be taken to celebrate the Labour party&#039;s centenary&#151;

</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_32">The reality is that the Government do not want a long debate on these motions because they have struck a deal with Sinn Fein. I have in front of me a copy of the parliamentary Labour party briefing on these motions, which is very poor in terms not only of quantity but quality. I also have a copy of the Conservative party briefing, which is more substantial in both senses. The PLP briefing makes it clear that these motions arise from a deal that the Government have done with Sinn Fein-IRA. They did another deal with Sinn Fein-IRA on the on-the-runs legislation, and we all saw what happened to that. So it is not in the Government&#039;s interest to have a long period of embarrassment in the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_33">The other factor is that, uncharacteristically and unintentionally, the Leader of the House might have misled hon. Members when he said, in the very brief remarks with which he opened the debate, that the motion was designed to facilitate the House when in fact it is to facilitate himself and his party colleagues. In addition, he said that the debate was to be truncated because we had gone over these matters before.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_34">That is not correct. One of the motions has been debated before in this House, but the other has never been debated here. The unique proposal is that a new fund should be set up that will be available exclusively to Sinn Fein-IRA. Other parties in the House will not enjoy the same freedom, when it comes to the expenditure involved, that Sinn Fein-IRA will have. That is a completely new subject for debate, and a major issue that we need time to discuss.

<p><a name="st_45"><a name="60208-07_spnew14"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend. I said what I said about the motion and the guillotine with full intent. The Government have sought to change the culture of this House over three Parliaments. This House now routinely subscribes to the truncation of debate on matters that are for the House itself to decide. That is why I resolutely oppose the business motion, and I urge all hon. Members to do the same, for the sake of our standing. At the heart of the debate is the ability to determine whether a person elected by an electorate should receive the rights that go with that position.

<p><a name="st_46"><a name="60208-07_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 With the leave of the House, I shall respond briefly to the debate. In saying that I shall do so briefly, I mean no discourtesy to those hon. Members who have spoken, but I do note that they had difficulty in formulating their observations on the business motion. They have said that the issues involved are important, yet the longer they speak on the business motion, the less time is available for dealing with those important issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_37">The Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), devoted much of his contribution to the subject matter of the motions that are to follow, and not to the business motion. It is important that the House has sufficient time to debate those matters, and I shall not speak at length now. However, the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) made it clear that she and her Front-Bench colleagues have judged that the business motion will allow sufficient time for debate of the important matters to come. That is also the view of the Government.

<a name="60208-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_38">The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) speaks eloquently on questions of procedure from as far back on the Conservative Benches as one can get. He illustrated the sort of difficulty that might arise without a business motion such as this when he said that he believed that debate should continue indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-07_para10">
<a name="stpa_39">I have had many opportunities to enjoy the delights of hearing the hon. Member for Macclesfield speak about matters of procedure. For those of us with a legal background and training, nothing could be more enjoyable, but the important thing about the debate to come is that the House will have an opportunity to debate the substantive motions.

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="60208-08_spnew0"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I want to put one point to the Leader of the House that I think is germane to the amount of time needed to debate the substantive motions. There is a proposal to give what for convenience I shall call Short money to Sinn Fein: does that imply that Sinn Fein Members will have a greater ability to spend that money than those others who receive Short money through the resolution of 1975? The debate will be truncated if they are not to have greater scope for spending, but it will be extended if they are to have greater licence. The answer to my question is crucial to our understanding of the matter.
</p>





<p><a name="st_48"><a name="60208-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 That is an important matter, and I shall deal with it when I open the debate on the substantive motions. However, to help the hon. Gentleman, I stress that proper restrictions will be placed on the spending of that money and that, even though the purposes are different, they will be wholly consistent with the restrictions currently attached to the expenditure of Short money. I am not suggesting for a moment that we are dealing with Short money, but the restrictions on how the proposed money is spent will be supervised by the House authorities in exactly the same way, and the proper safeguards will apply.
</p>





<p><a name="st_49"><a name="60208-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Frank Field  (Birkenhead) (Lab):</b> 
 The reason that some of us are puzzled is that Short money is given to political parties for their functions at Westminster. As the hon. Members involved do not wish to appear here, why should they get Short money?
</p>





<p><a name="st_50"><a name="60208-08_spnew3"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. We are now getting into the merits of the argument, rather than the timetable motion.
</p>





<p><a name="st_51"><a name="60208-08_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) can ask the same question during the debate on the substantive motions. The answer that I shall give him then will be the same as the one that I would have given him now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_40">I recognise that this is important House business. I do not suggest that hon. Members should not take it seriously. I am sure that they will, but it is important that the main debate is allowed to take place and that we do not continue discussing the procedure motion.
</p>





<p><a name="st_52"><a name="60208-08_spnew5"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering) (Con):</b> 
 Reference has been made in the debate to the Leader of the House having his photograph taken later this evening. Does that have anything to do with the centenary of the parliamentary Labour party?

<p><a name="st_53"><a name="60208-08_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I was asked at last week&#039;s business questions whether a great Labour party &quot;bash&quot; was scheduled for tonight. At the end of our proceedings today there will be an Adjournment debate that is concerned with the Labour party&#039;s 100th anniversary. I understand that a photograph will be taken&#151;but also that the photographer involved has another engagement afterwards that Conservative Members are likely to attend. It would be unfair to use the word &quot;bash&quot; about that other event, but it is likely to take up the time of Opposition Members. The photographer will be busy this evening&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry that some Opposition Members have not received an invitation to the Conservative party winter ball. I want to make it clear that I have not received one either.

The House will recall that the principle of those allowances was debated at great length on 18 December 2001. The suspension, approved on 10 March last year, was a measure of the disapproval the House felt over the IRA&#039;s role in the Northern bank robbery in December 2004 and the murder of Robert McCartney a month later.

The parliamentary allowances for Sinn Fein were suspended because the process of democratic development by the republican movement had slipped backwards. It is clear from the Independent Monitoring Commission and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning reports last week that the republican movement is moving to a reliance on exclusively peaceful and democratic means. That process is more advanced than when the allowances were first granted to Sinn Fein Members of Parliament in 2001.

 I hope that the Leader of the House will accept that after his comments about all this being for the good of peace, absolute and utter despair will go around our Province, Northern Ireland, especially among the victims and those who have suffered at the hands of Sinn Fein-IRA. After the La Mon House hotel bombing, 12 people died, and one women&#039;s only child&#151;her 25-year-old daughter&#151;was one of the victims, along with the daughter&#039;s 25-year-old husband. That mother was offered &#163;300 for the loss of that child. For many years we fought with the Community Relations Council to get money to put in a stained-glass window to honour the victims who were murdered so horrendously.

 I have had the opportunity to meet a number of the victims of violence in Northern Ireland, many of whom, inevitably, were associated with Her Majesty&#039;s armed forces, during the time that I was Secretary of State for Defence.

All I can say is that in my time visiting Northern Ireland, I have heard from all sides of the community an overwhelming desire to see an end to the violence and to see a peaceful path for the people of Northern Ireland.

There are still reports of localised criminality involving individual members of the IRA, but it is a sea change from a year ago let alone five, 10, 20 or, indeed, 30 years ago.

<a name="60208-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_59">The Government&#039;s aim today is to encourage Sinn Fein MPs to play the fullest role in democratically representing their constituents and to support the republican movement as a whole along a democratic path. The motion would provide Sinn Fein with a maximum of &#163;84,000 a year, together with a small amount of about &#163;2,000 a year for travelling expenses, from 1 November 2005. That will be subject to strict controls. Sinn Fein will have to furnish the House accounting officer with a certificate from an independent auditor to the effect that the expenses claimed are within the terms of the resolution&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I am sorry that hon. Members take that view because the same control system applies to Short money and the same maximum amount is payable as under that scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_60">Under the motion, financial assistance would be made available for activities related to those that would normally attract Short money. Short money, as the House will be aware, is payable for research associated with Front-Bench duties, developing and communicating alternative policies and shadowing the Government. Financial assistance would be available for related activities conducted by Sinn Fein, such as the employment of a researcher to assist the representative business of a spokesman, and the costs of relevant equipment and travel costs for spokesmen engaged in representative business.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_61">Crucially, certain activities will specifically not attract financial assistance. Those include political campaigning and fundraising, membership campaigns, advertising, personal or private business and constituency business.

<p><a name="st_115"><a name="60208-12_spnew4"><b> Mr. Frank Field </b> 
: The Leader of the House will realise that to some extent we heard this speech some years ago. When we extended our allowances to people who had not come to the House to be full Members, we were told that their behaviour would change, but nothing has changed in that respect. Has Sinn Fein given the Government any indication of how its behaviour will change as a result of being given Short money?
</p>





<p><a name="st_116"><a name="60208-12_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend addresses an issue that is central to the debate. The IRA has made a historic statement. Although right hon. and hon. Members might not accept it, it is a significant statement in the long and drawn-out tragedy for Northern Ireland and its people. There are now independent voices that have confirmed the statement and said it is verifiable that the IRA has abandoned terrorist activity. When those two facts are taken together, they provide hon. Members with a powerful argument that we should ignore at our peril.

<p><a name="st_117"><a name="60208-12_spnew6"><b> Mr. Field: </b> 
 I, for one, am grateful for the statements that Sinn Fein-IRA have made and hope that the changes are as profound as the Leader of the House suggests, because if that is so it will be for the good of all. However, saying that a party that does not appear in the House should receive Short money is totally different. We welcome the statement that Sinn Fein has made, but Short money is specifically paid to support functions carried out in the Chamber by members of parties when representing major policies. Surely there is a difference between that and giving commitments not to use violence.
</p>





<p><a name="st_118"><a name="60208-12_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I accept that there is a distinction to be drawn, and we are not granting Short money precisely for the reasons that my right hon. Friend makes clear. The motion refers to the work of a political party in its representative capacity, which is what we are debating.

<p><a name="st_120"><a name="60208-12_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I will try to give way to as many hon. Members as possible, but I will also try to answer their questions, which is what I am attempting to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_62">It is important to realise that while there is a responsibility on the IRA, as part of the republican movement, to continue on the path it has set out, we can encourage it by taking such decisions. We can support the process by realising that there are circumstances in which political parties have representative functions over and above the individual functions of members of those parties who happen to have been elected to the House and other democratic bodies.
</p>





<p><a name="st_121"><a name="60208-12_spnew10"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 I am extremely grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way to me a third time. He consistently refers back to the phrase &quot;representative business&quot; and differentiates Short money from the money that will be available for such business. He has indicated several activities for which that money could not be paid. Will he now give the House a definition of representative business?
</p>





<p><a name="st_122"><a name="60208-12_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I indicated the kinds of things for which the money could be available. I said that it might be used to fund a researcher, or to purchase equipment to support the representative capacity of a political party. However, as the right hon. Lady will realise, this is not one of those issues that can be precisely defined&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Ah.&quot;] The rules of the House cover the way in which Short money is spent and the motion was drafted closely to reflect those arrangements. Of course, Short money is subject to rigorous financial accounting, and the arrangements under the motion will be subject to rigorous financial accounting by the House authorities in exactly the same way. It is not entirely fair or right for Opposition Members to find the matter a cause of great entertainment because when they spend Short money they are subject to precisely the same accounting rules that apply to the allowance.
</p>





<p><a name="st_123"><a name="60208-12_spnew12"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> 
 The Leader of the House will understand that we are talking about not accounting rules but the areas of activity for which the money could be used. For the avoidance of doubt, will he make it absolutely clear that Sinn Fein will not be able to use the money for any activities or 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 908</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>classes of activities that the Conservative party or Liberal Democrats would not be permitted to undertake when in receipt of Short money?
</p>





<p><a name="st_124"><a name="60208-12_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 That is absolutely and precisely the case. It is important that that is well understood, which is why I make a precise analogy between the way in which Short money allowances are supervised and the way in which the new allowance will similarly be supervised.
</p>





<p><a name="st_125"><a name="60208-12_spnew14"><b> Mr. Hogg </b> 
: The House as a whole will welcome that assurance. Surely the money will not be confined to supporting parliamentary business. When we examine the motion, we must be careful to ensure that we do not find that Sinn Fein&#039;s receipt of representative money puts it in a better position than other parties that, on the face of it, have their money confined to supporting parliamentary business.
</p>





<p><a name="st_126"><a name="60208-12_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The right hon. and learned Gentleman makes an extremely good point and I agree with him. It is important that the rules are properly supervised and that there are strict accounting standards, and I assure him that that will be the position.
</p>





<p><a name="st_127"><a name="60208-12_spnew16"><b> Mark Durkan  (Foyle) (SDLP):</b> 
 Is the Leader of the House aware that several comments have been made in the past about various Sinn Fein returns to the Electoral Commission? Those excellent works of fiction have gone completely unchallenged despite the known facts about Sinn Fein&#039;s election expenditure, so it is hard to take seriously his assurances about scrutiny. Does the Leader of the House realise that he is talking in riddles by saying that the money is not Short money and then that it is&#151;that it is the same and is not the same? Is it not the case that I will be unable to spend Short money on activities in my constituency, but that Sinn Fein will be able to spend its representation money on activities in my constituency against me?
</p>





<p><a name="st_128"><a name="60208-12_spnew17"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 That is not the position. We must draw a clear distinction between the two motions. One deals with the restoration of parliamentary allowances, which clearly would allow right hon. and hon. Members to spend the allowances in their constituencies in support of their activities as individual Members of Parliament, as against money that would be, and is, available to political parties to support their representative activities. That is why the motion is drafted in the way it is.
</p>





<p><a name="st_129"><a name="60208-12_spnew18"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 This is a key point, because we need clarity. We understand that Short money relates to activities conducted within the House. In the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s response to my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), it sounded as though he was taking that money out of the House. Short money is named after a person. Is this money, which we might call Hoon money, connected in the same way to the House, or is it money that can be spent outside the House, as the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) suggested?
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/debtext/60208-13.htm"/>




<p><a name="st_130"><a name="60208-13_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I made it clear that the money would not be spent in support of individual Members in their constituencies, but it is clear that political parties have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 909</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>representative activities. Perhaps I can give one illustration of that. Sinn Fein may choose to employ a spokesman in Westminster to speak on behalf of the party in discussions that take place in and around Parliament. That is a matter for Sinn Fein, and we have given it access to facilities here. It is clearly a representative function of a political party; it is not the kind of activity that would allow money to be spent in an individual Member&#039;s constituency. However, it would provide the kind of support to representative activities of a political party that are already covered by the Short money that is made available to other political parties.
</p>





<p><a name="st_131"><a name="60208-13_spnew1"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman said that there is no opportunity to use the Hoon money in any way except for those purposes for which Short money is currently provided. Does he mean that to the letter of the law as it applies to Short money? If so, it clarifies responses to earlier questions, but it may be slightly different from the impression he gave in a previous answer.
</p>





<p><a name="st_132"><a name="60208-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I gave an unequivocal answer and I do not retreat from it. It is important to make a clear distinction. This is money that is available and wholly consistent with the rules that currently cover the payment of Short money as far as other political parties are concerned.
</p>





<p><a name="st_133"><a name="60208-13_spnew3"><b> Rev. Ian Paisley  (North Antrim) (DUP):</b> 
 Surely the Leader of the House should be influenced by the fact that the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party said what he did and that Unionist parties are saying the same thing. Surely he must understand that he will put all the other parties that have forsworn terrorism in a difficult position. The advantage will go to the paramilitary groups because they can cook the books and nothing will be done about it. If we are going to have an audit, let us see the Government auditor doing something and taking them to the courts. We are still to see that. How can we trust for the future what has not been done in the past?

<p><a name="st_134"><a name="60208-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I made it clear that this is a matter for the House and its audit, not for the Government. As I made clear, the Government have a view. We believe that the proposal is the right way forward, but it is a matter absolutely for the House to decide, and it will have to do that in due course.
</p>





<p><a name="st_135"><a name="60208-13_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Perhaps we can have some advice from the Chair. The motion apparently extends what is called Short money to representative business. I am not clear whether the motion standing by itself has that effect, or whether there needs to be a further and substantive motion, spelling out the terms and conditions on which Short money is payable to Sinn Fein before such money becomes payable. The House needs to know whether there is to be a further resolution or whether this resolution is sufficient to make payment due.

<p><a name="st_136"><a name="60208-13_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 That is not a point of order for the Chair. What is on the Order Paper, and the reasoning behind it, is for the proposer of the motion to explain and to be questioned about, which has been happening for the past 42 minutes. It is purely a matter of debate and then decision for individual Members of the House.
</p>





<p><a name="st_137"><a name="60208-13_spnew6"><b> Mr. Frank Field: </b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Your advice is needed as we just learned from the Leader of the House that if we pass the motion we will change the nature of Short money, because we have been told that it can now be spent in a way that representative money can be spent. Surely the Government should introduce a substantive motion on changing Short money that incorporates allowing Sinn Fein to claim that money, rather than changing its nature by extending it to Sinn Fein.
</p>





<p><a name="st_138"><a name="60208-13_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Interpretation of the motion is not for the Chair. It is a matter for debate. The Leader of the House must explain what he is asking the House to approve and be questioned on that. That is the stuff of debate, not a matter for the Chair.

: Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I entirely respect what you said, but the fact is that Short money exists as it does because the House has willed it so. It has approved the rules and decided how it should be applied. We are now told that a consequence of the motion will be that Short money will be reinterpreted, without the will of the House, in an entirely different way. Surely that cannot be right.
</p>





<p><a name="st_140"><a name="60208-13_spmin2"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Whether it is right or wrong is not a matter for the Chair to determine. The House has a clear decision before it. If right hon. and hon.

If the motion is agreed and doubt remains, there will be further parliamentary opportunities to eradicate those doubts. It is essentially a matter for debate.

 At the risk of straying beyond the terms of the motion, I want to make it clear that the House has approved the payment of what is strictly known as Opposition parties financial assistance, colloquially known as Short money.

The House now has an opportunity of debating and agreeing, if it so wishes, a motion relating to providing financial assistance for Sinn Fein and for those parties that have not chosen to take their seats. I accept that in the present context that applies to Sinn Fein.

Indeed, the latest report of the Independent Monitoring Commission makes it clear that the republican movement remains involved in criminal activity and intelligence gathering, and raises real concerns about the way in which that movement is exercising community restorative justice. I shall quote one part of the report, on pages 34 to 35. The report states:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;We have no doubt that the PIRA, uniquely among paramilitary organisations, has taken the strategic decision to eschew terrorism and pursue a political path. There are a number of signs that the organisation is moving in the way it indicated in its statement of 28 July 2005.

<br>&nbsp;<br>they choose how to vote. It is important to look at the background to the issue to understand where we are today. Many hon. Members will remember, as has been said, that the previous Speaker, the right hon. and noble Baroness Boothroyd, ruled initially that no MP should receive allowances without taking up their seat in Parliament. Her ruling was based on a clear principle that there should be no associate Members of Parliament. Indeed, after a meeting with the hon. Members for Mid-Ulster (Mr. McGuinness) and for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams) in 1997, she said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;I told them that they were in effect asking for associate membership of this House. Such a status does not exist.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 4 December 1997; Vol. 302, c. 487.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_75">The ruling made by the previous Speaker was subsequently overturned by Government motion in the House. The Leader of the House suggested that the motions are not about a point of principle but simply about the timing of the reinstatement of allowances and the extension of funding. I believe that it is still a point of principle that we should be debating in the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_76">It is a point of principle for my party that republican Members should not be treated any better, or any differently from any other Member of Parliament. We reject Government attempts to produce a pick-and-mix Parliament with &#224; la carte allowances for Members who refuse to take their seats in Westminster. We all know that the job of being a Member of Parliament has many facets, including dealing with constituency cases, providing advice and assistance to constituents, and taking up issues on their behalf with the Government and other agencies. Some of that work can be done without Members&#039; attendance in the Chamber and participation in debates. However, Members who do not come to the House will not fulfil that role properly because a key way in which constituency cases can be raised with other Members is through written and oral parliamentary questions, points of order and participation in debates. The job of being an MP goes further, and includes contributing to debates in the House on issues of the day and debating, scrutinising and commenting on legislation. That includes the ability to try to amend legislation, not to mention the job of holding the Government to account for the impact of their policies on the country as a whole and on individual constituencies.

 Is it not the case that, despite the promises that the hon.

Members of Parliament who do not take their seats in the House cannot participate in debates, ask questions or undertake other aspects of membership of the House, and they cannot participate in debates on legislation specifically affecting Northern Ireland. They have no voice when legislation affecting Northern Ireland is going through the House, and no opportunity to amend that legislation in Standing Committee.

<a name="stpa_79">I am interested in the number of interventions that I have received from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. In his alter ego as the Secretary of State for Wales, he appears to accept that concept of the nature of elected representation. I draw hon. Members&#039; attention to clause 23 of the Government of Wales Bill, which is going through the House. The clause makes it clear that no Member of the Welsh Assembly is entitled to claim any allowances until such time as they have taken the oath. Indeed, it goes further. If an elected Welsh Assembly Member does not take the oath within two months of being elected, they automatically forfeit their seat. I entirely accept that the Welsh Assembly is a different body from Parliament, but the principle remains the same. Why do the Government believe that elected representatives in the Welsh Assembly should not have allowances until they fulfil all their roles, whereas elected representatives at Westminster should be treated differently?

However, the motions before the House go further than the previous position. As was debated through interventions in the speech of the Leader of the House, Ministers are not simply seeking to reinstate the position that they introduced and were subsequently forced to suspend. They are seeking to go further and create a new allowance for political parties whose Members do not take their seats in the House.

<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 918</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on the other hand not Short money. That position is even more indefensible for the Government. Short money is not available to Members who have not sworn the oath because it is designed to offer assistance with    parliamentary duties, specifically to assist an Opposition party in carrying out its parliamentary business. Why should a party that does not attend the House, does not vote, does not debate in the Chamber&#151;in other words, that does not engage in or undertake parliamentary duties or parliamentary business&#151;receive additional money to support its parliamentary activities? Surely that, more than anything else, confirms that this is not just a matter of parliamentary business.

<a name="stpa_84">The Leader of the House made a number of references to the money, saying variously that it was Short money and that it was not Short money. I note that in his remarks he did not respond to my direct question about the definition of &quot;representative business&quot;. As the House of Commons Library has made clear, the term has not been used previously in parliamentary procedure. The motion would bring about more than the extension of Short money. It would create a new parliamentary allowance.

<a name="stpa_85">The Leader of the House should have recognised from the tone of the debate that if the Government&#039;s intention is to extend Short money to parties whose Members do not take their seats in the House, they should withdraw the motion and introduce a separate motion which makes that clear. The wording before us is not about Short money. It is about money that is available for representative business. It is a new allowance. I do not believe that parties whose Members are not participating fully in the House in all their duties as individual elected representatives and also as a party in opposition to the Government deserve to receive funding related to parliamentary activities or, more widely, a new allowance.

 My hon. Friend&#039;s recollection is correct. The Leader of the House was challenged to give a clear definition.

 The hon. Gentleman has made a good point. The acts in which people were involved in the troubles in Northern Ireland were frankly revolting. I share the same disgust as the hon. Gentleman and other Democratic Unionist party Members at the atrocities, whether they were committed by loyalists or republicans, but my point is that many individuals have made the intellectual transition from terrorism to democratic politics. However, I am not convinced that they have has exercised sufficient authority sufficiently far down the chain to ensure that everybody who has been involved, and is involved, is operating under the same set of principles as they are. That is the difficulty.

<a name="stpa_97">My right hon. Friend the Leader of the House made a good job of a difficult task, and I have some sympathy with him. Having on sat on that Front Bench for 26 hours trying to defend the Disqualifications Bill, I know precisely how difficult it can be to defend such provisions in the House. However, the one thing that he has not succeeded in doing to my satisfaction, and I suspect to that of many others, is explaining what the Short money amounts to in terms of representative duties. He made a stab at it, but it was probably not the best effort that he has ever made, as I think that he would be the first to admit. Perhaps the Minister could think about that before he winds up.

<a name="60208-16_para11">
<a name="stpa_98">It would be helpful if the Northern Ireland Office or one of the House authorities were to issue some restrictions on what that money can be spent on. As the hon.

If it does not play by the rules in elections, as we know is sometimes the case, it is conceivable that it would not play by rules that seem to be fairly ambiguous.

 I welcome the publication last week of the latest report by the Independent Monitoring Commission. While it gives us reasons to feel encouraged in relation to the activities of the IRA, I also recognise, in the words of the IMC, that

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-16_para14">
<a name="stpa_101">Some aspects of the report still give us concern. I remain deeply worried by the level of involvement of IRA members in organised crime. The right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) read out some salient sections of the report. We know that the IRA is well placed to run fairly sophisticated organised crime operations. That is very damaging to Northern Ireland. Any and all paramilitary activity is a threat to democracy, human rights and the rule of law. All members of society, including republicans, have a duty to co-operate with the legal authorities to ensure that the criminal justice system can do its job. The IRA must now clearly demonstrate that the rule of law will prevail in all areas of life, not only in relation to paramilitary violence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-16_para15">
<a name="stpa_102">Sometimes the Government seem rather schizophrenic in their approach towards terrorism. They are sympathetic and cut some slack to the IRA and other paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland, while almost in the same breath they introduce regulations and make tough-sounding speeches here about terrorist organisations that do not derive from the troubles of the Province.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-16_para16">
<a name="stpa_103">I am disturbed by the fact that the practice of exiling has not ceased. Exiling was specifically mentioned in paragraph 13 of the joint declaration. If the people of Northern Ireland are to be confident that the IRA is standing by its commitment last August that all paramilitary activity is to cease, that unacceptable practice must end.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-16_para17">
<a name="stpa_104">Nevertheless, the IMC&#039;s assessment of the current extent of IRA activity gives us some reasons to be encouraged. The commission has found no evidence of authorised paramilitary assaults or of recruitment for paramilitary purposes. Those are very significant developments. I particularly welcome the fact that the IMC is of the firm view that the IRA&#039;s leadership has taken the decision to end the armed campaign and pursue a political course. There will be suspicion and cynicism about that assessment, but I judge that the IMC has no particular reason to be falsely optimistic, and therefore find it plausible.

 I am following the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument closely. He is praying in aid the IMC report, as did the Leader of the House. Would he care to comment on the Government&#039;s decision following the previous IMC report, which explicitly stated that the Progressive Unionist party should not continue to receive money? The Government chose to ignore that recommendation by the IMC, yet now they and the hon. Gentleman are relying on its report in support of their argument.

 The hon. Gentleman may want to expand on that point should he catch your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker. It did strike me as somewhat curious that the Government were willing to accept some aspects of the IMC&#039;s report and ignore others. That makes it rather difficult for those of us who have been sympathetic and, in my view, constructive for nine years in trying to support the Government on Northern Ireland business.

 This is not a question of a distinction without a difference. Short money is not available to Sinn Fein because it is disqualified. We are discussing a new allowance, but people are going down the Government&#039;s route of conflating the two. It is new money, and it is exclusive to Sinn Fein.

I am keen for the Secretary of State to explain what kind of parliamentary business will be undertaken by Members who choose not to take their seats. In that regard, can he respond to four specific questions? First, how much money will it be? Secondly, for what purposes does he expect it to be used? Thirdly, how will the system be monitored to ensure that any expenditure will truly be for parliamentary business, not constituency matters, which are already accounted for? Fourthly, what will any organisation using such money be able to do that will not be permitted for those of us using Short money?

<a name="stpa_111">The Secretary of State might say that those points were covered by the Leader of the House. I am sorry to say, however, that the Leader of the House&#039;s responses were somewhat ambiguous. My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and I sought clarification and confirmation that there was nothing that a recipient of the new Hoon money could do that recipients of Short money were banned or prevented from doing. The Leader of the House&#039;s response was rather confusing. Fortunately, he twice said specifically that nothing could be done with the new money that would not be permitted for those who receive Short money. The Secretary of State must pin the matter down, however, because the record will be analysed in detail when challenges are made, if, for example, in this case, Sinn Fein is suspected of abusing the money.

<p><a name="st_197"><a name="60208-17_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I hope that I can help the hon. Gentleman and the House. As to how much money will be available, it is a little over &#163;84,000. It is not, as it were, a case of the House taking a wheelbarrow to give the money to Sinn Fein&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It will benefit the House if I can explain the matter. Sinn Fein can only claim such money against proper receipted applications, in line, as the motion says, with the rules set out in paragraphs (1) and (2), exclusively in terms of representation and the Short motion passed by the House on 26 May 1999. As to what the money will be for, it will be for research and that kind of activity. On how it will be monitored, it would be helpful if the chief accounting officer issued guidance in due course, which I would welcome, as is proper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_112">I am sorry that this intervention is a little long, Madam Deputy Speaker, but the hon. Gentleman will be aware that in recent times there has been a lot of conflict, which has included a former Leader of the Opposition, about Short money. That is why the rules have had to be clarified. That is also why it is important that the House has proper guidance and proper rules properly enforced. Sinn Fein Members of Parliament

 I found that intervention quite helpful. I wish that the Leader of the House had been as clear as the Secretary of State is being. I found the Leader of the House&#039;s comments somewhat confusing, and they led to concern, which, to some extent, the Secretary of State is allaying, about the specific implementation of the new money.
</p>





<p><a name="st_199"><a name="60208-17_spnew10"><b> Andrew Mackinlay: </b> 
 I find the hon. Gentleman extraordinarily naive. If he reads the <i>Official Report</i> tomorrow, he will see that the Secretary of State conflated a couple of things. The only relevance of the Short money, under paragraph (2) of the motion, is in relation to the formula for calculating the amount of money, in terms of numbers of Members of Parliament and numbers of votes. There is no cross-reference whatever in the motion to Short money. There cannot be; it is like trying to merge the rules of rugby with soccer.

I would certainly entertain the prospect of creating some kind of fund that created parity between political parties. It was therefore valid to raise the specific concern about the mechanics. The Secretary of State has some way to go to define exactly how allocation of the Hoon money will be implemented. What makes people nervous is the concern that any assurance given here will not hold water out there, and that this debate will provide no recourse or insurance policy in relation to any legal challenge about the abuse in spirit of this money. The Secretary of State must reassure the Chamber that there is not a way around the intended spirit of the proposals.

The application of the Short money model to Members who have not taken their seats is for representative purposes. The Short money resolution&#151;this is an important point, and the House should take a bit of care over it&#151;does not define parliamentary business any more than the motion defines representative business.

 Indeed, and we need to be careful.

<p><a name="st_223"><a name="60208-18_spnew13"><b> Mr. David Anderson  (Blaydon) (Lab):</b> 
 This cannot simply be an academic debate, or one about bureaucracy. We cannot ignore the background of a society that has been at war with itself for the past 40 years. In most debates it is possible to say to others, &quot;I understand where you&#039;re coming from.&quot; We all know that that is impossible in this situation. A community divided by centuries of hate, bigotry and discrimination has no parallels for most of us. A world in which it is still normal to build physical barriers even higher between communities is alien to most of us. And an attitude to life and death that has resulted in horrific acts being committed in the name of God and country&#151;from every possible angle&#151;is incomprehensible to most of us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_124">That incomprehension led the vast majority of people in Great Britain to turn their backs on the issues of Northern Ireland; they became just another problem in just another remote part of the world. They were shrugged off with the question, &quot;What else can you expect?&quot; They were easy to ignore; for most people, that simply meant turning the telly off or turning it over. But we in Great Britain were wrong to ignore the problem, and we were wrong to pretend that it was just some local issue. We should always remember that if the killings in Northern Ireland had been repeated on a proportional basis across Great Britain, more than 100,000 people would have been killed. I do not believe that anyone would have ignored that situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_125">It is a matter of some note that we have moved on from the sad, bad days of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, when some of us believed that we would never see a resolution. Even worse, many people did not seem to care whether we did or not. Thankfully, owing in no small measure to the courage of many people in the House and beyond, things have changed. The situation has improved, and if we do not falter, things can get better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_126">That did not happen by chance. It happened because people were prepared to take risks for peace. John Major took risks for peace by meeting terrorists while they were publicly banned. Mo Mowlam took risks for peace by going into the Maze prison to face those who had been at the forefront of the terror campaign. Our Prime Minister took risks for peace by refusing to take no for an answer from anyone. Politicians from all sides have taken risks in an attempt to move forward, when stepping back into their comfort zone would have been much easier.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_127">Beneath all that high-level risk taking, thousands of ordinary people were also saying, &quot;We&#039;ve had enough.&quot; The convenor of Unison in Northern Ireland, despite his misgivings and those of his community, stood up and led the call to vote yes to the Belfast agreement. The people working in the accident and emergency unit of the Mater hospital in Belfast refused to be intimidated by gun-wielding thugs trying out a novel way to beat the NHS waiting lists. People right across the community have accepted changes to their way of life that no one would have believed possible. From the changes to the police service to the changes to the Irish constitution, people have taken risks for peace.

<a name="stpa_128">People have done just about all that they have been asked to do, and now we are being asked again to take a hard decision. It is clear from the debate today that some people will never agree to recognise the reason for paying public money to any party that refuses to sit in this Chamber. I concede that others will question whether real progress has been made in the past year to justify the reinstatement of the allowances. I also accept that some will question the validity of the IMC recommendations. I know that many people not only question the logic of reinstating the allowance but have reservations about the Short money, and, like many other hon. Members, I look forward to hearing what the Secretary of State has to say about that.

<p>
<a name="60208-18_para15">
<a name="stpa_129">There is a logic to these proposals, however. Last year, the IMC recommended that the allowances be withdrawn, and the House agreed to do that. Now it is recommending that they should be reinstated, and we should listen to that argument carefully.

 For the hon. Gentleman&#039;s assistance, I should like to correct a little detail. The IMC recommended last year that Sinn Fein&#039;s allowance be withdrawn for a year. Why in heaven&#039;s name is the hon. Gentleman trying to encourage people to vote for the motion to backdate the allowances to Sinn Fein to 1 November, which would actually undo the recommendation of the IMC?
</p>





<p><a name="st_225"><a name="60208-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Anderson: </b> 
 I am doing so because this is the only motion before us today. There is not a motion on the principles behind these issues, although many hon. Members have spoken today as though there were. However, this is the motion before us, and I believe that it represents the best way forward. This is a big ask, and I understand why some hon. Members believe that it is too big. However, we still need to reach the goal of real peace, which we have not yet achieved. So many people have reached out before us to do this, and we should not stop that endeavour.

<a name="60208-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_130">I said earlier that we cannot pretend to understand the reality of Northern Ireland if we have not been a direct part of it. The closest I have ever been to a community at war with itself was in the aftermath of the miners strike, when communities were divided and respect for law and order had broken down; sometimes, members of the same family still do not speak to each other. However, falling out with each other, blaming each other and fighting with each other did not bring back a single job or prevent a single pit from closing. Nor did it save a single family from breaking up because of the intolerable pressures that ordinary men and women had to face.

<a name="60208-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_131">I respect the fact that the issues that we faced in the coalfields up and down Britain were a quantum leap away from what happened in Northern Ireland, but the link was the men and women facing enormous challenges, usually way beyond their control. Ultimately, we have to accept that all the hate, pent-up resentment and deep-rooted sorrow in the world will not bring back one lost soul or help one child to make up for the loss of a parent. Neither will it help any community to rebuild its broken heart.

<a name="60208-19_para2">

 Many of the matters before us have already been covered by the various hon. Members who have spoken today, and I shall not make a long speech, because many others want to make a contribution to the debate. It is only right that they should have the opportunity to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_133">The people of Northern Ireland deeply resent any suggestion that those who are motivated to keep this motion from going through are motivated by hatred of the people involved and by a refusal to face facts. All of us have had to face facts, but the suggestion has been made by the Secretary of State and the Leader of the House that if we do not pass the motion and there is retaliation, we should be responsible for what happens. We should not. Every Member of the House has the right to state their view. If people want to impute principles to their opponents, they can do so, but the fact is that the people of Northern Ireland do want peace. The greatest sacrifices for peace have been made by the population whom my colleagues and I represent in this House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_134">Who gave their sons to be murdered by the terrorists? Who supplied the police officers and the police force? Who supplied the Army volunteers? The vast majority came from the Protestant and Unionist community. I know that some very famous families came from the Roman Catholic community, and that they too suffered. The IRA refused to allow the body of a constituent of mine whom they had blown up to be buried in his own church graveyard. His body had to be carried to a graveyard six miles away, because the IRA said, &quot;If you bury him in his own graveyard, we&#039;ll dig him up. We will not allow him to be buried there.&quot; These are things that people have suffered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_135">Let the House get this point in its mind today. There is the inkling&#151;the Secretary of State and the Leader of the House seemed to suggest as much&#151;that if we do not take this step, there will be a dread result. However, the dread result of taking this step will be this: there will be another concession, and the same argument will be used. After that a further concession will be made and the same argument will be used again, until the cause is surrendered and the people of Northern Ireland have lost their way completely&#151;not through their own fault, but because they were misled. The Secretary of State needs to think very carefully about what he is doing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_136">The suggestion that those who oppose such moves are hindering peace is the suggestion of someone who is not facing facts. We do not oppose peace. Every one of my Members has been attacked. Every one of them has been subjected to an attempted killing, and some of them have been beaten up. My own wife, who was a member of Belfast council, was beaten up and stoned in the street. I know what they have been through. We in this House need to ask ourselves, &quot;What about the people who are the real carriers of the peace banner? What do they think about this?&quot; I certainly know from my constituency experience what the victims feel. They feel that this is a bribe to IRA&#151;pay money, blood money.

<a name="stpa_137">In this regard, I think in particular of what happened to my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea). I confronted one of the leaders of the IRA in the Assembly when he was speaking about the support of children&#151;about how we should all love our children&#151;and I said, &quot;What did you do when you were the IRA commander in Londonderry? You sent your gunmen to my friend&#039;s home on a Sunday night, after he had finished his service, and when his five children were in bed you ordered that the bullets be put through the bedroom.&quot; Forty-six bullets were put through that bedroom in my hon.

 The right hon. Gentleman is obviously very experienced in these matters and has lots of meetings with the Prime Minister.

 Yes, my conviction is that certain things were done at a certain time, which my party had no connection with at all.

<p><a name="st_229"><a name="60208-19_spnew5"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend may want to respond to the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) on the assumption that she has not received the Labour party&#039;s briefing note for the debate. It contains a bullet point that states that the lifting of financial sanctions formed part of the negotiations with Sinn Fein that ultimately led to the 28 July statement ending the armed campaign and to the decommissioning of weapons. Clearly, the sanctions formed part of the deal done by the Prime Minister and his colleagues to get a statement from Sinn Fein-IRA.

<p><a name="st_230"><a name="60208-19_spnew6"><b> Rev. Ian Paisley: </b>

<a name="stpa_141">None of the assets from those crimes have ever been recovered.

I became aware of it just before business questions last week, when a Whip phoned me about it, and I am grateful to her for her kindness in drawing it to my attention. I realised subsequently that the debate involved not only the restoration of moneys that had been removed as a sanction but the new allowance.

<a name="stpa_161">My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North and I may disagree in many of our views about Northern Ireland, but given his intervention we may agree on one narrow point&#151;that there could be a case for state funding for political parties. We have all debated that and we hold various views. However, the allowance in motion 3 creates state funding for one political party to the exclusion of all others&#151;that is what I find unacceptable&#151;and it does so because the rules are written exclusively for that political party.

 My hon. Friend is slightly missing the point. The money is for representational purposes. Representation is not just what we say in the Chamber; it is also involves representations directly to Ministers, meetings, briefings and all the other things that go with it, as he well knows.
</p>





<p><a name="st_241"><a name="60208-21_spnew1"><b> Andrew Mackinlay: </b> 
 I do not think that my hon. Friend and I disagree about that matter. However, the rules that will apply if motion 3 is passed have been announced, but they relate only to Sinn Fein. The Conservative party, the Liberal party, the SDLP, the DUP and the SNP must adhere to different, much narrower criteria.

<a name="60208-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_162">My hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp) pressed the Leader of the House&#151;if I could have the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s attention for a moment&#151;to define the parameters of Short money, because he criticised the Conservatives&#039; stewardship of it. The Conservatives said that it was inappropriate and quite wrong to accuse them of abusing Short money. My hon. Friend has asked the Leader of the House to clarify the parameters, and they have been clearly defined and relate to exclusively to parliamentary business. The provision did not extend to representative business. That shows the difference that is being made for Sinn Fein.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_163">We must understand the nature of Sinn Fein, which believes that its writ runs like a seamless robe throughout Ireland. Let us take the position of the Leader of the House, who said that Sinn Fein might have a spokesperson on a certain matter. It is not possible, either for Sinn Fein or an accounting officer, to distinguish whether that spokesperson is, for example, talking about transportation in Northern Ireland, or in Monaghan or Cavan or elsewhere. Such things cannot be allocated and put into watertight compartments. That is the nature of Sinn Fein. I am not laying that down; it is part of the party&#039;s own rules and ethos that it believes that there is no such thing as Northern Ireland and that its spokespeople are entitled to talk about all 32 counties.
</p>





<p><a name="st_242"><a name="60208-21_spnew2"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is in danger of burying himself in the detail of his own argument. Surely, the issue is that if Short money is paid to a party it is used to prepare briefings and other information for meetings with Ministers and so on. Is he saying that the other parties that receive Short money do not use any of that information other than in the Chamber of the House of Commons or in its Committees? Do they not use it in meetings with Ministers and in respect of all the other issues? Why is he so obsessed with the detail?

 I want to move on, because, as I have indicated, there might be a case for the state funding of political parties, but that is a matter for debate on another occasion. That should be taken seriously and considered across the United Kingdom; or if hon. Members were persuaded that there are exceptional circumstances in Northern Ireland, we could debate it in the context of Northern Ireland. I am conscious of the fact that the UUP&#151;the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) is now its sole representative&#151;does not attract Short money, and neither she nor I would suggest that it should do so. However, there is a paradox, is there not? She comes and plays a full part in the House and contributes to the debate and so on, but the party that does not attend will get the new allowance.
</p>





<p><a name="st_246"><a name="60208-21_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a very fair point. Will he consider a point that is at the heart of the distinction between parliamentary and representative activities, about which he is quite properly concerned? Is it permissible for the Leader of the Opposition, for example, to make a speech outside Parliament&#151;he has been doing that quite properly in recent weeks&#151;that was written and drafted by a researcher who was funded by Short money? <i>[Interruption.]</i> Of course it is permissible. Conservative Members have just confirmed that. However, the speech must be made as part of the job of Leader of the Opposition. My hon.

 It strikes me that we are trying to define something that we do not need to worry about today. The principle surely is that Short money cannot be spent on anything for which there are restrictions. Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that, as long as the Hoon money is very clearly defined, that will resolve that issue? Does the hon. Gentleman also accept that one of the problems with the contribution of the Leader of the House was that he was incredibly focused on Sinn Fein? As the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, the proposal sets a precedent. Will he be looking, as I am, for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to confirm that he really grasps that this about a principle and not specifically about Sinn Fein?

<a name="60208-21_para4">

Has he consulted the House authorities and elected officials such as Mr.    Speaker and members of the Administration Committee, who run our finances? Which political parties have been consulted? It is a matter of courtesy, common sense and right that there should be full consultation, as that might enable us to set the ground rules for what the Conservative party and other parties can spend the money on? If there is a facility for Sinn Fein, ground rules would also make clear what it can spend the money on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_167">The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland invited me to consider the example of the Leader of the Opposition. Some of his speeches would be delivered here and others elsewhere. The point is that Sinn Fein cannot even remotely do that; there is no fig leaf to suggest that it could. In fairness&#151;I use the word &quot;fairness&quot; for want of a better term&#151;to Sinn Fein, it will not be able to demonstrate in its accounts how the money is identified as Westminster money. That cannot be done. Its policies form a seamless robe because its mandate is pan-Ireland. It simply does not carve things up into Northern Ireland matters.

<p><a name="st_250"><a name="60208-21_spnew10"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson: </b> 
 May we return to what will happen as a result of the Government&#039;s largesse? There are three Members on the SDLP Bench behind the hon. Gentleman&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> There are now three. The proposal will not affect my colleagues and I because there is a very small swing vote between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party, but the funds for those three Members will be tied to their work for the Committees of the House and in the Chamber. Sinn Fein&#039;s target, on the other hand, will be to take the seats of those three hon. Gentlemen.

I acknowledge that unreservedly, as well as the fact that SDLP Members have bravely borne the problems of many years, along with other elected representatives. They follow a tradition in the House of being not only proud nationalists, but good parliamentarians. If you glance up at the back of our Chamber, Madam Deputy Speaker, you will see a red crest. I salute it every day because it represents Willie Redmond, a proud nationalist Member of Parliament. He was the oldest officer killed on the western front and a Member of the House of Commons who attended the House of Commons. The hon.

Enormous advances have been made and I am proud of the changes that have come about in Northern Ireland. I have a selfish interest in Northern Ireland because my wife and I intend to retire there&#151;a long time from now, I must add, and after many more elections. The place has transformed and we need to talk it up because, in many respects, it is one of the safest places in western Europe, as well as one of the most beautiful. It has a lot going for it and I am proud of what has been achieved. However, the suggestion that the peace process is predicated on the new allowance for Sinn Fein stretches credulity to the limit.

The peace process has a long way to go. I wish the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland well. He knows that.

You tell us you are embracing democracy and renouncing terrorism. You tell us that you wish to be treated on all fours with other politicians.

I do not believe that anything changed between her decision and the House coming to its decision, but there we are.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_180">Motion 4 on the Order Paper is the more straightforward of the two, as it deals with the question of restoring allowances removed in a motion on sanctions introduced in the House last March. That motion was tabled after a report by the Independent Monitoring Commission, and it extended the sanctions recommended by the IMC following the withdrawal of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 943</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Assembly allowances and the Northern bank robbery. The Social Democratic and Labour party has never agreed that the IMC should have a role, power or function in drawing up or recommending sanctions against particular parties. We agreed with the concept of a monitoring commission that would examine any issue of concern raised by any party or anyone else about paramilitary activities or about parties failing to honour their political commitments under the Good Friday agreement to work with the institutions in a proper way. We therefore agreed that a monitoring commission should have such a role.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_181">In 2003, we argued at Hillsborough that the two Governments should not include sanctions in the role of the monitoring commission. We suggested that it take a solution-based approach, not a sanction-based one in which parties would sue one another and cite one another&#039;s activities in an effort to achieve sanctions. In a solution-based approach, by contrast, all parties would have a collective responsibility to face up to problems, propose solutions and take shared responsibility for them. That position, however, was not accepted, so legislation was introduced in the House to establish the commission and give it the power of sanction. We did not support that legislation, because we believed that, yet again, the Governments were making a mistake in the management of the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_182">Whenever motions were introduced in the House to impose sanctions on Sinn Fein, SDLP Members abstained from voting. Similarly, we will abstain from the vote to lift those sanctions, not because we oppose the return of allowances to Sinn Fein so that its Members can work on behalf of their constituents but because that is consistent with our position that we are not in the business of sanctions. Our position has been misrepresented by Sinn Fein, who keep saying that we supported a power of sanction for the IMC. We did not do so, and that is why we will abstain from the vote on motion 4. I will not do anything to discourage hon. Members on both sides of the House from going into the   Lobby to support that motion, because it aims to ensure that Sinn Fein Members can conduct their representative business on behalf of their constituents. The hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) spoke about the way in which hon. Members conduct their business, and said that the allowances that we are paid do not all relate to what we do in the Chamber but to the meetings, correspondence and activities in which we engage. That will be covered by motion 4 on an equal basis with all other hon. Members in the House. The hon. Gentleman made a good argument for motion 4, but in his intervention he was not making a relevant argument in respect of motion 3.

I will make my arguments against Sinn Fein&#039;s manifesto and their representative quality at elections, but once the electorate has decided, we should all have the allowance available to us for our representative business.

We all knew that. What we did not know was that there was a bonus ball in the draw&#151;that Sinn Fein Members would get the Short money too.

They said that they would send me what there is, and not much came to me in the post. There is a genuine need for the House to re-examine funding for Opposition parties. That could take in representative work, as well as parliamentary work, so that all of us could look equally at the distinction between parliamentary work and representative work.

 I shall be brief, as I know that other right hon. and hon. Members want to speak. I find myself in agreement with some of what the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) has said. I make a distinction between the motion dealing with Short money&#151;&quot;Hoon&quot; money&#151;and that dealing with allowances. I will not support the former&#151;indeed, I will oppose it&#151;for the reason pointed out by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) and others. There is a distinction, as it is currently presented to the House, between the benefits paid to the traditional Opposition parties and to Sinn Fein. I listened carefully to what the Leader of the House said, but I am also conscious of the wording of the 1975 resolution.

However, we are emphasising the gap&#151;inevitably, I think&#151;by using different language. Where language is different, it normally attracts different interpretations. The risk of accepting the Short money-Hoon money motion is that there will be a real disadvantage to the traditional Opposition parties, and a real and unfair benefit to Sinn Fein.

Therefore my suggestion to the Government&#151;it is similar to the points made by the hon. Members for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) and for Foyle&#151;is that the motion should be withdrawn and replaced by one that covers the entirety of such allowances payable to all Opposition parties. In that way, we can be sure that there is no differentiation of language and no risk of a different interpretation.

<a name="stpa_252">The proposal to invent a new allowance for Sinn Fein alone is intolerable. Other parties receive Short money for the work that they do in the House, but I do not believe that Sinn Fein has any intention of using the funds that it will receive for that purpose. It will use them as part of its project of capturing the whole of the nationalist vote in Northern Ireland. The Government are effectively making a donation solely to republicans, while the IRA retains the proceeds of its ongoing crime. The motions stand alongside the Government&#039;s discredited on-the-runs Bill as the most bizarre and crazy proposals ever to be introduced in the House, and I hope that they meet the same end.

<a name="stpa_253">I want to bring a slightly different perspective to the debate: the situation as seen through the eyes of most of the people whom I represent in Northampton. The House must have a connection with them, but I have heard little about that connection during the debate. I shall explain the point that I am trying to make by referring to one of my predecessors, Charles Bradlaugh. He stood for election three times in Northampton before he was successful, and when he was elected, he refused to take the Oath. He did that on four occasions and was expelled each time, but the people of Northampton returned him again and again until the Speaker agreed to allow him to make an affirmation and become a Member.

<a name="stpa_254">Charles Bradlaugh acted honourably, suffered for his principles and was willing to pay the price. A comparison of his behaviour and that of Sinn Fein is unfavourable to the party. Bradlaugh stood by his principles, but Sinn Fein has lied about its activities. It continues to live off the proceeds of crime, yet expects to take the British taxpayers&#039; money into the bargain. The majority of people in Northampton, South find that totally unacceptable and will not understand the Government&#039;s actions, especially with regard to Short money. The truth of the matter is that Sinn Fein says that it will not take part in this Parliament with a sovereign at its head, but is prepared to take the sovereign&#039;s money with her face printed all over it. Do not tell me that that is honourable, or that the people whom we represent will accept that point of view.

 We have had a vigorous debate in which a large number of hon. Members on both sides of the House participated. What came through in particular was the widespread concern expressed from all quarters about the Government&#039;s proposed innovation of a new bespoke parliamentary allowance, as the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) described it, designed to fit Sinn Fein, which would parallel Short money. I noted the comments made at different stages by the hon. Members for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) and for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay), and the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who, along with hon. Members from various Opposition parties, questioned the appropriateness of the measure. It was ironic that the Government&#039;s chief support came from an unlikely alliance of the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), in his new found vocation as a cheerleader for the Treasury Bench, and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), in that fine English tradition of the radical aristocrat who has appeared in our politics from time to time through the centuries.

<p>
<a name="60208-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_257">The Government&#039;s case rests on two assertions, each primarily concerned with Northern Ireland rather than with the notion of the duties and rights of membership of the House. The first limb of their argument is that the restoration of allowances was a recommendation of the most recent report of the Independent Monitoring Commission, but that argument can be used to defend only motion 4, relating to the restoration of suspended allowances. Before rushing to approve that motion, the House will want to weigh up the positive comments that the IMC made about the republican movement alongside the ugly realities that it also reported&#151;the continuing involvement of senior members of the republican movement in serious organised crime, the persistence of spying and intelligence gathering, the scandal that people are still exiled from Northern Ireland and afraid to return home because of paramilitary threats, and the use by republicans of community restorative justice as an instrument to ensure paramilitary control over nationalist and republican communities.

<p><a name="st_305"><a name="60208-28_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right. My memory of the IMC&#039;s terms of reference is that its remit on recommending sanctions relates only to Northern Ireland institutions, not to institutions at Westminster. If my memory is correct, the IMC explicitly pointed out in the original report, in which it recommended the suspension of Stormont allowances about a year ago, that its remit did not extend to Westminster and declined to make recommendations in that respect.

<a name="stpa_262">The irony is that Sinn Fein, of all parties, is not short of cash. As the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) said, the amounts that we are debating today are small change in the context of the profits that have been made from a succession of robberies and other crimes over the years. The Government defend these motions on the ground that they will help to sustain the political process, but I fear that they will have the opposite effect. Suspicion about the Government&#039;s motives will breed along with deals that may have been done behind closed doors. As the hon. Member for Foyle said, there has been too much about the political process that has been about fixing things to suit Sinn Fein. It is time that we had less ambiguity and greater transparency if we are to have a chance of building trust and confidence, which presently is at a low level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_263">The debate has focused largely on motion 3 concerning the new allowance. There was widespread concern in the House about the ambiguity over what the money is supposed to be used for. There would have been some logic to the Government&#039;s position had Ministers come forward with a motion to say that from now on allowances paid to all parties would be to support them in their representative functions. I think that the hon. Member for Thurrock made that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_264">If motion 3 is passed, we shall be in a position where a party with elected Members has a choice. Those Members can take up their seats, claim Short money but accept the limitation that those payments must be limited to support for parliamentary activities, or they can decline to take up their seats and obtain money from the new allowance to support all representative activities. It seems that a difference in the type of activity that would qualify for funding is inherent in the difference in the language that is used to describe Short money and that used to set out the terms of the motion.

<a name="60208-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_265">My quarrel with the Government&#039;s supporters, particularly my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, concerns the rights and duties of a Member of Parliament. I accept completely my right hon. and learned Friend&#039;s assertion that the privilege of election confers certain rights on us, but those rights are accompanied by responsibilities. The very fact that rules exist in the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament making payment and allowances conditional on Members taking their seats reflects the fact that to take a seat and participate is seen as the central function and duty of an elected Member in any legislature. We should not forget that until a mere five years ago that was the tradition or belief on which we acted in the House.

 Far be it for me to try to represent the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), but the burden of his argument is not that those Members are elected and refuse to take up those duties but that they are elected on the conviction that they will not take their seats in the House. There is a difference.

<p><a name="st_311"><a name="60208-28_spnew7"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman and I differ on this point, but I simply do not believe that one can remove from the duty of membership of a legislature the notion of taking one&#039;s seat and participating. It is integral to the role of an elected representative, and it is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 963</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>an abdication of responsibility to avoid taking that course of action. We delude ourselves about the nature of the responsibility of elected representatives if we try to create two classes of MPs as the motions propose.

<a name="60208-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_266">It is not just a matter of the Oath, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham would agree. If it were a matter of the exact words that we were asked to swear or affirm at the beginning of a Parliament, he would have a stronger case. I note, however, that the Oath was not in the end an obstacle for De Valera and his Fianna Fail colleagues, and did not prevent them from taking their seats in the Dail in the late 1920s. I believe that Sinn Fein Members should take their seats. Although I loathe their politics, I would welcome their presence in the Chamber, where they could take part in debate and hold Ministers to account. Like my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), I have urged them to do so. As a number of Members have said, it is important that the House should remember that all of us, once elected, have a duty to represent the interests of constituents who did not vote for us or who did not vote at all, just as we represent people who voted for us or for our political party. The two thirds of the electorate in the five Sinn Fein-held parliamentary constituencies deserve to have their interests represented, just as much as the third who voted for Sinn   Fein candidates. The House of Commons deals with legislation on infrastructure for Newry; with environmental regulations affecting farmers in Fermanagh and Tyrone; and with education and training opportunities in west Belfast. It is an abdication of duty for those Members not to represent the interests of their constituents in the House.

This is a free vote for my party, but I hope that as many of my right hon. and hon. Friends as possible will join me in voting against both motions.

I note that the shadow Leader of the House&#151;and it has just been repeated by the shadow Northern Ireland spokesman&#151;is opposed in principle to that. I understand that. It is not to do with what was or was not in the IMC report. It is not to do with the level of paramilitary activity, criminality or violence.

In the two motions today I am asking the House to acknowledge that since then, and perhaps even encouraged a little by that suspension, the situation has changed dramatically for the better&#151;much better even than for the three years during which Sinn Fein Members were in receipt of House allowances. The House might want to bear that in mind.

<a name="stpa_285">The hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) asked several questions about allegations that he has made. I will look at <i>Hansard</i> before I consider my response.
</p>





<p><a name="st_319"><a name="60208-29_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Dunwoody </b> 
: I want to make a very simple point. Short money was granted by the House of Commons because Front Benchers were known not to have the money to support researchers. The research that they needed was in direct connection with their parliamentary duties. There has never been any doubt about that, and it does not need to be spelled out&#151;the House of Commons knew that that was what the money was for. This proposal is not only a negation, but a positive distortion, of that idea.
</p>

<p><a name="st_320"><a name="60208-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 As I said, this applies the Short money principle and model, with all its policing arrangements, to representative functions on behalf of Sinn Fein MPs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_286">The IMC report indicates that considerable organisational change is happening within the Provisional IRA to close down criminal operations. It states that there have been no IRA robberies or murders&#151;instances which occasioned the suspension of the allowances by the House in March last year. Yet&#151;I agree with the right hon. Member for North Antrim and the hon. Member for Belfast, East&#151;some members and former members are engaged in localised criminality, and we have to shut that down and demand that they cease it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_287">The report further points out the very difficult distinction to be drawn between organised and sanctioned criminality and that undertaken by individuals for personal gain. The distinction is difficult but the principle is not. Criminality is wrong, and the motions should in no way be taken as an indication of Government tolerance on that front.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_288">Amid the emotions engendered in this debate, it is easy, when viewing the situation through the prism of a highly selective reading of the report, to lose sight of how far we have come. I do not for one moment dismiss the genuine and serious concerns that many people have over these issues, but I ask the House to look at the whole picture and not to view progress through that restrictive prism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_289">That brings me, in conclusion, to a point that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House made in his opening comments&#151;this is, at heart, an issue of democracy. Do we want Sinn Fein representing its constituents and developing as a democratic party? Do we want Sinn Fein playing the fullest role that it can in the Palace of Westminster?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_290">The question before the House is whether we want to recognise that progress and encourage the republican movement further down the path of democracy. The transition from conflict to peace was always going to be tortuous&#151;international experience demonstrates that such transitions always are. The House has the opportunity tonight to vote for normalisation of politics&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> On behalf of all parties in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein included, the House, by supporting the motions, is voting for a Northern Ireland of democracy, hope, peace and stability.

For the sake of history, Mr. Speaker, would not it be best if Labour Members were arranged in a different sequence, with real socialists on one side, moderate socialists in the middle, and friends of the Prime Minister and friends of the next Prime Minister in some distinguishable array?

<p><a name="st_332"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Mr. Cawsey]</i></p>



<a name="time_29">
<a name="60208-32_time1"><h5>6.31 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_333"><a name="60208-32_spnew3"><b> Ann Clwyd  (Cynon Valley) (Lab):</b> 
 We all know why we are here tonight&#151;to discuss representative democracy in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_296">A hundred years ago, there was an important election for Britain. We in the Labour party are especially proud to be celebrating the centenary of the first meeting in the House of Commons of the Labour party as an organised body of MPs, held on 12 February 1906. The 29 Labour MPs&#151;all men&#151;were starting a parliamentary party that would shape the next century of British politics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_297">The Labour movement has its roots in the desire to improve the lives of the disadvantaged, the disfranchised and the dispossessed. The parliamentary Labour party has for 100 years been the voice of the many, not the few. It is fitting that we gather today in the Chamber to debate the achievements of those 100 years, for it is here and in the Lobbies that Labour MPs such as Keir Hardie spoke for, voted for and delivered the agenda of the first manifesto&#151;from universal suffrage, free health care, devolution and national insurance to the national minimum wage&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;]
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_298">Today we are a party of men and women, as committed to the ideals of social justice as ever, as committed to the interests of the many as ever, and as restless and demanding of a fairer, more just and prosperous society, where prosperity is created and used for the benefit of all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_299">In 1906 it must have seemed that the first Labour MPs represented the many in the very House of the few. Those men&#151;socialists, trade unionists, intellectuals and workers&#151;were elected on a franchise of only a quarter of the adult population, which excluded women, as well as many men without property or land or who did not pay high rent.
</p>





<p><a name="st_334"><a name="60208-32_spnew4"><b> Sir Gerald Kaufman  (Manchester, Gorton) (Lab):</b> 
 Is my right hon. Friend aware that among the Labour MPs at that first meeting was the Member for Gorton, John Hodge, who started a run of Labour Members of Parliament in that constituency? Apart from 1931 to 1935, there have been 100 years of continuous Labour representation in the Gorton constituency. Will my right hon. Friend pay tribute not only to John Hodge, the first ever Minister for Labour, but to the people of Gorton for remaining faithful to the Labour party?
</p>





<p><a name="st_335"><a name="60208-32_spnew5"><b> Ann Clwyd: </b> 
 I will indeed. My right hon. Friend is a Member for a constituency that has returned a Labour MP for 100 years&#151;along with my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Havard), whose constituency has also returned a Labour Member for 100 years. I congratulate all those constituencies on having the foresight to continue to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_300">As Labour&#039;s first manifesto put it,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60">&quot;The House of Commons is supposed to be the people&#039;s House, and yet the people are not there. Landlords, employers, lawyers, brewers and financiers are there in force. Why not Labour?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 978</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_301">It was a dozen years before universal male suffrage would be granted, and more than 20 before women were treated equally with men. Those Labour pioneers came to the House of Commons with a purpose. Although vastly outnumbered in our first Parliament they achieved a great deal, from reversing the Taff Vale judgment to strengthening the legal rights of trade unions in the Trade Disputes Act 1906. Labour was also successful that year in securing the Workmen&#039;s Compensation Act 1906, and the Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906. Confronting those two bread-and-butter issues&#151;school meals and compensation for industrial injury&#151;has made a real difference to all our constituents: a sign of things to come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_302">Another landmark achievement of the first parliamentary Labour party was the 1908 Right to Work Bill. Unemployment brought poverty and destitution, which helped to explain why, according to the Government&#039;s own admission, coroners blamed the 1906 deaths of 49 Londoners on starvation. The Bill sought to make local authorities responsible for finding work for the unemployed and for providing maintenance if no work could be found. It entailed both a deliberate national effort to tackle the trade cycle and the introduction into law of the revolutionary principle that work was a right. The Bill did not become law, but Labour&#039;s assertion of the importance of full employment and the dignity of work has been a central part of Labour&#039;s politics ever since.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_303">The first chair of the parliamentary Labour party was James Keir Hardie. Wisely, the chair of the parliamentary Labour party was also leader of the party. As the current chair of the parliamentary Labour party, I applaud and endorse that tradition. Keir Hardie led Labour for two years, and after ill health, was succeeded by Arthur Henderson&#151;a popular trade unionist and Wesleyan lay preacher&#151;who later became Labour&#039;s first Cabinet Minister. The MPs elected in 1906 included the first Labour Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_304">When the extension of the franchise came in 1918, Labour won the votes of many of those who now had a voice. Labour took office for the first time in 1924, and again in 1929. Then, after the long years in opposition of the 1930s, it joined the Churchill coalition in the second world war, before the 1945 election&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Hooray!&quot;]&#151;brought Labour&#039;s great landslide. The 1945 Government became one of the most reforming in British history&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear&quot;]&#151;with the national health service, national insurance, freedom for India, housing, the nationalisation of industry and the foundations of the welfare state.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_305">Sadly, the 1945 Government fell victim to the pressures that every reforming Governments now face. The natural desires to change further, reform more and become more radical are pressed against the need to balance resources, proceed gradually and manage change. These pressures&#151;&quot;the language of priorities&quot; to take a famous phrase&#151;have been at the root of Labour&#039;s failings as much as our reforming instincts have been at the heart of our successes. Despite our achievements in the 20th century, Labour was in power for only 23 years. The 21st century is getting better, and I am hopeful that we will beat our previous record by 2023.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_306">It is right that we mark our successes, but we should also think of all the times when we were not in office, when we were unable to help those who needed us, and unable to support the poorest and the most disadvantaged. We should think why we were not in power more often, and how we can make sure that we are even more successful in the next 100 years than in the last 100 years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_307">Some 100 years on from the founding of the parliamentary Labour party, we celebrate the achievement of those pioneers and their legacy. The Labour party that evolved into a party of government created the NHS, brought education for all and built the welfare state. It was those pioneers that built the party that more recent heroes, such as Attlee, Bevan, Bevin, Gaitskell, Foot and Castle, would join. It was these pioneers who built the party that our current parliamentarians know&#151;the party that introduced the minimum wage, introduced tax credits, gave more rights to workers and to unions, extended rights for parents, gave a savings account to every child and enacted the biggest hospital programme in Britain&#039;s history.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_308">Today we mark the Labour pioneers, all their successors who served their constituencies as Labour Members of Parliament in the last century in this Chamber, and the laws that they enacted. They served their country well.

<p><a name="st_336"><a name="60208-33_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Bridget Prentice): </b> 
 Sometimes one comes to an Adjournment debate when only the initiator of the debate and the Minister are in the House. I am not quite sure what has happened this evening. Furthermore, the Minister often has to reject the views expressed by the debate&#039;s initiator. I can say that, for once, that will not be the case tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_310">I can also say that this Labour Government absolutely agree with all my right hon. Friend&#039;s complimentary and inspiring comments about the Labour party in Parliament over the past 100 years. As she said, in the 1906 election the Labour Representation Committee fielded some 50 candidates and, exactly 100 years ago this Sunday, the 29 successful LRC MPs filed into Committee Room 12 to meet for the first time as the parliamentary Labour party. Their aims were straightforward. As Labour&#039;s manifesto for 1906 said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">&quot;This election is to decide whether or not Labour is to be fairly represented in Parliament.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_311">They were all men at that time; women had not been granted the right to vote. It was only because Labour campaigned for that right that women eventually achieved it. It is fitting that the Adjournment debate was introduced tonight by a woman and that it is now being replied to by one. That is what this party&#151;our party, whether in Parliament or outside&#151;has always and, I hope, will always be about: helping people to realise their potential regardless of their background. When those men met 100 years ago this weekend, they realised that Parliament and, beyond that, forming a Government were the best way to reach those ambitions. We might not always succeed and we might 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 980</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>sometimes try to reach beyond what we can achieve, but this party&#151;the Labour party&#151;on behalf of the people, will always try to enact the commitment that people give to us when they vote Labour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_312">So, 1906 was a vital year for the Labour party and Parliament, but there was a good deal else going on at the time, too. For instance, the <i>Daily Mail</i> tried to pour scorn&#151;old habits die hard&#151;on women campaigning for the vote by dismissively dubbing them, for the first time, as suffragettes. The result of Labour pressure in Parliament from 1906 meant that we saw the introduction of the Merchant Shipping Act 1906 to improve conditions at sea, the Trade Disputes Act 1906 to legalise peaceful picketing and the Workmen&#039;s Compensation Act 1906, which meant that 6 million workers became entitled, for the first time, to compensation for accidents and industrial diseases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_313">Those measures were of real and practical help to people. They helped people, their families and their communities to achieve their full potential. They sought to enact what Labour at its best has always sought to enact: social justice and economic success hand in hand. The measures expressed in practice our values&#151;Labour values&#151;because our values remain unchanged: fairness, justice, tolerance, decency and compassion. Those values were what Labour stood for 100 years ago in the House and they are the values that Labour stands for in the House today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_314">The way in which we apply those values must reflect the changing nature of people&#039;s lives. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is rightly fond of saying,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62">&quot;traditional values in a modern setting&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_315">That is exactly what the Labour party in Parliament encapsulates, just as those 29 founders did, for their time, 100 years ago. They had the new century spread out in front of them; so do we now. Just as their agenda and programme for change was of a large scale, so, too, is ours.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_316">Labour in Parliament has done much in 100 years. We have created the national health service, provided education for all and built a welfare state, but we all know that we have a great deal more to do. Reforming and improving key institutions and key achievements is a constant task. Maintaining our vigilance and security is a constant task. Securing a strong economy and a good society is a constant task, whether in 2006 or 1906. We know now, as our forebears knew then, that Parliament is the best vehicle to achieve change and to use power for progressive ends. Keir Hardie, the first chair of the PLP, might well have been baffled by some of the means by which we try to achieve change, such as television and the internet, but he would have recognised both the goals that we are seeking to secure and, perhaps most of all, what we are doing this for.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_317">Let me return, as my right hon. Friend did, to the 1906 Labour manifesto. When its authors said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63">&quot;The House of Commons is supposed to be the people&#039;s House&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_318">they were absolutely right. They said that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">&quot;the people are not there&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60208-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_319">and clearly thought that it was Labour&#039;s job to see that they were. That job then is our job now&#151;in 1906 and 2006. There were the same aims and the same values&#151;

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Feb 2006 : Column 981</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Labour values&#151;then and now. Making sure that this is the people&#039;s House was a job that the parliamentary Labour party was proud to take on in 1906, and it is a job that this parliamentary Labour party is proud to continue in 2006. Let me commend the 21st century as being Labour&#039;s century.
