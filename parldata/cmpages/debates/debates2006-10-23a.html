requirements for successful policing on the ground in our communities
are partly correct. It is not only about the involvement of the local
community, necessary thought that is, but about the support of central
Government, who provide the resources. We have made about &#163;220
million available, outside the normal police funding, to ensure that we
could have neighbourhood policing teams. Quite how that kind of
money&#151;or the necessary resources on the ground&#151;would be
provided by a Government committed to cutting &#163;21 billion from

such cuts would deeply affect the presence of policing on the

intervene to ensure that neighbourhood wardens are not removed from the

neighbourhood wardens to be left out by local government, even though
they play a vital part in policing and are a true sign of the success

Evidence Act 1984. This is part of our ongoing programme to look at
custody and related processes, a key objective of which is to simplify
and streamline procedures to free up police officer time for
operational activity outside the police station. That is why, for
example, we have enabled the arresting officer to grant street bail,
use street disposals such as fixed penalty notices and penalty notices
for disorder, and why, in 2002, under the work force modernisation
programme, we allowed chief officers to designate civilian staff to
carry out functions previously performed by the arresting officer, such

that, too, in one of his speeches. The use of civilian staff and the

patchy throughout the country. That is one of the reasons why we spent
some &#163;200,000 over the summer on an information campaign to try

Department of Health&#146;s major policy announcement made through
the newspapers after the House rose in July that it is out-sourcing to
DHL NHS Logistics and most of its purchasing and supply operations
worth about &#163;4 billion per annum. The policy was implemented on
1 October, while we were still in recess but was not announced or
debated on the Floor of the House. I wrote to the Secretary of State
for Health on 16 August raising questions of policy and parliamentary
accountability, eventually to receive a reply from her Minister of
State, the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), dated 16
October&#151;two months later&#151;in which he relied on, and
attached a copy of, a letter from his predecessor to the hon. Member
for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber) dated9 July 2005, saying that
a copy could be found in the Library. The Library confirms that a copy
of that letter was placed there only on 16 September 2006&#151;a
full14 months after it was written and, intriguingly, a month
after my letter and the press coverage in the early part of the most
recent recess. I am sure that the House will draw its own conclusions
from that, Mr. Speaker, but far from deterring me from
smelling a rat, could you advise me as to whether it is for you to
investigate the quality of ministerial responses or whether it is a
matter for the Leader of the House, in the light of his recent
pronouncements about the quality of ministerial responses? I am
grateful that the right hon. Gentleman is in the Chamber
today.</p><p><a name="0610239000148"><b><a name="61023-0003.htm_spnew34"><a name="0610239000454">Mr.

Mr. Speaker. Last week, a Member of the House of Lords used
parliamentary privilege to name an alleged victim of rape, despite the
fact that the law guarantees any such alleged victim anonymity for
life. Regardless of the circumstances of the particular case, surely
that will hardly help more rape victims to come forward. If a Member of
this House were to use parliamentary privilege in the same way,
Mr. Speaker, can you advise whether you would rule him or
her out of

of State for the armed forces to a straightforward question about the
payment of separation allowances to our troops. You can imagine my
surprise when I discovered that the very information that I had
requested had been given to a Sunday newspaper by the Ministry of
Defence. Although I realise that the Government are rightly embarrassed
about the fact that at a time when they are keen to announce
operational service bonuses to troops, they are cutting their
separation allowances by an even greater amount, is it right that that

for a fee payable by applicants for monitoring in the vetting and

the purposes of the House. That is sufficient to trigger a Ways and

a fee may be prescribed under clause 21. The motion enables us to

has not moved a Ways and Means motion before, but I assume he is able
to respond. It would be useful if he could give us some assurances
about the extent to which increases may take place. According to the
notes accompanying the proposals, the capital start-up costs are likely
to be &#163;7.58 million in the financial year 2006-07, and
&#163;6.92 million inthe financial year 2007-08, which is an
estimated&#163;14.5 million in capital start-up
costs.</p><p><a name="0610239000165">Given the
record&#151;the form&#151;of the Government in respect of

spending on computer projects across a number of Departments, let alone
their inability to stay within set dates, I ask the Minister to give us
his view as to how realistic the estimates I have just mentioned are,
because they will, of course, impact on the charges that the ways and
means motion gives rise to.</p><p><a name="0610239000166">In the covering notes, it is
stated that the Government anticipate that there will be an operating
cost of between &#163;16 million and &#163;18 million per annum
over the first five years, on top of the costs of the current work of
the Criminal Records Bureau. It is stated that that might lead by 2008
to an increase in the fee charged to applicants, which this motion will
give rise to. Can we have some greater clarity as to how likely such an
increase will be?</p><p><a name="0610239000167">We
are told that an extra 200 staff will be required in the CRB and the
IBB. We are not told how many of those staff are likely to be retained
within the public sector, or how many are likely to be contracted
out&#151;using a company such as Capita, which I gather was closely
involved in the original CRB contract, only for long delays to
transpire and for part of the contract to have to be subcontracted out
to Bombay, which caused a number of further problems. Given that the
CRB is still operating under a deficit&#151;although it aims to have
a surplus in the current financial year&#151;this House has concerns,
and it needs to be assured in respect of how realistic the level of
fees that are set now will be by the time that this legislation comes
into
force.</p><p><a name="0610239000168"><b><a name="61023-0004.htm_spnew10"><a name="0610239000467">John

the part of the Government to pursue the affirmative procedure, or
would it be possible for the Government to go about such an increase,

can be raised in future years, without it being necessary to come back
for further permission from the House.</p><p><a name="0610239000170">It is also worth pointing out
that the costs of CRB checks have been increased by an
inflation-busting &#163;2, with effect from 6 April 2006, so that a
standard check now costs &#163;31 as against &#163;29 last year,
and an enhanced check costs &#163;36 as against &#163;34 last year,
which in themselves are very large rises on the original sums charged
for CRB checks. I am raising many issues that I had not intended to

technology makes it more difficult to do things, that they are done
less well, and that a large amount of money has to be spent on remedial
action. Indeed, I find it disappointing that the Minister did not give

colleagues have proper controls over the setting up and efficiency of
this operation, how it controls its costs and how it uses new computing
systems to lower those costs. There should be no automatic assumption
that when the costs and fees are reviewed in subsequent years, they are
going to go up. It would be quite nice to have an assumption that they
will be coming down because computing and efficiency measures will be
applied to reduce them, as happens in the competitive market in
comparable service areas outside this Government&#146;s dream world,

the Opposition do not wish to detain the House unduly or to stop the

years&#146; time by announcing that it has got better at doing these
things and could have a fee cut, rather than an increase. I fear,
however, that we are going to have more of the same. We have had an

some of the issues that have been mentioned. The intention is that the

Maria Miller (Basingstoke) (Con):</b> The Bill was first
introduced in the other place in February, but, before that, about two
years&#146; worth of consultation took place on its provisions. All
the amendments that have been tabled today, however, amply illustrate
that the Government have yet to complete their thinking on this
important measure. The Minister says that there are so many amendments
because the Government have been listening to the points that have been
raised. I hope that he will remain in listening mode, and that he will
take up many of the excellent points that my hon. Friends and I, and
other hon. Members, will raise today.</p><p><a name="0610239000227">The Bill as drafted will result
in almost 10 million people being vetted, and under the amendments that
we are considering today a great many more people would be covered. We
hope that the Minister will follow the principle set out by the
Minister for Children and Families, the right hon. Member for Stretford
and Urmston (Beverley Hughes)&#151;who is on the Front Bench with
him&#151;that the breadth of the bar is proportionate to the risk
that is posed.</p><p><a name="0610239000228">The
amendments cover matters that have not been included in the Bill
before. Given the lateness of their tabling&#151;which has been
pointed out not only by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham (Tim Loughton) but in points of order&#151;will the Minister
assure us that there is broad agreement among the interested groups in
the proposals that have been tabled? It has been pointed out that there
has been no time at all to consider the amendments in the detail that
they deserve. New clause 1 will introduce fostering to the Bill for the
first time. Under Government amendment No. 20 vulnerable adults&#146;
accommodation is also included, while Government amendment No. 67 will
bring local authority health boards into the Bill for the first
time.</p><p><a name="0610239000229">This group of
amendments seeks to address the wide range of issues that we have
debated in Committee and in the other place, and I hope that I shall be

50, which brings prison officers within the terms of the Bill. I pay
tribute to my noble Friend Baroness Buscombe for raising this issue in
the other place and for pressing the Government to remedy that rather
large omission from the original Bill.</p><p><a name="0610239000230">Under
amendments Nos. 168 and 162 the Secretary of State will be able to

that, over time, the Government would like to see as many people as
possible being monitored in vetting and barring schemes. In the light
of that, and of the amendments, and of some of the contributions to our
debate on the ways and means motion, will he outline what criteria will
be used to decide how to increase the number of regulated activity
providers who are subject to monitoring, and to decide who is to be
monitored? We need to understand better the Government&#146;s
thinking on these matters.</p><p><a name="0610239000231">Throughout the debate on the
Bill, we have all agreed with the Government&#146;s intention that
the breadth of the bar should be proportionate to the risk involved.
Indeed, that is one of the Government&#146;s key principles. The
amendments, however, give almost unfettered power to the Secretary of
State to extend the Bill&#146;s scope in a way that would require
very little debate on the Floor of the House. The Minister owes it to
the House to explain that.</p><p><a name="0610239000232">I fully understand the need to
make provision for the future so that the Bill can keep pace with what
is happening in the world. Indeed, developments in technology often
make it very difficult to do that in many areas of our work. I hope,
however, that the Minister will be able to give details of when he
would bring the provisions into play, and when he would not. A
Back-Bench amendment&#151;unfortunately, I do not think it has been
selected&#151;referred to the implications of technology and would
have ensured that the matter was specifically covered in the Bill. Is
that the sort of issue that the Government are thinking about in
including these quite broad provisions in the Bill? We need
clarification on that.</p><p><a name="0610239000233">There are a number of other
amendments that introduce new concepts, which we have not debated
before, into the Bill. I thank the Minister for taking the time to meet
me and other colleagues to talk through some of the amendments. As he
pointed out, we met twice, but with more than 200 amendments and 25 new
clauses, there should probably have been a number of other
meetings.</p><p><a name="0610239000234"><b><a name="61023-0005.htm_spnew6"><a name="0610239000486">Anne

takes an interest in the list being extended? Since we will not all

issue.</p><p><a name="0610239000236">Amendment No. 45
introduces an interesting and new concept to the Bill, perhaps
clarifying further the way in which the Bill will work. However, I
would appreciate hearing the Minister&#146;s
thoughts&#151;particularly in relation to where the courts are being
invited to consider how an individual has attempted to interpret the
issue of frequency when any judgment is being brought to bear as a
result of a misdemeanour. Perhaps he could take the time offered by the
debate to explain why that has been proposed at this stage and what has
provoked the inclusion of amendment No.
45.</p><p><a name="0610239000237">Amendment No. 59
introduces a closer definition of frequency, which my hon. Friends and
I welcome inasmuch as that has been talked about from the beginning of
the debate on the Bill&#151;particularly by Lord Adonis in the other
place. Bringing in some clarification at this point is useful. However,
although amendment No. 59 contains a definition of frequency that
involves the same person carrying out an activity</p><a name="61023-0005.htm_brev8"><a name="0610239000328"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;on more than two days in any

also still includes the term &#147;frequently&#148;, almost as if
that were a separate issue. I would welcome clarification from the
Minister on whether the Government intend to have two meanings for the
word &#147;frequently&#148;: the tighter meaning of</p><a name="61023-0005.htm_brev9"><a name="0610239000329"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;more than two days in any period
of 30
days&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="0610239000239">and
also an alternative meaning. If the Government do not intend there to
be two meanings, why are both terms referred to quite specifically in
the same amendment? We would have hoped to tease that out in Committee,
but the provision was not in the Bill at that point.</p><p><a name="0610239000240">Finally,
amendment No. 92 gives the Secretary of State the ability to define by
order what is or is not a family relationship or a personal
relationship. That is quite a new area of discussion and I would
welcome the chance to hear the Minister&#146;s thoughts on it. To
revert to the original statement by the Minister for Children and
Families, the Bill should not intrude on family relationships.
Conservative Members are therefore puzzled by the need for the
Secretary of State to have the flexibility to move an order that would
define a family or personal
relationship.</p><p><a name="0610239000241">In
the interests of time, those are the only amendments that I will cover
because we need to debate several others further down the selection
list. However, I would welcome the Under-Secretary&#146;s response to
them.</p><p><a name="0610239000242"><b><a name="61023-0005.htm_spnew10"><a name="0610239000488">Judy

potential electronic surveillance of children without the necessary
controls to ensure that information does not get into the hands of

escalating. It is important to get to grips with the matter now and I
hope that the Bill can be amended to do that, or that we can find some
other mechanism for starting to license that

Moran:</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend on championing the
matter. As she said, technology is advancing fast and, although a
voluntary code currently covers the matter, even those in the industry
acknowledge that it does not apply to the latest satellite technology.
Does she agree that we need urgently to cover that to safeguard our
children?</p><p><a name="0610239000246"><b><a name="61023-0005.htm_spnew12"><a name="0610239000490">Judy
Mallaber:</b> I agree. The matter came to my attention through
coverage of one of the big CeBIT international fairs in Hamburg. In the
massive exhibition, someone had surveillance products, especially child
location products. He said, &#147;I can&#146;t understand why every
parent hasn&#146;t rushed to pick up my teddy pack. You can just pop
it in your child&#146;s rucksack and have peace of mind.&#148; How
can there be peace of mind if we do not know whether the person who
provided the equipment and popped it into a child&#146;s rucksack was
a parent or a paedophile? How does the organisation selling the product
know whether parents or paedophiles have bought it?</p><p><a name="0610239000247">My hon. Friend the Member for
Luton, South (Margaret Moran) is right that the escalation of the
technology is getting grossly out of hand and we must take hold of it
and regulate it somehow. The mass market is being bombarded with one
product after another. It is getting bigger and bigger, with more and
more different products. It begins with a simple Teddyfone, which is
attractive to a child. It would be easy for someone to persuade a child
to take one. One may know the location of the Teddyfone, but not
necessarily that of the child or whether the child is with the
Teddyfone. It should not give peace of mind. The person who has given
it to a child could also be tracking it because it can act as a
listening-in device. As soon as someone phones it, it states the
child&#146;s location. That is dangerous and we have not got the
matter under control.</p><p><a name="0610239000248">My hon. Friend is right that
there is a code of practice, which was drawn up with the mobile phone
networks, so it covers only that part of the technology&#151;not new
forms of satellite technology. That is great if people need to know
where someone is if they have had an accident or if somebody wants to
use the sat nav system in their car, but not so good if a child is
being tracked through that technology, or a jealous stalker is chasing
someone. We really do not have the way of controlling it that we
need.</p><br>

extremely concerned about the rapidly expanding market in devices to

understandable, though largely groundless, fears for their
children&#146;s
safety.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0610239000253">We need
to manage&#151;to regulate&#151;this industry. What made me realise
that we might be able to do that through this Bill was the welcome
inclusion of the provisions on vetting those involved in moderating
chat services, which already introduce an element of control of the use
of technology on the internet. We have done extraordinarily well in the
work that has been done in trying to control other areas of abuse on
the internet, such as child pornography, although we are always running
to catch up, but let us grab hold of this one before it is too
late.</p><p><a name="0610239000254">I suggested on
Second Reading and in Committee that we should try to amend paragraph
2(1)(e) of schedule 3, which is about moderators of chat rooms, but my
hon. Friend the Minister wrote to me to say that that would not work in
terms of the wording. I accept that, which is why my colleagues and
Ihave tabled an amendment proposing a separate paragraph
2(1)(f), which would make this an additional activity to be regulated.
It would not have the same force and range of licensing measures, which
I would like us to move towards, but at least it would ensure that
those who are involved in providing devices that can be a force for
good, but also a potential force for evil, are subject to checks to
make sure that they are responsible enough to be allowed to do
so.</p><p><a name="0610239000255">We could then
perhaps follow up from that and talk about what other provision we
should have for licensing, which I would like to have, in ensuring that
the products are given only to the right people, and that there are
checks, proper regulations and a proper regime in force on the
provision and use of such equipment.</p><br>

be proactive in that area. Without doubt, tracking devices have two
aspects to them. The aspect that relates to parents getting information
is entirely good. The downside, however, is that in the wrong hands
such devices have potential for the setting up of some very unpleasant

that we must consider foster parents, which sounds fairly obvious, what
other groups have we forgotten? Can we really put the Bill to bed

are often asked to foster children from impoverished countries who are

aunties and uncles. How are we to ensure that those people are
correctly informed of their duty under the Bill as it

Nos. 258 to 260 were tabled by meand my hon. Friend the Member
for Brent, East(Sarah Teather), and I want to explain why it
is necessary to delete &#147;reason to believe&#148; and instead
insert &#147;suspects&#148;. The aim is to restrict the offence of
use of a person not subject to monitoring to situations where it can be
established that a regulated activity provider had actual knowledge or
suspicion that someone was barred. We debated that many times in
Committee. Given the decisions that will be made, we thought that
precision was needed, and that we must not risk criminalising people in
cases in which there might be genuine lack of knowledge.</p><p><a name="0610239000266">There is a crucial difference
between clauses 9 and 10, which is why our amendments address clause 10
in particular. Clause 9 relates to people who are barred, but clause 10
relates to the use of people who are not subject to monitoring. Using
barred people for regulated activities is far more serious than using
someone who is not monitored, as the use of the former obviously poses
a greater risk to children and the vulnerable. That is not to imply
that the use of a person who is not subject to monitoring is not a
serious matter&#151;it is. If a regulated activity is carried out by
such an employee, severe disciplinary action, and even dismissal, may
well result.</p><p><a name="0610239000267">Our
concern, however, is that the creation of offences targeted at people
who make mistakes is excessive. Mistakes will be made, especially while
the complicated system beds down. We suggest that, for a successful
prosecution, the defendant must, at the very least, have some knowledge
of the fact that someone is barred, but have failed to act on that
knowledge. In other words, we would restrict criminalisation to
situations in which, although the person &#147;suspects&#148;,
rather than &#147;has reason to believe&#148;, that someone is not
subject to monitoring, they still allow them to engage in regulated
activity. I hope that the Minister will address that important
point.</p><br>

Liberal Democrat Members thinkit important to make it clear
that the probable regulations on powers of attorney and guardianship
should be all-encompassing, because they involve the handing over of a
great deal of power. For example, someone might name a person as their
attorney long before that power is used, and of course things could
change in the intervening period. A personal friend of 15 years ago may
have been involved in unacceptable activity in the intervening period.
I would particularly like the Minister to address that point of

attorney&#151;will that be conveyed to the independent barring board,

powers over welfare. If the Bill is to do what it rightly says it aims
to do&#151;protect and safeguard vulnerable groups&#151;it must
ensure that someone who is barred from working with vulnerable people
does not move on to a less well-policed part of the system and
exercises power under the 2005 Act as an attorney, deputy, appointee,

main thrust of the amendments&#151;I am grateful to Age Concern in
particular for its help and assistance in drafting them&#151;is to
probe how far the various lists work with each other: in other words,
how the various agencies set up under mental capacity
legislationwill interface with the barring board and the
barring register. For example, if someone has their attorneyship,
deputyship or appointeeship revoked, as my hon. Friend said, because
they have caused harm to a vulnerable person, that information should
be passed to the barring board. Similarly, the barring board should
inform the Office of the Public Guardian and the Department for Work
and Pensions of those whom they have barred.</p><p><a name="0610239000275">Amendment No. 192 would clarify
beyond doubt that where a family member or a friend is acting in the
capacity of an attorney, deputy or appointee, that activity is
regulated. I welcome the Government amendment which is intended to deal
with that in part, but what information will be given to attorneys,
deputies and appointees&#151;this thread has run through the

193 would ensure that the Court of Protection, the Office of the Public
Guardian and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions are under a
duty to check whether a person who will be involved with the finances
and personal welfare decisions of someone who lacks capacity is barred
from working with vulnerable groups. What form of risk assessment will
be put in place within those organisations to decide when checks with
the barring register are necessary? Will there be consultation with
organisations such as Age Concern and other interested parties about
precisely how that risk assessment might be implemented and on what
occasions it might be necessary to make a reference to the barring
register?</p><p><a name="0610239000277">Amendments

to abuse as an appointee, deputy or attorney, and that surely cannot be
right. Will the barring board see it as part of its duty to alert other
organisations when it becomes aware that those people are also

Many of those who act in that capacity&#151;although not all, as the

their case, compulsory checks are unnecessary and could be seen as
intrusive. Making such checks compulsory has the potential to raise

&#147;reason to believe&#148; that that is the case. A regulated
activity provider or personnel supplier would know whether someone is
monitored if they have made a check. If they do not do so, they will
commit an offence under clause 11. The check will also allow the
regulated activity provider to register to be notified by the IBB if
the individual stops being subject to
monitoring.</p><p><a name="0610239000291">The
offence in clause 10 is designed to criminalise an employer who has
made a check but goes on to employ someone, even though the check
showed that the individual was subject to monitoring. In those cases,
the employer would know that the individual was not subject to
monitoring and it is those people&#151;not people across the
board&#151;that we are aiming to criminalise. The provision also
criminalises an employer who learns from a source

subject to monitoring. In those cases, the regulated activity provider
would have reason to believe that the person was not subject to
monitoring, but he would not know it. To change the wording from
&#147;reason to believe&#148; to &#147;suspect&#148; would not
significantly change the circumstances in which the offence was
committed. If anything, it would widen the circumstances. An employer
who was unsure could simply do an online

242 is designed to ensure that those working for location-based
services are covered by regulated activity. The mobile phone network
operators and location service providers have acted to put in place a
code of practice, covering passive location services, using mobile
phone technology. As I pointed out in Committee, it is a new sector and
we would need to consult on and assess the risk presented by
individuals working in those services before looking to amend the
definition of regulated

Dhanda:</b> The new clause and amendmentsNos. 68 and
109 are designed to provide flexibility for the Secretary of State in
setting the vetting and barring scheme fee, and to give the Secretary
of State apower to fund the independent barring board
directly. Clause 21 currently allows the Secretary of State to set and
receive a fee from applicants for monitoring. We want to make it clear
that we want to set a fee that will enable the scheme to break even
over the first five years of operation, and the new clause achieves
that.</p><p><a name="0610239000313">Amendment No. 68
clarifies the Secretary of State&#146;s power to waive the fee for
those who undertake regulated activity on a voluntary basis. We made
that commitment on Second Reading and again in Committee, and I am
happy to make it explicit today. Volunteers currently receive Criminal
Records Bureau checks free of charge and we shall continue that
approach.</p><p><a name="0610239000314">Amendment No.
109 puts in place a mechanism for funding the IBB. The monitoring fee
will be payable to the Secretary of State, not direct to the board. The
IBB will be a free-standing statutory body, so we need to provide a
power for the Secretary of State to pass funding on to
it.</p><p><a name="0610239000315">Amendments
Nos. 110 and 111 ensure that arrangements for presenting IBB accounts
to Parliament are in line with current practice. Amendment No. 19 and
new schedule 1 make provision in relation to staff and property
transfer schemes. Their purpose is to enable staff who work in the
Department on the Protection of Children Act 1999, protection of
vulnerable adults and list 99 barring schemes, as well as property
deployed for the purposes of the current schemes, to be transferred to
the IBB. It is usual to include such a provision in the Bill where
staff and property transfers are envisaged. This set of provisions will
ensure that the expertise of those operating the POCA, POVA and list 99
barring schemes may be transferred to the new vetting and barring
scheme where appropriate. They will also ensure that property, like the
IT system, may also be transferred. The detail of such schemes will be
developed as part of the process of planning the implementation of the
new scheme.</p><p><a name="0610239000316">I commend

Maria Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for his explanation of
these important provisions, especially new clause 2, but this is yet
another example of the Government tabling amendments in the last few
days. Funding the IBB is at the heart of making the Bill work, so when
the Minister responds to the debate I should like him to explain why we
have had to wait until this late stage for the Government&#146;s
proposals. It is important that Members scrutinising the Bill have all
the facts at their disposal, because the measure will affect important
groups of people. When important elements such as these provisions are
not included when the Bill is introduced it makes our job difficult,
especially as it is entirely unclear why they were tabled at this late
date.</p><p><a name="06102315000024">Putting that to
one side, new clause 2 covers provisions which, as the Minister said,
govern the fees applicable to monitoring under clause 21. Amendment No.
109 allows the Secretary of State to make payments to the IBB and
amendment No. 68 tidies up some of the wording in relation to that
power.</p><p><a name="06102315000025">We
are pleased that there is an implication in the new clause that fees
will be capped for five years. We welcome that and I hope that the
Minister will remember the comments made by my hon. Friends earlier in
the debate about the need not just for capping but also for
efficiencies. There will be a significant cost, which employers and
other organisations will have to
cover.</p><p><a name="06102315000026"><b><a name="61023-0007.htm_spnew7"><a name="06102315000156">Anne
Main:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that, although capping is
welcome to prevent fees rising exorbitantly, the Minister should give
an undertaking that the fees will be reviewed regularly after the
initial five years, so that people will know how quickly fees are
rising, if they rise, or, we hope, decreasing? Given that some fee
structures seem to have risen remarkably quickly, people would welcome
a regular review, perhaps annually or more often, if that is
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06102315000027"><b><a name="61023-0007.htm_spnew8"><a name="06102315000157">Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for her contribution. As
the Minister is aware, the IBB will lay an annual report before the
Department and the Secretary of State may specify what the report
should cover. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether a review of
fees will be included in the
report.</p><p><a name="06102315000028">Costs
are a matter of great concern. It is a shame that we could not debate
the matter more fully in Committee. New clause 2 implies that fees can
be used to recoup payments made to the IBB under amendment No. 109
or</p><a name="61023-0007.htm_brev9"><a name="06102315000150"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in respect of any
other expenditure of the Secretary of State in connection with his
functions under this
Act.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102315000029">Under the Bill, the
functions of the Secretary of State are extensive. There will be three
significant cost areas. First, the Criminal Records Bureau may be used
to provide information on the status of individuals who are monitored.
Secondly, the IBB will eventually rely on the introduction of IMPACT,
the police monitoring database, which is already &#163;200 million
over budget and several years late. Thirdly, in addition to the costs
of the Department, there will be the cost of running the IBB. The Bill
provides for the Secretary of State potentially to recoup all those
costs from the fees that are charged. Will the Minister provide more
detail? I am sure a number of organisations will view the provision
with concern.</p><br>

present, development costs associated with, say, the Criminal Records
Bureau are not set against the costs levied from individuals applying
for a criminal record check. Are we to infer that the process is being
changed and that in future we can expect all development costs to be

considerable implications for organisations that must apply for checks
in order to continue to
operate.</p><p><a name="06102315000031">In Committee,
the Minister said that it was his intention that the numbers monitored
by the Bill should be expanded in future. He made it clear in reply to
my intervention a few moments ago that that would not necessarily be
only as a result of changes in technology, but that it could happen for
other reasons. Can he reassure the House that the number of people
being monitored will not increase purely to increase the revenue stream
available to the Secretary of State to offset some of the rather high
cost of implementing such an extensive
Bill?</p><p><a name="06102315000032">In answer to a
parliamentary question, we learned that the average unit processing
cost for the CRB was &#163;26.10 in 2005-06. As we heard today, the
cost of an advance disclosure is &#163;34, which is due to rise to
&#163;36. There is quite a significant gap between those two figures.
The House will be interested to know that the majority of requests made
to the CRB are for advance disclosure checks at the higher cost of
&#163;34, soon to be
&#163;36.</p><p><a name="06102315000033">The
Minister said that the programme needed to pay for itself, but it is
clear that it is currently more than paying for itself: a surplus is
being generated as a result of the charging levels. What is that money
is being used for? Does he intend to continue with that higher level of
charge and, if so, will he give us a rough idea of what the unit costs
will be for the new vetting and monitoring processes, and what the
actual cost will be? Given the burdens that this will place on many
employers, that will be of great interest.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61023-0007.htm_ordayhd10"><a name="06102315000151">5

voluntary and charitable organisations, I would appreciate it if the

be no charges for checks on volunteers. I am sure that he will be able
to do that, but it is still worth stressing that point.</p><p><a name="06102315000035">Amendment No. 6 addresses the
IBB&#146;s ability to borrow money. As we covered that in Committee,
I am pleased that it was decided that we could revisit it on Report.
The amendment has been tabled only in the spirit of ensuring that there
is transparency and sound financial management within the IBB. Although
we have received assurances from the Minister that the provision that
the amendment addresses is a standard provision that will be used
rarely, it gives the IBB extensive powers, which the House should be
aware of.</p><p><a name="06102315000036">I would also
like some clarification on the position of the Treasury in respect of
this provision. From reading the reports on this area, it is my
understanding that the Treasury will need to know that this provision
will be used before it is agreed that it can be included in the Bill.
Although the Minister assured us in Committee that it will be used
rarely, some discussions must have gone on with the Treasury to
reassure it that it is a required provision, and I ask him to share
those discussions with us.</p><br>

power to borrow money in connection with the exercise of any of its
functions. As the hon. Lady said, we debated it in Committee, and as I
explained then&#151;and confirmed in a letter that I circulated to
all Committee members&#151;the power to borrow is a normal one for
any independent body to have, but it is not common for that power to be
used. The kinds of rare circumstances in which a non-departmental
public body might need to borrow money include where the normal funding
mechanism failed for some reason&#151;such as an administrative error
or industrial action. In such circumstances, the body might need to
obtain a temporary bank overdraft to meet a short-term financial
requirement such as staff pay. If we fail to provide the IBB with the
power to borrow, we will put it at unnecessary risk of an occasion
arising when it cannot meet its financial obligations. That is why this
power is included in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102315000039">The main
purposes of the Government amendments in respect of funding are to
clarify and qualify the flexibility in fee setting and the mechanism
for funding the IBB. The Bill as published contains only a power to
prescribe the fee; the amendments place more detail in its provisions.
For example, they set out the period of time that the Secretary of
State needs to take into account in setting the fee, and they make it
clear that a zero fee may be prescribed. I am happy to make it clear
again that we intend to ensure that volunteers do not have to pay the
fee throughout the funding model of the first five years. I hope that
the House will welcome that additional detail that clarifies and
qualifies the funding arrangements.</p><p><a name="06102315000040">To answer the hon.
Lady&#146;s question about regular reviews, it is the intention to
have an annual review of that fee, as it is in respect of the CRB fee.
We were quite clear about our intentions for funding the scheme when
responding to questions raised in previous debates. We have realised
that the Bill&#146;s provisions could be clarified. For example, we
repeatedly stated that the fee for volunteers will be waived, and we
are now making the ability to do so explicit. I am sure that that
clarification is welcomed.</p><p><a name="06102315000041"><b><a name="61023-0007.htm_spnew12"><a name="06102315000159">Anne
Main:</b> Is the Minister completely satisfied that it is
clear what the funding is intended to pay for? For example, is it
intended to pay for updating all the computer systems and for any
programming required in the regular progress updates that are so
important if employers are to make checks? Given the big overruns in
computer costs that have occurred, is he satisfied that the fee levied
will be enough to cover the entire programme, including staffing
costs?</p><p><a name="06102315000042"><b><a name="61023-0007.htm_spnew13"><a name="06102315000160">Mr.

that this is about not just the costs incurred but the extra powers and

vetting and barring scheme fee will be paid once when a person enters
the scheme; there will be no new VBS fee when they change jobs. The new
employer will be able to use the online check to confirm the
person&#146;s status in the scheme. As with the CRB disclosure fee,
the VBS fee will be the individual applicant&#146;s responsibility,
but it will be open to the employer to pay the
fee.</p><p><a name="06102315000043">We want the IBB
to have the borrowing power that I mentioned, but we hope that it will
not need to be used. That is not a contradiction; rather, it is the
prudent way forward. If Government funding arrangements failed, the IBB
would still be able to meet its obligations. We do not expect it to
borrow from the private sector or to generate any working capital. The
power to borrow will not be used to allow it to run at a deficit. It
will need to balance its costs and income each year; it will not exist
to make a profit.</p><p><a name="06102315000044">As
the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) rightly
pointed out, in terms of the funding model, we need to look at the
numbers in the scheme. In the first three years, more money is likely
to be coming in as people register, but the costs in years four and
five are likely to offset that. As fewer people come into the scheme
and we get closer to the figure of 7 million people, the costs are
likely to be put toward the process of continual monitoring. But as I
said, work has been done to ensure that the funding model is secure for
the full five
years.</p><p><a name="06102315000045"><i> Question put

they need available quickly and easily online is a key part of
that.</p>

<p><a name="06102315000075">Employers are
required to ensure that all individuals engaged in regulated activity
are &#147;subject to monitoring&#148;. That means that the
individual has applied to the scheme, that they are not barred and that
the Secretary of State is undertaking regular checks of key information
sources to identify new information about the individual, which will
deliver the continuous updating mechanism recommended by Sir Michael
Bichard. For that reason, we propose that the online check should show
whether an individual is &#147;subject to monitoring&#148;. As the
Bill sets out, those who are barred cannot be subject to monitoring,
and employers in regulated activities can use only people who are
subject to monitoring. Showing whether an individual is

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1261</b><br>subject to monitoring will therefore effectively ensure that employers
do not recruit barred
individuals.</p><p><a name="06102315000077">As
the Bill stands, the online check would show that an individual is
barred or being considered for barring. That is sensitive information
and making it available online would require security measures, which
would make the check slower and more cumbersome for employers to access
and use. As I explained in Committee, those changes will make it easier
for employers to get the information that they need when recruiting
staff.</p><p><a name="06102315000078">New clauses 3
and 4 move the provisions on how a check is made from schedule 4 into
two new clauses, one of which provides for the mechanics of the check
and one of which provides for the information that is released.
Schedule 4 will contain only the table of those who can make
checks.</p><p><a name="06102315000079">New clauses 5
and 6 and amendment No. 75 make similar changes to the notification
system. They place more detail about the system in the Bill and change
the information that is released. Employers who have registered an
interest in an individual will be told that that individual has ceased
to be subject to monitoring and so cannot be engaged in regulated
activity.</p><p><a name="06102315000080"><b><a name="61023-0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="06102315000164">Anne
Main:</b> Given that there may be a time lag, if an employer
makes an inquiry and there is no information on the person in question,
will that inquiry be logged, which would allow information received
after the inquiry was made to be sent to the
employer?</p><p><a name="06102315000081"><b><a name="61023-0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="06102315000165">Mr.
Dhanda:</b> That question raises a couple of issues. First,
the hon. Lady has made the good point that we must ensure that the time
lag between someone&#146;s status changing and an employer being
informed that that person is no longer subject to monitoring is as
short as possible. Secondly, when new employees&#151;for example, a
teacher&#151;enter the work force, it takes a few weeks for the
enhanced disclosure to come through. However, schools will be able to
use the instant online check while they are waiting for the full
enhanced disclosure, which will allow them to determine that
individuals are not barred owing to their being subject to monitoring
on the online
list.</p><p><a name="06102315000082">New
clauses 8 to 11 and amendments Nos. 88 to 91 provide for supervisory
authorities and professional regulatory bodies to receive more
information, including confirmation that the individual is barred. They
also consolidate the way that supervisory authorities are defined.
Those bodies require that information to help them to carry out their
inspection and regulatory functions. The security issues are minimised
because only a small number of known bodies need this information. The
provisions for supervisory authorities and professional regulatory
bodies have therefore been covered separately in the new clauses
inserted by the
amendments.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61023-0008.htm_ordayhd2"><a name="06102315000152">5.15

and 12 create new information offences. The first of those criminalises
anyone making a false declaration to access individuals&#146;
information illegitimately. The second criminalises employers who, with
no right to do so, force individuals to provide the information about
their criminal records history that they receive when they apply to be
monitored.</p><br>

by the IBB and the Secretary of State in connection with his functions
under the Bill to section 56 of the Data ProtectionAct 1998.
It thereby criminalises employers who force individuals to make subject
access requests for data under the 1998 Act as a condition of
employment.</p><p><a name="06102315000085">Amendment
No. 73 expands the role of the independent monitor to include reviewing
all decisions to withhold police information from an individual under
clause 21 and reviewing a sample of the information that is provided to
the vetting and barring scheme by the police. The independent
monitor&#146;s role, as set out in clause 23, covers only police
information in connection with Criminal Records Bureau criminal records
disclosures. The amendment adds police information in connection with
applications for monitoring. That change responds to some of the points
raised in the report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights.</p><p><a name="06102315000086">New clause 13 and amendments
Nos. 77 and 78 make it clear that a finding of fact such as in court
proceedings or in an employment tribunal is not necessary for the
purpose of any referrals to the IBB. That is because there may be no
such proceedings in all the cases where we wish there to be a referral
to the IBB. In the Bill as drafted, that was made clear in some of the
referral provisions, but not all of them. The amendments remove any
doubt.</p><p><a name="06102315000087">The amendments
provide for more streamlined flows of information within the scheme and
so improve its operation. I therefore ask hon. Members to accept
them.</p><p><a name="06102315000088"><b><a name="61023-0008.htm_spnew3"><a name="06102315000166">Mrs.
Maria Miller:</b> I welcome several of the new clauses and
amendments, which, again, give us the mechanics of how the Bill will
work. The lack of those details when we discussed the Bill on Second
Reading and in Committee made it difficult to be sure that we had got
to grips with the Government&#146;s intentions. While we welcome
their inclusion at this stage, many Conservative Members wish that they
had come a little earlier in the process.</p><p><a name="06102315000089">I should like to focus my
comments on our amendments Nos. 197, 198, 250, 3, 4 and 5, which
address three key aspects that may not have been at the forefront of
the Minister&#146;s attention due to his preoccupation with putting
some of the detail into the Bill&#151;the quality of the data that
the IBB will use, the communication of the implications for employers,
and the important issue of overseas
workers.</p><p><a name="06102315000090">I
thank the Liberal Democrat Members who joined forces with us to support
our amendment No. 3, which would establish as a core function of the
independent barring board the need to implement a comprehensive
communications programme. We examined that matter in detail in
Committee. The Bill will affect some10 million people, and,
although we made some progress on the issue in Committee, we seem to
have made no progress on getting the Government to address it
thereafter.</p><p><a name="06102315000091">As a result
of amendments passed in another place, the IBB will have to notify by
recorded letter individuals who have been barred. A Government
amendment that we shall consider today will place a duty on a court to
inform people that they have been barred as a resultof a court
decision. Those are examples of good

<meta name="Date" content="23 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1263</b><br>communication of information. Also, the Minister has made it clear that
local authorities should inform those receiving direct payments of the
existence of the monitoring scheme, so that they can make use of it if
required. That, too, is an example of good communication taking place.
However, nowhere in the Bill is there a requirement to ensure adequate
communication to employers and employees on these important
matters.</p><p><a name="06102315000092">Amendment
No. 3 would place a duty on the IBB to implement a comprehensive
communication plan. Given that the Bill makes it a criminal act to
apply for a job while barred, if that job is monitored&#151;as a
large number will be&#151;we believe that it will be imperative to
communicate the implications of the Bill to all those involved. That
should be provided for in the Bill. When we raised this matter in
Committee, the Minister said that those communications would be made
when the individual was barred. However, he has made it clear again
today that he fully intends to increase the number of people and jobs
being monitored. That will create a fluid situation that will change
over time. Surely he must therefore understand the importance of
adopting our amendment.</p><p><a name="06102315000093">On the matter of the quality of
the data that the IBB will be using to reach its decisions, I was
surprised that the Government had not decided to take on board the
comments that we made in Committee, because they have taken on board
many others. The Minister acknowledged that it was an important issue,
and we had a lengthy debate on the problems that have been experienced
in this area by the Criminal Records Bureau. He rightly pointed out
that only a relatively small number of people&#151;in percentage
terms&#151;have experienced problems gaining employment as a result
of the CRB putting out incorrect information. In absolute terms,
however, thousands of people are affected by the problem, and I am sure
that the Minister is aware that there are continuing concerns about the
quality of the data being received by the CRB, not least because of the
problems that police authorities are having in sharing on a broader
basis the information that they hold.</p><p><a name="06102315000094">To include in the Bill a
fundamental role for the IBB to have regard to the quality of the data
that it receives would safeguard not only employers and employees but
the IBB itself, because its reputation would be undermined if people
felt that it was not using data of a sufficiently high quality, or that
it did not have the means to improve that data over time.</p><p><a name="06102315000095">We examined the issue of
overseas workers at length in Committee. I am therefore surprised, as
are a number of interest groups, that the Government have made no
headway on this matter. In Committee, the Minister acknowledged the
importance of this issue, and implied that it would be looked at again
on Report. Indeed, he said that more needed to be done in that respect.
However, I am not aware that the Government have tabled any amendments
or new clauses to deal with the matter.</p><p><a name="06102315000096">In Committee, the Minister said
that it was reasonable to raise the matter, but that it was perhaps not
quite the right place to tackle the issue of foreign offences. In the
spirit of being constructive, I went away to see whether we could table
an amendment that could appropriately be included in the
Bill&#151;rather than something that was more to do with the offences

that they have introduced measures so that those convicted of sex
offences can sign the sexual offences register in the UK. Paragraph 20
of schedule 2 states that inclusion on the foreign barred list would
lead to automatic barring in the UK. Those are welcome elements of the
Bill, but is the Minister certain that he has full, open and unfettered
access to all the relevant convictions held globally by individuals so
that he can be satisfied that the measures that he has outlined so far
are adequate? I am sure that the answer to that has to be no. We should
return to that matter today, particularly given the issue of gaining
accurate information from Asia and Africa.</p><p><a name="06102315000097">The amendments that we have
tabled take on board the discussion in Committee. We are trying to find
a solution to this problem&#151;I think that the Minister has some
sympathy with that&#151;and to find a way in which we can highlight
to employers that the data being supplied to them from the monitoring
organisation may not give them a full picture of the record of the
individual, because that individual has not continually resided in the
UK. As I understand it, currently the system makes no reference to
where an individual has lived and therefore an employer is not able to
assess whether the information covers the entire working career of that
person.</p><p><a name="06102315000098">The issue is
important because, as the Minister knows from our debate in Committee,
increasing numbers of people who work in our health service and areas
that affect vulnerable adults come from overseas. That is to be
welcomed because those people add greatly to the human resources that
we have available in the sector, but we should not ignore the problems
that that creates in terms of monitoring their history, in the same way
that we monitor the history of peoplewho are resident in the
UK and have been throughout their career. I hope that the Minister will
consider amendment No. 198, which increases the duties of the Secretary
of State in respect of getting information about non-resident
individuals.</p><p><a name="06102315000099">Importantly, amendment No. 197
makes disclosure of residency in the UK part of the monitoring process.
As I am sure that the Minister is aware, we have a group of people
working in our medical profession who do not reside in the UK, although
they deliver services here. They are an important group who often offer
GP or doctor services over weekend periods, when we might not be able
to get adequate cover from people who reside in the UK. That opens up
another problem. How do we make sure that our monitoring practices are
working in the way that they are intended to work? I hope that the
Minister is able to listen more to those points now that some of the
basic issues in the Bill have been resolved. Perhaps he could think
about how we can address that issue as we move
forward.</p><p><a name="06102315000100"><b><a name="61023-0008.htm_spnew4"><a name="06102315000167">Annette

in this group. I want to address amendment No. 3, which it is important

only if there is excellent communication to inform employers, workers,
parents and other people about the new

Bill and all its details are difficult enough for us in the Chamber to
grasp. It will be especially difficult for those who have to work with
it. I therefore believe that there must be absolute commitment to a
good communications system. I envisage, through amendment No. 3, a
communications strategy from the IBB, which will be implemented at
various local levels. I hope that the Under-Secretary will confirm that
he envisages local groups, organisations and local authorities
participating in disseminating the information.</p><p><a name="06102315000102">Has the
Under-Secretary considered a kite-marking scheme, which would integrate
the requirements of the law and best practice in communication with
some of the other processes that must accompany the Bill? The vetting
and barring scheme is only one tool in keeping children and vulnerable
adults safe. There needs to be a culture of vigilance and training for
staff, good child protection policies, a good system of checking
references and so on. It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary
considered a kite-marking scheme for all the different organisations
that might be involved in communication and implementing best practice
on all the important matters that will make the measure work and
achieve what we want when we look back at the sequence of events, which
was greatly informed by the Bichard inquiry.</p><p><a name="06102315000103">Focusing on
necessary aspects such as communication and the culture of vigilance
will be additional to including some protection for overseas workers.
If there are strong processes and everyone is looking out to ensure
that employees have the training that they claim and references have
been adequately checked, that would provide more comfort about the
overseas workers&#146; position. I share the concerns of the hon.
Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) but appreciate that it
is difficult to devise concrete proposals. We would all therefore like
the Under-Secretary to deal with the position of overseas workers.
There is no quick fix, but genuine rewards, such as a kite-marking
scheme, for implementing the processes on the ground would be
useful.</p><p><a name="06102315000104">The hon.
Member for Basingstoke mentioned the quality of data throughout our
debates. She has been persistent on that important point and I hope
that the Under-Secretary will address that issue.</p><p><a name="06102315000105">I want to ask a question that
the hon. Gentleman did not answer earlier. How can we communicate with
private foster carers when we do not know who they are because there is
no compulsory registration scheme? I would be grateful for an
answer.</p><p><a name="06102315000106"><b><a name="61023-0008.htm_spnew6"><a name="06102315000168">Mr.
Dhanda:</b> Amendment No. 198 would require
the Secretary of State to ensure that further inquiries were made about
individuals who live or have lived outside the UK while they are
subject to continuous monitoring. Such inquiries could involve
contacting the local police force in the area where the individual
resided abroad or checking a foreign barred list, if it existed. It is
not clear how the Secretary of State would carry out those inquiries.
Employers can already request individuals to produce a certificate of
good conduct from their local police force overseas. That will
continue. Recruiting responsibly is part of an employer&#146;s
obligation and the new scheme does not replace that.</p><br>

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1266</b><br><p><a name="06102315000107">Amendment No. 197 would amend
clause 35, which ensures that the Secretary of State will notify the
keeper of a specified register when an individual becomes barred or
ceases to be monitored. The amendment would require the Secretary of
State to inform an individual&#151;it is not clear whom&#151;of the
dates that a monitored person had been resident in the UK. Perhaps the
intention is that the information would go to employers. If so, that
would not be the effect of that
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102315000108">Whatever
the intended destination, the amendment would require the Secretary of
State to gather information about an individual&#146;s residence
abroad throughout their life. That would extend the scope of the scheme
in a way that is neither practical nor desirable. A lot has been
said&#151;in Committee and, indeed, this evening&#151;about the
number of people that we need to have information on to make the scheme
work. I wonder whether stakeholders, or the public, would be willing to
take that on. I would have reservations about such a
scheme.</p><p><a name="06102315000109">I would like
to set out the measures that the Government have already put in place
to deal with those who have committed sexual offences abroad, whether
UK citizens or foreign nationals, and who come to the UK. The
notification order was introduced by the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and
is designed to ensure that those convicted of sex offences overseas are
made subject to the notification requirements of the sex offenders
register in the
UK.</p><p><a name="06102315000110">Sexual offences
prevention orders can also be made in relation to offenders convicted
of sexual or violent offences overseas who pose a risk of causing
serious sexual harm in the UK. More than 900 sexual offences prevention
orders were granted in 2005-06. Breach of either order is a criminal
offence.</p><p><a name="06102315000111">The Criminal
Records Bureau is developing relations and information sharing with
other countries on a bilateral basis. However, the UK is well ahead of
most countries in this area and some overseas information is simply not
available. I understand the point that the hon. Member for Basingstoke
is making when she says that we need more and better information, not
least from abroad. I also know that serious work is being done with
Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but in many respects we are at the
mercy of the quality of information that exists abroad. We need to be
able to tap into
that.</p><p><a name="06102315000112"><b><a name="61023-0008.htm_spnew7"><a name="06102315000169">Mrs.
Maria Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for furthering the
debate on the issue. He says that he feels uncomfortable with the
amendments that have been tabled, but does not give a reason for that.
He might want to
elucidate.</p><p><a name="06102315000113">The
Minister might feel uncomfortable about this issue, but it is causing
concern not just among those on the Conservative Benches&#151;I
received a detailed briefing on it from the National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Although he is clearly unable to
take the points that we are making fully on board, perhaps he will
undertake to meet with the NSPCC to discuss them in more detail. It is
making clear the fact that it also has an issue about the matter.
Perhaps we have not yet come up with the right solution, but it needs
to be addressed.</p><br>

meeting with the NSPCC and am happy to do so, but my concern is the
idea of a database logging the time that British subjects spend working
or living abroad and having such a record of their lives, which is
effectively what the amendment proposes. That is specifically where my

relation to school staff, Department for Education and Skills guidance

I ask hon. Members to consider not pressing their
amendments.</p><p><a name="06102315000116">The
hon. Member for Basingstoke mentioned communication, as did the hon.
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke). We had a good
debate on amendment No. 3 in Committee, and we now also have amendment
No. 200, which places duties in respect of communications on the
Secretary of State. As the hon. Lady says, I reiterated in Committee
that I was wholly in agreement, as I was on Second Reading, on the need
for a widespread and ongoing communications campaign. I appreciate the
concerns that stakeholders must understand their rights and
responsibilities, that the coverage of the scheme needs to be well
known, that inadvertent criminal behaviour must be averted, and that a
coherent, co-ordinated communications strategy is needed. We need a
scheme that works, and in which people have total confidence. We are
committed to instigating a thorough and ongoing communications campaign
to create awareness, develop understanding and help employers and
employees to prepare for their new responsibilities and rights. The
IBB&#151;when it is set up&#151;and the Secretary of State will
play distinct and co-ordinated roles in that campaign. I assure hon.
Members that stakeholders will also have a big role to play.</p><p><a name="06102315000117">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset

Dhanda:</b> Let me give the hon. Lady a specific example.
Where an employer has done the necessary checks on an employee, but not
regularly enough to meet the period condition under the guidance, it is
important that such employers, who have done their bit to try to ensure
that people are monitored and subject to monitoring, and who,
inadvertently, have not obeyed the guidelines, are not criminalised for
that. Across the board, we must ensure that people are aware of the law
of the land and in what circumstances people are and are not subject to
monitoring, which will require a great deal of
communication.</p>

complex piece of legislation. I am the first to admit that. It is
important, however, to get across to all employers what is required of

if they have not broken the law.</p><p><a name="06102315000122"><b><a name="61023-0009.htm_spnew2"><a name="06102315000175">Tim

Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) does want to criminalise people
inadvertently. The independent monitor&#146;s role is to take a view
of the provision of information, particularly that withheld from the
application in accordance with clause 21(6). That is a specific
function in line with the monitor&#146;s role in respect of
information provided under part 5 of the Police Act 1997. Oversight of

the difficulty of making sure that we criminalise only those people who
act inappropriately, and do not attempt to put into criminal law
something that ought to be dealt with through an employment
decision-making

Dhanda:</b> The hon. Lady makes an
interesting point. She implies that, contrary to the legal advice that
we have received, the measures in the Bill are not appropriate for
protecting vulnerable groups. I am surprised that she should come in at
this stage of the debate, having missed most of it, and disregard our
legal advice, the measures that we are taking and the stakeholder
support, and imply that all the people involved are wrong. Perhaps in
the course of our debate she might care to tell us how she would do
things better herself.</p><p><a name="06102315000126">To get back to my point, we
expect the independent barring board to engage with its stakeholders to
identify and encourage best practice in the making of referrals, and to
issue guidance if appropriate. We will set out what information is to
be included in the referrals in regulations, so experience of operation
of the scheme and of the IBB can be taken into account as we develop
those requirements. It is intended that all referral information on
which a barring decision is based will be provided to the person under
consideration, as is the case at
present.</p><p><a name="06102315000127">On the
operation of the IBB, amendment No. 4 would require the IBB&#146;s

the IBB to report on one specific matter without specifying a lot of
other detailed IBB functions that are to be covered in the annual
report. The IBB will be free to report on the quality of information,
so explicit provisions to that effect are not
necessary.</p><p><a name="06102315000128">The House
might, in future, take a particular interest in one of the IBB&#146;s
functions. If so, it is highly likely that the Secretary of State will
take an interest, too. The Secretary of State will have the power to
direct the IBB to submit a report on any matter at any time. I foresee
no difficulty in Ministers responding to any issues that hon. Members
might raise. I hope that I have given the necessary assurances, and
that hon. Members will not press their amendments.</p><p><a name="06102315000129">Amendment No.
5 would add four new functions to the IBB&#146;s core functions. As I
said in debate on a similar amendment in Committee, the core functions
set out in the Bill are the IBB&#146;s essential decision-making
functions relating to barring. The IBB will be an expert body with a
tight focus on taking independent, expert decisions, supported by the
existing structures of the Criminal Records Bureau. The addition of
extra functions would risk diluting the focus of the IBB. The CRB is
well placed to undertake functions relating to monitoring and online
access for employers. The Bill therefore gives the Secretary of State,
in the form of the CRB, those functions. The CRB has access to the
police national computer and was set up to handle large volumes of
information. It would only confuse matters if we gave the IBB similar
functions.</p><p><a name="06102315000130">Amendment
No. 203 would place an obligation on the Secretary of State to report
any breaches of the security of the barred lists or online checks in a
statement to Parliament. It would be useful if I explained how the
lists and the online checks will be made secure, and how we will avoid
the problem, alluded to in Committee, of paedophiles being able to
change information held about them online, as happened in America.
First, and very importantly, the central barred lists will be securely
protected from interference and will not be accessible to anyone
outside the IBB and CRB. Information will be taken from those lists by
the CRB and supplied to other bodies as appropriate, which means that
the lists themselves are protected. We will take all appropriate
security measures to ensure the integrity of those lists, and we will
ensure that there are no opportunities to interfere with that
data.</p><p><a name="06102315000131"><b><a name="61023-0009.htm_spnew7"><a name="06102315000179">Mrs.

annual report is important to hon. Members and Ministers with a
particular interest in the functioning of the board. As a result of the

whether someone is subject to monitoring. The system that holds that

amendments Nos. 98, 120, 129 and 131 to

Lewis:</b> Government new clause 14 enables provision to be
made in future to take account of forthcoming Scottish and Northern
Ireland legislation. Scotland is making provision for its own vetting
and barring scheme through legislation currently before the Scottish
Parliament. Northern Ireland will make its own provisions that will
work in parallel with the England and Wales scheme and allow the IBB to
make barring decisions about individuals living and working in Northern
Ireland. Both the Scottish and Northern Ireland legislation will be
finalised after the Bill has completed its passage through the House.
Secondary legislation made under the Government new clause will be
subject to the affirmative resolution procedure if it amends the
Bill&#146;s provisions or confers a power to make secondary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06102333000025">Government
amendments Nos. 120 and 129 provide that the IBB must not include
someone on a barred list if Scottish Ministers have already made a
decision about whether to include them on their list and the IBB has no
new evidence. That will prevent them from being considered for more
than one jurisdiction&#146;s list on the basis of the same
information, and therefore having to submit to different representation
and appeals procedures in each jurisdiction. The intention is that
inclusion on the Scottish, Northern Ireland, or England and Wales lists
will result in a bar from regulated activity across the
UK.</p><p><a name="06102333000026">The
amendments give the Secretary of State an order-making power that he
can use to ensure that someone is considered for listing by the most
appropriate barring authority, rather than by the barring authority
that first becomes aware of information that could lead to listing. For
example, if the IBB receives information about

is a member of the Scottish scheme, Scottish Ministers&#151;and not
the IBB&#151;should consider new information on their case.
Government amendment No. 131 provides that the Secretary of State must
tell Scottish Ministers if the IBB includes someone on a barred list,
to allow Scottish Ministers to ensure that the person cannot work with
either children or vulnerable adults in
Scotland.</p><p><a name="06102333000027">Government
new clause 20 allows certain powers to make secondary legislation to be
exercised by Welsh Ministers. The powers significantly cut across
devolved matters, such as the requirements for checks for school
governors. The new clause requires the Secretary of State to obtain the
agreement of Welsh Ministers before exercising secondary
legislation-making powers that provide for requirements and powers that
affect the National Assembly for Wales in its functions as an
inspectorate. In exercising the remaining significant secondary
legislation-making powers in the Bill, the Secretary of State must
consult Welsh Ministers in relation to the powers&#146; impact on
Wales.</p><p><a name="06102333000028">Government
amendment No. 132 provides that the IBB may provide information to
Welsh Ministers relevant to their functions&#151;formulating policy
and monitoring delivery of that policy. The amendments ensure that
vetting and barring operates successfully and coherently across the
United Kingdom, and I commend them to the
House.</p><p><a name="06102333000029"><b><a name="61023-0010.htm_spnew62"><a name="06102333000169">Mrs.
Maria Miller:</b> I welcome the Minister to our debate on the
thorny issue of devolution, which contributed greatly both to the
number of Government amendments that have been tabled and the delay
that prevented hon. Members from seeing them before our debate. It is
only right to probe the issue a little further, especially Government
amendment No. 120. I was surprised to learn that the IBB must not
include someone on a barred list</p><a name="61023-0010.htm_brev63"><a name="06102333000152"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;if a relevant Scottish authority

Minister give an undertaking that the UK will be bound to decisions
that are made in Scotland only if we have full confidence that the
Scottish equivalent of the IBB exercises the same burdens of proof and
conducts itself in the same way as the IBB? Will he confirm that there
is a similar provision in Scottish law, so that if the amendment is
accepted we can be sure that Scottish authorities will pay heed to
similar decisions made in the UK?</p><p><a name="06102333000031"><b><a name="61023-0010.htm_spnew64"><a name="06102333000170">Mr.
Lewis:</b> The hon. Lady makes a perfectly
reasonable and valid point, and I hope that I can clarify the
situation. The amendments deal with the theoretical possibility that
someone can be required to make representations or appeals against the
same evidence in England and Scotland when the restriction that is
imposed in both jurisdictions is the same&#151;a bar from regulated
activity across the UK. It would be unreasonable to require someone
already cleared in one jurisdiction to submit to the process in another
jurisdiction. In practice, we do not envisage circumstances arising in
which the IBB may wish to overturn a decision by Scottish Ministers

Dhanda:</b> The amendments help to ensure that the offences in
the Bill are appropriately focused and that they strengthen the
provisions relating to personnel suppliers and controlled
activity.</p><p><a name="06102333000056">New clauses
15 and 16, and amendments Nos. 208 to 216, 229 to 231, 233 and 234 are
technical amendments to ensure that the offences are appropriately
focused. Amendments Nos. 208 to 210 ensure that the person or body with
ultimate responsibility for regulated activity is responsible for
checking individuals engaging in regulated activity. If no check is
carried out, that person or body would be liable. In the case of an
employee of a crèche within a high street store, the store would
be the regulated activity provider. The amendments are important in
ensuring organisations take their responsibilities seriously.</p><p><a name="06102333000057">New clauses
15 and 16 and related amendments clarify the way offences bite on
employees, ensuring that any person, including employees of a regulated
activity provider, such as a school administrator, commits an offence
if he knows that someone is barred and he permits them to engage in
regulated activity. A person who acts on behalf of a regulated activity
provider or personnel supplier will commit an offence if he knowingly
permits an individual who is not subject to monitoring to engage in
regulated activity or if he supplies him for regulated activity. Those
who act on behalf of a regulated activity provider or employment
business are guilty of an offence if the failure of the regulated
activity provider or employment business to check was due to their
&#147;act or reckless default&#148;. For example, an employee of a
sports centre who fails to check on an individual who is being employed
to teach children&#146;s tennis lessons because he did not know it
was a requirement to check would not have committed an offence. That
goes back to what I was trying to explain earlier. Instead, the owner
of the sports centre, or the sports centre if it is a company, would
have committed the offence. However, if the centre manager asked
someone to carry out the check and he deliberately did not, the
individual would have committed the offence. That is both fair and
appropriate as it ensures that all individuals in the children&#146;s
or vulnerable adult&#146;s work force take seriously their
responsibilities and take the necessary steps to ensure that
individuals engaging in regulated activity are subject to monitoring.
It will increase the protection the scheme provides. The amendments
also allow us to take a similar approach to controlled
activity.</p><p><a name="06102333000058">We have
made important amendments to the requirements to check. Clause 15
provides an easement from the requirement to check when an individual
works in more than one NHS position at the same time&#151;for
example, a permanent NHS employee who also undertakes temporary NHS
work on their day off. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for
Health made a commitment to revisit the clause and we now agree that
relevant independent health care providers that provide NHS services
under contract with the NHS should also benefit from the provision.
Amendments Nos. 52 to 54 achieve this. For example, they would cover
when a particular NHS trust contracts with an independent health care
body to run a specialist treatment centre. If a member of staff
employed by the independent body to work in the treatment centre agrees
to cover a post at short notice within the NHS trust, the trust would
not be required to make an additional check.</p><br>

clause 17 gives the Secretary of State the power to place a requirement
on holders of certain positions to be subject to monitoring and to
place requirements on an appropriate person to check. These will enable
us to mirror the governor provisions in clauses 8(3) and 12 for certain
positions of authority, such as trustees of children&#146;s
charities. We plan to consider with the Charity Commission whether it
would be appropriate to require checks and in what circumstances.
Depending on the circumstances, that might be a requirement on, for
example, the chair of the trustees or a person nominated by the
trustees and checked by the Charity
Commission.</p><p><a name="06102333000060">Amendments
Nos. 218 to 220, 222, 228, 236 and new schedule 3 clarify how employers
can comply with their duty to check that an individual is subject to
monitoring and therefore not barred. They can do this themselves
through an online check or an enhanced disclosure, or they can obtain
equivalent confirmation from another source, such as an employment
agency. Enhanced disclosures provide more information than an online
check and can help employers assess whether an individual is suitable
for a particular position. Enhanced disclosures are currently required
in sectors involving very close contact with children, such as foster
care and children&#146;s homes. The new schedule provides the power
to require employers to obtain an enhanced disclosure or check an
individual&#146;s status via an online check to allow supervised
employment to begin while waiting for an enhanced
disclosure.</p><p><a name="06102333000061">New
schedule 3 also explains what information a regulated activity provider
must obtain from a personnel supplier or a contractor. For example, a
girls&#146; dance school that hires a teacher from an agency could
rely on written confirmation that the agency had registered an interest
in the individual and had no reason to believe the individual was not
subject to monitoring. However, if the employer was required to get an
enhanced disclosure through regulations under the Bill, it would be
required to obtain a copy of the enhanced disclosure from the agency.
New clause 18 and amendments Nos. 226 and 227 explain how checks of a
governor can be performed through an online check or an enhanced
disclosure.</p><p><a name="06102333000062">New clause
19, new schedule 2, and amendments Nos. 34, 35, 40 to 42 and 217
strengthen the provisions on personnel suppliers, such as employment
agencies and businesses. The new schedule ensures that an employment
business will commit an offence if it supplies an individual to engage
in regulated activity and has failed to ensure that the individual is
subject to monitoring. Amendments Nos. 34, 35 and 40 to 42 ensure that
a personnel supplier will commit an offence if it knowingly supplies an
individual who is barred or not subject to monitoring to engage in
regulated activity, even where the activity takes place only
occasionally.</p><p><a name="06102333000063">In response
to a previous debate in the House, we have sought to strengthen the
controlled activity provisions. New clause 22 and amendments Nos. 232
and 238 provide the power to place a series of mandatory requirements
on employers through regulations. We will use them to require employers
to check, and to introduce the necessary safeguards when employing a
barred person. I hope that that will be welcomed throughout the House,
because it was pushed in Committee. Failure to comply with the
regulations may result in a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up
to &#163;5,000.</p><br>

Loughton (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con):</b> This group
contains a good many Government amendments, as well as six new clauses
and a new schedule. The Minister said that many of the amendments were
technical, but there are also some important matters of principle.
Moreover, as my hon. Friends and I have already pointed out, we have
had to take on a huge amount of new material in a very short time. That
will add enormous complication to the Bill, as if it were not
complicated enough already. I do not think that this is the best way of
pursuing legislation. However helpful the Minister has sought to
be&#151;and there have been a few odd meetings&#151;there is still
an awful lot of material for us to
consider.</p><p><a name="06102333000066">I
welcome the strengthening of, for instance, measures relating to the
treatment of acts by children and to personnel suppliers. At the
beginning of the year there was a furore about paedophiles and other
undesirables gaining access to schools, and in Sussex, my part of the
world, personnel providers were seen as a weak link. It was a grey
area: there was confusion over whose responsibility it was to check the
background of certain people, including those supplied to teach or act
as classroom assistants. Did responsibility lie with the education
authority, or with the commercial business that provided the
staff?</p><p><a name="06102333000067">I am slightly
confused about the grammatical relationship between amendment No. 209
and clause 6. The amendment would add a third paragraph to subsection
(2)(a) and (b). As the word &#147;if&#148; already appears in the
first line of the subsection, adding the new paragraph would cause it
to appear twice. If that is not the case, why is the new paragraph
preceded by a pair of brackets? There may well be a technical point
here, if I may be terribly
pedantic.</p><p><a name="06102333000068">However,
there is also a point to be made about the content of the amendment. It
states that someone is a regulated activity provider</p><a name="61023-0011.htm_brev2"><a name="06102333000153"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;if the regulated activity is
carried out for the purposes of an organisation, his exercise of that
responsibility is not subject to supervision or direction by any other
person for those
purposes&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102333000069">Surely
that can apply only to single-handed organisations. Surely any person
working in an organisation&#151;be it a charity, a voluntary
provider, an independent provider, a commercial company or a
not-for-profit company&#151;will have a boss, a line manager, someone
who is ultimately responsible, unless the organisation is a one-man or
one-woman business. In that case, as I understand the amendment, that
one person would be the person whose activity would be subject to some
form of restriction. I am genuinely slightly mystified, without
disagreeing with the point that the amendment is trying to
make.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61023-0011.htm_ordayhd3"><a name="06102333000163">6.15

mean? Can the Minister give us any examples of circumstances in which
someone whom we would normally expect to be defined as a regulated
activity provider engaged in a regulated activity would suddenly be
exempt and given a get-out-of-jail card as a result of a determination
by the Secretary of State&#151;presumably by means of secondary
legislation, not subject to any further ratification by the House? The
Minister tried to give examples earlier to make the legislation
clearer, but only succeeded in further confusing Opposition Members, at
least. Perhaps he will have a better go at it this
time.</p><p><a name="06102333000072">Amendment 217
relates to clause 10, entitled &#147;Use of person not subject to
monitoring for regulated activity&#148;. According to my reading of
the amendment, the creation of offences in this context is not
retrospective. This is another confusing point, which needs to be made
absolutely clear to the many tens of thousands of people who will be
subject to the legislation. Those people, who may now be employed quite
legitimately, would be subject to restrictions or barred altogether if
they applied for their jobs once the legislation was in
force.</p><p><a name="06102333000073">Let us say
that a person occupies an existing post without having had to fulfil
the proposed requirements. The nature of the job may technically change
so that it becomes subject to vetting and barring procedures, although
the person concerned has not moved to another job. Perhaps he or she
works for a local authority. There have been big upheavals in social
services and children&#146;s services departments. The employee may
have previously worked in a department where he or she did not come
into contact with any vulnerable groups, because there were no such
groups within that department&#146;s remit. The department may then
have merged with or become subsidiary to another department where other
employees come into contact with vulnerable groups, young or
adult.</p><p><a name="06102333000074">The
employee&#146;s job will not necessarily have changed. His or her
contract of employment and pay and conditions need not have changed.
The job title may or may not have changed; but the organisation or
department may have changed. What obligations will that person have at
that stage, when continuing to do a job in exactly the same way as it
was done the day before the reorganisation? What penalties could befall
that person if he or she took no action? Would the defence of not
knowing come into play, meaning that the person was not subject to
prosecution?</p><p><a name="06102333000075">I
welcome Government amendment No 54, largely because we proposed it in
Committee. It is a shame that the cameo appearance of the
Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Bury, South
(Mr. Lewis), has apparently ended, because it was he who, in
Committee, took up the point that I made in proposing what was then
Conservative-led amendment No. 139. What was said can be found in
column 131 of the <i> Hansard </i>Standing Committee report. It was
pointed out that given the various changes in the national health
service, people were far more likely to come into contact with health
providers who were not employed by the NHS, any NHS trust or any
division of the NHS. They were providing an activity that was
contracted in, as is increasingly happening in the fragmentation of the
health service. Would it not be better if it referred to a person
providing a form of health care rather than to

provided? That, I believe, is what happens under amendment No. 54,
which I certainly welcome. Given that the health authority&#146;s
contents and purposes no longer exist, the Government have taken out
the reference to health authority from the list of what constitutes
various health providers.</p><p><a name="06102333000076">Having commented on the main

201&#151;the only one in the large group tabled by myself and my hon.
Friends. We are minded to divide the House on the amendment, which we
believe deals with an important principle, and hope to have the
opportunity to do so at some stage.</p><p><a name="06102333000077">The amendment
is designed to help the Minister in his inadvertent failure, seen
rather glaringly earlier, to decide what is inadvertency and what is
not. It is an important point because many people&#151;some have
calculated that it could be as many as a third of the adult working
population&#151;are inadvertently going to be covered and may become
subject to continuous criminal record vetting. Given that 10 million
Criminal Records Bureau checks have taken place since 2002, a very
large number of the population could now be subject to prosecution if
they do not take notice of&#151;and, potentially, take action
on&#151;the new legislation.</p><p><a name="06102333000078">The Minister will no doubt
agree with our contention&#151;he acknowledged in Committee that the
principle was right&#151;that it is unfair to penalise individuals
who did not know that they were barred from engaging in an activity. As
it stands, there are three main circumstances in which someone commits
an offence. Under clause 7, an individual commits an offence if
he</p><a name="61023-0011.htm_brev5"><a name="06102333000155"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;seeks to engage in
regulated activity from which he is
barred&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06102333000079">or</p><a name="61023-0011.htm_brev6"><a name="06102333000156"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;offers

in regulated activity from which he is
barred&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06102333000081">which is pretty
all encompassing. Furthermore, the guilt test is fairly low and the
onus of proof lies on the individual to show that they did not know
that they were committing an offence, rather than the other way round,
whereby it would have to be proved that they were acting misleadingly
in trying to disguise committing or intending to commit an
offence.</p><p><a name="06102333000082">As the
Minister acknowledged in Committee, it is not the Bill&#146;s
intention to criminalise people who may have been barred but who are
not aware, for whatever reason, of the position. Schedule 3, which
provides the guts of the legislation, has a very broad scope of
regulated activities and will potentially catch thousands of people who
are not directly involved in teaching or caring occupations, which form
the focus of many of the activities at which the Bill is
targeted.</p><p><a name="06102333000083"><b><a name="61023-0011.htm_spnew8"><a name="06102333000177">Anne

that there is an unequal emphasis in that an employer has to do his bit
and try his best, whereas a member of the public or a potential
employee who seek to have their behaviour regularised will, if not
careful, become criminalised? The degree of latitude afforded to the
employee does not seem to be equal to that which is implied by the
Minister&#146;s comments to be afforded to the
employer.</p><br>

quandary into which the Minister inadvertently ambled earlier was the
suggestion that an employer who carried out the necessary checks in
good faith, in accordance with the legislation as required, would be
fine, while if a subsequent check became necessary but was not carried
out because of some notion of inadvertence, it would constitute a
lesser offence than if someone had failed to take the necessary steps
to conduct a check or register in the first place. That is an entirely
discretionary reading. How does the Minister decide when an
employer&#146;s conduct is to be regarded as inadvertency for failing
to pursue the follow-through as opposed to a deliberate intention not
to bother because it would be against his interests to do
so?</p><p><a name="06102333000085"><b><a name="61023-0011.htm_spnew10"><a name="06102333000179">Mr.

Gentleman. The employer makes the check at the outset to see whether
someone is barred to establish whether they should be subject to
monitoring when taken on. The hon. Gentleman implies that the employer
regularly has to check up and will somehow be criminalised for not
doing so. It needs to be understood that the new system will ensure
constant updating of information by the Criminal Records Bureau, so if
someone subsequently ceases to be subject to monitoring, the employer
will be informed through the due processes.</p><p><a name="06102333000086"><b><a name="61023-0011.htm_spnew11"><a name="06102333000180">Tim

The Minister clearly set out his own interpretation of what should be
regarded as either inadvertent or deliberate, based on entirely
subjective grounds, which have no foundation in the Bill, as
Ihave interpreted it. The important point is that the
legislation is very complicated and places considerable requirements on
a large number of people who currently go about their business in good
faith and with no problems whatever, but who are subsequently going to
have to take full cognisance of the letter of the law, rather than some
discretionary interpretation that the Minister appears to have
provided.</p><p><a name="06102333000087"><b><a name="61023-0011.htm_spnew12"><a name="06102333000181">Mr.

have had their fun with the term &#147;inadvertent&#148;, which is
fine, but he will recall that I was specifically describing the
position around &#147;frequency&#148;. I said that someone had to
carry out a check to ensure that a person lay within the period
condition&#151;whether it be more than two days within every 30 days,
or within an overnight stay or working one day a month. If a court were
to decide that a person had not done the job properly with respect to

an entirely new dimension to the debate. The subject of frequency did
not come up at all when the inadvertency get-out clause, which the

that is very confusing for hon. Members who are trying to get to the
nitty-gritty of the legislation and it will be confusing for those who

problem is that it refers to three different scenarios in clause 7(1),

engage or actually engages. Clause 7(3) is not comprehensive enough to
defend everybody against all three scenarios&#151;acts that someone
might have committed inadvertently. That is why it is necessary to
introduce an intent provision. Surely it is better to have to prove
intent&#151;that someone intended to engage in regulated activity,
intended to offer to do so or intended to actually engage in
it.</p><p><a name="06102333000097">The Minister
mentioned earlier that communication of the requirements of the Bill
will be essential, and we remain to be convinced about how the

provide for a proper defence, which shows that someone did not just
drift into committing the offence. The onus should be on the prosecutor
to prove that the person had the intent to commit the

legal terms of art, there is also throughout the law of England and
Wales and, I suspect, in Scotland and Northern Ireland, too, the
concept of basic intent and the concept of specific intent; for
example, section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which
refers to the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. That is an offence
of specific intent, which means looking at the actions of an individual
and at what was passing through their mind&#151;their mens rea, or
guilty mind, to translate the Latin.</p><p><a name="06102333000119">The difficulty with amendment
No. 201 is that it relies on a wholly subjective test of the
individual&#146;s state of mind, because its first word is
disjunctive&#151;namely &#147;or&#148;. Were the amendment to be
passed, a person would no longer have the particular defence in the

simply have to say that they did not intend to seek to engage in an

Gentleman applies subjectivity to the test, but if he is to be
consistent he will have to agree that the Minister earlier introduced
an enormously subjective test of inadvertence that had no basis in the

somebody who carried out and followed the letter of the law, as set out
in the

concerns of hon. Members about unfairly criminalising individuals
because of their lack of understanding of the scheme, and about the
need for an effective communications campaign. Amendment No. 254 would
mean that a barred person had committed an offence only if they engaged
in regulated activity with the intention of misleading the IBB or a
regulated activity provider. Through amendment No. 255, that would
replace the defence that the Bill provides for a barred person who
engaged in regulated activity without realising that they were
barred.</p><p><a name="06102333000130">The

wanted to harm children and vulnerable adults to engage in regulated

Dhanda:</b> The safeguard that the amendment introduces could
be exploited by someone to get into schools or work closely with
vulnerable adults. Let us take as an example a barred person who did
not intend to mislead their employer. Perhaps they still want to work
with children, so they find an employer who knows they are barred to
collude with. Under the amendment, the individual would not be
committing an offence. That would be the consequence of the hon.
Lady&#146;s amendment. Are Opposition Members aware that the current
offence for a person on the POCA or POVA list applies if the individual
seeks to work in a regulated activity at present? Perhaps they do not
think it should.</p><p><a name="06102333000133">It
would not be helpful to introduce an element into clause 7 that is
based on the individual&#146;s intention to mislead. It does, though,
remain essential that an individual who does not know they are barred,
or could not reasonably be expected to know, is not criminalised for
seeking to engage in regulated activity. Far from providing a level of
protection for barred people, to remove this defence in the way
suggested by the second amendment would introduce a real risk that they
would be unfairly
criminalised.</p><p><a name="06102333000134"><b><a name="61023-0012.htm_spnew23"><a name="06102333000208">Tim

provides for a defence where a barred individual seeks to engage in
activity without realising that it was regulated activity. As well
intentioned as the amendment is, it is unnecessary and could introduce
a dangerous loophole that Opposition Members are on the verge of voting
to support. We certainly do not wish to criminalise individuals
unfairly, so we will ensure that the scheme is well understood. Before
the commencement of the Act, guidance will be issued that will provide
further detail about what type of activity will be covered by regulated
activity. We will consult with stakeholders about the most effective
means of ensuring that all those subject to the requirements of the
scheme are aware which roles will be covered by the definition of
regulated activity. We will also provide an advisory facility to
employers and individuals to help them comply with the requirements of
the
scheme.</p><p><a name="06102333000139">In
addition, when an individual is informed that they are barred, the
intention is that this communication will include an explanation of the
types of activity from which they are barred. Setting this out clearly
for newly barred people will help to minimise the risk that the
amendment seeks to address. The amendment could in

individuals would seek to escape the offence in the Bill by arguing
that they did not know that a particular activity was a regulated
activity. That is what Opposition Members are considering supporting in
the Lobby this evening. We are trying to keep devious paedophiles out
of our schools, and the possibility opened up by the amendment is too
great a risk. Hon. Members need to consider their position on the
issue.</p><p><a name="06102333000140">Government
amendments to which I shall speak later will remove the need for a
barred individual to consider the frequency of a particular activity.
The definition of regulated activity for the purposes of barring will
be simpler to understand as a result. This will make even more remote
the likelihood of engaging, or seeking to engage, in regulated activity
without knowing that it is regulated activity. The hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) claims that I am on the side of
the employer. That is not the case. We are providing clarity for the
employee about the meaning of frequency. He should concentrate and read
the Bill to understand
that.</p><p><a name="06102333000141">Amendments Nos.
256 and 257 are intended to prevent regulated activity providers or
appropriate officers from committing an offence if they fail to make an
appropriate check or obtain relevant information where they are not at
fault. Amendments Nos. 208 to 210 ensure that the person or body at the
top of an organisation is ultimately responsible for checking
individuals engaging in regulated activity. If no check is carried out,
that person or body would be liable. These amendments are important in
ensuring that organisations take their responsibilities
seriously.</p><p><a name="06102333000142">The hon.
Lady should be reassured that new clauses 15 and 16 and related
amendments ensure that individual employees of a regulated activity
provider who fail to make a check commit an offence only if their
failure to check was due to their act or reckless default. We believe
that this is both fair and appropriate. It ensures that individuals
take their responsibilities seriously but does not penalise individual
employees who are not at fault. I reiterate my previous commitments and
the commitments of my noble Friend in the other place that we intend to
have widespread ongoing communications to ensure that organisations and
individuals are aware of the requirements upon them.</p><p><a name="06102333000143"><i> Question put and agreed

Dhanda:</b> I shall now deal with Government
amendments. Amendments Nos. 137 and 138 clarify that no one will be
automatically barred on caution or conviction for an offence committed
when they were under the age of 18. I know that that will be
particularly welcomed by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole
(Annette Brooke), who raised this matter in Committee. In addition, no
one will be automatically barred for an order, such as a sexual
offences prevention order, which was made against them when they were
under the age of 18. Under-18s will, of course, be barred where
appropriate, but they will have the opportunity to make representations
to the IBB first.</p><p><a name="06102335000038">Previous debates have raised
queries about the treatment of pornography in the Bill. Our amendments
will align the references to pornography in relation to what behaviour
the IBB can consider for the purpose of inclusion in the lists. That
fulfils commitments made at previous stages of the Bill&#146;s
progress. I remind the House that the IBB is already able to consider
any behaviour involving pornography that harms a child or vulnerable
adult. These amendments will catch conduct that does not necessarily
harm a vulnerable person, but which could indicate that the individual
is a risk to the vulnerable. The pornography amendments&#151;Nos. 114
to 118 and Nos. 122 to 127&#151;ensure that the IBB can consider
behaviour involving child pornography and conduct involving violent
pornography that the IBB considers to be
inappropriate.</p><p><a name="06102335000039"><b><a name="61023-0014.htm_spnew9"><a name="06102335000091">Anne

&#147;gratification&#148;. In some recommended reading of the
Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Health there
is an extremely graphic description of a sexual relationship between a
14-year-old boy and a 10-year-old boy, both of which depict children
and explicit sexual activities. One might argue that edification is
somehow better than gratification. I feel that the involvement of
children in this sort of activity should be deplored, full stop, and
not only if there is
gratification.</p><p><a name="06102335000041"><b><a name="61023-0014.htm_spnew11"><a name="06102335000092">Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I will not stray too wide of the subject of the
Bill. The hon. Lady has got hold of her press release for the day, but
I do not think that it is relevant to the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102335000042">As
I was saying, the pornography amendments&#151;Nos. 114 to 118 and 122
to 127&#151;ensure that the IBB can consider behaviour involving
child pornography and conduct involving violent pornography that the
IBB considers to be inappropriate. That applies equally to barring for
both lists&#151;a change that has been made as a result of a debate
in another place&#151;thereby expanding the focus of the
children&#146;s list from just child pornography, so that it also
includes violent
pornography.</p><p><a name="06102335000043">Interest
in child pornography is a matter that we wish the IBB to be able to
consider, given the sexual interest in children that that indicates.
Clearly, anyone who is unable to understand that that is unacceptable
behaviour is precisely the kind of person that the scheme was designed
to consider for barring. Similar considerations apply in respect of the
most extreme and violent forms of pornography. The Secretary of State
has the power to give guidance to the IBB in relation to inappropriate
behaviour involving violent pornography. It is intended that that
should be used so that acceptable behaviour involving adult pornography
is excluded from consideration, while all pornography that is unlawful
can be considered.</p><p><a name="06102335000044"><b><a name="61023-0014.htm_spnew12"><a name="06102335000093">Tim

merits a bit more attention than the Minister was prepared to give to
my hon. Friendthe Member for St. Albans (Anne Main). How will
the welcome new legislation that the Minister&#146;s colleagues at
the Home Office will introduce on dealing with extreme images,
particularly on the internet, interface with this legislation? Will it
just be the case that anything not covered by that, which will be
difficult to define, will be covered by a get-out clause in terms of
this legislation? Will the Minister make mention of that, because it is
important?</p><p><a name="06102335000045"><b><a name="61023-0014.htm_spnew13"><a name="06102335000094">Mr.

Home Office. I assure the House that that is the case.</p><p><a name="06102335000047">Amendments Nos. 113, 119, 121
and 128 respond to the debate on standards of proof that took place in
Committee, when I clarified that the balance of probabilities applies
to deciding matters of fact. The amendments make clear that a two-stage
test applies in discretionary barring cases. In cases being considered
because an individual has engaged in behaviour that has harmed a
vulnerable person&#151;I refer Members to amendments No. 113 and
121&#151;the IBB must first be satisfied that the individual has
engaged in relevant behaviour, before going on to consider whether it
is appropriate to include the individual in the list. In respect of
individuals who are considered to present a risk of harm to the
vulnerable, the IBB must first be satisfied that the individual poses a
risk of harm, and then go on to consider whether that risk justifies
including the individual in the
list.</p><p><a name="06102335000048">Amendment No.
139 ensures that the court is under a duty to inform an individual who
is convicted of an automatic barring offence that the IBB will bar him
as a result, putting the convicted person in no doubt from the earliest
possible moment.</p><p><a name="06102335000049">Amendment No.
98 provides that an order under amendments No. 120 and 129 should be
subject affirmative resolution procedure. Amendments Nos. 120 and 129
were discussed earlier. They allow the Secretary of State to specify by
order the criteria that must apply in considering whether it is more
appropriate that the IBB or Scottish Ministers should consider a
person&#146;s
case.</p><p><a name="06102335000050">Amendment
No. 112 gives the IBB a power to make ex gratia compensation payments
to any individuals who are adversely affected by IBB
maladministration&#151;a point that was made in Committee by the hon.
Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather).</p><p><a name="06102335000051">Finally, new
clause 23 and new schedule 4 create a new clause and new schedule
specifying powers to transfer individuals from existing barred lists to
the new children&#146;s and vulnerable adults&#146; barred lists.
Paragraph 1 of the new schedule allows the Secretary of State to
require the IBB to advise him on decisions under the current schemes.
That will help a seamless transition to take place. Paragraphs 2 and 3
relate to children and vulnerable adults respectively, and enable the
Secretary of State to make an order setting out the procedure to be
followed for transition and to ensure that the IBB can be required to
include automatically, or consider for inclusion, anyone included in
the current lists. I commend these amendments to the
House.</p><p><a name="06102335000053"><b><a name="61023-0014.htm_spnew14"><a name="06102335000095">Tim
Loughton:</b> I do not propose to detain the
House for long on this group of amendments, especially as we had a
lengthy debate on the last group we dealt with. I welcome some of the
amendments that the Minister has just whizzed through, in particular
the new provisions in respect of the treatment of children who could be
caught up without any intention at all in some of this legislation.
That matter was raised by Committee members of all parties. As always,
I welcome additional safeguards in respect of affirmative resolution
procedure for some of the measures, which the Minister has
mentioned.</p><br>

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1303</b><br><p><a name="06102335000054">I want briefly to discuss the
six amendments, which are meant to be constructive, in my name and
those of my hon. Friends. Those dealing with harm were not debated in
Committee, when we should perhaps have debated that issue at length.
Amendments Nos. 204 and 205 would add to the Bill definitions of harm
that are in no way controversial; indeed, I do not understand why they
are not already in clause 27 and the Bill&#146;s glossary. The Bill
would be enhanced if we added to clause 27 the original definitions of
harm given in the Children Act 1989, along with the definitions given
in further amendments to that Act, and as contained in the Adoption and
Children Act 2002&#151;I remember debating them&#151;which include
harm being caused by exposure to the ill treatment of another. The
latter definitions were concerned with the impact that scenes of
domestic violence might have on vulnerable children, and a dignity
definition was also added later.</p><p><a name="06102335000055">Amendment No. 205 would also
add the following, further definition of
harm:</p><a name="61023-0014.htm_brev15"><a name="06102335000082"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In this
section harm includes intentionally or negligently causing a child or
vulnerable adult to suffer financial loss or
deprivation.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102335000056">That is
particularly pertinent to those who take advantage of vulnerable
adults, be they the elderly and infirm or those with learning
disabilities. Such people might be harmed by somebody defrauding them,
in effect, of their funds, livelihood or property. It is clear that
harm would be done to them in such circumstances, because they would
suffer a financial loss or some form of deprivation resulting from that
loss. Such deprivation could apply in various other circumstances,
including those where the treatment of children was an
issue.</p><p><a name="06102335000057">The amendments
would be a useful addition to the Bill and would make it absolutely
clear how all-encompassing harm can be. Harm is not simply a question
of punching somebody on the nose; there are many other ways of causing
harm to an individual, particularly a vulnerable individual, without
being as unsubtle as that.</p><p><a name="06102335000058">Our other amendments in this
group&#151;Nos. 11, 13, 12 and 7&#151;deal with the burden of proof
and are linked somewhat to the previous debate, so I shall not go into
them in great detail. Amendment No. 11 would remove the very woolly and
subjective word &#147;thinks&#148; from clause 27 and replace it
with the more legalistic term &#147;has reason to suspect&#148;.
Amendment No. 13 would replace the word &#147;if&#148; in schedule
2 with the phrase</p><a name="61023-0014.htm_brev16"><a name="06102335000083"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;on
the balance of
probabilities&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102335000059">It is a
shame that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)
is not here, because he could apply his legal brain to that amendment
and either cast it out on the basis that it is a double negative, or
agree with it in order to enhance the Bill.</p><p><a name="06102335000060">We need to
include a definition for lower thresholds of proof, which is what
amendment No. 12 seeks to do. Of course, in law &#147;beyond
reasonable doubt&#148; is at the top of the hierarchy of proof,
followed by &#147;balance of probabilities&#148; and &#147;has
reason to suspect&#148;. In summary, amendment No. 11 would replace
&#147;thinks&#148; with the latter phrase, and amendment No. 13
would replace &#147;if&#148; with &#147;balance of
probabilities&#148;. Similarly, amendment

the phrase &#147;has reason to

Minister will welcome these amendments, rather than displaying the
petulance that he displayed when we considered our amendments in the
previous group, through which we were trying to be helpful. We were
certainly not in the business of furthering the activities of
paedophiles through those amendments, as he rather clumsily suggested,
I think, earlier. The amendments in this group try to establish some
basis in law for the fairness that we want to provide for everybody
concerned. This legislation will work only if it is practical and is
seen to be workable and fair by everybody concerned. If it is not, it
simply will not work, and we will end up pursuing and prosecuting a lot
of people who are in fact innocent of the charges set out in this
legislation, and who certainly never had any intention of abusing
vulnerable children and adults. In the process, we could well miss the
genuine wrongdoers who are able to circumvent the law, and on whom our
priorities should surely be placed in trying to ensure that the
legislation is
workable.</p><p><a name="06102335000062">These are
constructive amendments, tabled in an effort to enhance the Bill and to
make it more watertight. As such, I hope that the Minister will respond
to them in a rather more positive and less churlish way than he did to
our amendments in the previous
group.</p><p><a name="06102335000063"><b><a name="61023-0014.htm_spnew18"><a name="06102335000096">Annette
Brooke:</b> I welcome the Government amendments that establish
in the Bill that under-18s will not automatically be barred from
working with children or vulnerable adults without the right to
representations. There are a number of other Government amendments in
this group that we support, particularly those clarifying the situation
regarding pornography.</p><p><a name="06102335000064">However, there is an aspect of
the under-18s debate that the Government amendments do not cover. There
are two circumstances in which the situation for under-18s is very
different from that for adults. First, let us consider young people in
a mutual sexual relationship where one party is under the age of
consent&#151;for example, a 17-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl.
We know that such a relationship gives rise to difficulties under
sexual offences legislation. Secondly, we must also consider young
people who display sexually harmful behaviour.</p><p><a name="06102335000065">I believe that all children who
have been abused&#151;about 16 per cent. of all children have been
abused&#151;should be offered therapeutic services. However, it is
estimated that 90 per cent. of children in such circumstances receive
no substantial support. Those are horrendous statistics and as is
known, many children and young people who have been abused go on to
abuse other children and vulnerable people, which is why the provision
of therapeutic services is absolutely vital. Our new clause 24 calls
for the IBB to</p><a name="61023-0014.htm_brev19"><a name="06102335000084"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;make a
referral for therapeutic purposes, as specified in

it&#151;</p><a name="61023-0014.htm_brev20"><a name="06102335000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;for a person
under the age of 18 included on the children&#146;s barred list after
representations have been

provision would also apply to the adults&#146; barred
list.</p><p><a name="06102335000068">There is no
comprehensive national strategy for children and young people who
sexually abuse other children. Different local authorities take very
different approaches to this work. Policy is unclear and services on
the ground are sporadic. There is a worrying lack of knowledge and
threadbare provision, and in general there is poor access to specialist
treatment provision for many children in need of such services.
Treating sexual abusers in any way other than punitively may be
politically unpopular, and it is difficult to communicate complex
messages about that group of people.</p><p><a name="06102335000069">One difficultly is knowing
whether sexual behaviour is harmless. Many children engage in
activities that form a normal part of their sexual development, but
sexual behaviour by young people exists on a continuum from mutually
agreed experimentation to serious behaviour, such as multiple rape.
Indeed, research shows that juveniles commit almost one quarter of all
sexual offences, and such studies also contain clear evidence that many
such children have suffered abuse or trauma. In particular, such
behaviour is linked to sexual abuse, domestic violence and poor
attachment, and a significant proportion of those who are seen by
specialist services have severe emotional or learning
difficulties.</p><p><a name="06102335000070">It is
essential that child protection and criminal justice agencies work
together and that there is a clear obligation on social services
departments to respond to that group of children and young people from
a child protection perspective. Children and young peoplewho
go down the criminal justice route are unlikely to have their needs
assessed adequately. The outcomes resulting from the different routes
are inevitably very different. Social services may take no further
action, whereas a custodial sentence can lead to a child being placed
on the sex offenders
register.</p><p><a name="06102335000071">Initial
abusive behaviour is often the response of a vulnerable set of children
to their own experiences and difficulties, and it is a way of
expressing anger and exerting power by those with complex issues and
needs. Such children are still in the process of growing up, and they
can be helped away from spiralling patterns of sexual abuse by an
appropriate therapeutic
intervention.</p><p><a name="06102335000072"><b><a name="61023-0014.htm_spnew21"><a name="06102335000097">Robert
Key (Salisbury) (Con):</b> Where do parents fit in? I have
listened carefully, and the hon. Lady is making a lot of sense, but
should specialist services not be provided to parents in such cases?
The matter involves not only children, specialist agencies, clinicians
and social services, but parents, too. If parents are not involved, it
is likely that children will
fail.</p><p><a name="06102335000073"><b><a name="61023-0014.htm_spnew22"><a name="06102335000098">Annette

possible that parents may have abused a child who goes on to abuse
others, which occurs more than occasionally.</p><br>

again raise a constituency case. My constituents are the parents of
someone who is in jail and who will probably never come out. At the age
of 14, that person committed a minor sexual offence, and his parents
sought an independent psychiatric report, for which they had to pay
themselves. The report concluded that their son posed no danger to
others in society, but he went on to commit a terrible offence when he
was aged 19, which was a tragedy for two sets of parents. We do not
know whether treatment would have worked, if it had been available in
that case, but it might have worked, which is why I passionately feel
that we need the proper provision of therapeutic services nationwide. I
want the Minister to accept that such a provision should be included in
the Bill, which is the only way to make the service available to all
those who need it. I hope that the Minister will give the matter his
full consideration tonight, even at this very late stage.</p><p><a name="06102335000075">Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 would
allow the tribunal to consider appeals from the IBB, if relevant facts
emerge after the IBB has made its decision. We debated that point in
Committee, where my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah
Teather) made a number of valid points. However, having reread the
Committee <i> Hansard</i>, we do not feel that that the question has
been adequately addressed and therefore make no apology for raising it
again.</p><p><a name="06102335000076">Clause 4
contains the process that allows an appeal against a decision made by
the IBB. It permits appeals to the tribunal, which was created by the
Protection of Children Act 1999, against decisions not to remove people
from the barred list or to include people on the barred list. When the
Bill was originally published, an appeal was only permissible on a
point of law, which caused considerable concern because a successful
challenge would have had to establish that the IBB had made a mistake
in the decision-making process, so we are pleased that the grounds for
appeal have been extended to include the facts on which the
IBB&#146;s decision is based.</p><p><a name="06102335000077">We suggest that appeals to the
tribunal should also include appeals on facts not available to the IBB
when the original decision was made, because there are likely to be
situations in which relevant facts come to light after an IBB hearing.
As clause 4(4) requires the tribunal&#146;s permission to make an
appeal, it will not permit vexatious or merit-free appeals, but it will
give the tribunal appropriate leeway to consider relevant activity. I
ask the Minister to consider whether the Bill covers new facts emerging
after the IBB&#146;s
decision.</p><p><a name="06102335000078">Amendments
Nos. 249 and 251 concur with Conservative amendments Nos. 204 and 205.
They are based on the same premise that the definition in the Children
Act 1989, which covers a range of physical as well as non-physical
forms of mistreatment, was satisfactory. Our amendments would add
&#147;financial harm&#148; to the definition of harm, and the
Conservative amendments specifically mention &#147;dignity&#148;,
although I feel that that is included in the definition of &#147;ill
treatment&#148; in the 1989 Act. The IBB will make critical decisions
on risk of harm, but how can it make such decisions if the Bill does
not include a clear definition of &#147;harm&#148;? Given the lack
of a clear-cut definition, that cannot be the correct process by which
to judge whether somebody should be on a barred list.</p><br>

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1307</b><br><p><a name="06102335000079">Conservative amendments Nos. 11
and 12 would leave out &#147;thinks&#148; and insert &#147;has
reason to suspect&#148;, and we have signed up to them. We had a long
debate on the matter in Committee, where my hon. Friend the Member for
Brent, East and I were convinced that the use of the word
&#147;thinks&#148; was wrong, which is one of many examples how
this important Bill is woolly at the edges. It is all very well for the
Minister to suggest that we are trying to encourage paedophiles to take
up inappropriate activities, but throughout the passage of the Bill we
have been committed to tightening up the definitions so that the
mechanism is clear, consistent and controlled, which is
important.</p><p><a name="06102335000080">The
principle behind amendments Nos. 252 and 253 is the most important in
this group. As Conservative Members have said, people will
automatically be placed on the barred list, and there will be no right
to make representations under the Bill as it stands. We have been told
that the categories of offences that will lead to inclusion on the list
without the right to make representations will be introduced in
secondary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06102338000009">Given
the offences on the illustrative list, it is difficult to think that
there will be too much to worry about. The problem is that we do not
know precisely which list of offences the Minister will bring forth
when the regulations are introduced. As I understand it, a list of the
offences that will place somebody on the automatic barring list if they
are convicted or cautioned will be approved by affirmative resolution.
That means that we will have to vote against the whole list or for the
whole list&#151;there is nothing in between. There is no scope for
affirmative resolution to modify the list.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61023-0015.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="06102338000529">7.30

the Member for Brent, East and I attempted to table a suitable
amendment, but its complexity was beyond our skills, which is probably
why it was not selected. However, we received a great deal of support
from the Bill Clerks who helped us to write it, and I express my
gratitude for that. The amendment proposed a super-affirmative
resolution that would allow us to make modifications when considering
the secondary legislation. That procedure was used when we debated the
Identity Cards
Bill&#151;</p><p><a name="06102338000011"><b><a name="61023-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="06102338000532">Mr.

on.</p><p><a name="06102338000013">As
I said, there is a precedent for this procedure, so I would like the
Minister to consider it. However, as an alternative we suggest an
amendment to automatic barring whereby a person should be given the
opportunity to make representations on why he should be moved from the
children&#146;s barred list or from the adults&#146; banned list
where there are exceptional circumstances, but only in cases based on a
caution. As I said, it is difficult to find examples from the current
list, because they are pretty awful offences for which someone would
end up on the barred list. The amendment would establish a presumption
that certain people will be on the barred list but leave the
possibility of exceptional circumstances.</p><br>

Rights has expressed concern
that</p><a name="61023-0015.htm_brev3"><a name="06102338000525"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the list of
criteria for automatic inclusion on the barred lists has not been

that the lack of provisions on representation could create an
incompatibility between the Bill and articles 6 and 8 of the European
convention on human rights. Article 6 clearly provides a right to a
public hearing. That has been described as a fundamental guarantee, the
purpose of which is to protect litigants from the administration of
justice in secret with no public scrutiny. The Bill provides for no
public scrutiny. Case law has established that any procedures where
civil rights are determined without hearing the parties&#146;
submissions are incompatible with article
6.</p><p><a name="06102338000016">Our amendment
would, in place of the automatic bar, give the IBB a power to allow
people not to be placed on the list in exceptional circumstances. I
stress that that would apply only in respect of a caution. For example,
somebody who is just over 18 may not have realised the age of a girl
with whom he has engaged in a sexual relationship. The IBB should have
the scope to decide that the circumstances are so unusual that the
person concerned presents no danger.</p><p><a name="06102338000017">Amendments Nos. 243, 244, 246,
245 and 248 deal with an issue that was debated at considerable length
in the other place&#151;the basis on which an assessment of the risk
of harm might be made. It was suggested that a recently qualified
counsellor&#151;not many qualifications are required&#151;might
become concerned by comments made or fantasies expressed to them by a
patient and could pass them on for assessment by a professional in the
field. Of course, confidentiality issues are
involved.</p><p><a name="06102338000018">I hope that
the Minister will give due consideration to the many amendments to
which I have

Dhanda:</b> Let me begin with the therapeutic services that
the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)
mentioned. We have discussed the matter on several occasions, and when
we met last week she was kind enough to let me know that she intended
to raise it. Although I am sympathetic to the argument about providing
therapeutic services, the Bill is not the appropriate place to do that,
not least because it would involve the &#147;Every Child
Matters&#148; onion of services. This is an enabling Bill to set up
an independent barring board to make barring decisions, not a Bill
related to those services.</p><p><a name="06102338000020">On automatic barring, the hon.
Lady rightly says that there is a draft list on which we will consult
widely. After 10 years, even those who are automatically barred will
have a right to appeal, if they wish to take it up. We are discussing
that list with stakeholders. If I may, I will read out some of the
offences from the list of offences giving rise to automatic barring. In
respect of the children&#146;s list, they
include:</p><a name="61023-0015.htm_brev5"><a name="06102338000021"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;An

by the illustrative list, we saw no reason to think that there would be
a problem. Our concern, however, is that we have not seen the final
list, and that we shall be able to vote yes or no only when we see it;
we shall not be able to modify it unless the Minister undertakes to use
the super-affirmative resolution procedure to allow us to do
so.</p><p><a name="06102338000028"><b><a name="61023-0015.htm_spnew11"><a name="06102338000536">Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I can tell the hon. Lady that I am committed to
ensuring that there is a dialogue, and that we involve stakeholders
when we set up the list. The list to which I have referred is
illustrative of where we are coming from with regard to these
offences.</p><p><a name="06102338000029">Amendments
Nos. 1 and 2, which provide for an appeal to the Care Standards
Tribunal on the basis of a fact that was unavailable to the IBB when it
made its barring decision, are unnecessary. The IBB already has the
power to reconsider its decisions where new facts are available that
were relevant to the decision to bar. I hope that that will give hon.
Members food for thought, and that they will reconsider the amendments
in the light of that. It would be surprising, for example, if the IBB
barred a person on the basis of a conviction that was quashed following
the decision to bar, and the board was not then able to reconsider the
case. I am pleased to put it on record that the IBB will have this
power, under paragraph 13(1)(d) of schedule 1. The procedure in such a
case would be for the barred individual to apply to the IBB for his
case to be reconsidered on the basis of the new factual evidence. This
process would be simpler, quicker and cheaper than providing for an
appeal to the Care Standards Tribunal.</p><p><a name="06102338000030">New clause 24
would require the IBB to refer barred people under 18 years old to
therapeutic services. I have just explained my thinking on that issue,
and I hope that that will satisfy hon. Members. Amendment No. 7 relates
to paragraph 17(5) of schedule 2, which provides that the IBB must not
take into account police information that the chief police officer
&#147;thinks&#148; it would not be in the interests of the
prevention or detection of crime to disclose to the person under
consideration. The amendment seeks to replace &#147;thinks&#148;
with &#147;has reason to believe&#148;. This amendment is
unnecessary in drafting terms. It is intended that the chief officer
should &#147;think&#148; that it

disclose the information on the basis of a reasonable thought. So the
chief officer must have a reason to justify his belief. This is lawyer
talk, but these are the assurances that we have been given by our
lawyers. On the introduction of the Bill in another place, subsections
(1) and (3) of clause 26 contained the expression &#147;reasonably
thinks&#148;. By amendments made at an early stage in the
Bill&#146;s progress the word &#147;reasonably&#148; was removed
for the same reason&#151;the word was considered legally
unnecessary.</p><p><a name="06102338000031">Amendment
No. 11 applies to the obligation to refer to the IBB. This obligation
arises when the employer dismisses or would have dismissed an employee.
It is the employer&#146;s own reason for making the dismissal that is
important for purposes of the obligation to refer. There is no
practical difference between an employer who has dismissed an employee
because he &#147;thinks&#148; that the employee has harmed a child
and an employer who has dismissed an employee because he has
&#147;reason to suspect&#148; that the employee has harmed a
child.</p><p><a name="06102338000032">As we said in
Committee, there is no question of a certain standard of proof having
to be met before referrals under this clause have to be made. It will
be for the IBB, when assessing the evidence, to determine whether the
employee engaged in relevant conduct, and that will be assessed on the
balance of probabilities. It is important that the IBB has all the
evidence available to it on which to make a decision. It can then
decide whether to accept the evidence. That is part of the professional
judgment that we will expect the board to
make.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61023-0015.htm_ordayhd12"><a name="06102338000530">7.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06102338000033">Under amendment
No. 12 the IBB would have to give permission for a review of a previous
decision to bar an individual. Paragraph 16 of schedule 2 already
ensures that, when barred people ask for a review of their case, the
IBB can refuse their request if it is obvious that there is no prospect
of success. Our intention is that the IBB only has to
&#147;think&#148; that someone may have a reasonable case for a
review in order to give permission for a review to go ahead. In other
words, the board must believe that it is possible that the
individual&#146;s circumstances have changed. It does not have to be
satisfied that the person should be removed from the list at the stage
at which it grants permission for a review. I hope that that
explanation will satisfy hon. Members.</p><p><a name="06102338000034">Amendment No. 13 raises the
issue of the standard of proof in relation to the decision to include
someone in the children&#146;s list. Government amendment No. 113
makes it clear that this is a two-stage decision. The first stage is
for the IBB to establish whether someone has engaged in
&#147;relevant conduct&#148;. The board must be satisfied of this
on the balance of probabilities, as we discussed in Committee. Having
taken legal advice, however, I am satisfied that it is neither
necessary nor usual to put such a requirement on the face of the Bill.
The second stage is for the IBB to judge whether it is appropriate to
bar the individual, and, as this is an expert opinion, it is not
susceptible to a standard of proof. It is a matter for the IBB&#146;s
judgment.</p><br>

would ensure that all those who receive cautions for offences that
would otherwise lead to automatic barring without the right to make
representations would be given the right to make representations in
relation to any exceptional circumstances that might warrant their
removal from the list. I have already set out where we are coming from
on this issue. In the case of cautions, an individual has admitted
their guilt and we believe that they should be treated in the same way
as someone who has been convicted of that offence. The automatic
barring offences, without a right to make representations, will be
restricted to a small number of the most serious sexual offences such
as the rape of a child and the others that I mentioned earlier. In
regard to these few offences, we do not believe that any exceptional
circumstances could justify the individual being allowed to work with
children. This is a clear and important safeguard under the new scheme,
and we would not wish to water it
down.</p><p><a name="06102338000036">Amendment No.
251 was contingent on a new clause that was tabled by the Opposition
tabled but not selected. On its own, it would mean that the regulations
prescribing the offences that lead to automatic barring would not be
subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p><p><a name="06102338000037">Amendments Nos. 243 to 248 deal
with people who are referred to the IBB on the ground that, although
they have not engaged in relevant conduct, they may present a risk of
harm to children or vulnerable adults. Amendments Nos. 243, 245, 247
and 248 would require the IBB to obtain an opinion from an appropriate
professional that indicated that the person may present a risk of harm
to children or vulnerable adults, before it could propose to include
the person in either barred list. I reassure hon. Members that the
practice of the IBB will ensure that expert views are obtained where
appropriate. The IBB will itself be an expert body and will be able to
assess a case once the evidence has been
assembled.</p><p><a name="06102338000038">Amendments
Nos. 204 and 205 seek to provide a definition of harm to cover where an
employer has to refer information to the IBB because an individual may
pose a risk of harm to a child or vulnerable adult. Although I
sympathise with the intention behind the amendments, I still believe
that the Bill deals with the matter in the right way. Amendment No. 204
seeks to incorporate the concept of dignity, and amendment No. 205 the
concept of financial loss, in the term harm. Those are both important
concepts, but they would be included in the normal meaning of the term
harm, which encompasses financial deprivation and the impairment of
self-esteem and self-respect. Were we to accept the amendments, there
would be a risk that if a further type of harm needed to be covered in
future, it would be necessary to amend the definition through primary
legislation&#151;a problem that would not arise were we to rely on
the normal meaning of the word. I therefore ask hon. Members not to
press their amendments.</p><p><a name="06102338000039"><i> Question put and agreed

Dhanda:</b> As the Bill has progressed through both Houses,
few matters have been more subject to debate and examination than what
has come to be known as the &#147;frequency test&#148;. Similarly,
many of our key stakeholders have engaged us in constructive
discussions about our intentions for that.</p><p><a name="06102345000098">In the Bill,
&#147;frequently&#148; is key to the definition of most forms of
regulated activity. For the bar, the requirements to check and the
requirements to be subject to monitoring to apply, the activity in most
contexts has to be carried out frequently. Debate has focused on two
critical issues: first, whether barred individuals should be able to
undertake any work involving close contact with vulnerable groups, and
secondly, how employers and individuals should interpret the term
&#147;frequently&#148;. The Government amendments cover both
issues.</p><p><a name="06102345000099">For the
application of the bar, the concern put to us is that even very brief
or occasional contact with a barred person constitutes too great a
risk. We have received several representations from stakeholders,
including the NSPCC, about that. We have listened carefully to the
debate and further considered our original position. Consequently, I am
now moving amendments that would prevent people on a barred list from
engaging in regulated activity and make it a criminal offence for an
employer to engage them, even when the activity was brief or
occasional. I hope that the House will support that, although, after
dividing on amendment No. 201, I am not sure whether that will happen.
However, that is the rationale behind amendments Nos. 29 and 38, the
result of which would be that, when an individual was barred, he would
be barred&#151;full stop. That is the right way forward. It means
that a barred volunteer would be prevented from helping out at a summer
youth camp, even if it took place over only a day or two.</p><p><a name="06102345000100">However, we recognise that, in
an emergency, it may be necessary for barred individuals to engage
ina specific regulated activity and that to criminalise them
for doing so would be counter-productive. Amendments Nos. 28 and 37
create a defence when a barred individual has to engage in regulated
activity to prevent harm and when no one else is around who could
engage in that specific activity. That is intended to cover only a
limited range of situations, for example, 
<br>

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1318</b><br>when a doctor barred from working with children has to administer first
aid to a child who has had an accident in the
street.</p><p><a name="06102345000101">Amendments
Nos. 31, 43, 48, 141, 145, 146, 149, 156 and 159 will make
consequential changes on that modified approach to the application of
the bar elsewhere in the Bill. I should also mention that amendment No.
42 means that the frequency of an activity will also be irrelevant in
relation to the requirement on personnel suppliers to ensure that an
individual whom they supply is subject to
monitoring.</p><p><a name="06102345000102">Also in
that territory, amendments Nos. 143 and 158 are intended to ensure, for
example, that a barred parent can enter a school to attend their
child&#146;s parents&#146; evening or that an individual on the
adults&#146; barred list can visit their sick mother in a care home.
However, a barred person who carries out an activity in a school, for
example, with the opportunity for contact with vulnerable groups will
be prevented from doing so where the activity involves work, paid or
unpaid, in connection with the purposes of the
school.</p><p><a name="06102345000103">While a barred
person will now be barred from regulated activity of any duration, we
believe that the requirements to check and to be subject to monitoring

threshold. Our amendments will clarify that threshold, taking on board
our debates on the
issue.</p><p><a name="06102345000104">Amendments Nos.
140, 142, 153, 157 and 169 set out the circumstances in which the
Government intend that the requirements to check and to be subject to
monitoring should kick in. They ensure that activities that take place
overnight will be regulated activity. They also define contact taking
place on three or more days in a 30-day period as regulated activity.
Those circumstances are referred to in amendment No. 169 as the
&#147;period condition&#148;. Similar revisions are made to the
definition of controlled activity by amendments Nos. 56, 57 and
64.</p><p><a name="06102345000105">That means that
employers will be required to check, and individuals will need to be
subject to monitoring, if they are operating, for example, a conference
crèche for children that lasts for three days or
longer.</p><p><a name="06102345000106"><b><a name="61023-0016.htm_spnew10"><a name="06102345000574">Annette

want to put a specific question, and he might be able to answer later
if I ask it now. Can he confirm that a crèche that is operated
for less than two hours per day, which means that it does not come
within Ofsted regulations, but which is in a fairly public
place&#151;for example, a sports centre in a town centre&#151;and
which, for the most part, but not necessarily, has different children
attending every day, is covered by the provisions in the
Bill?</p><p><a name="06102345000107"><b><a name="61023-0016.htm_spnew11"><a name="06102345000575">Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I understand that that is a regulated activity,
but these provisions are not about the frequency of the activity
provided by the provider, but how frequently an employee is at work. If
the hon. Lady is asking about an employee who works for only two hours
a month, that is a different question. If she is asking about regulated
activity, that is defined by the nature of that activity. So, yes, I
understand that that is a regulated activity.</p><br>

volunteer helping out at a school campsite will need to be subject to
monitoring if they are looking after the children overnight. It will be
optional for employers to check individuals engaged in regulated
activity lasting less time than those circumstances specified in the
&#147;period condition&#148;, to which I think the hon. Member for
Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) will refer.</p><p><a name="06102345000109">Beyond those
situations, the requirements to check and to be subject to monitoring
will still apply when an activity is carried out
&#147;frequently&#148;. The word &#147;frequently&#148; will
take its normal meaning and, as I have said previously, guidance will
set out the Secretary of State&#146;s broad interpretation that the
term will cover activities that are carried out once a month or more
often.</p><p><a name="06102345000110">However, to
provide a measure of protection for employers and individuals who
follow that guidance, we have tabled amendments Nos. 33, 45 and 49,
which will require the court to take into account when imposing
penalties for failure to comply with the regulated activity
requirements the extent to which employers and individuals have
followed the Secretary of State&#146;s
guidance.</p><p><a name="06102345000111">We have
listened carefully to previous debates, and I believe that those
amendments will be welcomed, as they ensure that being barred means
precisely that. They clarify when the requirements to check and to be
subject to monitoring apply, and they reduce the risk of employers and
individuals being unfairly penalised in circumstances where they have
followed the Secretary of State&#146;s guidance. On that basis, I
commend the amendments to the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61023-0016.htm_ordayhd12"><a name="06102345000564">8.15

Miller:</b> Yet again, we are considering an important string
of amendments&#151;important because &#147;frequent&#148; and
&#147;occasional&#148; have been among the most problematic terms
in the Bill and have given cause to considerable debate in the House
and in the other place. Also, a great many representations have been
made by stakeholder
groups.</p><p><a name="06102345000113">The
Government&#146;s original position in Committee, when they were
pressed on the matter, and indeed on Second Reading, was that those
definitions did not require further clarification because they would
take their &#147;everyday meaning&#148;&#151;despite the fact
that both terms are relative and that there is no generally accepted
everyday meaning for either &#147;frequent&#148; or
&#147;occasional&#148; in English
law.</p><p><a name="06102345000114">Many
hon. Members, including those on the Conservative Benches, felt that to
leave such a key concept undefined would be to store up a great deal of
trouble, not to mention create extra work for the army of lawyers that
has clearly been involved in drafting the Bill. Therefore, we are glad
that the Government have worked over the summer, through a working
party including many reputable organisations, to reconsider the
position and take into account some of the debate in Committee. The
tabling of amendments Nos. 56, 57 and 64, which tightly define
&#147;frequently&#148; as any two-day period occurring in a 30-day
period, has allowed us to start to get a feeling for what is meant
here.</p><p><a name="06102345000115">Amendment No.
169 takes that welcome clarification a little further by specifying
that that new &#147;period condition&#148;, as it is called, is
also satisfied if the activity in question occurs between 2 am and 6
am,

overnight stays. That activity also needs to give the opportunity for
face-to-face contact with children or vulnerable
adults.</p><p><a name="06102345000116">No doubt the
wording is better than the original, but Conservative Members feel that
there is room for a little more improvement. Before we get on to that,
I want to ask the Minister to provide further clarification on
amendments Nos. 33, 45 and 49, which, again, will introduce a new idea
to the Bill on Report. Those amendments provide that the courts may
take into account the extent to which employers and individuals guilty
of offences under clauses 8, 10 and 11 have taken account of guidance
as to the meaning of &#147;frequency&#148;. We have not debated
that previously, and it would be interesting to know the
Government&#146;s intent. As we have said, the vetting and barring
system must be robust&#151; the reason for the Bill is that the
current system is not robust. It must also be simple for employers and
employees to navigate and understand; otherwise, it will not move us
forward.</p><p><a name="06102345000117">The
amendments might suggest&#151;perhaps the Minister will
elaborate&#151;that the Government think that the new rules will not
be well understood, and that employers and employees may
unintentionally misapply the rules and be guilty of criminal offences.
Is the Government&#146;s intention to try to provide a caveat in case
of misunderstanding? If so, we might need to discuss that further.
Perhaps the Minister will also enlighten the House as to how often he
expects the provisions to be used, and whether he will monitor them to
assess whether there is a fundamental flaw in the working of the Bill.
Will he tell us how he will conduct that monitoring, and what actions
will be taken?</p><p><a name="06102345000118">As many hon.
Members and other groups have mentioned, the amendments also touch on
the need to communicate clearly to employers and employees their rights
and responsibilities under the law, and to inform barred persons which
activities they can and cannot engage in. The system is complex, so it
is imperative that the Government communicate adequately to all
concerned, as we have discussed. However, amendments Nos. 33, 45 and 49
imply an expectation that in at least some cases people will commit
offences due to a lack of understanding of the rules. By tabling the
amendments, perhaps the Minister has inadvertently reiterated the
official Opposition&#146;s case, which is supported by our Liberal
colleagues, that further communication is needed.</p><p><a name="06102345000119">On a related
point, we are also concerned that the Bill does not do enough to
involve those on the front line who will try to implement this
increasingly complex legislation, particularly employers. In Committee,
the Government said that there was a great difference between different
settings, so the idea of one definition of frequency simply would not
work, and that flexibility was needed to ensure that the Bill would
work in practice. Obviously, the Government have slightly changed their
position, and now have a much tighter definition.</p><p><a name="06102345000120">Our amendment
No. 199 would provide a little more of what the Government have been
trying to achieve in the Bill&#151;not just providing a structure and
a process but engendering a culture of vigilance among those dealing
with children and vulnerable adults&#151;and could

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1321</b><br>be just what the Minister is looking for. It allows employers to use
their own professional judgment to determine what constitutes a
frequent activity in relation to their own setting, but only if the
definition were equal to or less than that contained in the
Bill&#151;two days in any 30-day period. The amendment would put some
of the responsibility on those who must implement the Bill, rather than
perpetuate a tick-box culture in which it is felt that as soon as the
Bill has been put in place, everything that is required has been done.
I hope that the Minister will give further consideration to the
amendment. The maximum period defined by amendments Nos. 56, 57 and 64
would not be threatened, but more people would be involved in the
process.</p><p><a name="06102345000121">Amendments
Nos. 28 and 37 would allow barred persons to engage in regulated
activities in emergency situations, of which the Minister gave an
excellent example. Again, we have not debated the issue previously, so
perhaps the Minister needs to provide a little further
explanation<i> .</i> Although we have not tabled an amendment because of
lack of time, given the extent to which certain individuals look for
loopholes in the law&#151;let us not revisit Kazakhstan at this
stage, but I would tell the House that its capital is
Almaty&#151;does not he think that the two amendments may have a
perverse consequence? Amendments Nos. 28 and 37 would give barred
persons a right to engage in regulated activities in an emergency. For
instance, a doctor who is barred would be able to administer first aid
to a child who had collapsed. What would apply in a situation in which
an individual who is not monitored, as opposed to barred, wants to
provide emergency assistance to a child or vulnerable adult? It could
be argued that such a person would be in a worse situation than one who
has been barred.</p><p><a name="06102345000122">Perhaps the Minister needs to
provide further explanation, but there is no provision in the Bill to
allow those who are not monitored to administer what would otherwise be
defined as a monitored activity. Last week, there was a wonderful
example, which I am sure that the Minister heard about, of a lollipop
man being taken ill. A local council did not feel it appropriate to
permit any other individual to help children cross a road, and the
police unfortunately could not supply the manpower. Instead of having
an adult help them cross the road, children had to cross a major road,
which had been associated with a number of fatalities, by themselves.
Will the Minister clarify whether amendments Nos. 28 and 37 would mean
that a barred person would be able to help a child who was in danger
trying to cross a road? Would the non-monitored person be at a
disadvantage? I am sure that the Minister has already thought about
that potential perverse outcome of the Bill, but because we cannot
debate the issue further, given the lateness of tabling, I would very
much value his feedback.</p><p><a name="06102345000123"><b><a name="61023-0016.htm_spnew14"><a name="06102345000577">Annette

I was troubled when the Committee stage finished, as I genuinely

amendments have been tabled. I thank the Minister for listening, and

the Secretary of State will issue guidance on his broad interpretation
of the term, &#147;frequently&#148;. When a regulated activity
offence has been committed, and the court is deciding a sentence, it
must consider the extent to which the employer or individual
interpreted &#147;frequently&#148; in line with the Secretary of
State&#146;s guidance. If the court reaches a different
interpretation of &#147;frequently&#148;, the intention is that it
will be more lenient in its sentence if the offender has adhered to the
guidance. For example, an employer may be prosecuted in court because
he did not make a check for an activity that took place once every six
weeks; instead, he made checks only once every four weeks, because that
was what was recommended in the guidance. The amendments will
essentially provide a measure of protection for employers and
individuals who have to interpret
&#147;frequently&#148;.</p><p><a name="06102345000126">The

&#147;frequently&#148;, and wished that the provisions went
further, so that checks could be made on people who are employed for
under two days or a week, or who are not employed for overnight
periods. Organisations are allowed to do that&#151;they are well
within their rights to do so. Under the Bill, a school or other
organisation is entitled to make that check if it wishes to do
so.</p><p><a name="06102345000127">With
regard to people who are not monitored, the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset

falling ill in the street, and a person giving them emergency first
aid. If someone is not monitored, they are not part of the scheme, and
may never have applied to be part of it, so there is nothing to prevent
them from administering first aid or helping in an emergency. It would
be different if they did so frequently, as a

matters. The provisions in the Bill for referral of information from
the independent barring board and the Secretary of State to some
UK-wide health professional bodies will be removed from the Bill, and
will be provided for instead in an order under section 60 of the Health
Act 1999. The change does not affect the original policy intention that
professional bodies will be notified when a registrant is included on a
barred list, and will be provided with other information held by the
IBB that is relevant to their

Third
time.</p><p><a name="06102345000347">Throughout
our debates Members on all sides of the House, and in the other place,
have given tremendous recognition to the importance of the measures in
the Bill. Ensuring that children and vulnerable adults are safeguarded
from harm is at the heart of the responsibilities of both Government
and Parliament. It is a responsibility shared with employers, parents,
families, and the work forces that support children and vulnerable
adults. I am therefore grateful&#151;and I know that I speak for the
Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my hon. Friend the
Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda)&#151;for the fact that
our debates at all stages of the Bill&#146;s passage have been
constructive and valuable, and above all have demonstrated the
commitment on both sides of the House to better safeguarding for
children and vulnerable adults. That has been reflected in the
significant degree of consensus in both Houses. The Bill has rightly
received the close scrutiny that it deserves and has greatly benefited
from constructive probing by all who have
participated.</p><p><a name="06102345000348">I thank
you and your colleagues, Madam Deputy Speaker. I thank our Chairmen in
Committee, the hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Derek Conway) and
my hon. Friend the. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew), for
their generous but firm management of our deliberations. I thank the
hon. Members for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) and for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke), who ably led from the
Opposition Benches and the hon. Members for East Worthing and Shoreham
(Tim Loughton) and for Brent, East (Sarah Teather). I thank the

the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend
the Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan), and all my hon. Friends who
have taken an active part in the debate. I also thank the Clerks and
our officials, who have supported us through every stage of this
difficult process.</p><p><a name="06102345000349">The
Government are committed to ensuring that safeguarding vulnerable
groups remains a top priority. Staying safe is one of the five outcomes
in the cross-Government &#147;Every Child Matters&#148; programme,
and seeks to ensure that safeguarding becomes everyone&#146;s
business across the range of children&#146;s services. The Bill is
part of that programme. It will also greatly improve the safeguarding
of adults in the most vulnerable circumstances. The &#147;dignity in
care&#148; campaign that I shall launch shortly will aim to create a
care system in which there is zero tolerance of abuse and disrespect of
older people, but the Bill extends much more widely than that, covering
a full spectrum of services in which abuse may
occur.</p><p><a name="06102345000350">Let
me further remind Members of the significance of the Bill. It fully
implements recommendation 19 of the Bichard report. I am sure that
every Member will recall the tragic circumstances, the murders of Holly
Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham, that led to that inquiry and
shocked the nation. In response to the inquiry, we have established a
wide-ranging and ambitious programme of work to address the systemic
failures that it identified. The House has been updated regularly on
progress. The Bill puts in place a major element of the response and
delivers on important commitments given by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly) in January, when she was Secretary
of State for Education and
Skills.</p><p><a name="06102345000351">As I am sure
Members will agree, discharging these important commitments has not
always been an easy task. It covers a difficult and complex area, and
we have been asked to reconcile very different imperatives. We are
determined to have the most robust system of vetting and barring
possible; at the same time, it must be simple and practical for
employers to implement, or it will get in the way of recruitment. It
also needs to be fair, with robust procedures. As the hon. Member for
Basingstoke said, our extended debates about such issues as
&#147;frequency&#148; have helped to ensure that the scheme is
effectively constituted.</p><p><a name="06102345000352">I am genuinely grateful for the
constructive approach throughout the House to resolving the challenges.
I believe that the Bill now provides for a tough, well-balanced and
effective vetting and barring scheme, and I commend it to the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61023-0021.htm_ordayhd97"><a name="06102345000567">8.41

which they have listened to the arguments, and for their willingness to

and 250 Government amendments that was presented only a short time
before today&#146;s debate.</p><p><a name="06102345000354">The Bill has been expected and
consulted on for more than two years, and has been debated since
February. It is therefore difficult to understand why so many
Government amendments were tabled at the eleventh hour. Many provide
the basic details of how the vetting and barring scheme will work. We
have been asking for those details for the past six months, and they
should have been thought through before, rather than after, the Bill
was presented to us. With that in mind, I thank the teams from the
Department for Education and Skills and the Public Bill Office, who
have worked tirelessly and often under great pressureas a
result of the Government&#146;s late tabling of amendments. They
have, as always, been an integral and invaluable part of the
process.</p><p><a name="06102345000355">Some four
years after the tragedy that led to the Bichard inquiry, there are
still too many examples of existing vetting procedures being
implemented haphazardly. That was highlighted only in June, in
Ofsted&#146;s report on recruitment practices in schools.</p><p><a name="06102345000356">We were presented with a
somewhat hollow Bill in February, despite the two years that had
elapsed since the Bichard report. There was a lack of definition, a
lack of detail on the processes to be followed and a disregard for many
of the findings in the consultations that had been
held&#151;specifically the DFES&#146;s own post-Bichard
consultation, which called for much of the clarity in terms and
definitions for which we, and other Members, have continued to press
today. Even after more than six months, there are still no definitions
of some of the key terms in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102345000357">My colleagues
and I are pleased that the debate has led to some changes. Much of the
spadework in the other place was done by my noble Friend Lady Buscombe,
both in debate and in behind-the-scenes meetings, on the issue of
read-across between the vulnerable adults&#146; and the
children&#146;s barred lists. It was widely felt to be a fundamental
flaw in the Bill as initially presented.</p><p><a name="06102345000358">I commend the
work done on Second Reading and in Committee by my hon. Friend the
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton). As always, he
brought his wit and depth of knowledge to debates in Committee and on
Report. I want to thank my hon. Friends the Members for St. Albans
(Anne Main), for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson) and for
Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett) for their continued
support and their contributions to our debate. We must not forget our
two Committee Chairmen&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley
and Sidcup (Derek Conway) and the hon. Member for Carlisle
(Mr. Martlew)&#151;who oversaw that particular stage and,
despite some trying times, kept our debate in reasonably good
humour.</p>

Minister for Children and Families. He was not in the driving
seat&#151;or, indeed, even in the Department&#151;when the Bill was
first introduced. Perhaps he would agree that the handling of the Bill
has not been an example of great parliamentary process and that a
review might be in order.</p><p><a name="06102345000360">Conservative Members remain
concerned about clauses dealing with the position of those who are
barred if they inadvertently apply for monitored jobs and we have
debated the issue extensively. We are also concerned, as we stated
clearly in Committee, about the Government&#146;s intention to expand
the number of people monitored under the Bill in future. As we know,
the Government have the ability to achieve that without much further
debate in the House. We shall certainly monitor that matter closely.
When the Bill was introduced, the right hon. Member for Stretford and
Urmston (Beverley Hughes) firmly stated that one of the principles
behind the Bill was that the breadth of the bar imposed should be
proportionate to the risk. I hope that Ministers continue to adhere to
that and that they are open to revisiting the provisions if they appear
to have created unintended consequences, perhaps along the lines that
we have discussed today.</p><p><a name="06102345000361">The amount of
reworking of the Bill at such a late stage is also worrying because a
number of areas require further attention. We have already mentioned
the use of vague terms and we have had little time properly to debate
critical issues such as the development of the IMPACT police national
database. It is now delayed until 2010, yet it was one of
Bichard&#146;s key criticisms of the progress that the Government
have made so far. Overseas workers is another matter&#151;we debated
it earlier&#151;that was virtually ignored in the later stages of our
debate on the Government amendments.</p><p><a name="06102345000362">We wish the Bill well as it
passes from here to wherever it goes next, but there remains a need for
a fundamental change to the process of vetting and monitoring. We all
agree that it needs to take place, but we urge the Government closely
to watch the impact of the Bill in practice. We support the intention
to make the vetting system better, but we do not want the Bill to
become an unwieldy instrument that, instead of simplifying the
position, adds even more complexity. In short, we simply hope that the
Bill does not become a sledgehammer to crack a nut. We hope that the
Government will monitor the impact in as much detail as possible as the
Bill is implemented.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61023-0022.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="06102345000568">8.49

Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, the hon. Member for

complex and that has to be a concern for us all. From the start, we
have all seen the Bill as being of great importance and significance.
We will all always remember the events at Soham and the revelation that
some information could have been passed on. In fact, there was lots of
information around, but it had not gone through the various channels or
been put together so as to lead to someone taking action. We have many
examples of similar situations in world history and that was another
example of failure of communication. Given the system that was in
place, it was impossible for anybody to put together all the pieces of
information
available.</p><p><a name="06102345000367">It seems a

grateful for this opportunity to discuss the Freedom of Information Act
2000, especially as the debate coincides with some proposed changes to
the Act, which are in danger of changing it for the
worse.</p><p><a name="06102345000376">I start at the
point when the Act was first imagined by the then Leader of the
Opposition who spoke about freedom of information at an awards ceremony
in March 1996. He said that</p><a name="61023-0022.htm_brev10"><a name="06102345000562"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;information is power and any
Government&#146;s attitude about sharing information with the people
actually says a great deal about how it views power itself and how it
views the relationship between itself and the people who elected
it.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102345000377">Wise
words.</p><p><a name="06102345000378">We should
congratulate the Government on introducing the Freedom of Information
Act. It was a good step in the right direction, which has, by and
large, increased the ability of members of the public to get access to
information, in particular from Government bodies. As I shall explain,
the Act has not worked quite as the then Leader of the Opposition
intended and that gives rise to serious concern about some of the
changes to be proposed
shortly.</p><p><a name="06102345000379">Although the
Act was passed in 2000, it has been in operation only for about 22
months. In that time, a vast array of freedom of information requests
has been made to some of the 115,000 bodies open to such requests. The
responses have been informative and worth while, and in the wider
public interest. However, an Act that came into force so recently has
not yet had time to settle down, so that we can see how it performs in
reality. I draw attention to the fact that there has yet to be even one
occasion when any decision about whether to supply information under
the terms of the Act has been challenged in the High Court. Not one
decision has yet been challenged in the High
Court.</p><p><a name="06102345000380">Many
decisions have been challenged with the help of the Information
Commissioner&#146;s office, which is quite right. However, until the
Act reaches such a state of maturity that it is actually tested in the
courts, it is premature to talk of changing it. I shall say more about
that
later.</p><p><a name="06102345000381">Personally, I
find the Act most helpful. Recently, I achieved the release of
information, through the Act, about the scale of cancelled appointments
in the NHS; for example, we found out that 1,000 operations are
cancelled every day, due to various equipment, bed, staff and
management problems. The Department of Health was unable to provide
that information when I asked for it in parliamentary questions, but
the beauty of the Freedom of Information Act is that we can go to the
source. Indeed, it was ironic that on the day that I reported the
information that I had uncovered, I heard that the Department of Health
was trying to claim that my figures were inaccurate. In fact, the
Department had no way of knowing whether my figures were
inaccurate&#151;in reality, they were entirely
accurate&#151;because it did not collate the figures. I tested that
point through a question in the House, and the Freedom of Information
Act provided me with the opportunity to release the information for the
wider public good, so the measure certainly works.</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="23 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="23" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>23 Oct 2006 : Column 1354</b><br><p><a name="06102345000382">However, when asking a variety
of questions via the Act, I came across a number of concerns. My
principal concern relates to the way in which the Act is operating. It
is being pretty much openly flouted, and the Government should take
that on board. Today I issued the results of research carried out on
the last three freedom of information requests that I made, two to
national health service trusts and one to local education authorities.
I found that in those three requests&#151;almost 1,000 pieces of
information were requested in total&#151;as many as 50 per cent. of
those asked to provide information under the Freedom of Information Act
failed to respond on time or with information that related to the
question asked. One third failed to respond at
all.</p><p><a name="06102345000383">If one third of
public organisations are failing to respond to perfectly proper
requests under the Freedom of Information Act, we have a problem. For
clarification, the House should note that these are not instances where
the public bodies failed to respond on the basis of cost or on the
basis that it was not in the public interest, which are two of the most
obvious reasons why bodies would not respond. The one third that have
not responded simply did not reply to the FOI request&#151;not just
once, but in the case of the NHS trusts, serially. So those are serial
offenders, consistently breaking the law by not complying with the
terms of the Freedom of Information Act. With the LEAs I found the
figures to be somewhat lower, but still worrying. About a third of LEAs
did not reply or replied late or with inaccurate information, and about
a quarter failed to reply at
all.</p><p><a name="06102345000384">I see a systemic
problem with the current system. I call on the Minister to tell us this
evening what steps will be taken to improve the performance of the
Freedom of Information Act. I called the debate with that in mind, but
since then something has happened that has heightened my concern. In
response to the Constitutional Affairs Committee, the Government
released a report that seeks to make amendments to the FOI Act. The
House would do well to study those amendments in great detail and
express its concern.</p><p><a name="06102345000385">The amendments appear to make
it harder for the public to use the Act in order to obtain information.
Regardless whether it would be harder or not, it would certainly be
more expensive. The information that has drifted out so far is
confused. Can the Minister tell us whether it is the
Government&#146;s intention to introduce a charge for requesting
information under the Freedom of Information Act? I should appreciate
clarification.</p><p><a name="06102345000386">Whether
or not a charge is introduced by a reformed Act, we understand that the
Government are considering allowing a couple of things to happen that
would make it much harder to obtain information. The first
consideration is to group together various requests made by one
individual, and allow the authority that is being challenged for the
information to claim that it would cost too much to answer. That is not
fair play. I am not the only one who has serious reservations about
that. The Constitutional Affairs Committee
stated:</p><a name="61023-0022.htm_brev11"><a name="06102345000563"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;These
changes, if implemented, would fly in the face of the
Government&#146;s stated desire of encouraging an open culture and

this&#151;again, I would appreciate clarification when the Minister

public body to claim that a request is simply too expensive to respond
to. That is entirely wrong if it is done by, so to speak, massaging the

has done quite some good, and that has enabled a lot of information to
come out in the public interest, by making it harder to use that Act by
making it more expensive to do so, and by failing to address a
fundamental problem that we seem to face at present, which is that a
surprisingly high number of requests are failing to be answered. I

Labour Government who introduced the freedom of information
legislation; and may I furthermore remind him that his party had 18
years in government in which to try to pass such legislation if they
had wished to do so&#151;indeed, they could have walked it through
Parliament&#151;but they chose instead to cling to secrecy? There is
not a lot of letting sunshine win the day in that regard, or any other
chink of light&#151;there was something of the night about that
Government perhaps, in terms of the darkness that they intended
perpetually to keep the public. As the hon. Gentleman said, information
gives citizens power, and his party decided not to give the public that
power against
them.</p><p><a name="06102345000391">This Government

out how public services are performing; they can ask for themselves. As
the recent Constitutional Affairs Committee report on this legislation
stated, the Act is a significant success. It has made available
thousands upon thousands of pieces of information in just 22 short
months from more than 115,000 public bodies, and that information is
now being used constructively in the main. It is important to
understand how far we have come since the Conservative days when
citizens were not entitled to information about the number of

we will work harder if we are not succeeding.</p><p><a name="06102345000401">The hon.

MPs&#151;have the right to request an internal review when no reply
is given, and the right further to appeal to the Information
Commissioner. If they are not satisfied with his decision, they can
appeal to the Information Tribunal and, ultimately, to court.</p><p><a name="06102345000402">Contrary to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s opening line that precedents from the court are very
important before changes are made, it is not intended that the public
should be priced out of making appeals against failures to give
information, which is what could happen if courts were the point of
recourse. The idea is to have an independent regulator who is freely
accessible. In many other countries, the courts are, in some cases, the
only recourse. That is not what happens here. We have established an
equally free means of controlling the way in which public authorities
deal with such matters, and we encourage all the tiers involved to
drive the public authorities to be as full and frank as they can
be.</p><p><a name="06102345000403">We
are committed to the principles and philosophy of freedom of
information. In 2005, central Government alone released 20,000 pieces
of information. Some 60 per cent. of requests resulted in full
disclosure in time. That is the clearest evidence of our commitment.
Less than two years in and we are clearly outperforming many countries
where FOI has been in place for many years, as it could have been in
this country. When the hon. Gentleman says that FOI is taking time to
bed in, I am afraid that, in a sense, he is criticising his own
Government. Other countries have had the benefit of such experience
over many years, and we could have had the same. Sadly, it has been
left to
us.</p><p><a name="06102345000404"><b><a name="61023-0022.htm_spnew20"><a name="06102345000596">Mr.

possibly be interpreted as a lack of commitment on our part to openness
and accountability. As the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield seemed
almost ready to acknowledge, FOI has been a real success, but it must
be balanced with good government across the piece. We have to make sure
that we get the balance right between the provision of services to the
public and the provision of information. FOI must not come at the
expense of government and our ability to get on with the job, or of the
provision of core services.</p><p><a name="06102345000407">The two changes that we have
said we will make to the regime are not about avoiding this commitment;
rather, they are about giving public authorities more options in
dealing with the small number of requests that impose truly exceptional
burdens, and which tie up resources and take time from public service
delivery. Nearly half of all the time that all public authorities spend
on FOI casework is accounted for by just 5 per cent. of requests. That
small number of cases, which impose truly disproportionate burdens, are
our target. If it were our intention to kill demand, we would impose a
flat charge. The hon. Gentleman asked me clearly about that, and I
answer him clearly: we will not impose a flat charge. It has been
estimated that that would reduce demand by 44 per cent., which would
not be appropriate. What is the Freedom of Information Act for, if it
is not to provide universal access to information free at the point of
delivery?</p><br>

Consequently, I cannot see how he seeks to make a link between what he
calls &#147;failures&#148;, which I may not, and the changes that
are being introduced to try to make sure that requests are targeted.
One of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s own requests concerned management
consultants to a particular health authority. He asked for their nature
to be broken down across three categories that the authority did not
recognise. It could not possibly have done it within the time
available, but it did its best and produced the answer in time. The
hon. Gentleman would probably call that a failure. If he wants to
characterise as a failure everything that is not given in time or does
not give full information, his idea of a failure is not the same as
mine. It is incorrect of him to suggest that his experience and his way
of categorising matters represents a nationwide trend. Eighty-four per
cent. of requests to the Government are answered within the time limit,
and well over 60 per cent. are answered
fully.</p><p><a name="06102345000417"><b><a name="61023-0023.htm_spnew8"><a name="06102345000606">Grant

not public bodies refusing to answer legitimate questions because they
are taking their lead from the Government? Hon. Members on both sides

experience 12 to 18 months after the implementation of the Act. It is
responsible to learn from experience. We were three years into
government when we introduced the Act. We knew that information could
be embarrassing, but we had the courage to say, &#147;Give it to the
public none the less.&#148;</p><p><a name="06102345000422">We ask
requesters to start to apply to their freedom of information requests
the discipline that they understand they have to use in other areas of
their lives. Difficult requests are not those where the requester is
specific or where the subject matter is perceived to be sensitive or
political. Difficult requests are those that are imprecise, ambiguous
or indiscriminate&#151;for example, requests for the number of new
posts created in Departments since1 January 2005. From the
office junior to the director of services, one would have to determine
which were new, which were partly new, which had changed in status,
which were part-time, and which were full-time. It can be done, but it
takes weeks. There is a requirement on public authorities to send back
such a request and ask the person to be more specific. We use that to
try to guide people to act within an acceptable framework. Let me
compare it to going to a public library. We do not expect the librarian
to search through the library stock for us in the hope that they might
turn up something that interests us. If we want a librarian to help us,
we make our request precise and unambiguous, as should
inquirers.</p><p><a name="06102345000423">There has
been a lot of misconceived comment on the nature of the changes
proposed last week, particularly the provision to aggregate two or more
requests when calculating whether the threshold has been reached.
Public authorities already have the power&#151;which Conservative
Members supported during the passage of the legislation&#151;to
aggregate similar requests from the same person. We propose to give
public authorities an extension to enable them to aggregate non-similar
requests.</p><p><a name="06102345000424">We require
better standards from those who are best placed to exercise quality
research skills, including journalists, campaigners and researchers.
Those people&#146;s careers are underpinned by understanding how to
ask a clear, unambiguous and precise question. The Act is not intended
to transfer the cost of research from the inquirer to the public. At
present, anyone can make unlimited requests for information, regardless
of the cost to public funds.</p><p><a name="06102345000425">The key point
that has been missed in the debate so far is that the existing power to
aggregate requests is&#151;as the new one will be, if it is
introduced&#151;a power. It is not compulsory. The present power is
by no means used every time. Indeed, two requests were made by the hon.
Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) concerning
material received from the Electoral Commission in 2003-04 and material
relative to the findings of the Jenkins Commission. The requests took
more than two and a half weeks of official time to answer, which is far
more than the time to which the hon. Gentleman was entitled. They
could, therefore, have been dealt with by a refusal. However, they
appeared to be in the public interest. Therefore no power to resist
answering them was used. There is always a balance to be struck in
these matters. I ask hon. Members to remember that we are
consulting&#151;sounding out&#151;on this issue, and that it will
involve a power, not a compulsion.</p><br>

change proposed last week, on which we are also taking soundings, is
the inclusion of reading, consultation and consideration time in the
hours that can be aggregated when assessing whether a request would be
too expensive for an answer to be in the public interest. This proposal
will not encourage inefficient decision making. It is designed to
reduce the number of occasions on which significant amounts of time are
taken up with inefficient freedom of information work. It reflects the
significant resource that is currently required to deal with some
requests. Estimates of costs will have to be reasonable, and decisions
can be appealed to the Information Commissioner and the Information
Tribunal. The Information Commissioner already assesses public
authority estimates under the current regulations to ensure that they
are reasonable. That right will remain the same.</p><p><a name="06102345000427">Additionally, public
authorities will continue to be obliged to offer advice and assistance
to enable the requester to refine their request to bring it below the
cost limit. Only a very small proportion of requests are likely to be
affected by the proposed changes, but they will be the ones that cost
the public purse the most. Frontier Economics, the company that carried
out the review, estimated that a maximum of 13 per cent. of requests
would be affected, but these account for more than half the resource
burden imposed by the
