 Does the Secretary of State agree with the continuing concerns highlighted on Radio 4&#146;s &#147;Today&#148; programme this morning about arbitrary arrest and violence by President Kabila&#146;s regime towards political opponents? There are also problems of rampant corruption, especially in the extractive industries, and a continuing history of lack of development in the basic infrastructure. Will the Government put renewed pressure on President Kabila to end those autocratic practices, as without a realand meaningful development of civil society all our increased aid budget will be frittered away?

That is the truth, as I saw for myself on my recent visit, and as did thehon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell), the Opposition spokesman on international development, who has also been there recently. I raised precisely that point in my meeting with President Kabila, because the people of the Congo want to see that the Government will reach out and embrace the Opposition there and allow civil society the time and space to acquire a voice.  <br>

 Does my right hon. Friend believe that the Congo&#146;s ruling elite has understood that the purpose of government is to benefit the welfare of the people, and that it is not an exercise in looting?

 The cultural and political change&#151;if I may describe it in that way&#151;to which my hon. Friend refers in the Congo can be described only as work in progress, because it has a long way to go. Army integration is an example of that. There has been some progress, but one of the difficulties is that the large amount of money that comes out of the Exchequer every month to pay for the armed forces does not bear a direct relationship to the number of soldiers who need paying. One of the points that I made to President Kabila both on my recent visit and previously is that if the Government of the DRC want the international community to give more support to army integration&#151;the UK is doing something to provide tents and clean water to those who are part of the integrated brigade&#151;they have to demonstrate that the money that the donors are putting in is being used for the purpose for which it is intended. Army integration is crucial to the future of the country. The country has to stop having separate armed forces representing separate political groups. There is one elected President. The army must come behind that President and act on behalf of the country as a whole.</p>

I agree with him that MONUC has got to stay there for quite some time, because the country needs the security and the reassurance that it provides. I specifically raised with President Kabila the issue of space for the Opposition. I met members of the Opposition both in the National Assembly and separately. It was hoped recently that they would meet President Kabila. I understand that that meeting has not taken place, although they met one of his advisers.

On EUSEC, we have provided support in the form of the secondment of staff and we have provided funding, as I indicated in answer to an earlier question.

institutions and the Governments of developing countries themselves&#151;and giving local authorities in the growing towns and cities of the developing world the resources that they need to provide water and sanitation as their populations increase. It is also about changing cultural attitudes and habits, which is why our support for the community-led total sanitation initiative is a really good thing.

I am pleased to report to the House that at the recent spring meetings of the World Bank, we reached an agreement that there should in future be one annual report on how the world is doing and one annual meeting at which we can gather to determine what needs to be done next and to divide up the work. The UN has indicated that it is prepared to nominate one lead UN body in- country to be the vehicle through which support for water and sanitation will be provided, which represents real progress.

 To return to my right hon. Friend&#146;s comments about changing habits, is he aware that the local authority in Nairobi had well-advanced plans some months ago to pipe water to one of the city&#146;s largest slums, but that those plans had to be withdrawn due to landlords&#146; threats of violence because they were making too much money out of selling water in that slum?</p>

 The story that my hon. Friend tells draws our attention to the difficulties that countries face as they try to make progress. In the case that she cites, the landlords have a vested interest in the existing system because, as the House knows, the highest prices for water are paid by the people who buy it in plastic bags and buckets from water sellers. In Ghana, such people pay five to six times as much for water as those who get it through the leaky, creaky water supply system. That illustrates that one problem that local authorities face is how they deal with informal settlements. There is a question whether there will be a recognition of the fact that millions of people live in an area and whether clean water will be provided, and that shows what a big task local authorities face. That is partly about governance and partly about resources.</p>

In the end, the most important thing is to give resources to the people who have responsibility for providing clean water and sanitation in the urban areas of Africa and Asia. This country&#146;s history shows that local authorities, as they developed, were principally responsible for putting in place piped water and sewerage systems, which did more than anything else in 19th century Britain to prolong life expectancy. Developing countries are going through exactly the same process, and we need to ensure that they have the means, the political will&#151;that must come from within&#151;and resources at a local and city level, given that that is where the investment must be made.</p>

addition, the community-led total sanitation initiative is a practical way of dealing with the problem. It is very blunt and direct; it involves going into villages and saying, &#147;We&#146;ve got to take a decision to stop open defecation in this village because that&#146;s the cause of a lot of ill-health,&#148; and it works, because it does not have a fixed plan.

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and that is why providing clean water is not just good for the health of children and communities, but very good for getting girls into school. That is why, as I saw for myself on a recent visit to Malawi, providing toilets as well as classrooms is absolutely fundamental in the education work that we support. That maximises the chances of girls coming to school, and, as they get older, staying in school, which they will not do if there are no toilets for them to use. The issue is how we integrate all the approaches to health, education, water and sanitation to ensure the progress that the hon. Gentleman and I both want.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity that the hon.

I had the opportunity to see a superb Christian Aid-funded project in South Africa that is doing a huge amount of good in the Germiston township just outside Johannesburg, helping that community to deal with the impact of HIV and AIDS. Faith-based groups do a lot more than that, too: they advocate efforts to tackle poverty, and they play a huge role in the campaigns that are inevitably mountedin the run-up to G8 conferences to encourage international leaders to do more.

When we took office, there was a backlog of about 60,000 asylum claims, whereas the figure is now down to 6,000. Whereas trials frequently used to collapse, the figure has been reduced by 20 per cent; the collection of fines is up; and there are extra numbers of police and community support officers, and antisocial behaviour laws.

 Of course we want the Home Office to focus on terrorism, but let us take just one example of a Home Office fiasco&#151;the failure to deport foreign criminals; we all remember that one.

That is why the incomes of the poorest 40 per cent. of this population have gone up in percentage terms roughly double what they were in the previous 18 years. It has made an immense difference to many families in this country. We must all know of people in families in our own constituencies who, as a result of the working tax credit, have been able to go out and get a job. The job has paid and they have been able to look after their families properly: it has dramatically transformed their lives.

In those circumstances, it is extremely important that we fully support the work that our forces are doing and rebut this idea that somehow people are dying in Iraq as a result of the activities of British or American or other coalition soldiers.

If the money is there and the investment is possible, let us have both. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I find it extraordinary that the Conservatives have put the Manchester casino in jeopardy, and are going around the streets of Blackpool telling people that they support the casino there. If we had had our way originally, without their intervention, we would have been able to have both.</p>

 Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement on Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70509-0003.htm_para3"><a name="07050990000147">I do not think it possible to overestimate the significance of yesterday&#146;s events at Stormont. In effect, we witnessed the final resolution of what has for centuries been the most intractable source of political conflict in the whole of Europe, and its significance is not confined to relations within these islands. What happened on 8 May 2007 showed the world how &#147;A Shared Future&#148; can emerge from even the most bitterly divided and blood-stricken past&#151;and we must never forget how much misery and suffering that caused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70509-0003.htm_para4"><a name="07050990000148">Many people, including Members in all parts of the House, worked tirelessly to make yesterday possible. The foundations were set by the 1998 Good Friday agreement, with the principles of consent and power-sharing at its core, but seeing the Democratic Unionist party and Sinn Fein going into government togetheron a fair and equitable basis makes &#147;historic&#148; seem a clich&#233;. That they have done it without the DUP&#146;s ceasing to be the DUP, and without Sinn Fein&#146;s ceasing to be Sinn Fein, is all the more remarkable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70509-0003.htm_para5"><a name="07050990000149">When we all witnessed that now iconic picture of the leaders of the DUP and Sinn Fein together for the very first time on 26 March, we knew that Northern Ireland and the wider world would never be the same again. Since then, by working together, the DUP and Sinn Fein have shown that the greater good can be served without the sacrifice of either principle or integrity. Indeed, I was delighted that the first letter signed jointly by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister asked me to leave my office in Stormont castle to enable them to move in, in time for yesterday&#146;s first meeting of the Assembly and formation of the Executive. Never has an eviction notice been so eagerly anticipated or so warmly received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70509-0003.htm_para6"><a name="07050990000150">Having met the First and Deputy First Ministers together, I have been struck since by their business-like approach to preparing for government and&#151;perhaps even more remarkably&#151;by their cordial and warm personal interaction. Above all, they have shown that age-old enmities can be overcome. That is truly inspirational, as we saw yesterday when they preached together at Stormont a common gospel of healing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70509-0003.htm_para7"><a name="07050990000151">I am convinced that devolution is here to stay. It would now be as unthinkable for Northern Ireland to ask for a return to direct rule in the future as it would be for Scotland or Wales. Indeed, who would have imagined that, as of today, of all the devolved Administrations, Northern Ireland has the only settled Government in place?</p>

That shared future must go beyond the &#147;big politics&#148; of Parliament Buildings. Astonishing as the political transformation over the past two years has been, there is much more to be done. We must find a way of dealing with the past and addressing the needs of victims and survivors. Although last summer&#146;s marching season went off more peacefully and with  <br>

greater consultation than ever before, a global solution to parading still needs to be negotiated. I hope that the review team headed by Lord Paddy Ashdown will help to achieve that. There are still too many so-called &#147;peace walls&#148; that divide communities in Northern Ireland, and some parts of Northern Ireland society continue to feel isolated, marginalised, deprived and out of the mainstream. I am thinking especially of loyalism and its place in the shared future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07050990000153">We have always said that we would support and encourage those who wanted to work to a positive agenda, who wanted to bring about change and who had sustainable mechanisms for doing that. People have a right to have their identity, their culture and their traditions respected, but if loyalism does not get into the mainstream and catch the tide that is taking Northern Ireland forward, there is a real danger that, despite the best intentions, the loyalist community will be left behind and further isolated, because no one will understand why there are groups within loyalism that still cling to an armed past. Last week&#146;s declaration by the Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando that they will end their paramilitary activity was therefore very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07050990000154">Guns, drugs and crime have no place within a community whose people want the best for their families, the best for their community and recognition of their core values. I want loyalism to play a full part in the new Northern Ireland&#151;a full part in the shared future&#151;as we should all want it to do, because loyalism anchored to peace, the rule of law and democracy has an honourable place in that future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07050990000155">Northern Ireland has changed immeasurably since direct rule was introduced in 1972&#151;the year when, as a student, I first visited. Apart from anything else, Northern Ireland is fast becoming a multicultural, multi-faith and forward-looking community, as evidenced by the election of Anna Lo as the first person of Chinese origin to become a member of a legislative body in Europe. That is not the only such first for Northern Ireland; it also had the first civil partnership ceremony anywhere in the UK. That is all part of the shared future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07050990000156">The whole process demonstrates what relentless attention by Government and persistent negotiations regardless of crises, collapses and depressing stalemates can achieve, and that must give hope to those tryingto resolve conflicts the world over. For generations,the politics of Northern Ireland has been a sometimes murderous zero-sum game of winners and losers. Yesterday saw an end to that, and whatever the challenges that lie ahead, they will be played out on the field of politics and democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07050990000157">The Members of the Legislative Assembly who came together in Parliament Buildings yesterday amidst a great joyous mood of reconciliation carry the hopes and aspirations of a people who have yearned for peace, stability and prosperity, and who have waited so terribly long to see it. I know that the whole Housewill support all of them as we enter this new and exciting era.</p>

 May I first thank the Secretary of State for his statement and for giving me advance sight of it? As the restoration of devolution to Stormont has resulted in changes in the  <br>

Secretary of State&#146;s ministerial team, may I also take this opportunity to say that Conservative Members will miss the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) and the hon. Member for Inverclyde (David Cairns)? Both of those former Northern Ireland Ministershave always been courteous and good-humoured in their dealings with the Opposition and we wish them both well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07050990000159">I am happy to associate myself and my right hon. and hon. Friends with the Secretary of State&#146;s words about all those whose efforts over the years made possible yesterday&#146;s historic and moving ceremony at Stormont. Of course, politicians of all parties did their bit, but I hope that the Secretary of State agrees that peace today would not have been possible without the courage and sacrifice of the police and the armed forces, and the dogged endurance of the people of Northern Ireland over nearly 40 years of violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07050990000160">As the Secretary of State acknowledged in his statement, devolution now opens the door to enduring peace and genuine reconciliation, but daunting challenges nevertheless remain. I want to put questions to him about three of those challenges, the first of which concerns loyalism. Last week&#146;s declaration by the Ulster Volunteer Force was indeed welcome, but does the Secretary of State agree that it is not enough for the UVF just to declare that it has abandoned violence? It needs to show by its actions that it actually has done so. It must decommission its weapons, and that decommissioning needs to be independently verified by General de Chastelain&#146;s commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07050990000161">The second challenge concerns the future of the Provisional IRA. The Government and the Independent Monitoring Commission say that the IRA is no longer a terrorist threat, which is welcome news indeed, yet it remains a proscribed terrorist organisation on both sides of the Irish border. If we are to consider devolving criminal justice, including decisions about prosecutions, to devolved Ministers in as little as 11 months from now, surely that paradox has to be resolved. Do the Government believe that the IRA has now transformed itself into a kind of old comrades association that no longer needs to be proscribed? On the other hand, if proscription is still right and necessary, do the Government believe that at the same time it is right to entrust the criminal justice system to people who include those who, until recently, were active IRA commanders and who still maintain the strongest of ties to that organisation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07050990000162">Thirdly, what steps do the Government propose to take to help Northern Ireland come to terms with its past? As the Secretary of State knows, there are nearly 2,000 unsolved murders from the troubles&#151;2,000 families and networks of friends who have had no sense of justice being done. Thousands of victims and bereaved families will carry physical and emotional scars for as long as they live. At present, a number of different types of selective historical inquiry are taking place into particular killings. As the Secretary of State knows, responses to those inquiries are eating up a vast amount of police time and resources, which are having to be diverted from current policing priorities. I acknowledge the acute sensitivity of this issue and I accept that there is unlikely to be a quick or easy answer. However, does the Secretary of State agree  <br>

with me that coming to terms with the past is essential if we are to build genuine reconciliation in Northern Ireland, and that that should be done in a way that puts the interests of victims and families first? Will he work now with other parties in this House and in Northern Ireland to see if together we can agree on a way forward?</p>

 I very much welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s statement in broad terms, but first, with permission, Mr. Speaker, may I send my commiserations to the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley), at the death over the weekend from cancer, at the age of only 45, of George Dawson, a Member of the Legislative Assembly? He was the grandmaster of the Independent Orange Lodge, and his funeral is tomorrow. Also, I acknowledge that, because MLAs are running procedures for appointing today their committee chairmen and women, vice-chairs and other committee members, DUP Members have been unable to attend the House today as I know they would have wished to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07050990000164">In responding to the points made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington), I first thank him for the warm remarks he made about my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), who played an outstanding role over the past two years, helped me and the whole process immeasurably and is hugely respected. My hon. Friend the Member for Inverclyde (David Cairns) has also done excellent work over this past year. My right hon. Friend&#146;s remaining portfolio of the political process and criminal justice will be taken over by the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), who will do an outstanding job as she has done in the past year in other areas, and by the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins), who has gained huge respect. He has been a fantastic security Minister, and he will continue to be so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07050990000165">I agree with the hon. Member for Aylesbury about the outstanding courage that has been shown by the police and the armed forces over the decades of the troubles. He made the strong point, with which I agree, that loyalism and the loyalist leaders must do more than simply make promises, as the UVF did, in very welcome terms, last week. I have asked the Chief Constable for advice on whether specification is still appropriate for the UVF and I await that advice in due course. It was very important that the leadership of the UVF declared its intention to abandon paramilitarism and criminality in the clearest terms, but the hon. Gentleman was right to say that there has to be delivery on the decommissioning of weapons. There was a certain uncertainty about what that meant exactly, and the only legal way to decommission in the sense that will give confidence to the rest of the community&#151;including this House&#151;is to engage with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning.</p>

the discipline of its organisation, managed to deliver that and get all the members and so-called volunteers to abide by its diktat, including ending criminality.The IMC was clear on that point. Obviously, there need to be further developments, but the intention to devolve policing and justice is an ambition of the Government&#146;s, agreed at St. Andrews and repeated since.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07050990000167">We would like to see a target of May next year, by which time the devolution of policing and justice can be achieved. That policy is supported by all the parties in Northern Ireland, although there are disagreements, especially among the DUP and the UUP about whether the target of barely a year&#146;s time is achievable. Let us see whether the incredible pace of change over the past few weeks, expressed yesterday&#151;and, in a sense, sanctified yesterday&#151;can see that progress being made. Undoubtedly, that will have to take into account the wider security situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07050990000168">The hon. Gentleman mentioned Sinn Fein Ministers, and it was significant yesterday that they willingly and without qualification took the pledge of office,which included an absolute commitment, as the House legislated in the Northern Ireland (St. Andrews Agreement) Act 2006, to support the police and the rule of law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="70509-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07050990000169">I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s final point about the past, and that is why I said in my statement that the past still has to be addressed. I was very struck, as I know he will have been on his frequent visits&#151;people appreciate the diligence with which he pursues his duties&#151;by the fact that, despite the incredible events that led up to the remarkable nature of yesterday, Northern Ireland still keeps getting dragged back to the past. Although inquiries must naturally reach their end&#151;costing &#163;2 million so far; &#163;100 million has gone to pay lawyers&#146; fees, which are ratcheting up astronomically day by day&#151;I do not think that they will deal with the past, whatever may emerge from the reports that are produced. We need to have a frank debate and I will certainly give the hon. Gentleman a categoric assurance that we are considering the issue. My hon. Friends the Under-Secretaries and I will look into that and consult widely with the parties, and I will certainly talk to other parties about it, includingthe hon. Gentleman&#146;s. We must try to find a way of consulting that enables us to move forward and underpins the developments of yesterday. I am grateful for his support.</p>

 I very much welcome the wholesome and full statement made by the Secretary of State to reflect what happened at Stormont yesterday. It was a day that I have longed to see throughout the time that I have been in public office&#151;and I have held office for some four decades, during the worst of the troubles. Enormous progress has been made.</p>

They must be remembered, as must the fact that some of the people who hold the highest office have been purveyors of hatred and perpetrators of violence. They in turn must do all in their power to undo their evil deeds and attitudes. I hope that the Secretary of State will use his office to facilitate that.</p>

Also, does he agree that the shared future to which he referred, and to which we all aspire, is one that must be shared not only by the extremes but by the entire community?</p>

David Trimble and others showed tremendous courage at the beginning of the process, and took a lot of hits for doing so, but the SDLP deserves particular praise for expressing its support for policing at a time when that was a most difficult thing to do in nationalist communities. That helped to create the circumstances that were signalled and symbolised so momentously yesterday.</p>

There will be Orders-in-Council procedures to implement those provisions when the Assembly decides that it wants to accept that devolution. Therefore, Orders in Council will still have a role, and I hope that we will be able to carry on working with the hon. Gentleman. I hope too that he will not suffer an allergic reaction, as it were, to every Order in Council necessary to take Northern Ireland forward.

Friend the Secretary of State aware that all of us on the Labour Benches are very pleased indeed that the name of Mo Mowlam has been mentioned today? She was a politician of great political courage, as she showed time and again when she was the first Secretary of State for Northern Ireland after we came into office. Does he agree that one other person should be mentioned? John Hume, who initiated the talks between his party&#151;the Social Democratic and Labour party&#151;and Sinn Fein, was often denounced by some people in Northern Ireland and perhaps here, but he pioneered the process that led to what happened yesterday in Northern Ireland.</p>

 I wholeheartedly agree with everything that my hon.

The way in which John Hume drove the process through, and his vision and eloquence, helped to get us to where we are. On the Second Reading of the emergency legislation on 27 March, I paid tribute to all the individuals that my hon. Friend has mentioned and to John Major, the Prime Minister and many others who played a crucial role. I did not think it was right to repeat what I said, but I agree with my hon. Friend.</p>

happened yesterday? The Secretary of State is correct: we did take hits. But, having said that, I welcome enormously the events of yesterday at Stormont. I would like to place on the record thanks on behalf of the Ulster Unionist party to various and successive Secretaries of State and direct rule Ministers, who may be leaving us on account of the restoration of devolution. I am most grateful to the Secretary of State for putting on the record a tribute to George Dawson MLA and for sending his condolences to the family. His death was a very sad loss to the Democratic Unionist party&#151;the alternative Unionist party&#151;and a huge loss to his wife and two daughters.</p>

That Church teaches that homosexuality is evil. Will the Secretary of State kindly give assurances to the many young and not so young gay and lesbian people and transsexuals in Northern Ireland that, in the forthcoming new, rosy Northern Ireland, there will be no diminution or erosion of the rights and protections that are extended to them?</p>

 On the hon. Lady&#146;s latter point, the legislation, including the somewhat controversial legislation that I and my ministerial team took through Parliament earlier this year, makes it completely impossible to exercise any discrimination against people on the grounds of sexuality, adding to the other grounds already in the statute in Northern Ireland. That answers her point.</p>

May I also mention those members of the Conservative party, including Sir John Major and the Ministers who handed their baton to me when we took over in 1997, who worked to bring about peace in Northern Ireland? Does my right hon. Friend agree that, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) said, although it is absolutely right to pay particular tribute to Sinn Fein and the DUP for the enormous amount of work that they have put intothe settlement, the Good Friday agreement was about the inclusivity of all parties in Northern Ireland, including the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist party, because they hold ministries, the Alliance party and the Progressive Unionist party?

 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for all that he has said. I want to echo and underline the points that he made about the inclusivity of the process in relation to all the parties, including the SDLP and the UUP&#151;which are in government with Sinn Fein and the DUP&#151;the Alliance party, the Greens and everybody else, although people will not think I am churlish when I say I am glad that that does not include the independent Unionist party anymore. He is rightto say that the Good Friday agreement included all parties, and that is very important. That spirit should be taken forward. I think that this situation will stick because the two most polarised parties have agreed. The problem that the SDLP and the UUP faced in the past was that there were people further away from the centre on both sides who in one way or another undermined what they were trying to do and were not in the tent. What is good about the current situation&#151;this is why I believe this is the political end game in a real sense&#151;is that the two most polarised parties are included.

 In this momentous and splendid week for Northern Ireland&#151;a week that many of us, in the bleakest moments, thought would never actually happen&#151;does the Secretary of State think that it is worth reflecting that patience really has been a virtue? It would have been all too easy at times to have compromised with the men of violence. The fact that that did not happen has meant that this could now be a lasting peace. He and his Ministers are to be congratulated on their patience.</p>

Friend the Member for Torfaen knew many of those during his period as Secretary of State and before as Minister of State. There were high points and there were very low points. This process can be a bit of a model for other processes around the world. People have given the middle east attention from time to time, but there has not been the same relentless forensic attention as there has been in Northern Ireland. That was started by Conservative Governments under Margaret Thatcher and John Major and carried on&#151;I think everybody will agree&#151;by the Prime Minister and his Secretaries of State and Ministers with tremendous verve, dynamism and energy. That needs to be recognised.</p>

 I very much agree with my hon. Friend that the origins of the dispute are historically complex and go back centuries. They include the relationship between the island of Ireland and Britain.

I know that my aunt in Dungarvan, County Waterford, would want me to recognise the efforts of John Major and the current Prime Minister, which indeed I do. Finally, I add a comment in my native tongue of Scottish Gaelic, which is a first cousin of Irish Gaelic, but without any of the perceived tribal, political or religious overtones: gum bi mile mile beannachd air sluagh Eirinn a Tuath.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for his kind comments about the servicemen and women who have given so much for Northern Ireland and our country over the years. As a humble Guardsman, I served in Armagh in Northern Ireland in the 1970s, and we sacrificed an awful lot. On that note, before we close the door completely on the past, may I bring up the tragic situation of Captain Robert Nairac, who was my captain from 1st Battalion the Grenadier Guards? He was the first man to break my nose; he was an excellent boxer. His family, quite rightly, would like to know what has happened to his body, and we would all like to put that question to rest. Will the Secretary of State tell the House what is happening in the negotiations to find out what happened to Captain Robert Nairac?</p>

 I commend the hon. Gentleman&#146;s role and that of his colleagues. The predicament experiencedby the family of Captain Robert Nairac is appallingand unacceptable. Many relatives of those who have disappeared face the awful situation of not knowing what happened to loved ones or where their remains might be. We have provided the opportunity, through recent legislation, for death certificates to be issued. That is at least something, but it is not sufficient and we will continue to pursue the matter.</p>

I was struck by the fact that despite his being injured, and despite his family having seen the events on at least one occasion, he still wanted the process to work, and he welcomed the fact that Martin McGuinness was the Deputy First Minister. He said, &#147;Look, I may have fought all these people, and they may have tried to take my life away years ago, but I want to see them in government with other parties, democratically pursuing their interests in peace and with respect for the rule of law.&#148; I thought that that change of heart by somebody who had suffered what he had suffered boded very well forthe future.</p>

<h3 align="center">Ministry of Justice</h3>
<a name="ordayhd_1"><a name="70509-0006.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="07050990000366"><h5 align="left">1.26 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o112"><a name="07050990000227"><a name="70509-0006.htm_spmin0"><a name="07050990000497"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Mr. David Hanson):</b>
 Today I am delivering a statement that the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice will make in another place at 3.30 pm. Today is the firstday of the Ministry of Justice. Creating our new Department is the right thing to do; it is the logical next step, after decades of constitutional and criminal justice reform, in delivering what I believe will be a world-class justice system that has the protection of the public and the reduction of crime and reoffending atits heart.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para0"><a name="07050990000228">The independence of the judiciary is paramount to the success of any justice system and vital to the well-being of our nation. I will continue to uphold that independence, as is my constitutional and statutory duty, and so, too, will my successors. The Ministry of Justice deals with all justice issues, in conjunctionwith other criminal justice Ministers. The Ministry of Justice and the Home Office are engaged in fighting crime and protecting the public, and the two Departments will continue to work closely together to deliver that. Appropriate working arrangements will be put in place at official level to ensure that that happens, particularly on criminal law and sentencing policy&#151;areas in which the relationship between the two Departments will be vital. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has announced the creation of a new Cabinet Committee on criminal justice and crime policy, which he will chair, and on which my right hon. Friends the Home Secretary and the Attorney-General will sit. In addition, the Ministry of Justice has responsibility for the family and civil justice systems, which remain vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07050990000229">In this first statement from the Ministry of Justice I want to address and set out our approach to penal policy. Copies of the document, &#147;Penal Policy: a background paper&#148; are available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office. The Government have made significant progress in tackling crime since 1997. Over the past decade, according to the British crime survey, crime has fallen by 35 per cent. Offences brought to justice are up by nearly 40 per cent. since 2002. Ineffective trials have more than halved in the Crown court since 1997. Fine collection is at 91 per cent., up from 74 per cent. in 2003-04. The Government have continued throughout to rebalance the criminal justice system in favour of victims and the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07050990000230">The creation of the Ministry of Justice offers a significant opportunity to build on that success with the following three-part programme. First, we will continue to protect the public by ensuring that we provide prison places for people whom the courts determine need custody. The Government have already built 20,000 new prison places over the past 10 years. That is an increase of 33 per cent., and those places were built faster than ever before. Some 8,000 further places will be built by 2012. We want to examine the question of how to modernise the estate to provide more cost-effective facilities that are better equipped to reduce reoffending. We also want to identify whether the resources in our estate can be used to finance new  <br>

accommodation, whether that be new large state-of-the-art prisons, or smaller local provision for women and young offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07050990000231">My noble Friend the Secretary of State for Justice has asked Lord Carter of Coles to provide an assessment of the plans for the 8,000 prison places and of the longer-term issues affecting the estate, including the interrelationship between prisons and the rest of the Ministry of Justice estate, to ensure that we have a coherent strategy. Our prison building programme will therefore continue to ensure that we have capacity to lock away the most dangerous prisoners for as long as they are dangerous, and to enable sentencers to send people into custody whenever they think that that is required. The new indeterminate sentence for public protection is now in place, ensuring that the most dangerous prisoners are released only when it is safe for that to be done. Over 2,200 such sentences have been issued so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07050990000232">The Government have always recognised that prison must be used for those who need it, and that sentences should be designed to reduce reoffending. However, over decades we have learned that some short custodial sentences are not effective in reducing reoffending. That is why we want greater use to be made of the best community sentences where evidence shows that they reduce reoffending and offer more effective punishment than custodial sentences of less than 12 months. Sentencing policy must support the use of our resources in such a way as best to protect the public, punish offenders and reduce reoffending. Prison should be used to protect the public to the extent and for the periods necessary to deliver the statutory aims of sentencing in accordance with the Criminal Justice Act 2003, with alternatives to custody used when they are more effective in reducing reoffending and providing payback to the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07050990000233">We will ask the Sentencing Guidelines Council to review whether its guidelines fully reflect the principles set out in the 2003 Act. We will ask it, too, to look at its processes to ensure that it can operate in the way that it considers best enables it to produce effectively such guidelines as are necessary. We will ensure that where serious and dangerous offenders breach their licence conditions, the punishment is a swift return to custody, for as long as is necessary. For non-dangerous prisoners, we will propose new arrangements for them to be recalled to prison for 28 days. We propose, too, that suspended sentence orders should apply to more serious offences, as we originally intended when they were created in 2003, not to summary ones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07050990000234">Secondly, we need to increase confidence in community sentences and to support their greater use where they are more effective in reducing reoffending. Offenders will be required to undertake programmes to stop them reoffending, and training to equip them with the skills to get back into work. They will also be required to carry out unpaid work in their local community, organised by the best available providers, whether in the public sector or the private sector&#151;or, indeed, in the voluntary third sector. They will be subject to packages to restrict their liberty and movements, to make them face up to the consequences of their actions, and to pay back to the communities that they have harmed. The individual being punished, the community, and the sentencer all have to  <br>

understand that if the penalty is breached, punishment will follow, with custody if necessary. We will ensure that prison places are available for that purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07050990000235">Thirdly and finally, we will renew our commitment to delivering in line with the vision set out in the Carter report of December 2003, including end-to-end offender management and public service reform. There is excellence in the public, private and voluntary sectors in the delivery of prison and probation services, and we want to build on that to reduce reoffending further. In particular, that means commissioning the most effective interventions that will best support the management and rehabilitation of offenders, and making use of the fullest range of providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07050990000236">I believe that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State and the ministerial team present today have put in place the framework, the people, the programmes and the knowledge to make a massive difference to the way in which we deal with crime and protect the public in this country. We must make sure that that investment pays off. Above all, that means the right punishment, for the right length of time, for as long as necessary, with the right interventions and the right level of supervision for each offence to prevent reoffending. I commend the statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o113"><a name="07050990000237"><a name="70509-0006.htm_spnew0"><a name="07050990000498"><b>Mr. Oliver Heald (North-East Hertfordshire)(Con):</b>
 I start by congratulating the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) on assuming his new duties after hisspell in Northern Ireland&#151;seemingly quite a successful spell. I also congratulate the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe), who is responsible for prisons and has joined the team. I thank the Minister of State in the usual way for giving me early sight of his statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07050990000238">The Opposition have repeatedly said that to put prisons and the courts into a single person&#146;s hands is potentially a recipe for constitutional crisis. The Lord Chancellor has tried cajoling judges about sentencing, and he has tried threatening them; now he will simply be able to dictate to them, on the basis that if too many people go to prison, the budget for the courts will be cut. The Lord Chancellor has a constitutional duty to uphold and protect the independence of the judges and the rule of law. However, it is now his Department that poses a threat to the judiciary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para10"><a name="07050990000239">It is no surprise that on 29 March, when the Home Secretary announced that he was donating his problem areas to the new Department, it was the Lord Chief Justice himself who said:</p>
<a name="70509-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="07050990000358"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The announcement raises important issues of principle...Structures are required which will prevent the additional responsibilities of the new ministry interfering with...the independent administration...of the court service.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para11"><a name="07050990000240">A working group has been set up with the judges, but it is clear from the Minister&#146;s statement that agreement has not been reached. Will he tell us what areasof agreement there are regarding those important assurances, and what has not yet been agreed by that important working group? He must tell us, because it is absolutely vital that the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law should be protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07050990000241">The background to the statement is the continuing problem of prison overcrowding. The Lord Chief Justice also said that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para13"><a name="07050990000242">I believe that the word &#147;pressure&#148; puts it far too lightly. It was the Lord Chancellor himself who, when he was a Home Office Minister, said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para14"><a name="07050990000243">One thing is for sure: the Government have always underestimated the need for prison places, given their home affairs policies. Given that they have passed so many criminal justice Acts&#151;there are now 3,000 extra offences&#151;it is not surprising that they need more prison places. Everyone predicted that, yet the prison places to which the Minister referred were ordered in the time of John Major. We therefore need a bit more joined-up thinking from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para15"><a name="07050990000244">How can those duties be passed to what remains of the Department for Constitutional Affairs&#151;fromone failing Department to another? The Magistrates Association says that it is impossible for magistrates courts to perform adequately at present. London&#146;s most senior county court judge, Judge Collins, described the county court as being in &#147;chaos&#148;. The verdict of the Constitutional Affairs Committee on the legal aid changes was that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para17"><a name="07050990000246">The Department for Constitutional Affairs was responsible for all those problems, and for electoral administration; it was the Department in charge of postal voting and electronic counting. Is it really right that these important functions should go from the Home Office to this failing Department?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para18"><a name="07050990000247">The last time the Lord Chancellor tried to encourage judges to keep the prison population down we ended up with a convicted sex offender being released on bail. What guarantee can the Minister give that proper safeguards will be put in place to protect the public? What sort of offences will no longer lead to short custodial sentences? What sort of offences will no longer attract suspended sentences? Are we really going to let off sexual offenders, shoplifters who are drug addicts, and people who have committed offences of violence such as assault occasioning actual bodily harm? On the recall of serious offenders, are we really saying on the one hand, &#147;Short custodial sentences are no good&#148;&#151;that is what the statement said&#151;and on the other hand, &#147;Oh, but with serious criminals, we can recall them from licence for 28 days,&#148; which is a short custodial sentence? None of that adds up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para19"><a name="07050990000248">The Minister said that he would ask the Sentencing Guidelines Council to review its guidelines, but why is he going to do that? Is it because he thinks that sentences are too long at the moment? What guarantee can he give that prisoners are not going to be released early from prison, as everyone expects? We have hundreds of prisoners in police cells. The prisons are full. It is the Government&#146;s fault, but what is the Prime  <br>

 I warmly welcome the creation of the Ministry of Justice and the new ministerial team that has been assembled, and wish them well. However, I have two concerns. First, as regards the judiciary, I do not think that my right hon. Friend has dealt with the matter properly and adequately today. It is our unwritten constitution, not the Government, that is the guarantor of our liberties. Lord Woolf was very specific: he had deep concerns about what the Government were proposing. Has my right hon. Friend met Lord Woolf, and what has Lord Woolf said, subsequent to the decisions that have been made? As for the choice of Lord Carter of Coles for the prison inquiry&#151;he was the man who completely mucked up our legal aid system. Putting him in charge of the prison system was the wrong decision.

I hope they will share an agenda with us, and I hope and believe that in due course they will come to welcome the creation of the Ministry of Justice today.</p>

 On behalf of my colleagues, I welcome the government&#146;s interest over 10 years in improvingthe criminal justice system. We welcome the creation of the Ministry of Justice and we welcome the righthon. Gentleman and the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) to the team. Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that he and his colleagues will have to work hard to reassure the public that the decision to create the Ministry has been fully thought through, and in particular to explain how the constitutional and electoral matters fit comfortably in a Ministry of Justice dealing with justice and the criminal justice system?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para24"><a name="07050990000259">Can the Minister give an assurance&#151;this picks up some of the questions that he has been asked already&#151;that the new Ministry will have the resources that it needs for the jobs that it has to do? It needs money for the probation service and adequate money for the Prison Service, and must ensure that there are no cuts in courts that are needed around the country, in addition to the many that we have already, or further holding back of the money for legal aid, which has been hugely criticised, not least in the recent report of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, chaired by my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). Will the right hon. Gentleman undertake to review the policy on legal aid, and take the advice from around the House that another contract with Lord Carter to do another job for the renamed Ministry will not add to anybody&#146;s confidence in the new team?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para25"><a name="07050990000260">On sentencing, there was a welcome recognitionin the Minister&#146;s remarks that many short custodial sentences are not effective, and that community sentences are underused. Can he tell us whether, when he introduces his new legal proposals for sentencing policy changes and for sentencing guidelines policy, sentences will in future mean what they say, which is what the public want above all? Do the Government accept, by implication, that their prison policy has failed? Either we have in England and Wales the most criminal population in western Europe, which I do not believe can intrinsically be the case, or there is no logical explanation for 80,000-plus prison places and building, because reoffending prisoners come backso often.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="70509-0006.htm_para26"><a name="07050990000261">Finally and importantly&#151;a topic picked up by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald), on the Conservative Front Bench&#151;there is a welcome commitment to the independence of the judiciary, who are not yet fully on board with the new plans. Can the Minister give an absolute pledge from the Front Bench that during his time in office and that of the Ministry, no Minister in any Department, including the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird), will criticise judges, and that they will be allowed to do their job free of political criticism by the Government of the day?</p>

 I am grateful for the support fromthe hon. Gentleman and the Liberal Democrat party. There is in many ways a synergy with the policy objectives that we seek, and I hope we can consider a range of sentencing options which will provide a  <br>

greater menu for the judiciary to examine. One of the key issues that the hon. Gentleman alluded to was that of community-based sentencing. Yes, the objectivein all this has to be punishment, and we need tohave strong punishment even in community-based sentencing, but we need to have it with the objectiveof preventing reoffending. We must ensure that individuals learn from their experience in the community, get better trained, recognise, through reparation work, the damage that they have done, and return to the community as better citizens as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70509-0007.htm_para0"><a name="07050990000263">With regard to the financing of the Department, the hon. Gentleman will know that we are in the middle of a comprehensive spending review settlement. I can assure him that the resources from the Home Office and the DCA are there on the table for this year, as planned. Obviously, that will be subject to negotiation. However, he can take the reassurance that the Government are committed to reducing crime, and one of the main methods of doing so will be the work of my right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State and my other colleagues in the Ministry of Justice.I very much hope that the CSR settlement willreflect that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="70509-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07050990000264">The hon. Gentleman said that we wish sentencing to mean what it says. Obviously, we want greater clarity in sentencing. There will be options to ensure that, as with indeterminate sentences, those who are a danger to the community spend longer in prison, until such time as they are deemed not to be a danger to the community. That is a solid basis for the policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="70509-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07050990000265">I take issue with the hon. Gentleman on the question of the Labour Government&#146;s &#147;failure&#148; on prison policy. I do not agree with his statement. We now have an option to look at a wider range of sentencing policies. The 20,000 prison places that have been built over the past 10 years and the 8,000 that are being built between now and 2012 will make a difference. However, at the heart of our whole criminal justice policy must be the objective of preventing reoffending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="70509-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07050990000266">Lastly, let me say to the hon. Gentleman that I hope that I have made it clear to the House that the independence of the judges is paramount, and it is part of the role of a criminal justice Ministry to ensure that that independence is maintained. I can never give a blanket guarantee on the issues that he examined, but I would say that our role is to set a framework for a sentencing policy and a prison policy that prevents reoffending, while the judiciary&#146;s role is to interpret that on a case-by-case basis. I believe that they do a very good job in the vast majority of cases, and I look forward to working with them to prevent offendingstill further.</p>

There are great opportunities there for my hon. Friend, and I welcome his comments.</p>

 I welcome the two new Ministers, whom we look forward to questioning in the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs. Why was this important constitutional change rushed through without any prior parliamentary discussion so that some of the concerns of the judiciary, for example, could have been resolved? That was surely the lesson to be learnedfrom the last round of constitutional changes, which was suddenly sprung upon everybody and had to be modified subsequently. Given that there was no significant new policy on prisons in today&#146;s statement, would it not have been better to use this first opportunity to tell the House that the Government are rethinking the proposals that the Select Committee believes will seriously damage access to justice through legal aid?</p>

for the House as a whole. The right hon. Gentleman will know that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made a statement to Parliament, as did my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. These are machinery of Government changes, as we have made clear. Time will tell how the Ministry of Justice beds in. He said that there is no new policy direction in my statement. I disagree&#151;there are new policy nuances in the direction of policy on supporting reoffending reductions inthe community. No doubt there will be a major opportunity to discuss those over the next few weeks and months.</p>

A large number of prisoners enter prison with drug problems and continue to have them, and we need to take strong action to help them through that. Unless we stop the drugs problem inside prisons, it will continue to drive crime levels in terms of feeding people&#146;s habit once they are outside and in the community. We have spent a considerable amount of resources on drug treatment.

 The Minister said that he wanted to deliver a world-class justice system. However, we clearly do not have a world-class prison system. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) said, our prisons are not only full but spilling into our police cells. I saw that with my own eyes when I recently visited Dorchester prison, where not one single cell was spare. Will the Minister elaborate on the way in which we can prevent the dilution of sentencing? More important, when will police cells stop being used for the overflow from prison cells?</p>

Under Operation Safeguard, and through the Under-Secretary, we are implementing policies that we introduced in the days of the Home Office to ensure that we use police cells only as a last resort. Sadly, given the prison population, we have had to use them. In several places, police cells are used as temporary accommodation for prisoners.

Members of the words of &#147;Cumberland Gap&#148;, which was at the top of the hit parade in 1957 for five weeks. It runs:</p>

Uniquely, we have a position whereby people who record and produce music, which is a single creative act&#151;often not repeated, despite the number of times people try to re-record the same tune&#151;suffer a disproportionate imposition. After 50 years, their music can be taken, put on another CD or included in another collection, sold around the world, often with the revival selling more than the original, with nothing being paid tothe recording artist, the producer, the band or the individual&#146;s family or estate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="70509-0007.htm_para17"><a name="07050990000297">We are not talking about millionaire pop stars. I compliment Sharon Donegan, who opened the books to us. When Lonnie Donegan died aged 71 in 2002, his total estate amounted to &#163;82,000. His income, which also meant that of his wife and children, ran to &#163;30,000 to &#163;40,000 a year from his royalties in a good year. We are talking not about millionaires, but about working musicians. In fact, the Musicians Union has done a detailed analysis and found that the average income from royalties for people who work in the music industry&#151;even someone who may have been well known in their time&#151;is about &#163;15,000 a year, which is not a great deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="70509-0007.htm_para18"><a name="07050990000298">This debate is significant now because it is 50 years since many of the original rock and roll tunes were released. Lonnie Donegan recorded &#147;Rock Island Line&#148; in January 1957&#151;my preference over &#147;Cumberland Gap&#148;&#151;but his family has received no money for it. Tommy Steele recorded &#147;Singing the Blues&#148; and had a hit with it. As a primary school pupil, when I went out for my Halloween, as they called it in Scotland, I had to give a performance to get my treat. It was not like it was in America&#151;where it was trick or treat, but if they did not get a treat they smashed the windows or something like that. We had to sing and I learned &#147;Singing the Blues&#148; for my little treat because it was easier to sing than others.</p>

Their company, Pye Records&#151;which found and cultivated them, advanced their careers and recorded the music&#151;also lose out. We want equality, and the Bill is based on common sense.</p>

We are not asking for that sort of equality. We would settle for the same situation as that in the USA, where copyright is paid for 95 years. There are many sensible reasons for that, one being that it supports the musicians.</p>

In the UK alone, 7,000 musicians will lose their rights to any payment for the recordings in the next 10 years. Some of them are very well known. In 1961-62 the Beatles came on the scene, but in four or five years&#146; time many of their hits will stop being eligible for royalty payments. People may well say that that is fine because the Beatles are millionaires and can afford it, but that is not true of many of the people who recorded the strings in the studios, for example, or other recording artists. Indeed, whoever played the drums instead of Ringo Starr on the Beatles early records&#151;it is often said that he did not, in fact, play on them&#151;receives only a pittance, and those records will soon cease to be eligible for royalties.</p>

People are now twice as incentivised to record and release a record in America because the right to copyright for the company and the artists applies for 95 years. That makes it twice as intelligent, so to speak, to go to the USA to release a record than anywhere in the EU. That is why 40,000 musicians and 3,500 record companies signed a Phonographic Performance Ltd petition to improve the copyright terms in the UK to the same level as those in the USA. We have already lost some of our creative industry to America because of the mass culture, but our unique musical culture still rests in the independent record labels and is still to be harvested. We should not allow it to be taken from us.</p>

It makes no difference whether people are making a cheap record or a more expensive first release, as the price of the recording is no different. There are massive disparities, of course, in the price that will be paid for the second releases and the compilations, which are not the unique set, as things are taken from here and there and the best parts are often missed out.</p>

There is the version of Gerry and the Pacemakers&#146; &#147;You&#146;ll Never Walk Alone&#148; that has been stolen by the fans on the terraces, but if we listen to Nina Simone singing it as a blues song, we realise that the same music with a different time frame and different singer is a unique experience. I think that Gowers missed that point, because a song cannot be replaced by someone recording it later. My particular favourite recordings of the Bruch and Mendelssohn minor key symphonies are by someone called Grumiaux, a Belgian who recorded in the 1950s. I have three or four versions, but none of them compares with that. That is the uniqueness that we are talking about, which should be paid for, for at least the lifetime and beyond of the recording artist.</p>

 That is an important point, and we have taken some considerable time and effort to think through the safeguards, which I will come to in a moment. I want to reassure all communities that this legislation will be used fairly and for the benefit of all, and not in a disproportionate manner. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will remember that our debateon this question in Committee, which was identifiedby the hon. Member for Ashford, centred on the proportionate nature of the power. That is why we are now introducing the need to obtain a warrant to search more widely than was allowed in the original clause. Such a warrant will be required to search other premises where it is believed that documents relating to the person might be found. That should ensure that people do not place relevant documents in someone else&#146;s safe keeping in order to avoid their being seized.

There is no reference, however, to the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995, which details how seized information and evidence should be treated.

 As the hon. Gentleman says, the PACE codes apply to England and Wales. He might know that we are seeking to change the code of practice in relation to code C, which covers the police being able to ask the nationality of a person who has been taken into custody when it is unclear whether they are a UK citizen. It was in that sense that I referred to the PACE codes. I have already talked about all the checks and balances that will apply to the proposed power. In regard to the hon.

 I should like to thank the Minister for the kind remarks that she made at the beginning of her speech. We welcome the thrust of the new clauses and amendments. We made an effort in Committee to ensure that the Bill would have a practical effect and make a significant differenceto the practice of immigration control, and to the enforcement of the important laws in this area. That was the intention behind our various amendments to that part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70509-0008.htm_para27"><a name="07050990000336">I am glad that Ministers have reflected further and turned our amendments into the new clauses under consideration this afternoon. Not only is that good for the Bill and for the practice and enforcement of immigration control, but it represents a small victory for scrutiny by the House of Commons, which is much abused. It is a textbook example of how scrutiny can work, and of how the Committee stage can improve a Bill in small but important ways, if Ministers are flexible enough to take on board arguments made in good faith by Opposition parties.</p>

Although she has rightly emphasised the issue of proportionality of response&#151;and she has talked a lot about the safeguards over the past few minutes&#151;she said previously that our amendment was unnecessary and potentially disproportionate under article 8 of the European convention on human rights, especially in relation to widening the power to enter and search premises for relevant documents. We suggested expanding the scope of the provision to cover &#147;any other premises&#148;, to ensure that those searches were as effective as possible.

 Like the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green), I welcome the revised amendments submitted by the Minister, notwithstanding her detailed explanation about the safeguards and operation ofthe Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07050990000340">In that regard, I have a question about the role of the chief inspector of the Border and Immigration Agency. If there is concern about an immigration officer&#146;s pursuit of such searches, is it correct that the chief inspector can refuse to co-operate with, say, Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of prisons, the Independent Police Complaints Commission or other bodies that might be concerned about the operation of the clause? I have no objection to the use of the provision; it is important that the powers that officers have are clearly laid out. As I mentioned, however, I am concerned about the effect on community relations, which is why I asked about monitoring. If there are concerns, is it true that the chief inspector will be able to block any investigation?</p>

 The hon. Member for Ashford is right that the European convention on human rights was discussed in relation to the proportionality of the legislation. As I understand it, the amendment that he tabled would have extended the powers sought by the clause then in the Bill. The introduction of the seeking of a warrant helps to satisfy the requirement to protect people&#146;s rights under the legislation. We are satisfied that the new clauses and amendments are compatible with the convention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07050990000342">It was interesting to consider the examples given in relation to the new clauses and amendments. Of course, police already have powers to deal with the criminal offence situation outlined by the hon. Gentleman. The provision is about the seeking of documents relating to nationality, in order to effect removal and deportation at the appropriate time. With regard to that analysis, he had a point. We wished to address that, not leave a loophole in what we all agree is necessary legislation, or create an incentive for people to hide their documents with family, friends and so on. Although the majority of documents are found on the premises where the person is arrested, or on premises under the person&#146;s control, we recognise the possibility of creating a perverse incentive for those documentsto be stashed away somewhere else, so we wish to extend the powers. Given the analysis that we have undertaken, there is no question but that extending the safeguards to include the seeking of a warrant&#151;which does not apply to the powers to search the premises where the person is found or premises under the person&#146;s control&#151;satisfies the requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07050990000343">In response to the question of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen), the chief inspector will have oversight of Border and Immigration Agency activity, and will therefore oversee immigration officers exercising powers. The IPCC will oversee the police. I hope that that clarifies the relationship, but I can write  <br>

 New clause 1 is grouped with a large number of amendments, none of which I tabled, so I shall leave their explanation to others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para18"><a name="070509103000039">New clause 1 sets out a simple proposition: when foreign nationals are deported because they have committed relevant crimes, their victims should be entitled to know about the deportation. In the Billas amended in Committee, clause 31 provides forwhat the heading calls &#147;Automatic deportation&#148;. At its most basic, my argument is that if the deportation is automatic, what is the problem in telling the victim that it has happened?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para19"><a name="070509103000040">The truth, however, is that not every foreign national convicted of an offence and sent to prison will be deported. For some offences, there will be a sentence of less than 12 months, which will not trigger the power. Clause 32 provides for a number of exceptions that will mean that others will not be deported. To my mind, the fact that, in some instances, uncertainty remains as to whether a deportation will take place strengthensthe case for victims to know what has happened. Iwant to illustrate that argument with reference to the constituency case that first attracted my interest inthe issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para20"><a name="070509103000041">In 2005, a young female adult was walking home from work on a Saturday night. She was followed by a man for two miles until she was in a road where noone else was about. There she was brutally raped. The offender was arrested. He was a foreign national. He was tried and convicted, and the judge, sentencing him to six years in prison, said that he had shown absolutely no remorse. It was at that point that I was asked by my constituent&#146;s family to find out whether the offender would be deported from prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para21"><a name="070509103000042">The young female was understandably sufferingnot just physical but mental trauma because of her experiences. She wanted to know whether there was any risk at all that the offender might one day beback on the streets where she lives. For her that isan ever-present, uncomfortable thought. I was quite willing to help to try to put her mind at rest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para22"><a name="070509103000043">I wrote to Home Office Ministers several times to find out about the fate of the foreign national in prison.

The Domestic Violence, Crimes And Victims Act 2004 enables victims of some sexual offences, for instance, to obtain information from the probation service about licence and supervision conditions when an offender is released from prison.

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para32"><a name="070509103000053">There are victims of serious crimes who have a legitimate interest in knowing whether a deportation, as directed by clause 31, has indeed taken place. Forthe sake of those victims and, indeed, for the sake of the public&#146;s confidence in our laws, it is in the public interest for the information specified in new clause 1 to be given to those victims. In weighing the interests of the offender and the victim, surely we should give the victim&#146;s rights the higher priority.

 I shall concentrate mainly on the four amendments tabled in my name, but let me first comment on what was said by the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), who made a powerful case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para33"><a name="070509103000055">When the rights of the victim are balanced against those of the offender, it is clear that the victim&#146;s rights should come first. I am sure the Minister agrees with that, but&#151;coming fresh to the matter&#151;I am puzzled by the response that the hon. Gentleman received from the Home Office, which told him that owing to a number of legal restrictions his constituent could not have the required information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para34"><a name="070509103000056">Given that we have been through a phase during which the Government were prepared to circulate posters and leaflets about hooligans who had received antisocial behaviour orders, and were making a virtue of naming and shaming people who were guilty of what I suspect were, in this context, relatively minor offences, and given that anyone who will be subject to deportation under the Government&#146;s proposals must have been convicted of an offence and been in prison for more than 12 months&#151;and must therefore have been convicted of a very serious offence&#151;I feel that the hon. Gentleman made a good case for the new clause, or a similar measure. We need an appropriate balance which gives more weight to the victim&#146;s rights than the current arrangement as explained to him by the Home Office. I hope that the Minister, who will have seen the new clause on the amendment paper for some time, will be able to respond positively to his hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para35"><a name="070509103000057">Amendment No. 8 would add to those considered for automatic deportation people who have committed immigration offences. As it stands, the Bill provides for what it calls automatic deportation, but I think it was widely agreed in Committee that that is a misnomer.It is automatic deportation except when it is not automatic, and that means a huge number of exceptions. The deportation provision applies to foreign prisoners who are sentenced to more than 12 months in jail, yet the Bill itself sets the punishment at 51 weeks for the new immigration offences that it creates. That means that anyone committing an offence under the terms of the Bill would not be subject to the part of it that provides for what it calls automatic deportation, which strikes me as perverse. It is not credible that a Bill that purports to protect our borders excludes from its own provisions automatic deportation of those who commit serious crimes against immigration officials and those who seek to enter this country illegally.</p>

However, the Opposition believe that a strong message needs to be sent: &#147;We will stop you if you try to come to this country illegally, but if we cannot we will catch you and send you away again quickly.&#148;</p>

The number of asylum seekers has dropped considerablyin recent years, mainly because of the end&#151;thankfully&#151;of wars on the continent of Europe, but there is a huge overhang in the system, which is onethe main problems the Government face. We want to prevent anything similar from happening in the future, if there should again&#151;God forbid&#151;be large-scale movements of refugees across Europe, which would inevitably end up with hundreds of thousands of people coming to this country, as we have found in the past. That is the purpose of amendment No. 8.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para38"><a name="070509103000060">Amendment No. 14 would require the Secretary of State to make a deportation order at least one month before the end of a prisoner&#146;s sentence and would provide for that person to be deported within six months of the order being served. The Minister assured us at earlier stages of the passage of the Bill that he had the right systems and manpower to ensure that the deportation system would work better in future than it has in the past. He said that resourcesin what was the IND and is now the BIA&#151;the immigration and nationality directorate and the Border and Immigration Agency for those who are not keeping up with the fast-moving world of Home Office acronyms&#151;had increased tenfold over the past year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70509-0009.htm_para39"><a name="070509103000061">The amendment is designed to probe whether the Home Office&#146;s systems will ensure the deportation of the individuals it wants to deport, precisely because the scandal that cost the still immediately previous Home Secretary his job arose in part because of the inability of the Home Office, the Prison Service and other agencies to communicate and work together to get those people, who are serious criminals, out of the country. One fears that with the split in the Home Office, which we discussed in previous business today, those communication problems are likely to get worse, as the Prison Service has been even further removed from the ambit of the immigration service. The situation will certainly not get better and it may get worse, so the need for the amendment is even more urgent now than when we discussed it a few weeksago in Committee. The amendment would ensurethat arrangements were already in progress when an individual neared his or her release date, to make the whole process smoother and more efficient.</p>

We want to achieve the same things. At present, people who have been handed a suspended sentence are exempt even if they serve some of the sentence, and the amendments would close that loophole. We wanted to delete subsection (1) of clause 37 in its entirety, but the Government want to do that in another way.</p>

Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) will speak to his amendment No. 2, which also deals with exemptions from automatic deportation. Under clause 32, people are exempt if they are under 18 when convicted and, as I understand the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, he wants to focus on the date of the offence rather than the date of conviction. I have a degree of sympathy with Ministers on that point, as clearly they need to select one event as the cut-off point for the exemption. None of the options is perfect, but the advantage of using the date of the offence is that it will seem fairer. Justice can occasionally take a long time, so it is not difficult to imagine a situation where two 17-year-olds might commit a crime on the same day but one might be deported because his case took longer to get to court and he had passed his 18th birthday, while someone committing the same crime on the same day would be allowed to stay in the UK because he received justice more quickly. Such a hypothetical situation is not difficult to imagine; nor is it difficult to imagine that the public would find it somewhat unfair.</p>

Often, no criminal offence is committed in such cases so it can be difficult to decide whether information should be released, because when someone approaches us in such circumstances we inevitably hear only one side of the story.

Recently, a constituent I was dealing with had separated from her husband who had been violent. He had then been convicted of a sexual offence elsewhere in the country. He had also been subjecting her family to considerable harassment after the marriage broke down. In my opinion, we should have got rid of him as quickly as possible. However, we ran into the problem of not being able to get information about what was happening to him and whether he was going to be deported.</p>

However, whether or not they are removed it is common sense that the victim ought at least to have information on that. Has the person been subject to a deportation order? Has that order been signed? Has it been put into effect? If that has happened, it will give the victim some peace of mind. If for some reason it has not been possible to deport the convicted person, at least the victim will know that and can, if necessary, take whatever precautions they think are reasonable to try to avoid coming into contact again with the criminal.</p>

 The examples given are all very familiar. In some such circumstances, the assailant and the victim are married.

 That is a common scenario, but I can think of situations in which it would be difficult to give out such information. There might not have been a criminal charge.

I and other Members have dealt with constituents who have been very distressed when they have been the victim of a serious crime and it is not possible for them to know what is happening to the individual who committed it. We should contrast their situation with that of someone who has been a victim of crime in other circumstances and who would be able to get some information&#151;who would know if someone were to be released on parole, for example.

 I rise to support amendments Nos. 34 and 35, on which we hope to have an opportunity to vote at a later stage. Perhaps one of the biggest issues in terms of automatic deportation is that, in the Bill, automatic deportation is not automatic deportation. The key question about the processes whereby somebody goes through a criminal conviction and then ends up at some stage being deported is this: at what stage should the judicial consideration as to the merits of the case for deportation occur? We have strongly argued that that should happen at an early stage. We argue that the court of first instance at which the decision is taken as to whether someone is guilty and what sentence they should receive should also be the point at which it should be decided whether they ought to be deported. The Government&#146;s alternative&#151;having failed previously to execute judicial recommendations for deportation&#151;is to have a process whereby a decision remains to be taken by the Home Secretary as to whether certain exemptions apply. As a consequence, the decision will be subject to judicial review. Because it will be subject to judicial review, there will be a stay of proceedings in terms of the deportation until the judicial review has occurred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70509-0010.htm_para8"><a name="070509103000077">Therefore, rather than the judicial consideration of the issue taking place right at the start, it happens at the end of the process. Therefore, we can envisage situations arising in which a prisoner who is released because of judicial review proceedings having been initiated then wanders off somewhere. The judicial review proceedings then continue and it is decided that there is no case to answer, but the person concerned has been released. That is an absurd situation. Even if the Conservative party&#146;s recommendation for deportation decisions to be taken at least a month before the end of the sentence is accepted, we could end up with people being released and there being a stay of proceedings. With no deportation, a violent criminal could be allowed to wander around the streets when they should have been deported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70509-0010.htm_para9"><a name="070509103000078">It is clear that these issues should be dealt with at the start. Some offences that result in imprisonment&#151;such as not paying council tax, or stealing electricity, or not attending probation meetings&#151;do not make someone a major threat to society. If someone has been living in the country for 30 years, we would not expect them to be deported for not going to a meeting or not paying council tax. That would not be reasonable.</p>

Therefore, the situation he describes is very unlikely to arise. Also, no more than a handful of people each year are convicted of stealing electricity, and I am sure that the sentences for doing so are extremely light and of less than 12 months.</p>

 I refer the hon. Gentleman to the current wording of clause 31. Obviously, some cases are covered that do not have a 12-month sentence applied. Also, suspended sentences are applied insome circumstances. It would be useful if the hon. Gentleman did a little more research on sentences.</p>

That deals with one of the points of the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), in that at that stage the victim is involved in the criminal process. It is at that stage that the decision should be taken as to whetherit is appropriate to deport someone. There is no disagreement in this House that if someone comesto this country and goes about causing all sortsof problems, involving violence, for example&#151;the situation in which the victim is the sponsor is a good example&#151;they should be subject to deportation. The question is: what is a firm but fair and effective way of doing that? The Government have failed to be effective in the past. We are simply saying that this decision should be taken by the initial court.</p>

 I am not sure that that solvesthe good point of the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney). It might well be that a judge decides in the first instance that someone should be deported, but during the period of the prison sentence, the country to which he ought to be deported becomes so dangerous that he cannot be deported there. Things might be even worse in the current situation in which someone might get a letter saying &#147;X will be deported&#148; but they are not deported. I am not sure that this problem has been addressed.</p>

 I accept that our suggestion only partially addresses that, in that the victim will be involved in the initial process and in the decision-making process as to whether someone should be deported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70509-0010.htm_para11"><a name="070509103000084">There is a good argument in favour of new clause 1. As things currently stand, without new clause 1, there would be so-called automatic deportation as a result of some serious offence. A decision then would be taken by the Home Secretary as to whether that satisfies certain exemptions, and that would then be subject to judicial review, but the victim would not even know that a judicial review had gone through. Therefore, the situation would be that someone was released from prison and was free to move anywhere in the country. However, the victim may believe, because of the flaws in the design of the system, that a deportation is occurring but the person concerned turns up on their doorstep.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70509-0010.htm_para12"><a name="070509103000085">Frankly, the Government have got to get their act together and start designing systems that are firm, but fair and effective. The current proposals are not effective. They put the judicial process at the end of the system, rather than at the beginning, and that process should take place at the beginning.</p>

 I wish to speak briefly in support of my amendment No. 2 and of new clause 1, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70509-0010.htm_para13"><a name="070509103000087">I have previously raised with a Home Office Minister a case involving a constituent of mine, a young man from Leicester who was studying in Manchester. He was killed in a road accident by a Chinese citizen. The matter went before the courts and there was a seriesof adjournments before the final hearing took place. Unknown to my constituent&#146;s parents, the person responsible for the crime, although he had not been convicted&#151;he had been charged and was to appear for trial&#151;was removed by the Home Office back to China. So although they were ready to attend the trial of this gentleman and were seeking closure in order to move on, they were told by the court staff that he had been removed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70509-0010.htm_para14"><a name="070509103000088">The then Minister with responsibility for such matters, my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)&#151;he is now a Minister of State in the Department of Health&#151;told me that new procedures would be put in place to ensure that someone who was part of the judicial process would not be removed without people being informed. I am not sure whether that has happened. When the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality sums up the debate on this group of new clauses and amendments, he will doubtless tell us what has happened as a result of the issues raised in the Adjournment debate on this matter. Although I was satisfied with the actions of the then Minister, I was not convinced that the procedures adopted then by the Home Office would help us to ensure that such a situation would not occur again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70509-0010.htm_para15"><a name="070509103000089">Hence the need for new clause 1, which is a sensible, reasonable provision that would help the Home Office and the victims of crime. In the light of today&#146;s statement about splitting the Home Office in half and putting the Prison Service and the probation service under the remit of the Ministry of Justice&#151;a move that I support&#151;we will be dealing with two Departments instead of one. The flow of information might therefore not be as seamless as one would have liked; it certainly was not seamless before. However,if we adopted new clause 1, which has the supportof other Members, such information would be forthcoming. As a result, victims would be informed and people would not be left in the situation faced by my constituents, to whom information was given only when they happened to ask. If the new clause were accepted, such information would be given to victims not by the Crown Prosecution Service or the police, or by the opposing side&#146;s solicitors to their solicitors, but by the appropriate authority&#151;in this case, the Home Office.</p>

We have no indication of whether a cross was put on his passport or of whether the Home Office told the Foreign Office about this case, which would mean that when he applied for entry clearance, the officer concerned would be aware that he had committed a crime for which he had not been charged. That is why this information is vital and why new clause 1 is so important. For those who will suffer in  <br>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) on making the case for new clause 1 so well. When I first read it I did not realiseits significance, or that such a problem existed in obtaining information. If it is accepted, it would help the victims of offences and it would help Members of Parliament to help those whom we feel have a genuine case for staying here. We cannot always get the information that we require about foreign nationals in this country.</p>

There is a wider malaise in the Home Office; not at the top, for once&#151;I am not going to blamethe Government for this&#151;but among its middle-management, who seem to feel that victims do not have the right to information about offences, be they offences involving foreign or British nationals. I was involved in a case concerning a British national, andit was impossible to get information for the victimsof that crime on when that person was going to be released from custody, or even on what his sentence was. Such information should be freely available, but the reality is that it is not. I therefore hope that my colleagues will consider supporting new clause 1.</p>

 Of course, but the hon.

countries&#151;some inside the EU and others outside it&#151;and from one African country are operating in this country, and that they have committed numerous offences and are arrested regularly. I can see their names and addresses on the computer and the long list of offences for which they have been convicted, and I know from statistics that they have been convicted of only a fraction of the offences that they have actually committed. However, they are not deported. Even when these provisions come into force, it is unlikely that many of them will be deported, because they are committing crimes that often carry a sentence of less than 12 months imprisonment.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. Although his amendment would make deportation possible, it would be unlikely to happen in practice. Low though my opinion is ofthe Home Office, the Home Secretary is at least accountable in some way to public opinion. That is one of the reasons we have had a few Home Secretaries recently. The public have lost confidence in them. Ultimately, I would prefer to put my faith, little though it is, in the Home Office rather than in the judiciary, because the judiciary is completely unaccountable and, in far too many instances, passes sentences that defy rationality and common sense.</p>

If we wanted to deport someone to Somalia, we would not need to go to the expense of chartering private jets. We could simply take them to the Kenyan border and pay someone a few dollars to take them over in a minibus. It would be easy to deport people to Somalia. Put me into the Home Office and I will deport people who do not belong in this country left, right and centre.

In the short time that I have been a Member of Parliament, I have dealt with several cases of women subject to domestic violence in forced marriages. I have written to the Minister about some of those cases and the most frustrating aspect for the women is that their husbands are still around, having served their sentences. Data protection legislation prevents the Minister from giving the women any indication of when their husbands are to be removed. In the past 12 months, I have dealt with four such cases. It is deplorable that women who have been subject to domestic violence should not know how long their husbands will be roaming around or when they will be deported.</p>

 I agree. If new clause 1 and the amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats were accepted, the victims would know at the time of sentence whether the offender would be deported. The Minister can dress up the issue any way he wants&#151;it might make good headlines to claim automatic deportation for a sentence of more than 12 months&#151;but the clause is riddled with so many exceptions and ifs and buts that it will not happen. If our amendment is accepted, a decision will have to be made. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) gave the example of a pickpocket who commits a series of offences that do not qualify foran automatic 12-month sentence. Under the presentrules, that person will not be subject to automatic deportation.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for that information. But let us take the example of a child asylum seeker&#151;I have dealt with one such case in the past 12 months&#151;who comes to this country with a false passport or no passport. At present, that offence attracts a 12-month sentence. The amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Leicester, East, which applies the age limit of 18 to the date the offence was committed, rather than the date of conviction, would at least ensure some sort of parity when people are sentenced. The 12-month sentence limit is very arbitrary. Someone can be sent to jail for 12 months for not paying their council tax, for fly-tipping or for possession of cannabis.</p>

Under that provision, victim liaison officers are allowed to provide information about when a decision is made, when a deportation has been effected, and what conditions are attached to a person who has been released on bail. The victim has to opt in, and that happens in about 15,000 cases each year, so some of the arrangements are working in practice. I would be grateful if my hon.

 The answer must be yes, because under the Criminal Justice Act there is provision to disclose information about 65 different offences, but under the automatic deportation provisions in the Bill there are 324 offences listed in relation to section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 that would result in automatic deportation if a sentence were handed out.

In sexual abuse cases, the victim is often unable to pin down the precise date of the offence,and the offence might have been perpetrated over a substantial period of time. If the relevant date was that of the offence, there would be a risk that the provisions would not be triggered for such an individual, although, as the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C.

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70509-0011.htm_para11"><a name="070509103000137">We have heard arguments at different extremes. The hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) and my neighbour, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming), argued that we should start withthe judicial process. However, we already start witha judicial process because there will be criminal proceedings and a judge will hand down a sentence. I am troubled that their proposal would remove the strong relationship between committing an offence and being deported. It would put a great deal into the hands of judges and leave too much to judicial discretion. That would create the risk of different decisions being made in different parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70509-0011.htm_para12"><a name="070509103000138">I suppose that my objections to the hon. Gentlemen&#146;s proposal are threefold. First, we would lose all clarity about whether a breach of Britain&#146;s hospitality leads to deportation. Such clarity about consequences serves as an important deterrent that we should retain. Secondly, we would lose the British public&#146;s wider reassurance that serious criminality is not to be tolerated and that people who commit a serious offence will be removed. The combination of those factors would create the strong risk that criminally minded foreign nationals would be given the green light to try their luck because they could treat the discretion of the courts as a roll of the dice. Thirdly, I do not think that the proposal would get away from the problem of judicial reviews, given that amendment No. 35 would leave open the possibility of judicial review at the end of the process. It is important to remember that the non-suspensive appeal procedures for asylum claims that we have tried have been tremendously successful. There have been very few judicial reviews and even fewer have been lost.</p>

review. The problem is that while it says that it is automatic deportation, it is in fact a mechanism whereby a button is pressed at the start, yet the process can later be reversed by judicial review. Judicial considerations should happen at the start of the process. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The Government have messed it up before and they will mess it up again.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his good wishes, but under the arrangements in the Bill, the principal scope of judicial review is to determine whether the Home Secretary has properly considered an individual&#146;s claim for humanitarian protection or asylum. Under the provisions, it is possible for the Home Secretary to designate such a claim as being clearly unfounded. As I say, we have used such provisions before; they are not a great legal innovation and I am not claiming anything original for the Bill. We have tried and tested the mechanisms under the non-suspensive appeal procedure for asylum claims and they have been found to be very successful.</p>

Given that no one ever goes to prison the first time that they commit a crime, and given that it is rare for people to go to prison these days, surely the fact that someone has gone to prison at all, whatever the length of their sentence, means that they are not suitable to stay in this country.</p>

application of the provisions is very wide. They apply to all foreign nationals who live in this country, and there may be some 3.4 million of them living here at any one time. That includes everybody who is granted indefinite leave to remain. The provisions could also apply to people born in this country to non-British parents after 1981, because they may not qualify automatically for British citizenship and may not have secured that privilege. It is quite possible for someone to have grown up in this country&#151;to have come to this country for two or three weeks, but to have spent all their childhood and adult life here&#151;and to be still subject to the automatic deportation provisions in the Bill. I want to avoid a situation in which someone who has spent all their life here and who is convicted and sentenced for something quite minor&#151;such as the proverbial charge of council tax non-payment&#151;is deported to a country that they have not been to in their living memory.</p>

 I will come to the arrangements that we will need to make under section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 in a moment, but the point on which I want to finish is that there has to be a degree of balance. That is why we propose automatic deportation for those offences that attract a 12-month sentence or are referred to in section 72 of the 2002 Act. That is a very long list of offences&#151;it is 40 pages long and includes 324 different offences. They are offences that the House has deemed serious, and I therefore believe that they should attract the automatic deportation provision.</p>

 May I make a helpful suggestion? The Liberal Democrat Members sitting near to me seem to have a fixation about the theft of electricity. If the Minister could find a way to exempt people who steal electricity, and so not be deported, will the Liberal Democrat Members sitting on my left&#151;they are very much to the left of me, in fact&#151;offer to support the part of the Bill that we are discussing?</p>

I confess to having a great deal of sympathy with amendments Nos. 14 and 8, and there are only two insurmountable problems. First, there are offences for which the sanction is automatic deportation, but which attract, too, a sentence of less than a month. Becauseit is quite possible for someone to commit one of the 324 offences under section 72 of the 2002 Act, it is possible for them to be handed down a sentence of less than a month for an offence listed in that section. In that case, the provisions could not apply. Secondly, I am sympathetic to the notion that someone needs to be deported within six months of a deportation order being served. Again, the only obstacle&#151;I am afraid that it is insurmountable&#151;is that occasionally it may be impossible at the end of the six months, or within that period, to return the individual to a particular country.</p>

 The offer has become better still.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70509-0012.htm_para2"><a name="070509103000156">Sometimes, legal barriers prevent us from deporting people. The individual may be unfit for travel, there may be an outstanding judicial review, or travel documentation may be unavailable, which would make it difficult in practice to enforce the provisions proposed by the hon. Member for Ashford, however sympathetic I am to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70509-0012.htm_para3"><a name="070509103000157">Amendment No. 8 would provide automatic deportation for all immigration offences. I wouldmake two points. First, when it comes to assault ofan immigration officer, common assault is listed in section 72, so it would attract automatic deportation. Secondly, we must remember that immigration offences are a broad class of offence and I do not necessarily think that we would want automatically to deport someone who, for example, had overstayed their visa for a couple of days to attend a graduation. I have received representations from Members on both sides of the House on such cases, particularly if someone cannot come back in after they are deported, so I would find it difficult to accept the amendment. It is important, however, to look again at the measures that we have proposed for consecutive and suspended sentences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70509-0012.htm_para4"><a name="070509103000158">The hon. Member for Ashford tabled amendments Nos. 9 and 10, which are slightly unclear at the edges. I was not certain whether he was seeking to exempt people given sentences in institutions or hospitals orto exclude indeterminate sentences&#151;that may, on one reading, be the outcome of the amendments. We believe that indeterminate sentences should be included in the remit of the provisions and time served in institutions, such as young offenders institutions, should be included. We think that time served in hospitals should be included, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70509-0012.htm_para5"><a name="070509103000159">We differ on the question that was posed in Committee by the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) about whether we should include in the automatic deportation provisions consecutive and aggregated sentences. I find it very difficult to construct a solution that would solve the problem of offences and sentences that are handed down at different points in time. It is possible, for example, for an individual to be convicted of two different offences 30 years apart and for the cumulative sentences to add up to more than12 months. In some cases, it is difficult to see how automatic deportation should apply, so it is important to preserve the right of in-country appeal. The individual should still face deportation, but there may be appeal rights that it is important to retain.</p>

The key issueto which Committee members sought to draw our attention was what we should do about recidivists.

cent. to 80 per cent. The assurance that I can give the House is that 13 of the 19 categories of offence are section 72 offences, so they would attract automatic deportation. There are a couple of offences not in section 72 that we should consider, in particular drink driving offences and soliciting and prostitution. We will give the matter further consideration before we lay a new section 72 order later this year. That would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in the House, so hon. Members would be able to comment.</p>

I am not sure, from memory, whether theft of electricity is included, but burning down houses, another case that we discussed at length in Committee, is covered. The important thing is that there should be an opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny of the order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70509-0012.htm_para8"><a name="070509103000162">The Government amendments provide that if somebody is given a suspended 12-month sentence or a suspended sentence for a section 72 offence, and any part of that sentence is subsequently activated, the automatic deportation provisions will apply. We think that if somebody is given a suspended sentence, in effect the court is saying, &#147;The sentence that we are giving you is an indication that you haven&#146;t committed an offence so serious that you should automatically be deported.&#148; The individual therefore has a chance to play their cards right and stay in the country. If, however, they commit an offence and the suspended sentence is activated for whatever period, they have had their chance and blown it and the automatic deportation provisions should take effect.</p>

We think that the provisions will apply to about 4,500&#151;a substantial number&#151;which sends out a clear signal not only to the British public, but to the foreign nationals who are here to enjoy our hospitality, that criminality cannot and will not be tolerated.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="070509103001543"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Young asylum seekers, whether children in need or looked after children, matter every bit as much as other young people in the context of meeting each and all of the five outcomes of the Every Child Matters framework.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70509-0012.htm_para19"><a name="070509103000177">That is not a great piece of prose, but the thinking behind it is extremely good. In this context it is noteworthy, and perhaps alarming, that the Government do not seek to offer refugee children the protection afforded by section 11. Ministers will be aware that the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium campaigned to ensure that refugee children would have the same protection as other children under the section 11 duty. The Joint Committee on Human Rights, whose Chairman I see in his place, has criticised the Government&#146;s position, stating:</p>
<a name="70509-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="070509103001544"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the omission of this particular group of children from the institutional arrangements designed to fulfil the State&#146;s positive obligations to children under articles 2, 3 and 8 raises the question of whether this gives rise to unjustifiable discrimination in the enjoyment of Convention rights.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="70509-0012.htm_para20"><a name="070509103000178">In the other place, Ministers argued that the inclusion of the refugee agencies would be overly restrictive. They also argued that in undertaking its primary function, the IND, as it then was, would do thingsthat would be judged as inconsistent with a duty to safeguard and promote welfare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70509-0012.htm_para21"><a name="070509103000179">That is the nub of a debate that has been running for a long time. It is worth going back to first principles. Section 11 of the 2004 Act is not an absolute duty&#151;it simply requires agencies to make arrangements to have regard to the need to safeguard children and promote their welfare when they discharge their functions. As Ministers said in another place:</p>
<a name="70509-0012.htm_brev2"><a name="070509103001545"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have been very careful in the way in which we have worded this clause: we do not put a duty on agencies that would make them unable to fulfil their primary functions.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 17 June 2004; Vol. 662, c. 995.]</p>

The explanatory notes to the 2004 Act state:</p>
<a name="70509-0012.htm_brev3"><a name="070509103001546"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This duty is intended to ensure that agencies are conscious of the need to safeguard children and promote their welfare in the course of exercising their normal functions.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70509-0012.htm_para23"><a name="070509103000181">The analogy is a good one. If the police can be regarded as exercising their proper central functions while having regard to the constraint, it is hard to understand from first principles why immigration bodies should not be able to fulfil their functions while operating under it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70509-0012.htm_para24"><a name="070509103000182">The Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium has taken legal advice, which states that section 11 would not prevent the Home Secretary from implementing removal directions for a child or his or her family and would, at most, affect the manner in which the removal occurred. Decent legal advice therefore shows that the exercise of the duty would not damage the proper functions of not only the front-line agencies but Ministers and officials when making the most difficult decisions about removal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="70509-0012.htm_para25"><a name="070509103000183">I am sure that the Minister knows that the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England has described the refugee services&#146; omission from section 11 as &#147;a great disappointment.&#148; He also said that he believes that the exclusions are already having an impact on relations between those who are subject to the duty and those who are not. The Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium argues that the standards of safeguarding for that group of children are inadequate. The Minister is a decent and humane man and will not wish children to be made more vulnerable through the lack of the duty, which would not impede the proper function of the immigration service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70509-0012.htm_para26"><a name="070509103000184">In Committee, the Minister tried to assure us.

He said that he did not want to pre-empt the outcome of those discussions, but he would explore what information he could provide at the earliest opportunity. Now is his chance not onlyto provide the information but to change the Government&#146;s stance on the issue. I am clearly not alone in my view. A wide coalition of interests argues that the Government are simply wrong about the matter.</p>

 The House is most grateful to my hon. Friend for his interest in the Bill and the amendments that he has tabled. What does he believe to be the purpose of the consultation paper? Does he agree that it should not be implemented until the consultation period has expired, all parties have given their views and the Government have had time to consider them?</p>

<p><a name="st_o212"><a name="070509103000188"><a name="70509-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="070509103001651"><b>Damian Green:</b>
 It is up to the Minister to explainthe purpose of the consultation. However, my hon. Friend&#146;s underlying point is correct. A consultation that takes place during&#151;in some cases, after&#151;the passage of a relevant measure, so that we cannot possibly have responded to it, suggests bad process. Indeed, Ministers cannot properly respond because it is not yet finished. The only consolation that I can give my hon. Friend is that all experience tells us that, just as one immigration Bill passes to the other place and on to the statute book eventually, so another one will come along soon. We have had five such Bills in the past 10 years and we have already been half promised a consolidation Bill next year. One point made in Committee that cannot be made often enough is that quite a lot of the serious parts of previous immigration legislation have not yet been implemented&#151;even while we debate and pass the current Bill. I can well imagine that large parts of this Bill will not have been implemented by the time the next immigration Bill comes along. That is not in any way to defend the way in which the Government do these things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70509-0013.htm_para2"><a name="070509103000189">To provide a more detailed answer, my understanding is that, in future, children and young people will receive only limited leave until they are17 and a half in order that any further applications that they wish to make can be concluded before they become 18. The Government&#146;s hope is that that will have the effect of making many more young people liable to enforced return immediately on turning 18. The reporting and residence requirements in the new clause are intended to support that approach by providing additional mechanisms to monitor those young people in the period running up to their 18th birthday, when they can expect to be removed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70509-0013.htm_para3"><a name="070509103000190">The contention made by the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium&#151;and the question that the Minister has to address&#151;is that that approach will not achieve its intended aims. Children who seek asylum alone in this country are often very vulnerable and, whether or not they meet the 1951 convention criteria, many will have a real fear of returning and do not consider it a realistic option. We can debate what should happen in principle  <br>

to such children, but the practical point that I hopethe Minister will address is that, faced with these additional residence and reporting requirements, large numbers of children will simply disappear from care and go on to the streets. We all know that if that happens, they are more likely to face danger and possible sexual or economic exploitation. In that case, the Government would not only fail to achieve their aim of removing more young people when they reach 18, but place more children in the way of moral or physical harm. I cannot believe that the Minister wants to achieve that.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that very comprehensive and informative reply, which I am sure the whole House will have enjoyed listening to as much as I did, but can he help me a little more on the question of being 17 and a half? It seems to have sinister overtones, which I do not fully understand. I wonder whether my hon. Friend fully understands the significance of being 18. Once young people are 18, for example, do they have more rights than they did at17 and a half? On the question of disappearance, is my hon. Friend aware of the ECPAT report&#151;End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes&#151;which showed that48 children in the care of three local authorities disappeared last year? Will the Bill help?</p>

 I am indeed aware of that report and my contention is that the Bill may actually make things worse. To answer the first part of my hon. Friend&#146;s question, no, these young people do not get more rights at 18. At 18 they can be deported and the Government are trying to ensure that they know where they are for the six months leading up to their 18th birthdays so that they are easier to deport. My problem with that is that I do not believe that the Government&#146;s actions will make it any more likely that any individual will be there to be deported. Indeed, it is more likely that they will disappear earlier, putting themselves into danger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70509-0013.htm_para4"><a name="070509103000193">Therefore, my objection to the provision is not a principled one but a practical one. It will achieve exactly the reverse of what the Government are seeking to do. To that extent, I agree with the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium that such an attempt to legislate for open-ended reporting and residence requirements for these children will not work, and that the Government&#146;s rationale is inadequate. The Children Act duties on social services are sufficient to ensure that the children are cared for and protected and that their whereabouts are known. The additional reporting and residence requirements will be counter-productive for the Government and, perhaps even more importantly, for the children themselves.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman cited the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the treatment of asylum seekers.

We took evidence from a head teacher, whose view was that there should not be two children in the same class with different rights. One of the issues that we identified was the difficulty of establishing the age of asylum seekers&#146; children. We were particularly concerned about the use of dental X-rays, and suggested that a more holistic approach should be adopted in that regard. Would the hon.

The borough of Hillingdon, with Heathrow airport in its area, has huge problems in that regard, and I have great sympathy with it and its council tax payers, who must ultimately pick up a large share of the bill for what we all recognise is essentially a national rather than a local issue.</p>

I do not think it will facilitate the speedy removal of asylum-seeking children. I believe that that can be done through local authorities and National Asylum Support Service officers who, in Rochdale at any rate, are employed by the local authority and have a day-to-day relationship with families seeking asylum. That, I believe, is the best way in which to ensure that any provisions relating to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are implemented. I fear that if the residence and reporting arrangements are enforced, perhaps clumsily, many children will disappear&#151;which is not the object of the exercise&#151;or put themselves in a position in which they are in someone else&#146;s control, without particularly wanting that to happen.

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70509-0013.htm_para22"><a name="070509103000215">My criticism of amendment No. 36 is that it does not go far enough. It seems to put in statutory form the requirements of the European convention against trafficking in human beings to which the Government have already agreed to sign up. I am pleased that they accepted the recommendation of my Committee to that effect when we produced our report in the autumn, but signing does not go far enough; the treaty must be properly ratified not just by the United Kingdombut by other countries to make sure that it comesinto effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70509-0013.htm_para23"><a name="070509103000216">Amendment No. 36 would recognise and protect the victims of people trafficking, which is reckoned the second most serious international crime after the drugs trade. It is organised crime, involving large numbers of people and huge amounts of money. Several years ago, the Government admitted that 4,000 women had been trafficked for sexual purposes, but that figure is now widely seen to be an underestimate. Having met victims of people trafficking through the Poppy project and heard evidence about that crime, I have no doubt that the provisions of the amendment are important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70509-0013.htm_para24"><a name="070509103000217">It is important that the victims of trafficking are recognised as such at a sufficiently early stage for them to be protected, and that they are not faced with arbitrary removal, as has been the case for some of them in the past. When a brothel is raided everybodyis rounded up&#151;victims of people trafficking and traffickers alike. That has to stop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70509-0013.htm_para25"><a name="070509103000218">The convention makes specific provision for unaccompanied children who are trafficked, as set out in subsection (5) of the amendment. Their interests must be represented in the legal process through a guardian; the children must be properly identified and efforts made to locate their family back home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70509-0013.htm_para26"><a name="070509103000219">However, what is important is the question of recovery and reflection, which the amendment, unfortunately, does not define. Recovery and reflection are about putting the interests of the victims of trafficking first&#151;making them paramount in the process. For example, a woman may have been the victim of multiple rape over a prolonged period. Recovery and reflection would give such victims the time to come to terms with what happened to them and the support and counselling they needed to address those appalling experiences, and then to decide the extent to which they could co-operate with the authorities in bringing the perpetrators of their trafficking to justice. On the evidence we heard in the Select Committee, the period of 30 days specified in the amendment, which is the period in the convention, is far too short. It is important that victims are given the chance to have a period of reflection before action is taken on their removal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70509-0013.htm_para27"><a name="070509103000220">As I said, my main concern is that the amendment does not go far enough in protecting victims, to make sure that there is support for them not only through organisations such as the Poppy project but also in the criminal justice process so that their immigration status is dealt with properly. When I met a woman from eastern Europe, through the Poppy project, I was appalled to hear that her trafficker had been convicted and served a lengthy prison sentence, yet her immigration status had still not been favourably determined. That cannot be right and it is an example of what needs to be done.</p>

If they are returned, they should be rehabilitated effectively and properly. At the Poppy project, we heard of one poor woman who had been returned to her country without proper support and retrafficked within 48 hours by her family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para1"><a name="070509103000222">The amendment is important. It adds tothe legislation on immigration and asylum some of the protections provided in the convention, which the Government have now agreed to sign up to. However, it does not go far enough. I hope that in responding to this brief debate the Minister will give a commitment that the Government will seriously tackle this matter, not necessarily with legislation but on the back of the convention which they have so properly at long last agreed to accept.</p>

 I did not intend to speak in this debate, but I feel prompted to do so by the contributions made so far. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Damian Green) for not being present in the Chamber when he moved the new clause; I was attending a Select Committee sitting. However, I know from experience that my hon. Friend has great concern for the welfare of children in the circumstances under discussion, and it is properto have such concern. I seek an assurance from the Minister that the Government are dealing with children in as humane a fashion as possible and taking their interests into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para2"><a name="070509103000224">I make no secret of the fact that I have many wide-ranging criticisms of the asylum system. I recognise that many people try to use the system as a means of facilitating their migration to this country when they do not have a proper asylum claim. However, I also recognise that a substantial number of people do have genuine claims for asylum, and we must bear in mind their interests as well. Looking at the system in the world as a whole, I find it hard to seea thread of consistent logic in how it operates, particularly in conjunction with the carriers&#146; liability provisions that this country has adopted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para3"><a name="070509103000225">However, almost all decisions to come to this country&#151;whether for reasons of economic migration or because somebody is genuinely fleeing persecution&#151;are taken by adults. They are not taken by children. When children arrive here and are unaccompanied, we owe them a special duty of consideration&#151;seeing things from their point of view and recognising some of the experiences that they might have been through. Whenever a child is unaccompanied by an adult, we must do as much as we properly can to ensure their welfare. My hon. Friend made his points on thatvery well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para4"><a name="070509103000226">I do not intend to discuss some of the legal arguments to do with the various obligations that countries have or those that we seek to place on local authorities and others. However, I know that the Minister is genuinely engaged with this subject, and I seek an assurance from him that the Government are conforming to the highest humanitarian standards in dealing with such children. The public would expect that of us, irrespective of how we might feel about other parts of the asylum system.</p>

 I am grateful to Members for having tabled the new clauses and amendments in this group, so that we have had the opportunity to debateon Report another subject on which we spent a considerable amount of time in Committee. Members of all parties have made representations to me during my happy months as immigration Minister&#151;and I have spent nearly a year in this post now. The fact that they have done so underlines the point that the House takes this issue very seriously, and it is proper that on Report we should have a debate such as this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para5"><a name="070509103000228">We must strike a balance. On the one hand we must ensure that, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) said, unaccompanied children are given the right level of protection when they come into contact with us in this country and come under our care. On the other hand, we also have a duty to ensure that the deportation of children who have no right to be here and whom it is perfectly safe to remove does not become so difficult that in effect a green light is switched on for every child trafficker around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para6"><a name="070509103000229">The Government and the Public Bill Committee have put considerable effort into ensuring that the Bill contains a number of new measures that make it easier to track down people smugglers and human traffickers, wherever on earth they perpetrate their crimes. It would be unfortunate if we ended up with a Bill that in any way encouraged that barbaric trade by making it so difficult to remove people who have no right to be here that Britain became a target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para7"><a name="070509103000230">Our starting point is a protocol that it is perfectly right that our Government should carry on implementing. We did not invent it; it was devised and stated to this House by a Conservative immigration Minister back in the early 1990s. The point is that when such children become adults, it is important for us to ensure that they go back home when a court has said that it is safe for them to do so. Otherwise, it is impossible to maintain the integrity of the immigration system&#151;a sentiment that was well reflected by the hon. Member for Hertsmere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para8"><a name="070509103000231">I am proud to say that this Government have helped to lead the way in Europe on this subject. During our EU presidency we pushed through the EU action plan on human trafficking. When we established the Serious Organised Crime Agency, we made sure that four of the 20 work programmes pursued by it related to tackling trafficking. After considerable debate, we published in March the UK trafficking action plan, which provides an holistic approach to prevention, prosecution and support. Last year we established the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre&#151;a facility that a number of Members have visited. Of course, this year we signed the Council of Europe convention on human trafficking&#151;a subject about which I feel very strongly, not least because my predecessor as MP for Birmingham, Hodge Hill is now the secretary-general of the Council of Europe.</p>

I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) for ensuring that we would debate it, and I agree with him that it does not go far enough. In effect, it picks out parts of the convention and seeks to put them into effect through the Bill. Of course, the problem is that  <br>

incomplete implementation would create risks in different parts of the system. For example, the amendment does not deal with how people get support, or how victims of human trafficking under forced labour provisions might be protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para10"><a name="070509103000233">We want to ensure that the convention is not implemented in an incomplete fashion; we do not want to drop defences, thereby creating a pull factor. Crucially, we want to ensure protections for all victims of trafficking. I want to give my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon the commitment that we will implement the convention, but not in a half-and-half way. That is why we have said that we will ratify it only when we are absolutely confident that we can implement it in full. A project team has been established at the Home Office that is reviewing what training and legislation is required, what legislation is required of other Government Departments, and what support arrangements need to be put in place not just by the Government but by local authorities.</p>

Once 10 countries have ratified it, it will effectively be in force. However, it is important for this Government to ensure that when we choose to ratify it, we can implement it in full. Otherwise, I fear that signature and ratification will be dismissed&#151;rightly&#151;as a token gesture.</p>

late. I wanted to ensure that it had proper consideration at the right levels of seniority within the Home Office. The consultation document tries to flush out a couple of ideas, but none is more important than new measures to ensure that we do not have children in the adult care system or&#151;even more importantly&#151;that we do not have adults in the children&#146;s system. That is why age testing is so important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para13"><a name="070509103000240">There are measures in place that may provide certainty to plus or minus five years, but if we were to rely on them we would open ourselves to the risk of having adults in the children&#146;s system, and that is not something that I would be prepared to countenance knowingly. Therefore it is incumbent on us to explore any opportunity to improve the accuracy of age testing. I know that there is controversy over the use of dental X-rays and other methods, and I am grateful for the tone that the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green) struck. It is incumbent on us to try to make an imprecise science as precise as we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para14"><a name="070509103000241">The second group of measures on which we are trying to solicit views through the consultation document concerns the care arrangements available for children. As the hon. Gentleman said, those are concentrated in London at present. That means that boroughs such as Hillingdon, where I have met the directors, shoulder an unfair burden. If we encouraged different local authorities in various parts of the country to become specialists in the provision of such care, we could manage some of the pressures in London better and improve the overall care that we can offer unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. That is why I stress that the document is a consultation document. It has been put together with good intentions, and it contains open questions. I encourage hon. Members to respond to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para15"><a name="070509103000242">The consultation document does not contain any particular question, policy or direction of travel that requires legislation to underpin or implement it. Efforts to strengthen the support that we provide for children will undergo incremental improvement over the next few years. The reform plan for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children is one part of that, and the Council of Europe convention is another. There will be others, and we must keep the spotlight constantly on the issue, so that any opportunity to improve care is taken up.</p>

 I was concerned about articles 10 and13 of the convention, which provide the victim with assistance and protection. The Minister is clearly satisfied that the consultation paper will not conflict with those objectives, but why have the Government refused to lift the reservation on the UN convention on the rights of the child? That is about giving children protection. The Government keep saying that the convention might conflict with domestic legislation, but what domestic legislation? It would be marvellous if the Government took the lead on that convention.</p>

stands in the debates about Europe that often surface in his party, and I cannot remember whether he would be influenced by the fact that the European Commission is about to introduce requirements for biometric residence permits. I understand that from this week that requirement will apply to third-country national children aged six and over&#151;something that may appeal to some in the Conservative party, although it may not cut much ice with others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para16"><a name="070509103000245">Two important arguments support the issuing of biometric immigration documents to children. The first is that that will help us tackle trafficking. I shall pray in aid a contribution that I solicited from the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre, which</p>
<a name="70509-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="070509103001550"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;views biometrics as having great potential as a tool for law enforcement to effect identity, recovery and rescue of child victims of trafficking. Having biometric details of children means that when you encounter a victim you can identify and rescue them from whatever form of exploitation they are suffering.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para17"><a name="070509103000246">We have sought to introduce biometrics in two ways. First, we have issued biometric visas abroad, a process that allows us to pin down the relationship between the child and a particular adult, and to capture the child&#146;s biometrics at that time. We have successfully issued 5,500 biometric visas to children, and by the end of the year they will be issued at all our visa posts abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para18"><a name="070509103000247">When a child applies for further leave in-country, we can check the child&#146;s biometrics again, and determine that the family coming along with the child is the same as the one that was with the child when the application for the biometric visa was made. An alarm is triggered if there are discrepancies. I do not understand why we would want to turn that alarm system off, as I consider it an important step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para19"><a name="070509103000248">The second argument for biometric checks is that in the long term, they will help us to tackle fraud. Their introduction will help us to govern and police accessby third-country nationals to the benefits system. Capturing the biometrics of children allows us to stop the deplorable crime of child swapping, whereby a child is placed with a family to try to improve that family&#146;s eligibility for benefits. The ability to pin down a child&#146;s biometrics on our systems and place that child with a family will give us a way to tackle problems of that sort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para20"><a name="070509103000249">I know that questions have been asked about unstable biometrics. The problems that arise have less to do with capturing the biometrics than with the matching software. The report about the costs of biometrics will be laid before the House shortly, as I am sure that the hon. Member for Ashford will be delighted to hear. In answer to his specific question about frequency of registration, I can tell him that it is currently envisaged that people will be asked to come back after about five years.</p>

 The Minister will be aware that there is growing concern about the very little children, particularly from Asia and Africa, who are being brought in for the purposes of slavery and paedophile activity.

that regard, so what approach has he taken to obtaining the relevant statistics? When he has got them, will he be able to follow up and do whatever is required, including introducing primary legislation? Finally, what does he have in mind to tackle the problem that I have described? The answer that he has just given does not touch it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o228"><a name="070509103000251"><a name="70509-0014.htm_spnew9"><a name="070509103001667"><b>Mr. Byrne:</b>
 I know that the hon. Gentleman has long taken an interest in these matters. We have to try to stop the trade in the first place, so the Bill, which introduces new offences to tackle people trafficking, is an important step forward. Issuing biometric visas helps us to lock down an identity to an individual. All that we are doing in the Bill, through our provisions for biometric immigration documents, is making sure that when a child applies for further leave to remain, or if a child is going to be here for some time, there is a cross-check against the original biometric information. That provides us not with a complete answer, but with another tool to help us discover where things are going wrong. The argument against the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ashford is: why would we throw that alarm system away? Surely it is better to build tools up over time, rather than to lose them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para21"><a name="070509103000252">Before I come on to the debate about section 11 of the Children Act 2004 and contact management, I should say that I understand the argument that the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium has put forward, but it sounds a little strange for people to say that an insistence on contact may drive people underground, when at the moment we have no legal means of establishing contact at all. It is important to be able to contact children at regular intervals in order to know whether they are still in the country, where they are, whether they are being looked after properly, and, often, to acquaint them with the prospect that they will be going home again soon. I do not pretend that this is a complete answer, but it is another important tool that the immigration service would find useful.</p>

<p><a name="st_o229"><a name="070509103000253"><a name="70509-0014.htm_spnew10"><a name="070509103001668"><b>Mr. Steen:</b>
 I might be able to be helpful to the Minister, but I need an explanation. The Minister is familiar with the unaccompanied and separated children and refugee projection in the UK report &#147;Seeking Asylum Alone&#148; by Jacqueline Bhabha and Nadine Finch. The report shows that there is a difference between the Home Office figures for applications from unaccompanied and separated children and the statistics provided by the Refugee Council&#146;s children&#146;s panel. There are big discrepancies. In 2003 the Home Office figure was 2,800 and the Refugee Council&#146;s children&#146;s panel figure was 4,658. I wonder whether the Minister could indicate, bearing in mind that the Government grant only 6 per cent. of asylum applications from unaccompanied children a year&#151;94 per cent. get sent back&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para22"><a name="070509103000256">I was talking about the need to maintain contact arrangements with children, particularly when they do not have the right to be here. While honouring our commitment not to send children home when, in our view, the reception arrangements are not appropriate, it is important that we make arrangements to send them home as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para23"><a name="070509103000257">I now come to the debate about section 11 of the Children Act 2004, which was where the hon. Member for Ashford started. This is an important area and we have spent some time reviewing it over the last 12 months. The nub of the problem is that the section 11 duty is not a simple duty. There are two parts to it. On the one hand there is a duty to safeguard the child, but on the other there is a duty to promote the child&#146;s well-being. The Department for Education and Skills guidance that comes with the duty is clear. It says that the duty is to make arrangements to ensure that</p>
<a name="70509-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="070509103001551"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;children are growing up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para24"><a name="070509103000258">It also mentions:</p>
<a name="70509-0014.htm_brev2"><a name="070509103001552"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;undertaking that role so as to enable those children to have optimum life chances and to enter adulthood successfully&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70509-0014.htm_para25"><a name="070509103000259">The analogy with the police is helpful, becausethe police do not seek to deport people back to third world countries. Although our advice is that, legally, we would win the cases&#151;I am sure that the refugee children&#146;s organisations have gone to some good lawyers to solicit advice and ascertain that there are no barriers to the Home Secretary setting removal directions&#151;unfortunately, that is only part of the story. My great fear is that there would be a licence for judicial review to multiply. One can easily see that lawyers could file judicial reviews challenging decisions and arguing about a Home Office decision to deport somebody back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo or parts of south-east Asia. I think that lawyers would question how that would be consistent with the duty to enable those children to have optimum life chances and enter adulthood successfully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70509-0015.htm_para0"><a name="070509103000260">Judicial review presents a serious problem: between January and March this year we received an average of 79 judicial reviews a week challenging enforcement activity. Some 94 per cent. were refused permission at the paper stage; none the less, one ongoing case has been running for 12 months and is on its second judicial review. Another case has been running for14 months and is on its fourth judicial review, while a further case has been running for seven months and is on its third judicial review. People often try to exploit the judicial review process as a last-minute barrier to removal. I fear that the change to section 11 proposed by the hon. Member for Ashford would simply multiply those barriers.</p>

 While I understand what the Minister is telling us, he also says that it is not the intention to deport, or send home, children at least until they become adults. The provision would not apply after people reached the age of 18, so I do not understand  <br>

 Because we will often be making arrangements to send those people home. I simply do not understand how anyone cannot envisage that in judicial review proceedings, lawyers would make the argument that I cited. The proposal would lead to the multiplication of judicial review proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70509-0015.htm_para1"><a name="070509103000263">This is a serious matter. It is important to go further than we have to date on the Border and Immigration Agency&#146;s duty to safeguard the welfare and livelihood of children. I said in Committee that we were keeping the matter under review. This summer the agency will publish its safeguarding strategy, which has been drawn up in close consultation with children&#146;s organisations. If the Bill is enacted, we will commission advice from the new inspectorate about how it can examine specifically the way in which the safeguarding strategy is implemented, so that we can ensure two things. The first is that the strategy is actually working, with policy being translated into practice. The Joint Committeeon Human Rights, chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), has helpfully and successfully highlighted instance after instance when policy has not been translated into practice, which explains why the single inspectorate is important. The second is that hon. Members, and the wider public, have an assurance that the safeguarding duty is being implemented properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="70509-0015.htm_para2"><a name="070509103000264">We can make important changes. While the point about transparency is particularly important, weneed to continue to listen to the argument abouthow a specific and appropriate legal obligation could underpin the safeguarding responsibilities of the border and immigration authority in a way that would not multiply the grounds for judicial review, but would ensure that hon. Members&#146; ambitions were achieved.</p>

<p><a name="st_o234"><a name="070509103000265"><a name="70509-0015.htm_spnew2"><a name="070509103001673"><b>Paul Rowen:</b>
 I am listening carefully to the Minister&#146;s explanation. He cited an example involving the DRC. Given that that is an unsafe place, we would not deport anyone back to that country, whether they were under 18 or over 18. The section 11 safeguards would not be affected in such circumstances. As I understand the way in which the system operates at the moment,an asylum seeker will not be sent back to an unsafe country.</p>

<p><a name="st_o235"><a name="070509103000266"><a name="70509-0015.htm_spnew3"><a name="070509103001674"><b>Mr. Byrne:</b>
 That is absolutely right. I am trying to make the point that the section 11 duty is about not simply safeguarding, but enabling</p>

There are places in the DRC to which the asylum and immigration tribunal has consistently found it very safe to return people. However, one can easily envisage how a cunning and clever lawyer could look at the part of the obligation that I cited and question how deporting a child from the world&#146;s fourth largest economy would promote optimum life chances or help that child to enter adulthood successfully. That is my fear. I do not think that anyone in the House would want us to remove defences in a way that  <br>

prevents us from deporting people successfully. I genuinely think that hon. Members understand that if defences are weaker, Britain will become a target for child traffickers, and no one in the House wants that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="70509-0015.htm_para4"><a name="070509103000268">We need to go further in ensuring that the Border and Immigration Agency has a stronger safeguarding obligation. I have sketched out a couple of ways in which I think that that can be brought about, but I remain open to the argument that a legal requirement should be put on the BIA, and a specific safeguarding element should be written into the law. I have yet to be convinced of that, and I do not think that the answer is in section 11 of the Children Act 2004&#151;but when the Bill goes to another place there will still be a case to be listened to and answered.</p>

<p><a name="st_o236"><a name="070509103000269"><a name="70509-0015.htm_spnew4"><a name="070509103001675"><b>Damian Green:</b>
 I start my response to this extremely good debate by apologising to my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen). I knew that he was going to be unavoidably detained elsewhere, but I had not realised for how short a time. If I had, I would have explored the issue in even greater depth. I assure him that I have now had one unprecedented experience this afternoon: sitting down at the end of a speech and being criticised for having made it too short. I am grateful to him for that. I can reassure him that his case was made most eloquently by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="70509-0015.htm_para5"><a name="070509103000270">To pick up on some of the Minister&#146;s points, I thought that he was pushing the envelope a little in saying that the Government were leading in Europe on the fight against trafficking. As he will be aware, the Government made the good move of signing up to the Council of Europe convention rather later than many Governments did. He was right to say that the Government do not want to ratify the convention until they can actually implement it, because we have had enough of gesture politics from the Government, both in that field and in others. I find it refreshing that the Minister is seeking to avoid that, but I point out, as he did, that seven countries have already ratified the convention, and when 10 countries ratify it it willcome into force, so it is likely to come into force soon. At that point, the Government will presumably start implementing it. I thought it slightly ominous that he could not give the hon. Member for Hendon any reassurance about the timing, and could not say when the Government will be in a position to do something practical and useful in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="st_o237"><a name="070509103000271"><a name="70509-0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="070509103001676"><b>Mr. Byrne:</b>
 That is merely down to an ambition for accuracy, rather than anything ominous.</p>

 I am grateful for that. Ambition for accuracy is a good thing in Ministers. The Minister&#146;s central point was about striking a balance between the protection of children and the protection of the interests of the Executive, which should not be tied down with judicial reviews. I found his argument on that point beguiling, but it was not convincing, because the Government have had a long time to think about the subject. They have known what the refugee children&#146;s organisations and others think about the issue for a long time. It is not wholly convincing for the Government to come before the House on Report, after a long Committee stage, and say, &#147;We&#146;re looking  <br>

into the matter, and we may bring forward appropriate measures, but not those supported by both main Opposition parties and the organisations concerned. We&#146;ll come up with better measures during the later stages of the Bill.&#148; The Government have had a long time to consider the issue, and they have not yet found any other measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70509-0015.htm_para6"><a name="070509103000273">I would hate to miss this opportunity to register the point that underlies all our discussions, which is that the current arrangements are not satisfactory. Indeed, what the Minister said this afternoon made it clear that he does not think that they are satisfactory either, and is looking for better ways to protect the rights of refugee children. If he cannot come up with concrete proposals at our final opportunity to discuss the Bill before it proceeds to another place, it is for other parties to submit such proposals to protect those children. That is what we have done, and we commend our proposals to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o239"><a name="070509103000274"><a name="70509-0015.htm_spnew7"><a name="070509103001678"><b>Mr. Steen:</b>
 Is not my hon. Friend&#146;s concern&#151;indeed, the Opposition&#146;s concern&#151;about the fact that many thousands of unaccompanied minors arrive somehow or other in the country every year at airportsand ports? I do not know how they get here. The Government are then expected to finance their care in local authorities, provide legal aid, food and shelter&#151;but then what? Does my hon. Friend believe that something needs to be said about how we are going to manage better those thousands and thousands of children who are still pouring into Britain? Certainly we are not doing enough at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o240"><a name="070509103000275"><a name="70509-0015.htm_spnew8"><a name="070509103001679"><b>Damian Green:</b>
 My hon. Friend is exactly right. One of the things that the Government have failed to do is make our borders secure enough so that people traffickers and other evil criminals are not encouraged to try to smuggle children into this country. That brings us on to a debate about our proposals for a border police force, which is the most effective way of minimising the effects of that particularly repellent crime&#151;but I suspect that you would pull me up, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if I went too far down that road, because it is not strictly relevant to this group of amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70509-0015.htm_para7"><a name="070509103000276">Finally, the Minister talked about the European Commission and biometric documents for children. Whether the proposals are introduced by the Commission or by central Government, if biometrics for children do not work&#151;all the technical evidence suggests that they do not&#151;those documents will be ineffective in protecting them. I am relaxed about whether the proposals come from the Commission or from the Home Office; they will not work in either case. In summary, I have not found the Minister&#146;s arguments that we should wait for the Government to come up with a convincing way of protecting children at all persuasive, however well he put them, so I commend the new clause to the House.</p>

 New clause 5 would require an immigration officer to ensure that any clothing covering the face or part of it was removed to verify the identity of an individual on entering or leaving the United Kingdom. I am disappointed that I need to table the amendment, as most people would imagine that what I described would happen as a matter of course under existing legislation. However, there have been a couple of examples only recently where it appears that people suspected of crimes&#151;in one case, terrorist offences&#151;have actually fled the country disguised by a veil. Surely, if I were to present myselfto the immigration authorities wearing a motorcycle helmet, for example, I would be asked to remove it. Is it not staggering that one of the chief suspects forthe murder of PC Sharon Beshenivsky in Bradfordis reported to have fled the country wearing a veiland that one of the bombers&#151;fortunately, failed bombers&#151;of 21 July is also alleged to have fled the country wearing a veil?</p>

Surely someone cannot be checked for purposes of identification unless any clothing is removed from their face. As I said, it is very disappointing that I needed to table this amending provision, but it appears that immigration officers around the country have been tied up in some kind of political correctness, feeling that they cannot ask people to remove their veils lest they be accused of some sort of racism or of attacking certain ethnic minority groups. That is clearly unacceptable, so my new clause is designed to help those immigration officers by making it clear that nothing will be done to prevent them from doing their job.</p>

 Does my hon.

 As ever, my hon. Friend makes a valid point. My new clause does not specify&#151;nor would I want it to&#151;that people should not be allowed to wear a veil if they so wish. If they want to wear it, they should be allowed to do so, as we have enough of a nanny state as it is without telling people what they can and cannot wear. Surely, however, for purposes of identification at a point of entry, the power in my new clause should be taken as read.</p>

 In all the debates that I have heard on the Floor of the House and in Committee, I have yet to hear a more misguided mischaracterisation of poor practice than I have just heard. I am sad that the hon. Gentleman did not have the chance in Committee to listen to the praise that was lavished on the front-line immigration service and the work that it does. Willthe hon. Gentleman further consider the remarksthat he has just made&#151;and those that he is aboutto make&#151;and temper them, bearing in mind the extraordinary job that the immigration service does for this country?</p>

 I am afraid that the Minister&#146;s indignation is unjustified.

serious offences leaving the country wearing a veil. Whether the vast majority of immigration officers do or do not do a good job&#151;I am sure that the Minister is right and they do&#151;there should surely be something to prevent serious criminals from leaving the country in such ridiculous circumstances. If the new clause would prevent the chief suspect in a serious terrorist offence or in the murder of a police officer carrying out their duty from leaving the country, that must surely be a good thing.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is entirely right. My new clause aims to help immigration officers so that they do not feel that they are being put in a difficult position, and so that no one can accuse them of some kind of political correctness or misguided racism just because they are asking people to identify themselves. They are already doing an excellent job, and I hope that the new clause would help them to doit better.</p>

 I am slightly mystified by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech. I have found, through speaking to veil-wearing women in my constituency, that when they go through entrance and exit ports they go into a room, remove their veil and show their face to a female immigration officer. That is what happens at the moment, so I am a bit mystified as to the merit of reinforcing that by introducing a provision that simply does the same thing.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. In some respects, he makes my point for me. I am sure that on some occasions that does already happen. My new clause merely insists that immigration officers &#147;must ensure&#148; that any such clothing be removed. That is clearly not happening on every occasion because two people suspected of serious offences have left the country disguised by a veil. My new clause would not affect what should be standard practice; it would merely ensure that that practice became compulsory.</p>

 The Minister referred to the word &#147;may&#148;. My new clause uses the word &#147;must&#148;. There is a distinct difference between the two. Clearly, some problem arose that allowed those two people to leave the country without their identity being checked. My new clause requires that people&#146;s identity be checked whether they are entering or leaving the country. In the two cases to which I referred, the people happened to be leaving the country. If the Minister thinks that that should happen anyway, I take it that he will have no objection to supporting my new clause, which merely insists that it must happen.</p>

This proposal is being made against a backdrop of many people having completely lost faith in the immigration system. They feel that the whole system is getting out of hand. We are now at the stage at which one migrant a minute is coming into this country. That equates to the population of a city the size of Birmingham every two or three years. The vast majority of the public know that that is unsustainable, yet that fact appears to have escaped the notice of the Government, who have allowed such mass immigration to take place on an unprecedented scale. The purpose of my new clause is to impose an annual limit so that people can have confidence that there is some control over the number of people coming into the country.</p>

 I am grateful to my eagle-eyed hon. Friend for noticing that the new clause has a European dimension. He is absolutely right; the elephant in the room is the fact that it refers to &#147;non-European Union nationals&#148;. The fact of the matter is that our relationship with the European Union allows free movement of people, which means that we have no ability to deal with them. As my hon. Friend knows, I would wish us to be out of the European Union so that we could impose a limit. I think that he will agree that at least the proposal is a step in the right direction.</p>

 My hon.

That amendment would have enabled us to override the European Communities Act 1972 and require the judiciary to give effect to that override.

In the past few years, that has turned around&#151;the population of Dundee has risen over the past year, Glasgow&#146;s over the past two years and Scotland&#146;s over the past three years. That has been due mainly to inward migration, primarily, though not exclusively, from eastern Europe, and has been a generally successful, useful and beneficial experience for all concerned. In those circumstances, why would I want to support his amendment? As for his views on the European Union, the free movement of people is tied in with the free movement of capital and free trade within the European Union and the eurozone. Why on earth would he take such a hard-line position against free trade and something that benefits the economies and peoples of the whole Union?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70509-0016.htm_para8"><a name="070509103000847">The purpose of new clause 7 is to ensure that people wishing to claim asylum in this country are detained in secure accommodation for a maximum of 90 days while their application for asylum is processed. At the end of those 90 days, alternative accommodation would be found for them. The new clause exempts people under 18 and their guardians, because it would probably not be right for them to be detained. We have been very generous in this country. We have a tradition of allowing people who genuinely claim asylum to stay, and we are rightly proud of that tradition. However, over the past decade in particular, our kindness and hospitality have been abused on an unprecedented level, much to the disgust of many of our constituents who wish something to be done about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70509-0016.htm_para9"><a name="070509103000848">When I visited the immigration and nationality directorate in Leeds, it struck me as unbelievable that any failed asylum seeker ever left the country. The hoops that the authorities are expected to go through to track down failed asylum seekers are beyond belief, and it would undoubtedly help them if people claiming asylum were in secure accommodation. They wouldbe well treated and well fed&#151;no one would wantthe accommodation to be like a prison&#151;but the authorities would know where they were. Once their applications had been processed, those with valid reasons for claiming asylum would be welcomed into the local community and given the support that they deserved and needed, while the authorities could ensure that those who were here under false pretences left the country immediately, rather than having to chase around wondering where they were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="70509-0016.htm_para10"><a name="070509103000849">There is no reason why people who are genuinely fleeing persecution in their own countries would not accept decent secure accommodation in this country while their applications are processed. That is not inhumane; it is merely a common-sense way of keeping tabs on people so that those found not to have a valid claim can be sent out of the country, much to the satisfaction and relief of many of our constituents.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s proposals would require an extra 5,000 detention beds at a start-up cost of about &#163;750 million, with running costs of about &#163;158 million a year.

 As ever, my right hon. Friend is right. According to a survey conducted by the TaxPayers&#146; Alliance, the public believe that a quarter of all Government expenditure is wasted, although I suspect that that is a Conservative estimate. I am sure that there is plenty of money available&#151;and, in addition, alarge amount would be saved because it would be unnecessary to chase people around the country.</p>

 The interest shown in this debate may be a reflection of the seriousness of the subject that the hon. Gentleman has raised. May I return him to new clause 6 and ask him what figure he proposes for the maximum number of non-EU nationals to be granted indefinite leave to remain? Will he also answer the question asked so perceptively by the very talented right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) and tell us which country they would come from? If the hon. Gentleman came up with the figure of, say, half a million, would it matter if every one of those people came from Pakistan, for example? But perhaps he has other ways of responding to the question.</p>

 I am, as ever, grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his contribution to the debate. The new clause states that the number is to be decided annually by the Secretary of State. We would consider the situation at the time, but my guess is that we could sustain immigration to this country of about 50,000 a year&#151;certainly no more. That figure is much lower than it is at present. On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point, it would not matter to me which country the immigrants came from; the issue is how much immigration our country can sustain, both economically and culturally. Immigration puts pressure on housing&#151;about one in three new houses is built merely to deal with immigration. It puts pressure on our public services, schools and hospitals, as well as on the taxpayer, so we need a sustainable figure.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way to me again as I want to press an important point. From the figures published recently by the Office for National Statistics, he will know that 145,000 people came from the European Union in 2005, so if EU migrants were uncapped under his proposals there might be a bit of a problem. No cap for EU migrants is significant because 48 per cent. of net migration is from the EU.</p>

 The Minister is absolutely right, which is one of the reasons why I want Britain to regain control of its borders. To do so we need to leave the European Union, but that is a debate for another day. However, I agree with the Minister that the scale of immigration from Europe, especially eastern Europe, is colossal and I want us to regain control of our borders to deal with it.</p>

 Does not the Minister&#146;s pointcut both ways? Since 1997, there has in fact been a substantial increase in net migration from non-EU countries as a result of Government policy, in large measure, to extend work permits that were not granted before 1997.</p>

Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer), who is my constituency neighbour, has done muchhard work on that issue, especially forced marriage. Although increasing the age from 18 to 21 would not necessarily stop people being brought into the country for forced marriages, it could help to get rid of that scandalous practice, which is used to obtain entry to the UK. The new clause would help to reduce immigration, as well as helping to deal with the horrific practice of forced marriage, about which the Minister, like the hon. Member for Keighley is also concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70509-0017.htm_para1"><a name="070509103000862">My new clauses are common-sense proposalsthat would instil an awful lot of the British public&#146;s confidence in our immigration system that has been distinctly lacking over the past 10 years or so. Even if the Minister will not agree to my proposals, I hope that he will at least look carefully at the issues that they raise, understand that they are of great concern to the British people and try to find a way of addressing some, if not all, of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70509-0017.htm_para2"><a name="070509103000864">Some of the interventions were helpful, especially on the question of limits. We have been watching the debate among Opposition Members on that subject for some time. It was at spring conference, back in 2003, that the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith), who is not in the Chamber, called for quotas on refugees. &#147;This is real action&#148; was, I think, what he said. Of course, the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green) threw out that policy some time ago. However, the Conservative party went on to propose quotas in 2005. Although that policy was proposed two years ago, we have yetto hear precisely what the numbers would be. As has been pointed out, it is very difficult under the current arrangements to set a limit on EU migration. The fact that EU net inflow is 48 per cent. of UK net migration raises the question whether any attempt to set a limit would be meaningful or meaningless.</p>

 Although it is all very interesting hearing the Minister speculate about what my party&#146;s policy might or might not be, will he focus on the real issue by telling us what happens in practice?

 The answer is simple: they are escorted into a room and an immigration officer will take any step that he or she judges to be necessary to verify their identity. The options do not stop simply at asking someone to remove their veil; if necessary, we will fingerprint them. That is precisely how we discovered more than 200 failed asylum seekers trying to leave the country. We did so through tougher exit controls.</p>

 I do not think that I described the issue of EU immigration as a problem, because it has proved to be of substantial benefit to this country. The hon. Gentleman cannot get away from the point that his right hon. Friend&#146;s letter was extremely clear thathis party would switch off the national identity infrastructure of this country, despite the evidence that we have heard from people such as Dame Pauline Neville-Jones, who I think is chairing his party&#146;s international security and policy commission, and Lord Stephens, who has consistently spoken in favour of identity technology and who is chairing another of the Conservative party&#146;s policy commissions&#151;the one on border controls. The right hon. Gentleman wrote that in his letter also despite the evidence of people such as Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch UK, who has looked at the question carefully, and of the business community and of trade unions. All of them have said that if we are to stop illegal journeys and illegal jobs we must lock down people&#146;s identity. I hope that the Conservative party will follow through on any decision it votes for tonight by either underlining or withdrawing its commitment to shut down Britain&#146;s identity infrastructure.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para12"><a name="070509103001429">Before I come to my substantive remarks, I want to thank the members of the Public Bill Committee, who ensured that the Bill received the right level of scrutiny and deliberation. The changes that we have brought forward this afternoon demonstrate that the Committee was an important and useful part of the process. I also thank the witnesses who were summoned to give evidence to the Public Bill Committee. Often the evidence became a foundation for a lot of the debate that followed. That is the kind of constitutional innovation for which the Leader of the House deserves some credit. The Bill shows how important the changes to Committees have become. I also thank the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan) for the work that she has done on the Bill, and the work that she did in Committee and during the deliberations leading up to the Bill. I would have been lost without her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para13"><a name="070509103001430">On Second Reading, I said that the Bill is one of five reforms that we are making to the immigration system on the back of the changes announced by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary last year. The changes are already bearing fruit. At our overseas border we now turn back something like two jumbo jets-worth of potential illegal immigrants each week. Some 17,000 people were stopped on the other side of the channel last year alone. The number of asylum seekers is now at its lowest level since 1991. Last year, for the first time, we removed more failed asylum seekers than came into the country. As the Prime Minister said this afternoon, the number of foreign national prisoners being deported is now up, and up substantially. Last year, we tracked down and deported somebody every eight minutes who had no right to be in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para14"><a name="070509103001431">These changes are important, but they are not enough and they will not be enough for the future. In the future, we will need to do more. As we enter an era in which global migration will become faster and faster, our border defences and border security will need to be still more robust. That is why we are bringing forward such a radical overhaul of the immigration system. A cross-Government strategy brings together all aspects of public services to sharpen our attack on illegal  <br>

By the beginning of next year, that technology will be in place in border posts covering three quarters of the world&#146;s population. New international alliances are being negotiated to help to develop stronger global co-operation on this global issue. The Bill is designed to ensure that having doubled the number of our warranted staff, they will have the right powers to do their job, to keep our borders secure and to remove those who have no right to be here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para16"><a name="070509103001433">At the heart of the Bill is a series of measures to help us to deter, detect, detain, restrict and deport illegal immigrants. To deter more, we propose to strengthen our borders and to give our border security officers new powers. We propose new powers to prosecute human smugglers and people traffickers wherever on earth they perpetrate the offence. We propose new powers to confiscate the proceeds of organised immigration crime, which is responsible for about three quarters of the illegal immigration into this country. To detect more of those who are here illegally, we propose compulsory biometric identity cards for foreign nationals, so that those who exploit fake documents can be uncovered and denied access to the labour market and public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para17"><a name="070509103001434">However, we are providing important protections. We listened to the concerns of hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), and introduced prohibitions on any regulations that might require someone to carry a card at all times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para18"><a name="070509103001435">Nevertheless, the measures that we propose will allow us to eliminate the insecure 20th-century documents that are used to provide evidence of a person&#146;s eligibility to work or benefits. We will phase in new secure documents that are easier to check and harder to forge. We also propose new powers of search and the ability to share information with Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to find those who are here illegally or who employ people illegally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para19"><a name="070509103001436">To detain and restrict more people, we propose new powers to put those whom we are unable to removeon limited leave subject to reporting and residency restrictions. To deport more people, we propose new powers to deport automatically people who have committed offences in this country and breached our bond of trust. Foreign nationals that abuse our hospitality by seriously breaking the law will not be allowed to stay in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para20"><a name="070509103001437">The Bill also includes important measures that are designed to underpin the long-term improvement of the Border and Immigration Agency. It will give the agency new flexibility to raise resources from abroad so that it can do the job with which it has been tasked. There are also new provisions to provide stronger and more independent oversight to ensure that those resources are used as effectively as possible to keep our borders secure.</p>

that will allow us to lock down with confidence the identity of an individual. The technology will be used first when we issue a visa; secondly, when an individual boards a plane, train or boat for Britain; thirdly, at our border; and, fourthly, when people go about their business in Britain. That is why we have consistently argued that it would be an error to shut down the national identity infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para22"><a name="070509103001439">It was unfortunate that the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden, who is not in the Chamber, wrote a letter to the Cabinet Secretary in which he promised to shut down that system, because that will be a vital defence against illegal immigration. We think that migration will grow, which means that the riskof illegal immigration will surely not decrease, but increase. In the face of such future pressure, a plan simply to restructure managers here at home would be about as robust as sandcastles on the seashore. If Conservative Members support the Bill, I hope that they will take the logical next step by revoking their commitment to shutting down the UK&#146;s identity system. If they do not, people who are being kind will accuse them of having a muddled policy, while their critics will say that they are voting for one thing, but committing themselves to another. They would leave themselves open to the accusation that their immigration policy had become a shambles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para23"><a name="070509103001440">I hope that the House will pass this important Bill, which has benefited from the scrutiny that hon. Members have given it over the past few months. Let me finish with a word of warning: the pressure on our borders will grow unless we take steps to secure them today. That is why the Bill and the changes that the Home Secretary is putting through are important. We need to ensure that our front-line staff have the powers that they need to do the job that they love. I commend the Bill to the House and wish it a speedy passage in another place.</p>

 I start by echoing the thanks that the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality expressed to the staff on the Public Bill Committee. In particular, I thank the witnesses. Hearing from expert witnesses at the start of Committee is a useful innovation, and all of us learned many things from them. In fact, I would have preferred it if some of the insight that the witnesses gave us in Committee were better reflected in the changes that subsequently appeared in the Bill. The Government have indeed made some changes on the basis of amendments that we suggested in Committee, and that is entirely commendable, but I still feel that some of the things the Minister has just said, particularly about biometrics, fly in the face of the expert evidence that we heard in Committee. However, that institutional change to the way in which Bills are scrutinised should be preserved and, if possible, extended in future.</p>

Second Reading, I described it as a rag-bag&#151;a collection of measures with no core, central theme or guiding intellectual thrust to it. If anything, it was made even more of a rag-bag by the introduction, ata very late stage, of the inspectorate. That is an important step forward and one that, in principle, we do not oppose, but the idea has not received sufficient scrutiny as it was introduced in a series of new clauses well after Second Reading. Our wish is that the inspectorate will be properly independent. We know that public confidence in the system is rightly very low, and if recent evidence is to be believed, it is getting lower. A properly independent inspector could make some difference to that, but unfortunately that is not what is provided for in the Bill as it stands. I am sure that that will be a fruitful area for scrutiny and change in another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para25"><a name="070509103001443">From looking at the Bill as a whole, it is difficult to improve on the analysis of the Immigration Advisory Service, which makes the following point in its briefing for this debate:</p>
<a name="70509-0018.htm_brev3"><a name="070509103001557"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Bill...will become the fifth piece of major immigration legislation...since the Government assumed office in...ten years, excluding the Special Immigration Appeals and Human Rights Act. The list of repeals and amendments to previous legislation (some of which was never even implemented) tells its own story and has led to confusion and complication even among the judiciary.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para26"><a name="070509103001444">That is exactly right. The Government have thought too little and legislated too often on the subject. Too often, legislating has been a displacement activity for Ministers who feel that they are not on top of the immigration and asylum process.</p>

<p><a name="st_o289"><a name="070509103001445"><a name="70509-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="070509103002781"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 I am not trying to tempt my hon. Friend into agreeing with me on the Floor of the House&#151;I am not trying to make my point in that way&#151;but does he not have some sympathy with my continuing concern about, indeed campaign on, the Human Rights Act 1998? It presents serious problems, for example in relation to deportation, and there is no short and easy answer, save to repeal the Act. That would ensure that we got the results that we want when dealing with matters as serious as those that we are discussing.</p>

 It is clear that there are problems with the dispensation for deportation. Given what has happened in the past few weeks, I am sure that there is consensus in that area between the Government and us. My hon. Friend will know that our right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has suggested a British Bill of Rights, part of which would entrench the human rights which as British citizens we need and deserve, while ensuring at the same time that problems in the existing legislative regime can be dealt with. My hon. Friend will agree that that is not an easy task, but it is an essential one in a world as dangerous and difficult as the one that we face. He is right to point out that the legislation passed in the past 10 years has not, on the whole, been helpful, either in promoting human rights among vulnerable people or in giving proper protection to the population as a whole. That is certainly a matter that needs to be addressed by a future Conservative Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para27"><a name="070509103001447">To return to the Bill, it was instructive that throughout our proceedings, particularly on Second Reading, Labour Members attacked it from both left  <br>

and right. It was clearly unsatisfactory both to those who think that the Government have been led down the path of attempting to appease right-wing newspapers and those who thought that they should go further down that path. Underlying the unease of Government Members is the fact that a lot of the immigration debate in this country is now about delivery. It is not about the minutiae of legislation, important though they are, but about whether structures have been set up that can give us both effective control of our borders and the processes that will clear up the huge backlog of people who are in this country but who have no right to be here&#151;a backlog that has been allowed to build up over the past 10 years. The characteristic of the current regime at the Home Office&#151;when the Minister noted wistfully that he had been Immigration Minister for more than a year, I could tell that he was yearning for movement, and I wish him well over the next few weeks&#151;is to talk tough, to legislate often, but to deliver little. That verdict came through very clearly on Second Reading from Members on both sides of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para28"><a name="070509103001448">Looking ahead, we must consider whether anything will change. Will the Bill change anything much? Will the future Bills that were promised change anything much? I fear not. We know that we will soon have yet another Home Secretary. The path is instructive. The first Labour Home Secretary lasted four years; the second one, three years; the third one, two years; the fourth one, one year. As everyone speculates about who is going to take over as the next Home Secretary in July, I have to point out that at the current rate of progress, it will all be over by Christmas, because he will have about six months in the job before we get another one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para29"><a name="070509103001449">There is a hole in the Bill and a hole at the heart of the Government&#146;s immigration policy, because they have not protected our borders properly. The Minister waxed lyrical about biometric technology and said that it is the solution. He almost said explicitly a few minutes ago that it was what we needed, and that is the cornerstone or building block of everything that the Government are doing. It flies in the face of evidence from around the world, and of the expert evidence that we heard in Committee, that blind faith in biometric technology will not result in the solution that the Minister claims. Our practical solution of a border police force and specialist policing to deal with what goes on both at our borders and in illegal employment is a much more effective, holistic solution to the problems that we continue to face with a porous immigration system, in which our borders are not properly protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70509-0018.htm_para30"><a name="070509103001450">The biggest problem that the Minister faces is delivery. The second biggest problem is the fact that the inspectorate that he has established to examine the various new structures that he is setting up lacks proper powers. I suspect that the final verdict on the Billwill be that it is not destined to change much or to make any significant improvements in our failing immigration system. We regret that. We have not opposed the principle of the Bill, because it contains useful elements. Some of the changes that we were able to make in Committee will make it slightly more useful, but the Bill fails to rise to the enormous challenge of improving Britain&#146;s immigration system.</p>

At the time, the Minister said that one of the reasons why the Government did not want to do that was the need for stability in the Home Office, yet immediately afterwards they split it.

 It is a relatively rare experience for a suggestion that I make on a Home Office Bill to be taken up and accepted by Ministers, so I am genuinely grateful to the Minister for inserting Government amendment No. 16. That change was needed to ensure that the Bill reflected what Ministers said was going to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70509-0019.htm_para7"><a name="070509103001465">The same approach would help if applied toclause 16, which deals with reporting and residence conditions. We debated that on Second Reading and some detailed discussion took place in Committee. Current drafting means that reporting and residence conditions could be applied to almost anybody who does not have indefinite leave to remain. In Committee, the Minister gave some assurances that he expected the clause to apply in relatively limited circumstances. However, as the provision is drafted, it would be open to a future Minister to interpret it differently from my hon. Friend. I hope that, before the Bill completes its passage, more thought will be given to whether a similar approach to that on biometrics could be taken to clause 16.</p>

That has been a recurring theme of debates on several Bills, and the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green) made the point earlier. I fully accept that, after 10 years of government, we must accept responsibility for the state of the Home Office and the delays. However, if the hon.

The problem has simply remained unsolved for a long time. It is important to get to grips with it; if the processing does not happen, the deportation clauses will not work. If legislation is passed but not implemented, and things that we say will happen do not, faith in the process will be lost. I have argued for some time that the Home Office should legislate rather less and do a hell of a lot more to ensure that the systems within it work.</p>

 I shall be brief. I listened to the Minister&#146;s comments with interest. In a nutshell, he said, &#147;So far, so good, but we need to monitor the position carefully in future.&#148; The Bill does not go far enough. I have deep concerns about the rate and manner of immigration policies, and I have already said that the Human Rights Act 1998 represents an obstacle to our dealing not only with immigration but with asylum and deportation.

They have not been mentioned in our debates on the Bill, but the Minister knows that that is where it all comes from. Judging by the evidence that I have read recently, it will not work: it is another costly implementation of unnecessary European legislation.</p>

I cannot think of a single conceivable reason why a person who is a foreign criminal should be able to avail himself of an escape from these provisions simply on account of a fatuous law that has come out of the European convention or European Community treaties. We have really got a completely upside-down world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70509-0019.htm_para13"><a name="070509103001472">I see that the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon.

She knows that we in the European Scrutiny Committee remain deeply concerned and critical of her role and that of other Ministers in matters that impinge on this question. I do not intend to go further into them now, but I refer to the transfer of foreign prisoners and related issues.</p>

The intrusion of the Human Rights Act and European Community enactments should be covered by the sort of provisions set out in new clause 17 of the Regulatory Reform Bill.

projected over the next generation&#151;a growth of about 7 million or more, of which the majority will come from migration. That is unprecedented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70509-0019.htm_para16"><a name="070509103001478">That is a huge task for a society to adjust to and digest, so the key is to ensure that we look at the issue in the round and take sensible decisions on border controls and migration policy generally, based on the best evidence about what is good for this country. The levels that we are talking about, and the components of them, may be extremely good or they may be extremely bad&#151;or perhaps somewhere between the two, which I suspect is the case. What I am sure about is that we have to do better in finding the mechanism to enable us&#151;in government, in Parliament and among the public&#151;to have better discussion of these matters than we have had before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70509-0019.htm_para17"><a name="070509103001479">I am pretty sure that when the Bill was announced, the Home Secretary told me that we were going to have an immigration commission to look at these issues in the round. I welcomed that, as I had argued for it for a long time. I tabled two early-day motions on the subject, and others supported them. The point was to put all the issues together&#151;what the economy needs in terms of skills, but also the effect on wage levels, public services, social cohesion and all the other things that bear on decisions on migration and border policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70509-0019.htm_para18"><a name="070509103001480">I see that there is no such body in the Bill. Instead, we have what is called a migration advisory committee, which is to be a non-statutory, non-departmental public body that will offer advice, I am told, on the skills needed in particular sections of the economy. If that is the case, we are missing an opportunity to remedy the deficiencies that have been pointed out by the national statistician, even in terms of the figures that we are dealing with. We cannot make good policy unless we have good population and migration figures, but we do not have them. Nor can we make sensible policy decisions unless we put all the issues about economic activity, skills shortages, wage levels, public services and social cohesion into the same pot and try to make sense of them. We could then make some informed decisions on that basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70509-0019.htm_para19"><a name="070509103001481">We are to have a migration advisory committee, a migration impacts forum and a national statistics centre for demography, and we already have a commission on integration. I believe, however, that the time has come to put all those bodies together toform a serious commission that could advise the Government, and all of us, on all matters relating to immigration and population. I had hoped that such a provision would be in the Bill, because of what the Home Secretary had said. I still hope that in the course of the Bill&#146;s passage to the other place and back, we shall manage not to lose the opportunity to establish a body of that kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70509-0019.htm_para20"><a name="070509103001483">There was also a slightly less than satisfactory outcome to our brief exploration earlier today of clause 44, which relates to the seizure of nationality documents, in relation to Scotland. I mentioned during that debate that there was a corollary between the new powers being given to HMRC officers in Scotland and the similar new powers in the Bill for immigration officers. The Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 was amended to ensure that only sheriffs&#151;not sheriffs and justices of the peace&#151;could issue and vary production orders. The provisions specified in some detail the procedures relating to the powers to remove, access and copy documents; again, there is a direct corollary with the power to seize nationality documents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70509-0019.htm_para21"><a name="070509103001484">The powers of arrest were specified, and, indeed, limited, to ensure that HMRC officers&#151;and likewise immigration officers&#151;would not actually be police officers but would have certain powers. The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 was also amended. Finally, the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001was amended to reference the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995, particularly in relation to the seizure of documents. That might have been a better approach to take to the powers given to immigration officers by the Bill; it might have been a more comprehensive way of dealing with these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70509-0019.htm_para22"><a name="070509103001485">However, none of those flaws is enough to persuade us to oppose the Bill tonight, and we will not do so. I am sure that the Minister will take on board in the correct manner the fact that I say that there is to be a change of Administration in Scotland soon, and that I am sure that he would like to seek an early meeting with the new Justice Minister at which he can explore fully how the criminal law in Scotland might be amended to provide the necessary safeguards, and to ensure that immigration officers working in Scotland have the same powers to protect their borders as those working in England and Wales.</p>

 The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) did not underestimate the amount of public disquiet on the subject of immigration. While I support some of the measures in the Bill, it certainly does not go far enough to address those concerns. It contains three potential areas of weakness, and I shall attempt to outline them in the limited time that I have left.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70509-0019.htm_para23"><a name="070509103001487">First, on illegal immigration, I am worried that the proposals in the Bill, together with other proposals that the Government are bringing forward, will weaken the first and most effective line of defence, which is the overseas posts&#146; power to grant people visas to come to this country. All the evidence shows that once someone is inside the country and staying here as illegal migrant, it is very difficult to remove them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70509-0019.htm_para24"><a name="070509103001488">Secondly, the proposals on automatic deportation are in fact a retreat from what the Government proposed last year. The proposals in the Bill, which we  <br>

went through in some detail in Committee, show remarkable indulgence towards repeat offenders. All the provisions are, in any case, subject to human rights legislation. Given the weakness of the Bill in dealing with repeat offenders, it will be important to examine how effectively the existing provisions on deportation are being used for people whose presence is not conducive to the public good, and whose deportation has been recommended by the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70509-0019.htm_para25"><a name="070509103001489">Finally, in relation to overall immigration, we need to consider the points-based system and the overall impact of migration.

 For many Members, it is often constituents who highlight an issue by bringing it to our attention, either inan advice surgery, in correspondence or over the telephone. That was so in the case of Tony Dean, whose case I bring to the attention of the House this evening, as well as to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister. Tony&#146;s wife, Avril, first came to see me in February last year, concerned about her husband&#146;s care at a time when he was visibly deteriorating day by day. It might help the House to understand Tony&#146;s case a little better if I give some background.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para0"><a name="070509103001500">Tony Dean was born in the working-class Chapeltown district of my constituency in February 1940. He was highly intelligent, attended school in Chapeltown, then went on to Leeds modern school&#151;now known as Lawnswood high school&#151;and went to Sunderland to train as a pharmacist before qualifying in 1962. In 1967, he married Avril and the couple had two children, now grown up and aged 37 and 35. In 1968, Tony set up his own pharmacy in the Beeston and Holbeck area of Leeds. It was a small local shop, which rapidly gained a good reputation and became an integral part of that modest suburb of south Leeds. Many of his former customers still ask after him and try to seek his advice, although he has not been there for a few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para1"><a name="070509103001501">Seven years ago, Tony was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#146;s disease. As a pharmacist, he knew what to expect and bore the news with typical stoicism. He and Avril had already guessed that something was wrong when, during the preceding two years, Tony had started suffering memory loss&#151;at first, small things such as forgetting how to lock the car door or where the airing cupboard was located in their home. After the formal diagnosis in 2000, Tony knew what to expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para2"><a name="070509103001502">Tony had always been a sporty and athletic person. A well-built and powerful man of 5 ft 10 in, he enjoyed cricket, golf and bowls as well as bridge and chess. However, one by one, he had to give up those pastimes&#151;and his work&#151;as the disease gained its grip on his mind. Although he tried to take each setback in his stride, accepting what the disease would mean, he fought against losing his driving licence by retaking his driving test, although eventually, sadly, he had to give up driving in early 2002. He was 62 years old.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para3"><a name="070509103001503">By the time he had begun to suffer from the excruciating pain of kidney stones during 2002, Tony became so frustrated that he could no longer express his pain or feelings&#151;nor could he even urinate properly, or sometimes at all&#151;and he started to become violent and angry. Eventually, at the end of 2004, he underwent an operation for the kidney stones, but his family tell me that by the time he came home from hospital he was no longer the husband and father whom they knew and loved so much. He had, in their words, &#147;gone to the fairies&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para4"><a name="070509103001504">In March 2005 Avril decided to visit her daughter in Canada, but needed respite care for Tony, whom she was finding increasingly difficult to look after.  <br>

Following two unsuccessful attempts to place him in private care homes, he was admitted to The Mount psychiatric hospital in Leeds for a month for his care needs to be assessed. By the time Avril returned from Canada, he had been admitted to Leeds general infirmary suffering from bruising and bleeding as a result of falls sustained at The Mount. By this time the disease had made him very aggressive, and although no physical problem could be found, he kept walking into other people as well as objects, doors and furniture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para5"><a name="070509103001505">One month&#146;s assessment at The Mount soon became 15 months. An attempt to place Tony in an NHS continuing care home, Towngate House in Guiseley,in June last year failed after a few days, and he was back at The Mount. After being taken off 24-hour observation while Avril was away on holiday in August 2006, Tony became dehydrated and very seriously ill. He had suffered kidney damage and bruising to his head and eye. He was kept in Leeds general infirmary for three and a half weeks, but he was also suffering from an enlarged prostate, and by now was reduced to a vegetative state. He had stopped being able to walk, talk, feed himself or even drink without help. By this time he was no longer aggressive, so he was admitted to Towngate House again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para6"><a name="070509103001506">Unhappy with the care that Tony was receiving compared with the care he had received at The Mount, I arranged a meeting for Avril with Michele Moran, deputy chief executive of Leeds Community and Mental Health Trust. Michele was very helpful backin November and promised to look into Avril&#146;s complaints about the way that Tony had been treated at Towngate House, as well as trying to find somewhere appropriate to give him the care that he needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para7"><a name="070509103001507">On 22 February this year, Tony moved to Southlands care home in the old Wetherby road in my constituency. Southlands is a privately run home that offers excellent standards of care, and Tony is now very well looked after. However, it is costing Avril &#163;635 per week. She is receiving a contribution of &#163;87 a week from the NHS, and also receives an attendance allowance of &#163;325 a month as well as Tony&#146;s state pension, but it will not take very long for every penny that the couple have, as well as all their assets, to be used up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para8"><a name="070509103001508">Avril is unhappy that Tony does not qualify for continuing care because he does not have enough &#147;medical need&#148;. After complaining to Leeds primary care trust, she was told by one of its officials that &#147;its hands were tied&#148; by Government policy. Yet when I went with Avril to meet representatives of the PCT in January, the official could not understand why I was there. The PCT agreed to bring in a qualified nurse from Halifax PCT to reassess Tony&#146;s care needs at Southlands. The nurse agreed that a higher level of care was needed and raised the band for payment to &#163;133 a week, although I understand that that higher amount has not yet been received by Avril and that Leeds PCT is very unhappy with the award.</p>

January 2006 in the case of Maureen Grogan found that the eligibility criteria for continuing care being used by the Bexley care trust were unlawful. That surely raises questions about the criteria being used by other health trusts and authorities. Given that many attempts were made during Tony Dean&#146;s 15-month stay at The Mount to find a private care home that would take him, and that no home at the time would give him a place, does not that show that he had such high dependency needs that only the NHS could give him the care that he needed?</p>

Friend the Minister tell me when he expects it to be available and what it might say? Surely, the distinction between health and social care is a false one when examining cases like Tony Dean&#146;s. Can my hon. Friend give me, the Dean family and many thousands in their situation any hope that the continuing care needed for patients like Tony will be provided at some future date? Dementia care is not simply social care. A man such as Tony Dean can no longer do anything for himself. He has forgotten how to swallow and he cannot turn over in bed, speak, walk, eat, drink or do anything else without help from another person. He needs 24-hour a day care just to stay alive.</p>

Their determination, especially his wife Avril&#146;s, has certainly ensured that Tony is now properly looked after, but I hope that it will also show what needs to be done to help many others in the same situation who continueto suffer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para15"><a name="070509103001516">It is difficult and challenging to live with a husband or wife, mother or father after seeing them enjoy a full life&#151;participating actively in their local community, holding down an important job, being a parent or spouse&#151;only for it to be suddenly shattered by that horrendous condition. It is indeed traumatic. For many people, it can be the first time in their life when they require significant input either from the national health service or from the social care system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para16"><a name="070509103001517">Continuing care has long been a difficult issue. Decisions are made locally by a combination of assessment involving primary care trusts and local authorities. As a consequence of cases such as that of Mr. Dean, of court rulings&#151;my hon. Friend referred to one&#151;and of ombudsman&#146;s investigations, the Government acknowledge that there is an authentic and genuine issue that has to be addressed. Until now, we have not been able to micro-manage decisions made on a locality by locality basis. Indeed, it would not have been appropriate to do so; nor will it be in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para17"><a name="070509103001518">However, we acknowledge the need for a national framework to provide clear guidance about access to and eligibility for continuing care funding. I have made it clear that, as a result of court judgments and ombudsman&#146;s rulings, it is important that we get the guidance right, which is why it has taken some time to prepare. It is my intention to publish it in June. We believe that it will lead to a more equitable and a fairer system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para18"><a name="070509103001519">The difficult but honest message is that people will always fall on either side of the line, wherever that line is drawn. What is important is that the new system takes account of the fact that we live in a changing society. One of the challenges for the national health service and the social care system is the demographic realities that we now face. People in our society are living longer, which is good news, but in doing sothey are developing more complex and challenging conditions such as Alzheimer&#146;s and dementia&#151;conditions that the current system was not set up to address or cope with. That is why we need to issue this new guidance. It will influence the decisions that are made in every local health economy and social care system throughout the country, and it will, we hope, lead to greater equity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para19"><a name="070509103001520">My hon. Friend raises the question of the dividing line between social care and health care. That is incredibly difficult to address because, again, there is a line, so there will always be people who, following assessment, fall on one side of it rather than the other. The national health service has through history been free at the point of need irrespective of the ability to pay, funded through general taxation, and that will always be the position as long as this Government remain in power. On the other hand, social care has always been a means-tested system. There has always been a requirement, linked to income and capital, for people to make a contribution. That is not an invention of recent years; it has always been the nature of the social care system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para20"><a name="070509103001521">I say to my hon. Friend that any political party which suggests to Tony and Avril, and thousands of other people up and down the country, that the concept of free care is sustainable is not telling them thetruth. The Liberal Democrats spokesperson, the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley), recently said  <br>

that she regretted the fact that in her party&#146;s manifesto for the previous general election it had misled people into believing that free care was a credible option. She admitted that in the Chamber, much to everybody&#146;s surprise. The question&#151;and challenge&#151;for our society and Government is: what is fair and sustainable under this new demographic reality?</p>

<p><a name="st_o303"><a name="070509103001522"><a name="70509-0020.htm_spnew1"><a name="070509103002795"><b>Mr. Hamilton:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend not agree that in Scotland much more continuing care is given free of charge, and that therefore according to his own logic that is unsustainable in the future and at some stage the Scots will have to charge for that continuing care?</p>

<p><a name="st_o304"><a name="070509103001523"><a name="70509-0020.htm_spnew2"><a name="070509103002796"><b>Mr. Lewis:</b>
 The local authorities in Scotland are already saying that it is difficult to believe that the policy of free personal care will be sustainable going forward. Devolution means that Scotland has the right to make that choice, within the restraints of the resources available to it. However, we must recognise that there is a difference between continuing care, social care and personal care, and we must not mix them up. Free personal care is in my view neither sustainablenor necessarily fair, because it bears no relation tothe relative ability to pay of the people making a contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para21"><a name="070509103001524">We must address the status quo. We already recognise that the status quo in continuing care is not acceptable, which is why we intend to issue guidance&#151;in June, we hope. We also recognise that the changing demographics mean that we need a new consensus for a new settlement in terms of social care as well. That will involve looking at the respective future responsibilities and contributions of the state, the Government or the taxpayer, and of the family and the individual using the services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para22"><a name="070509103001525">We need a new consensus. A coalition of charities has just come together, which has stimulated a national debate that has just begun. There will also be a series of conferences throughout the country, so we will be having an honest dialogue with the people of England on what is sustainable and fair. Given the realities that we now face of people living longer and of an increasing number of challenging conditions, where does responsibility properly lie, both financial and behavioural? As a consequence of conditions such as Alzheimer&#146;s and dementia, more and more people define themselves, and are defined as, carers in our society, and that process will continue. That is why the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I launched not long ago a consultation on the nature of the support that we need to offer carers in future. That consultation process will take place over the next few months, and we intend to publish a new national carers strategy in due course. We have announced some funding for emergency respite care, an emergency helpline and an expert carers programme. Since 1999, every local authority has had an annual grant to spend specifically on supporting carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para23"><a name="070509103001526">I realise that, now that Mr. Dean is in care, some of those developments are in a sense less relevant in the case of Mrs. Dean.

The level of support available to her as a carer has perhaps not  <br>

always been of the highest quality and standard. The system is sometimes incredibly difficult for people to navigate, which is why the Government believe that more control and power over deciding the level and nature of care that people with Alzheimer&#146;s and other such conditions should receive should be in the hands of the family and the user, and that less should be in the hands of organisations. The manifestation of that is individual budgets and direct payments, and a greater level of control for those who use such services and their family members, with professionals playing quite a different role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para24"><a name="070509103001527">The Government have introduced many changes that have represented progress. Since October 2001, there has been NHS-funded nursing care in all settings, substantial investment in intermediate care, and a 12-week property disregard of the means test for residential accommodation when a person moves permanently into a care home. There is also the deferred payments scheme, whereby people can delay selling their homes in order to meet care costs, and the raising of capital limits below which individuals receive financial assistance toward their care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para25"><a name="070509103001528">Therefore, the Government have done a number of things, but there is still a lot for us to do. On the specific issues that concern Avril and Tony Dean, I hope that the new guidance on continuing care, which is due in June, will make a difference to them and to many others whose presenting problem is, in a sense, their mental health need because of Alzheimer&#146;s or dementia. Having reviewed this issue, I am not sure that the system that was in place historically took sufficient account of that reality and of the consequences of such conditions in the care required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para26"><a name="070509103001529">Alongside the new guidance on continuing care, we need a new consensus for a new settlement that defines in terms of personal and social care the respective responsibilities of the state, the citizen and the family. The situation today is challenging, given the changes that are taking place, but as Wanless said in his report of not that long ago, we have to address this issue. Over the next 20 to 25 years, that will be a growing challenge facing our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para27"><a name="070509103001530">Members in all parts of the House&#151;I say that slightly tongue in cheek, looking at the empty Opposition Benches during this incredibly important debate&#151;have accepted that the status quo on pension provision is not appropriate to the changing society that we live in. The balance of people who will be economically productive as against those who will be retired is changing rapidly. The same principles apply to the way that we fund and provide care as people get older. It was possible, in the new framework for pensions, to achieve significant consensus in difficult circumstances. This issue is not just a challenge for one Government, but for society. Let us hope that we can engage in a constructive, honest and authentic dialogue with the people of this country about what a sustainable and fair system will look like in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para28"><a name="070509103001531">There are no easy solutions. Wanless sought to bring disability benefits into the equation, and that is a contentious and difficult addition to the subject of the reform of social care. The presentation of the issue as a choice between a means-tested system or free personal care is, in some ways, disingenuous. Much of the way in which the system now works would need to be  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para29"><a name="070509103001532">The Government will not shirk the challenge. There are no easy options and there will be hard choices to make, but we must not seek to impose a new social care system on people. We must first have a serious discussion with people about their expectations, their rights and their responsibilities. As part of that dialogue, we need to identify the options and alternatives available to us. As I have said, some excellent work has been done by Derek Wanless, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the King&#146;s Fund on the dilemmas and choices that society and Government face in reordering the social care system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="70509-0020.htm_para30"><a name="070509103001533">Alongside financial responsibility, we need to consider how to move from a system in which local authorities and the statutory agencies provide services to people, to one in which people are empowered to take a greater level of control over the care that they want for themselves and their families.
