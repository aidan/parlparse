<a name="stpa_14">I am surprised that the right hon. Gentleman had so little to say, and so little intention of including business on, global warming and this country&#039;s response to it. He will remember that, before the election, the Prime Minister said that it was the biggest issue that our country faces. It was therefore surprising to hear nothing about it in the Queen&#039;s Speech. It is obviously not on the agenda at the moment&#151;that will come as a surprise to many people inside and outside this place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-01_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">Will the Leader of the House please give us an update on the timetable for appointing Select Committee members and Chairmen, especially in the light of the Chairmen&#039;s meeting in July, when the Prime Minister will be interviewed again? It is obviously important to get Chairmen in place before that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-01_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">When will the Bill on the European constitutional referendum be published? Will the right hon. Gentleman clear up the confusion of the past 24&nbsp;hours? Will the Bill contain a firm, definite and immovable date for the referendum? Will he clarify the position?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-01_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">Will the Leader of the House provide an early opportunity for the House to consider the system of ministerial appointments in this country, especially whether it should be possible for someone to receive millions of pounds from substantial Government contracts, make a major financial contribution to the Government and then become a Minister in that Government? Is not that the sort of behaviour that the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s colleagues have a habit of criticising vigorously when it happens in other countries?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-01_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">I am sure that the Leader of the House and I share the hope that what we all do in the House during this Parliament will encourage greater interest in the democratic process. Does he therefore share my disappointment that the Queen&#039;s Speech debates this week have been curtailed owing to a lack of interest and lack of willingness to speak among Labour Members? Does he believe that that is a sign of things to come?
</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50519-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I am surprised to hear the shadow Leader of the House complain about the lack of discussion on the important subject of global warming, given that we are about to start a debate on precisely that subject, once the business question is resolved. There will be every opportunity for Ministers and other right hon. and hon. Members to discuss the issue in the course of that debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-01_para19">
<a name="stpa_19">It is certainly my intention to have the Select Committees up and running before the summer recess. I hope also to be able to assist the House in relation to the publication of the Bill dealing with the referendum. Exceptionally, I would like to announce that we propose to introduce it on Tuesday next, 24&nbsp;May. I hope that that will be of assistance to Members in illustrating the Government&#039;s determination that there should be a referendum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-01_para20">
<a name="stpa_20">I am sure that the shadow Leader of the House knows full well that all ministerial appointments are made in accordance with the relevant rules, and there have been no exceptions whatever on this occasion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-01_para21">
<a name="stpa_21">I certainly share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern that there should be greater interest in the democratic process. It is in the interest of all Members to establish 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 272</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>ways of increasing turnout. I made the point in my acceptance speech following the announcement of the result in Ashfield that the amount of effort and energy put in by all Members to promoting democracy around the world must be matched by a similar effort so far as turnout in our own constituencies is concerned. That is a challenge for all political parties.
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50519-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Chris Mullin  (Sunderland, South) (Lab):</b> 
 I am sorry to see that we seem to have reverted to the 80-day summer recess. Nothing brings us into discredit with our constituents so much as the idea&#151;which I know is false in many cases&#151;that we take two and a half months off in the summer. I had understood that we were to come back for a couple of weeks in September; I thought that that had been agreed some time ago. Is the suspension of the September sittings permanent or temporary? I understand that this suspension might have something to do with the fitting of a new security screen, but I would like an assurance from my right hon. Friend that we shall revert to the arrangement that I thought had been agreed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50519-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that matter. I know that the question of the September sitting is of concern to right hon. and hon. Members. This year, the specific reason for there not being a September sitting is the works that will have to be carried out in the Chamber to install a permanent security screen&#151;my hon. Friend was right in that regard. That does not mean, however, that we have taken any particular decision as far as the future is concerned.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50519-02_spnew0"><b> Andrew Stunell  (Hazel Grove) (LD):</b> 
 May I also welcome the new Leader of the House and his deputy to their posts? I am sure that, with the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s background in constitutional law, he will appreciate the importance of his role in serving the whole House. Bearing that in mind, will he give us an assurance that, next time he is in charge of the House at the time of a Queen&#039;s Speech, he will ensure that the bundle of information given to the press in advance is also available to all Members of the House?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_22">Will the Leader of the House also refer back to the work of his predecessors on the Modernisation Committee to produce a report that recommended the establishment of a business management committee? Such a committee would provide an opportunity for the whole House to take part in the timetabling and management of the Government&#039;s Bills throughout the year. That would avoid a logjam of business during the year, and the poor scrutiny that can result from that. It might even moderate some of the opposition that Bills could face in the Lords on the ground that they have not been adequately scrutinised. It would be helpful if the Leader of the House commented on that procedure. May I conclude by saying that I hope that he will share with the House more Government secrets in his new role than he ever did in his previous one?
</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50519-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b>

 Right honourable!

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50519-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 My apologies. I asked for the information to be deposited in the Library for the information of Members at the earliest opportunity, and it is my understanding that that was done. For the benefit of the House, particularly the more technically minded Members&#151;I do not think that that includes the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst&#151;Members might like to be reminded that information on the Queen&#039;s Speech, including detailed briefings about the Bills, is available on my website, at www.commonsleader.gov.uk. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman can take the appropriate courses to allow him to access that information.
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50519-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Andrew Mitchell  (Sutton Coldfield) (Con):</b> 
 I too welcome the right hon. Gentleman to his new position, not just because he has been a close friend of mine for nearly 30&nbsp;years&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Oh!&quot;] These things do happen. I also welcome him to his position, because&#151;as some Conservative Members will remember from the 1990s&#151;when he was on these Benches he showed himself to be a great respecter and user of the traditions and procedures of the House. Will he be sure to inculcate the same respect in some of his fellow Cabinet Ministers, who have not always shown the commitment that he has always shown to making announcements first and foremost from the Dispatch Box, and not outside and through the media?
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50519-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I think I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I hope that I can respond in kind. When I first met the hon. Gentleman at the university of Cambridge, I had him down as a future leader of the Conservative party. I know it is a crowded field at the moment, but I am grateful for what he said and I wish him every success in his endeavours, wherever they may lead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-02_para2">
<a name="stpa_24">As for respect, it is certainly important&#151;as I hope I made clear earlier in my response to yesterday&#039;s point of order&#151;for all Ministers to respect the conventions of the House, and to ensure that proper information is available to all Members.
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="50519-02_spnew6"><b> William Hague  (Richmond, Yorks) (Con):</b> 
 Will the Leader of the House, in his new role&#151;which, of course, covers the whole range of Government policy&#151;acquaint himself with the truly bizarre side-effects of the Government&#039;s policy on the capping of local authorities? Those side-effects include the capping of a council with one of the lowest council taxes in the country, Hambleton in north Yorkshire. Given the perhaps not wholly unfounded suspicion that the policy was motivated by electoral and political considerations, will the Leader of the House advise his colleagues that it can now happily be dropped, thus saving the House&#039;s time? If he will not do that, will he ensure that there is the fullest possible debate on the policy, so that its grave deficiencies can be fully exposed?
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50519-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I am sure the right hon. Gentleman was not suggesting for a moment that the policy was in any 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 274</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>way motivated by the recent general election or the election campaign, but I give him the opportunity to confirm that. Nevertheless, it is important for the rules and the approach to be seen to be transparent, fair and objective in the case of all local authorities. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept from me that that is the position.
</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50519-02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland) (LD):</b> 
 Has the new Leader of the House had an opportunity to see a BBC weather forecast recently? If so, he may have noticed that the BBC is employing a new graphic viewing the country from the south-west of England. The land mass has expanded, the country tapers away at the top, and my constituency, which is rightly famous for having some of the most interesting and varied weather in the country, is barely visible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-02_para3">
<a name="stpa_25">Many of my constituents depend on reliable weather forecasting for their living as fishermen, farmers and crofters. Surely it is wrong for us to be excluded from BBC services in this way. Has the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport a view on the matter? If so, may we have an opportunity to hear it as part of next week&#039;s business?
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="50519-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I knew I was in for a treat when I was appointed to this job. One of the little-known responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Defence is, in fact, the Met Office. In the course of those responsibilities I visited the new Met Office, and saw the tremendous facilities there. I regret to say that my responsibilities did not extend to the way in which the BBC presents material supplied by the Met Office, but I am sure that the director-general of the BBC will note the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments and take appropriate action.
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="50519-02_spnew10"><b> Andrew Mackay  (Bracknell) (Con):</b> 
 Does the Leader of the House accept that it is essential for the Foreign Secretary to come here next week and make a statement on our relationship with Uzbekistan? Many of us believe that our ex-ambassador Craig Murray has been treated disgracefully by the Foreign Secretary, and that no action was taken against human rights abuses in that country. We would like the Foreign Secretary to make an apology from that Dispatch Box.
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50519-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary is assiduous in making statements. I have not checked the number of statements that he has made in the course of his distinguished occupancy of his position, but he has come to the Dispatch Box regularly to make them, and I am sure that if he judges it necessary, there will be a statement on Uzbekistan. He has made the British Government&#039;s position quite clear. The British ambassador visited the troubled part of Uzbekistan yesterday, and I know that the Foreign Office is awaiting a detailed report from him on what he found there.
</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50519-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Eric Forth  (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con):</b> 
 Given his responsibilities for the House itself and for the management of business, can the Leader of the House share with us how he thinks that we can possibly scrutinise properly and effectively in excess of 45&nbsp;Bills, even in an extended parliamentary Session? Does he 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 275</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>seriously think that the House and indeed the other place can properly discharge their duties in terms of scrutiny in that time? If not, what does he propose to do about it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50519-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 As the right hon. Gentleman has conceded, this is an 18-month Session. The business managers judge that there is perfectly adequate time to get through the programme that has been announced to the House. As always, co-operation from both sides of the House is required to ensure that there is proper scrutiny of that legislation. I am absolutely confident that that proper co-operation will be forthcoming.
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="50519-02_spnew14"><b> Robert Key  (Salisbury) (Con):</b> 
 In welcoming the new Leader of the House to his post, may I advise him to set a trend and to establish twice-yearly debates on science and technology? This House neglects science and technology. The Minister for Science and Innovation is in the House of Lords, so we cannot question him about his work; and we live in an anti-science culture. Great issues face us such as nuclear energy, so we need to take the issue more seriously. An Adjournment debate would be warmly welcomed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="50519-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I am slightly averse to setting trends after only 20&nbsp;minutes in the House doing a new job. Nevertheless, he makes a good point about the importance of science and technology. I am sure that something can be considered through the usual channels.

<a name="stpa_26">There is no mention of a Bill and no time scale. May I make a suggestion that will save us all a lot of time and trouble? At the end of the previous Parliament, a draft Bill was introduced with the support of members of all three parties. Why does not the Leader of the House just introduce that and get on with it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="50519-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 Because, as the right hon. Gentleman will be well aware, it is necessary for us to consider carefully the important issues. On other occasions, right hon. and hon. Members on the Opposition Benches have urged the Government to take their time and to consider carefully the implications of important constitutional measures, and that is what we will do.

 In presenting the Government&#039;s programme for the next 18&nbsp;months, will the Leader of the House ensure that we have enough time to debate the 45&nbsp;Bills that he and his colleagues wish to see on the statute book? In the previous Parliament, the Government&#039;s programme became farcical as they guillotined and prevented debate on a range of highly important public policy issues. He can make a new start and, with renewed self-confidence following his party&#039;s election to a third term in government, allow the House of Commons to do what it is supposed to do, which is to scrutinise legislation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="50519-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I do not disagree with the hon. and learned Gentleman: it is important that Bills are scrutinised

<br>&nbsp;<br>thoroughly. But may I gently remind him that it is the practice occasionally of Opposition Members in dealing with Bills to spend an inordinate amount of time on the first two clauses and not to devote any time to the remaining parts of the Bill? I have been on many Bills where the Opposition have done that. Indeed, in opposition, I did it. That is why it is necessary properly to consider the way in which these Bills will be considered by the House. I am confident that through the usual channels that will be the case.

 Did the Leader of the House notice that, yesterday, in an excellent maiden speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) drew the House&#039;s attention to the fact that the recent rebanding exercise for council tax in Wales has meant that some 40&nbsp;per cent. of properties in his constituency have gone up by one band and many have gone up by two or even three? Can the Leader of the House ensure that before the summer Adjournment we have the opportunity to debate council tax revaluation, or at least rebanding, with the appropriate Minister coming to the House to explain how that will happen? In constituencies such as mine, we are fearful that that exercise will mean large numbers of our constituents will pay substantially more council tax.

 I join the hon. Gentleman in congratulating not only the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C.

It is important, once elected to the House, to serve the House in the way that those who have been re-elected have always done.

<a name="stpa_27">I did not recognise on my last trip to Banbury that the constituency extended to Wales. I am delighted to hear of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern about the situation there.

 Towards the end of the last Parliament, the Government accepted in the Modernisation Committee that we should be able to table written questions during the summer recess. As the Leader of the House has today announced that the summer recess will be longer than was originally planned, will he ensure that there is an opportunity for the relevant motion to be laid so that those of us who wish to hold the Government to account, even during the summer recess, have that opportunity?

That would greatly reassure the two thirds of British people who in poll after poll, year after year, and decade after decade have felt that Britain should continue to possess nuclear weapons so long as other countries have them&#151;although it might not reassure a number of people on Labour&#039;s Front and Back Benches.

Since then it has been roundly condemned by thousands of professionals, voluntary bodies, users and, indeed, my party. The pre-legislative Scrutiny Committee produced its report in March in singularly condemning terms. Can the Leader of the House give us some indication of when the Minister will respond to that report, and tell us when we might see the final mental health Bill and whether it will take account of the enormous amount of criticism that has resulted? Given that we have not had a single debate on mental health issues in all that time, will he now provide time in this House for us to discuss this important subject?

 Will the Leader of the House arrange for an early debate on the Government&#039;s failure to take key strategic decisions, in particular on the full fitting-out of the St. Pancras international rail station to allow proper access to other rail and underground services?

 It is a delight to open the debate on the Gracious Speech this morning, and to debate industry and the environment together. Those agendas have sometimes been seen as conflicting, but it has become increasingly clear that they must advance together. Business needs to be greener, and greens need to be more business-oriented, because only through innovation and sustainable development can we ensure that society meets the major challenge of our times&#151;tackling climate change.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_32">The prerequisite for industrial success is the strong and stable economy that our country currently enjoys. Our long-term interest rates are around their lowest levels since the 1960s and we are enjoying the longest sustained growth in gross domestic product on record, the longest period of sustained low inflation for 40&nbsp;years and the highest employment levels in our history. We have narrowed the productivity gap with other leading economies in sectors such as computer, legal, technical and advertising services and we are now, for the first time in generations, as productive as Germany and have overtaken France to become the fourth largest economy in the world. With 2.2&nbsp;million more people in work since 1997, our employment rate is higher than that of any other G7&nbsp;country. We have 300,000&nbsp;more businesses than in 1997, with new companies starting at the rate of more than a thousand every day. Our science base is strong, because we have reversed decades of under-investment. In short, Britain has never worked so productively, created so much wealth and generated so many jobs as in today&#039;s enterprising and innovative economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_33">All that has not happened through serendipity. It has happened because our workers and businesses have excelled within a supportive economic framework set by this Government, including an independent Bank of England, tough fiscal rules and help for those outside the labour market through the new deal. As a result, Britain has become one of the most favourable environments for starting and growing a business.

<b>19 May 2005 : Column 284</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Minister of State, I had the pleasure of shadowing him for a while, and on several occasions, he said that the UK&#039;s opt-out from the working time directive was not negotiable?

</p>








<p><a name="st_62"><a name="50519-05_spnew1"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 It is still the case that we are determined to maintain the opt-out, and we believe that we have the best situation, because workers in this country have protection and cannot be forced to work beyond 48&nbsp;hours, but if they choose to work more hours, they should be allowed to do so. The hon. Gentleman should not tempt me to talk about MEPs. I do not know whether he has seen the letter in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> this morning headed, &quot;Please don&#039;t let me elect the new Tory leader.&quot; It is from Roger Helmer, Conservative MEP for Lutterworth in Lincolnshire. He says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;In all three major parties, the MEPs are a self-selecting and unrepresentative group.. the Tory MEPs are unrepresentative of the party&#039;s views&quot;.</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_35">As I was saying, the situation that I was describing did not come about through serendipity; but because of our businesses and workers, and because of the economic framework that we established. We have enjoyed eight years of economic prosperity, but whereas, in the past, overall material success was secured at the expense of greater equality and workplace protection, this Government have coupled industrial success with the introduction of decent civilised minimum standards for employees. Through the 1980s boom, the best-off saw decent pay rises but the poorest faced living standards that were frozen. In recent years, it is incomes at the bottom end that have grown the fastest. The Government have lifted 700,000&nbsp;children out of relative poverty and have reduced relative pensioner poverty by a quarter, showing that we have not only increased the incomes of the poorest and most vulnerable but helped them to narrow the gap with the better-off.
</p>








<p><a name="st_63"><a name="50519-05_spnew2"><b> John Bercow  (Buckingham) (Con):</b> 
 I do not dispute what the right hon. Gentleman has just said. However, may I invite him, in the name of social progress and joined-up government, to consider the alternative view? Notwithstanding what the Government have done to help people at the bottom of the scale, it remains the fact that the poorest fifth of the population are now paying in tax overall a larger share of their income than any other group. Will he have a word with his right hon. Friend the Chancellor on that point?
</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="50519-05_spnew3"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 We have taken millions of low-paid workers out of tax altogether. As a result, statistics show that the poorest paid have increased their earnings by 10&nbsp;per cent. as against 4&nbsp;per cent. at the richer end. Dealing with relative poverty is always more difficult than dealing with absolute poverty, because everyone is gaining from the prosperity of the country. Of course, tax is an element of that, which is why the working tax credit, the family tax credit and the child tax credit have been such important parts of our policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_36">In 1997,&nbsp;there was no protection for vulnerable workers from exploitative rates of pay. We introduced the national minimum wage against fierce and sustained

<br>&nbsp;<br>opposition in the House and dire warnings of impending job losses. In 1997, a father could see his child born in the evening, but be compelled to go to work the next morning. We introduced paid paternity leave for the first time for British workers. In 1997,&nbsp;a person could be sacked simply because of their sexual orientation. We introduced protection from discrimination in the workplace. In 1997,&nbsp;workers could be made to work for seven days a week every week with no paid holiday. We have given employees four weeks&#039; paid leave guaranteed, and will ensure that bank holidays are not counted against that entitlement.

</p>








<p><a name="st_66"><a name="50519-05_spnew5"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I certainly accept my hon. Friend&#039;s congratulations. The minimum wage was introduced with great deftness. The Low Pay Commission ensured that its introduction did not lead to a loss of jobs in vulnerable industries, and as a result we have been able to bring the minimum wage up to &#163;5.05&nbsp;this October and &#163;5.35&nbsp;next October. Against all the dire predictions and warnings, we ensured that the minimum wage was introduced, and we can still say that people not only have rights at work, but have work to go to where they can exercise those rights. That is a crucial element of our approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_37">We introduced the right to membership of a trade union, and equal treatment for part-time employees and those on fixed-term contracts. We have increased paid maternity leave from 18&nbsp;weeks in 1997&nbsp;to 26&nbsp;weeks, with 39&nbsp;weeks to follow in relation to the Bill announced in the Gracious Speech. We have almost doubled the rate of statutory maternity pay from &#163;60&nbsp;in 1997&nbsp;to &#163;106&nbsp;today.

<a name="50519-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_38">We have slashed the qualifying period for additional maternity leave from two years to six months, benefiting 350,000&nbsp;mothers every year.

 The Secretary of State cannot get away with his response to my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown). On the subject of skills, particularly in relation to the teaching of reading, what does the right hon.

 I was reading that soundbite only this morning. As the father of a four-and-a-half-year-old child, I am very interested in the way in which reading is taught in our schools. My point is that we did have a problem, and it is the legacy problem of adults out there who do not have even the basic level of skills that they need&#151;not through any fault of their own but because society has let them down. The entitlement to a level 2&nbsp;qualification will be an important aspect of dealing with that. I accept that, as well as considering the current generation out there, we need to ensure that future generations do not end up in the same situation.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_59">Last week began with an announcement from No. 10&nbsp;of a new Department for Productivity, Energy and Industry. That, it was said, was the strategic title, and it was created so that the new Department would be &quot;refocused and reinvigorated&quot;. We all know that language. It is authentic John Birt. It is Birt-speak. I must say that I prefer Prescott-speak. The Deputy Prime Minister puts things so much better; as he said during the general election:


</p>

<a name="50519-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_61">By the end of last week, the Secretary of State had a fiasco on his hands: nobody could take the new title of his Department seriously. The Institute of Directors described it as a circus. The Secretary of State, to his credit, announced a climbdown: it had all been a dreadful error. It ended up where all the best errors end up&#151;in the marvellous corrections column of <i>The Guardian</i> on Saturday, alongside miscellaneous misprints and mistakes.<i> The Guardian</i> carried a correction reading:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;Today&#039;s <i>Jobs & Money</i> carries a number of references to the week-old Department for Productivity, Energy and Industry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

The Department of Industry, Productivity and Energy, or DIPE? No, it could not be that.

<p>
<a name="50519-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_65">The Secretary of State says that he recognises the need for the opt-out and the danger of what the European Parliament has voted for, but if he believes that this is so dangerous, he should have been on the phone morning, noon and night to try to prevent his own Members of the European Parliament from voting to get rid of the opt-out. So, was he on the phone trying to persuade them? If not, why not? If he did try to persuade them, why on earth was he so unsuccessful? Not a single Labour MEP voted to support the Government&#039;s position of protecting the opt-out. Is it not an indication of a Government who, so soon after their election victory, are already losing their authority if they cannot get a single Labour MEP to vote for the Prime Minister&#039;s official position?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-08_para8">

The Government talk proudly&#151;we heard this again from the Secretary of State today&#151;of the macro-economic stability that our country has enjoyed since 1992, but that is not the end of the story, as surely it should be macro-economic stability with a purpose. What we need is some vision and bravery, showing what we can do to make the British economy more successful and more competitive.
</p>

<p>

Under the Conservatives, Peter had to fight for the cash to repair leaky school roofs and toilets and to get adequate textbooks for our children.

It is therefore a great pity that the subject barely featured in the election campaign.

The other took place in Government time. There was to be one in Conservative time, but the subject of that debate was changed at the last minute to one that attacked wind farms. We did not therefore have the opportunity to discuss climate change on that occasion, but I hope that the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), who has now taken over responsibility for these issues on behalf of the Conservatives, will do rather better than that in his negotiations with his colleagues on the allocation of Conservative time for debates. He is an affable chap, and well liked in House, but I understand from the press coverage that he sees a move to the environment portfolio as a chance to take his foot off the pedal a little, and that his new responsibility is not so important as the big job that he had shadowing the Treasury. I hope that that is not really his view, because consideration of climate change should not allow anyone to take their foot off the pedal. It requires the diligence and application that I know he can deliver, and I look forward to hearing his speech later in the debate.

<a name="stpa_105">Climate change was the dog that did not bark during the election campaign. One reason for that could be the media&#039;s approach, to which I have already referred. Another could be the Government&#039;s record on climate change. They regularly make all the appropriate noises, drawing attention to the need to take action, but the action itself is often not forthcoming. When it is forthcoming, it sometimes does not work very well. The Government&#039;s record on climate change, in relation to the domestic indicators that they themselves cite in support of their case, is not one of which they should be terribly proud.

We have already heard Members referring to the fact that carbon emissions have gone up since 1997, and that we are in danger of missing our Kyoto target. The Government say that we are in line to reach that target, but we are not. We are actually moving backwards in that regard and, unless the Government put in place some serious policy levers now, there is a real danger of our missing the target. The only reason that we are anywhere near it is because of what happened during the Conservative years. Before the Conservatives assume that I am praising them for their contribution, however, I should point out that there was a big cut in carbon emissions at that time because they smashed the coal industry. I do not think that carbon emissions were uppermost in their minds when that decision was followed through by successive Conservative Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry.

The Government&#039;s transport policy is equivalent to a car going down a hill with the handbrake off, and there seems to be no way of arresting that movement. We are also seeing a big growth in carbon emissions from road traffic, and road traffic is forecast to increase by up to 25&nbsp;per cent. by 2010. That is an enormous increase, and the Government seem to be adopting a &quot;predict and provide&quot; policy to accommodate it, rather than trying to arrest it. Aviation emissions are also out of control, with a projected increase of 83&nbsp;per cent. by 2020.

Steps are being taken by individual north-eastern states to shadow the EU&#039;s very sensible emissions trading policy. Schwarzenegger is making good progress. Some American states are attempting effectively to shadow Kyoto. There is a commitment in those individual states, and there is a commitment in American industry, which now recognises the opportunities for business to tackle climate change.

Allan Hubbard is living in cloud cuckoo land. He must understand that the oil price has gone up, and is unlikely to fall much, if at all.

<a name="stpa_114">Nuclear power, apparently, is an issue that will occupy us over the next 12&nbsp;months or so. Some Liberal Democrats tried to interest the House and the wider public in the issue during the 12&nbsp;months preceding the election. As the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) suggested, it might have been more honest for us to have the debate at that point. There are now a number of policies, but the Liberal Democrat policy is absolutely clear: nuclear power has no role in the future energy supply of this country, for a couple of very sound reasons.
</p>

<a name="50519-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_115">First, there is no solution to the problem of nuclear waste, which covers an enormous acreage. There is now enough nuclear waste to fill five Albert halls, and it is increasing all the time. Apparently, the DTI wants to import some to try and please the Treasury by making the nuclear bills look smaller. The Committee on Radioactive Waste Management has not yet even reported on what should happen to the waste, but we are going to have a debate on nuclear power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_116">The other reason is financial. Nuclear power is hopelessly uneconomic. We were told in the 1950s that it was too cheap to meter; we have just signed off an

Time and again, the nuclear industry has said, &quot;This is a new generation: it will be all right.&quot; Time and again, it has turned out to be horribly expensive. No private sector company will build nuclear power stations, so the only option is for the taxpayer to pay. The Liberal Democrats will not countenance that.

<a name="stpa_117">We have two policies from the Government. At least we have two from them; we have none from the Conservatives.

Others&#151;including the Prime Minister and perhaps the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, judging by his comments in the <i>Financial Times</i> the other day&#151;apparently think that nuclear power may have a role. Let me put to the Secretary of State a point that I made earlier in an intervention. If we have nuclear power, the cost will be so enormous that the taxpayer will have to pick up the bill. That will choke off funds for renewables and energy efficiency, which are far more desirable for the delivery of our energy mix. I hope that the Secretary of State will not be hoodwinked by people in his Department, many of whom seem to be very keen on nuclear power without much basis for being so.

If we are to build up stocks of nuclear waste which, in some instances, will last for thousands of years, that test will clearly not be met. For 10&nbsp;years, Nirex has been trying to find a repository, or some other way of dealing with nuclear waste. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) ruled out one possible answer when he was Secretary of State for the Environment, and no progress has been made in the 10&nbsp;years since then.

<a name="stpa_118">Let us consider some of the alternatives. Energy efficiency is a poor relation of energy policy in this country&#151;partly, I suspect, because responsibilities have been split between the DTI and DEFRA. DEFRA has been trying to stop the production of energy, while the DTI has been happy to produce as much as the market wants in a gung-ho way. That division of departmental responsibilities is unhelpful, and I think it is one of the reasons why energy efficiency has not been given the attention that it deserves.

<a name="stpa_119">It is perfectly possible to cut energy consumption by 1&nbsp;per cent. per year over the next 30&nbsp;years without doing any damage to industry. According to evidence from BP and other companies, investing in energy efficiency means ending up with bigger bottom-line profits.

Wind power is not, of course, the only renewable energy source; we need a mix including tidal power, wave power and micro-generation. It is, however, an important element, and is first in line when it comes to what can be achieved quickly.

<a name="stpa_122">As well as looking at renewable energy, of which there are many variations, we need to look at clean coal technology and to identify its potential benefits. By retrofitting our power stations, it is possible to cut carbon emissions by up to 12&nbsp;or 15&nbsp;per cent. That will not be without a cost but it should not be forgotten that we can clean up coal to some extent. New coal-fired power stations are coming on stream in China and everywhere else. One of the best things we can do is develop technology to reduce carbon emissions from those sources. If we do that, that will contribute far more to tackling climate change than a couple of windmills here and there. We should not, therefore, ignore the role of coal globally and, for indigenous reasons, in this country. There is the potential to clean up coal and that possibility should not be neglected.

Friend should never allow the country to become dependent on a single source. That is the risk that we run with today&#039;s policies. Security of both supply and price are at risk if we become over-reliant on imported gas. We should start with the premise that there needs to be several sources&#151;we need a genuine mixed and balanced policy. The pricing mechanism needs to be much more sophisticated to avoid moves such as are occurring today, for example buying in the cheapest fuel, which happens to be gas at the moment. If we carry on in that way it will mortgage our future and leave us with too little room for manoeuvre. I have come to the conclusion that because we need to protect a genuinely balanced policy and because of the loss of capacity from the closure of the early phase of nuclear power stations, part of the solution lies in new nuclear build. At the same time, much more needs to be done with wind and solar technologies. They are not mutually exclusive&#151;we need to promote all those technologies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_134">I realise that this is not a five-minute solution. It is by no means easy to take that proposition through this House and all its processes, and to engage in rational debates about it with the public. However, the technology has improved massively and waste issues are hugely lower than in earlier generations of nuclear build. Moreover, it is now possible, with the right leadership from Government&#151;I am not talking about the Chancellor with his cheque book&#151;to put together a financial consortium that would back new nuclear build. That needs to be explored as part of a move towards a balanced policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_135">In conclusion, the DTI has done remarkably well on a whole host of matters. In our manifesto we have committed ourselves to continuing to work towards the improvement of working conditions while keeping an eye on the need to increase productivity and be more competitive. Those are key roles. The leadership role that the Department provides in that respect is mission critical to the success of our country. It needs to be supported by a long-term vision about the way in which science and technology will help to address some of the problems facing us. That science and technology will also provide the basis for successful business and industry here in the future.

 I am delighted to follow the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) because he and I represent constituencies in the same county. I am not sure whether he is aware that for a time I was associated with a major employer in his constituency, known then as the Bridgewater Paper Co. As a past non-executive director of that company&#151;fully declared in the Register of Members&#039; Interests&#151;I know that the company played its full part in the green agenda. It extracted water from the local river and returned it to the watercourse a lot cleaner. In addition, it had a magnificent, but very expensive, combined heat and power system to generate the electricity that it required. It was highly efficient and, again, very much part of the green economy.

<a name="stpa_136">I am sorry that the hon. Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) has left her place because I intended to pay tribute to her maiden speech. She painted an attractive picture of Burnley and its immediate environment. Knowing the town and the area well, I agree that it is a lovely area in many ways. I also know it because historically I have taken a huge interest in the textile and clothing industry. That area of Lancashire has been involved over hundreds of years in the production of textiles and clothing.

<a name="stpa_137">I wish to pay tribute to the hon. Lady&#039;s immediate predecessor, Peter Pike, with whom I worked closely in this place over a number of years. He and I served on the Modernisation Committee and he left that Committee only when he left the House at the end of the last Parliament. We shall watch with interest to see whether the new Leader of the House will reappoint that Committee or take my advice and merge the Modernisation Committee with the Procedure Committee, which I had the privilege of chairing during the past two Parliaments. I am not looking to him to do that and appoint me&#151;or, indeed, for the Committee to appoint me&#151;as Chairman; I just believe that there is a great deal of common ground between the two Committees. They cross over in many areas and they trespass into each other&#039;s preserves, and I believe that it would be better to have a Back-Bench Member chairing that Committee. Having a Cabinet Minister as Chairman undermines the independence and integrity of a House Committee. It is the only Select Committee that is chaired by a Cabinet Minister.

<a name="50519-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_138">Although she is no longer here, may I say to the hon. Member for Burnley that I was privileged to serve in the House with her predecessor&#039;s predecessor, Dan Jones, who was a truly magnificent man. He was a coal miner who never lost his roots, but took to this place and represented Burnley with huge distinction. He and I worked together on textiles, mainly. I remember going to British Home Stores to see some of the leading executives of that company to persuade them that because it was called British Home Stores they should stock and sell more goods that had some connection with Great Britain and the United Kingdom as a whole. He was a fearless campaigner, and Burnley in both Dan Jones and Peter Pike had two magnificent representatives.

<a name="stpa_139">In the House, we frequently hear one of the Chancellor&#039;s boasts about his management of the economy&#151;that the economy has experienced 50&nbsp;quarters of consecutive growth. I admit from the Opposition Benches that that is true, but the Chancellor does not tell us that 20&nbsp;of those quarters&#151;from the third quarter of 1992&nbsp;to the second quarter of 1997&#151;were under a Conservative Government and Prime Minister John Major, when the economy was performing extremely well. I know that my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Michael Jack), who is sitting close to me, was well aware as a Treasury Minister of the success of our Chancellor at that time and of the Conservative Government.

<a name="stpa_141">I want to touch on matters relating to MG Rover. Labour&#039;s recently acquired reputation for sound economic management has withstood news&#151;we know this, having come through a general election&#151;which in another period of our history would have seriously damaged the governing party. Even before the MG Rover job losses are taken into account&#151;in the 1960s and 1970s this would have been an unthinkable calamity&#151;1&nbsp;million manufacturing jobs have been lost under this Labour Government since 1997. While overall unemployment has fallen over much of the Government&#039;s term of office, it is now sadly&#151;I say this with deep regret&#151;rising again. It rose some 29,000&nbsp;in March this year to reach 1.43&nbsp;million. That figure&#151;I say this to my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), whom I congratulate on his new role&#151;would be much higher still had it not been for the creation of 583,000&nbsp;public sector jobs by the Government since 1997. Some 146,000&nbsp;of those were created in the last year alone. I welcome the fact that people are in work, but although those jobs have kept people from the dole queue, they are what I describe as unproductive jobs. That is not to cast aspersions on the ability of those who hold those jobs. The Centre for Policy Studies calculates that, in the year to the first quarter of 2004, productivity in the economy as a whole grew by 1.2&nbsp;per cent., yet in the public sector it shrank by 1.3&nbsp;per cent. That draws attention to the true state of the economy.

<p>
<a name="50519-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_142">My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset held the important portfolio of shadow Chancellor leading up to and during the election campaign. I regret that more time was not devoted during that campaign to the economy, employment, pensions, taxation and the impact of the European Union on the economy. I believe that the non-jobs being created by the Government have been doubly damaging. They add to the taxation burden and at the same time create scarcity in more important sectors of the job market, making it harder for the wealth-creating sector to recruit. That is important. While I welcome many of the improvements that have been made in employment, the Government should give more attention to the impact that such measures have on the competitiveness of United Kingdom industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_143">Much was said by the Secretary of State in his opening speech about the improvements provided for those in employment. It reminds me that tomorrow I am due to attend a celebration with a company in my constituency called Complete Medical Communications, which has been given a work-life balance award&#151;something for which I know the Government will take credit. The company provides its employees with greater flexibility in balancing their lives and their work. Of course, many companies manage to do that, but many small companies would find it extremely difficult.

<a name="stpa_144">I wish to look briefly at the trade figures. In 2004, according to the impeccable Office for National Statistics, our country imported &#163;58&nbsp;billion-worth of goods: more than it exported. If we take account of invisibles&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset, in his history and pedigree, contributed to invisibles in his work in the City&#151;such as banking and financial services, the figures are little better. We have a net deficit of &#163;39&nbsp;billion compared with a small surplus that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer inherited from the Conservative Administration in 1997.

<p>
<a name="50519-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_145">To paraphrase an article that I read in <i>The</i> <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> at the beginning of the election campaign, in 1970&nbsp;Harold Wilson&#039;s unexpected defeat was partially put down to one month&#039;s bad trading figures, which the Government blamed, believe it or not, on the purchase of two jumbo jets by British Airways&#151;yet last year&#039;s far more dramatic trade deficit was hardly reported outside the business pages and technical business press.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_146">I find that extraordinary, and I ask my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset why the matter was not discussed at much greater length during the general election campaign. The governing Labour party, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor are extremely vulnerable. As the months pass us by, we shall see much more evidence of what I am talking about now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_147">Bad trade figures, of course, are not so urgent in 2005&nbsp;as they were in the 1970s, when memories of the 1967&nbsp;devaluation were still fresh in the mind and there were worries about a run on the pound. They are indicative, however, of the general direction of Labour&#039;s economic policy. In 1997, Gordon Brown inherited a strong economy in which growth was export-led, but in the subsequent eight years he has turned our economy into one driven by Government borrowing and consumer debt, which is sucking in imports and burdening industry with taxes to pay the wages of those in the public sector&#151;

<a name="stpa_149">Before I finish, I want to emphasise the important role of manufacturing industry. I said earlier that I would refer briefly to the problems of MG Rover, which broke out just as the country went into the general election campaign. I am deeply worried, as are Members on both sides of the House, that a group of four people who inherited and took over huge industrial capital assets 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 313</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>could end up so remarkably wealthy, when many thousands of people in the west midlands ended up without a job. There is something fundamentally wrong with our system when failure can result in the people who created it walking away with a huge package of money and assets, while those who have actually created the wealth and been part of an important manufacturing sector of the UK have lost their jobs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_150">I am pleased to hear that the economy is, as the Government state, doing so well and that businesses will seek to employ some of those who lost their jobs in the MG Rover plant at Longbridge. However, will the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs tell us in her reply what action the Government will take against those who were responsible for bringing about the collapse of that plant, particularly as they have walked away from this sad saga with millions of pounds? If we are to believe in capitalism, as I do, it must be an acceptable form of capitalism whereby profits are shared not only by those who take executive decisions, but by those who do the work on the shop floor to produce the goods that the country needs. I believe that the Government have a duty to do so and I hope that the Secretary of State will deal with the sad circumstances of MG Rover. I must say, as a long-serving Member, that I am surprised that those problems did not feature more strongly in the election campaign.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_151">It is important to view the subject in a wider context. Many people work hard to generate wealth, but if a company fails, perhaps through bad management or bad executive decisions, those at the top often walk away with huge packages totalling more than the average working man and woman in this country earn in a lifetime, while those who hew the coal at the coal face walk away with very little. Increasingly, people are beginning to have doubts about the effectiveness of capitalism. As I said, I am a Conservative who believes in the generation of wealth, but I want it to be fairly distributed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_152">Before I finish, I want to raise another subject that is relevant to industry. So many people in private industry are finding that the purchasing power of their pension is being dramatically reduced. Part of the reason for that&#151;I hope that the Government will be prepared to admit their responsibility&#151;is the way in which the pension funds were depleted in 1997, and have continued to be so to the tune of more than &#163;5&nbsp;billion a year. In eight years, more than &#163;40&nbsp;billion has been removed from this country&#039;s pension funds&#151;a situation exacerbated by the fall in the stock market. Tens of thousands of people throughout the country are now looking forward to a much less prosperous retirement than would otherwise have been the case. Will there be any meaningful move to try to help those people? Will the Government introduce measures to provide meaningful, real incentives for people to save for their retirement and to prevent companies from abusing their pension funds, often to assist their cash-flow problems?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_153">As the Secretary of State knows, just over the border in Derbyshire, Ferodo faces a crisis over pension provision. I have constituents who work there and they raised the matter with me. I believe that the success of industry is essential to the success of pensions, but we should not allow people to be deprived of the pension 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>for which they have saved for so many years of their working lives to ensure that they retire with a decent standard of life.

But at its heart is the question of economic stability and the need to entrench it while also promoting long-term growth and prosperity. That was where the Queen&#039;s Speech started.

However, Toyota is a car company that is doing well and expanding. Indeed, anyone who wants to know about productivity should go and look at the Toyota production line and observe the steps that the staff take to cut an extra hundredth of a second off the production process and the teamwork at the plant that has led to some of its success.

We need to ensure that the initiatives we take and the support we provide are clearly focused to make the most of them. Industrialists still sometimes perceive that we have a plethora of business support initiatives at regional and sub-regional level. I know that efforts have been made to streamline that support, but we need to ensure that our initiatives are easily understood and that business people know about them, because that is not always the case. Confusion still exists about the roles of different bodies. The structure might seem clear to us when we set it up, but it is not necessarily always clear to those seeking to access support whether they should go to Business Link, the manufacturing advisory service, the regional development agency or another body. It is not always clear what the learning and skills councils do and what the sector skills councils do.

The skills and training that we provide must be genuinely linked to the industrial needs of our manufacturing businesses. For example, in our textiles industry we have wonderful young designers, but they have problems bringing their ideas to market. But we need the structures to provide people with skills in technical textiles manufacturing, which has amazing potential, including bandages that mend wounds, protective clothing and items used in the construction industry. Technical textiles have so many potential uses, but we must provide the courses to enable people to improve their skills in that area, rather than just the fashion end of the market.

<a name="stpa_169">I was interested by the sudden spewing out of articles on nuclear energy since the election. It is clear that we must have a debate about where we are going and that obviously involves both Departments represented in the Chamber today. We need to consider how to maintain sustainable energy sources. We must deal with the climate change problem and ensure that we have secure and affordable energy supplies. That will clearly be a major debate in the months to come.

I shall not go through the arguments again but we need to do much more. Indeed, I am looking forward to meeting a retired farmer in my constituency who is completely into biofuels and will show us the wonderful plants that we should be using to develop energy sources. I am looking forward to my house being fuelled by such energy. There is great enthusiasm about those ideas, but I am still unclear about whether, even if we concentrate on all those things, there will still be an energy gap.

I hope that the argument that somehow there is a huge energy gap that cannot be covered without a new generation of nuclear power stations is not put in aspic so that, by default, that is felt to be inevitable, although I feel that some people may be trying to portray the situation in that way. We need a major debate on the economics of nuclear power and about who pays the price.

I hope that the Secretary of State in whose Department she resides will give her complete support in dealing with the difficult job of putting pressure on every Department to take on board equalities and gender equality issues. That is the most difficult part of her job and she will need complete support from Cabinet Ministers to press that agenda. I realise that her job may be even more difficult because she reports to one Secretary of State on gender and another on the overall equalities agenda. That is ironic given that the equalities Bill, which I very much welcome, will bring together equality and human rights, and, at last, put a positive duty on public authorities to promote gender equality. A recent report from the DTI on the income gap between men and women shows how such matters range across Departments&#151;pensions, tax credits, pay and so on; none can be dealt with in isolation. On behalf of my hon.

Like many other constituencies across the country, Wimbledon has experienced a huge increase in the number of applicants for phone masts over the past few years. I recognise the need to balance the ever-increasing demands of users against local residents&#039; concerns, rational health concerns against the &quot;phone fried my brain&quot; health scares, and over-expansion against nimbyism. However, the simple fact is that the siting of phone masts near homes, schools and hospitals, the health effects, and particularly concentrations of masts should be matters for proper consideration. The old telephone exchange on the Ridgway in my constituency already has 10&nbsp;different masts and equipment boxes on its roof. There are three outstanding applications, each of which is for six more multiple masts. There is a high incidence of cancer in local areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_187">Local residents and I have campaigned to oppose that concentration and the visual intrusion, but to no avail. Local residents feel powerless and the local authority hides behind Government legislation that does not allow it to adjudicate many applications, so it waves through planning applications on the basis of prior approval without allowing the discussion of opposition on the grounds of health. We need to have a debate on the health concerns, including the impact of proximity and concentration and the most recent studies of Professor Henshall. We need to ensure that all phone mast developments are subject to full planning permission. Councils should be allowed to take on board health concerns and visual amenity. I trust that this House will have time to debate that at some stage during this Parliament.

<br>&nbsp;<br>new Bills, does not do well in that regard. There can be few Members who, when campaigning, did not meet small business people who told us about the problems that they were facing with over-regulation. In Wimbledon, I was particularly struck by the number of such people in the construction industry. One gentleman, an electrician, showed me all the forms and ID that needed to be supplied for him to get on to a site, and told me that he is unable to compete with electricians from some of the newly acceded EU countries. He was but one of many. While one could say that that is only anecdotal evidence, one should not forget that the director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce recently said that it is fed up with the spiralling costs of regulation and estimates that overall regulation has cost &#163;40&nbsp;billion since 1997. If the Government are truly about to set about reducing the cost of regulation, we will support them. However, if we see a set of targets to reduce targets and regulation, and more administrators and regulators to reduce regulation, I am sure that there will be ironic smiles and laughter from Conservative Members and we will know that yet again the legislation will not work. For any legislation to be effective it must transform regulatory impact assessments, repeal some of the specific business regulation and grant some exemptions to small businesses.

The existence of climate change is still a subject for debate in America, even though our chief scientist, Sir David King, told the Select Committee that carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions are at record levels. We know the facts of the matter, so measures to reduce greenhouse gas production make sense, both in terms of the precautionary principle and of simple politics in respect of the world and of energy. I cannot understand why the US refuses to put technological emphasis on reducing its dependence on hydrocarbon fuels, as that would relieve its dependence for fuel on some of the most politically unstable countries of the world&#151;a dependence that stems from the current slowdown in the world economy.

For example, whatever the overall performance in reducing carbon dioxide emissions since 1997, the amount of those emissions arising from the transport sector has been rising. It is a source of great sadness that the UK has no coherent policy to deal with the problem.

For some time, his Department has been advocating the establishment of a UK biofuels industry, and it has produced a nice coloured brochure entitled &quot;The Facts on Biodiesel and Bioethanol&quot;.

<a name="stpa_212">The UK is a signatory to the European directive that requires us to achieve a biofuels inclusion rate of 2.75&nbsp;per cent. by 2005, rising to more than 5&nbsp;per cent. by 2010. If we cannot achieve that, we are required to say why. DEFRA subscribes to our having an indigenous biofuels industry, but we have no industry producing bioethanol&#151;the green element included in petrol&#151;and the Queen&#039;s Speech contained nothing to suggest that the Government intended to accelerate the process. All we have is a British Sugar planning application for a plant that would produce 55,000&nbsp;tonnes of bioethanol a year.

<p><a name="st_131"><a name="50519-16_spnew2"><b> Michael Jack: </b> 
 I was about to come to that. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the EU-Mercosur regional trade agreement gives Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay a bioethanol tariff quota of 1&nbsp;billion litres, at generous rates. Perhaps that gives us the answer to the question of why the Government are not supporting a UK bioethanol industry enthusiastically. They have surrendered the supply of that commodity to Brazilian interests.

<a name="50519-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_213">I woke up this morning to the news that an area the size of Belgium in the Brazilian rain forest has been destroyed in the past 12&nbsp;months, which brings me back to the UK&#039;s G8&nbsp;presidency and our environmental credentials. If we are serious about saving the world&#039;s environment and biodiversity, and about encouraging sustainability, we should address the problem of Brazilian rainforest degradation&#151;a matter that has been raised in every one of the 18&nbsp;years for which I have been a Member of this House. However, the international community appears powerless to stop the loss of the fantastic biodiversity resource that the world&#039;s rainforests represent. The latest finding from Brazil is just another example of that. If the G8&nbsp;is to show its environment credentials, it must address that problem.

<a name="stpa_214">To achieve a 2.75&nbsp;per cent. inclusion rate in bioethanol, our bioethanol production target is 660,000&nbsp;tonnes, and a rate of 5&nbsp;per cent. would require us to produce 1.2&nbsp;million tonnes. The East of England Development Agency has conjectured that a UK bioethanol industry could create 12,000&nbsp;new jobs.

On adding up all the projected production of biodiesel in this country&#151;be it from UK-grown oilseed rape, or from the recycling of cooking oils or other fats&#151;our potential production is 478,000&nbsp;tonnes, which is about half the amount that we need to produce to meet our 5&nbsp;per cent. inclusion target.

<a name="stpa_216">I say in all sincerity to the Under-Secretary that if this Government are serious about the CO <sub>2</sub>  reduction capabilities of a biofuels industry, his Department has got to be a much more effective champion of it within government, to ensure that it actually starts. It is no use falling back on the lame-duck excuse that if we are too generous with our duty derogation, that will somehow suck in imports. As I have said, the EU-Mercosur agreement makes it absolutely clear from where the European Union currently thinks that its biofuels will come, in the absence of an indigenous industry.

<a name="stpa_217">Given the fundamental changes to UK agriculture with the advent of the single farm payment, and given that land will now be available that can produce these fuels without in any way compromising the new agricultural regime, the time is now right for the United Kingdom to have its own biofuels industry, in order to help contribute to a reduction in CO <sub>2</sub> per cent. reduction in CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions.

Given the decline in nuclear capacity from some 20&nbsp;per cent. to 7&nbsp;per cent. on a similar time scale, all that we are doing is using every 1&nbsp;per cent. of renewables to replace 1&nbsp;per cent. of CO <sub>2</sub>  &#151; free nuclear power generation. However, such power generation is already being eliminated through the phasing out of the Magnox stations and the advanced gas-cooled reactors.

They must recognise that we already have a portfolio of energy sources that cost different amounts, recognise that the renewables option is expensive and survives only by virtue of the renewables obligation certificates through which renewables get the &quot;necessary&quot; subsidy, and recognise that we do need a new generation of nuclear power stations. Finally, Corwm should pull its finger out and get on with identifying the long-term deep depository that we need to deal with not just nuclear waste generated by the nuclear electricity industry, but with the stockpile of material in Sellafield. Once that issue is attended to&#151;it has been done in Finland and in other countries&#151;we can have an affordable future for nuclear power. I remind those colleagues who have criticised the economics involved that the advanced gas-cooled reactor industry already has to make its own provision for the decommissioning of fuel and, eventually, of those stations.

Members may wonder why on earth I am getting hot under the collar about the future of our military aerospace industry, but the answer is very simple. When we come to the end of the current Eurofighter production run&#151;be it tranche 2&nbsp;or tranche 3&#151;and we start manufacturing the American-designed joint strike fighter, to which the Americans hold all the technology keys, we will have nothing left.

It was BAE Systems North America that had produced this vehicle, as part of an American contract. Could the people in north America talk to the United Kingdom about it? No, because of the technology transfer barriers. So one of Britain&#039;s biggest manufacturing companies faces the dilemma of deciding where to invest in future. We are seeing major investment in north America and continuing investment in the United Kingdom, but against the background of an uncertain future.

 I am grateful, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to make my maiden speech today, and I congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) and for Llanelli (Nia Griffith), and the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond), on making theirs.
</p>

<a name="50519-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_226">It is an honour to represent the people of South Swindon and to follow in the footsteps of Julia Drown, who was the first woman to represent the seat. Julia will be a hard act to follow. She was much loved in Swindon and there was genuine sadness when she announced her retirement from this House. Julia&#039;s legacy can be seen throughout the constituency, most markedly in improvements to the national health service. In her maiden speech, she called for a new hospital to replace the crumbling Princess Margaret hospital. Both she and my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills) worked tirelessly to achieve that, and the Great Western was opened in 2002.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_227">In her maiden speech, Julia cited the urology waiting list in 1997. It was already 18&nbsp;months long and only emergency cases were being treated. Today, under Labour, 98&nbsp;per cent. of urology patients in Swindon wait six months or less for treatment and the Great Western hospital is on target to make that 100&nbsp;per cent. by Christmas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_228">In addition to her interest in the NHS, Julia was a passionate advocate of international development. She was the co-chair of the all-party group on heavily indebted poor countries and a leader in bringing international development issues to the fore. In particular, she helped to secure a timetable for spending 0.7&nbsp;per cent. of national income on international aid. I can assure my constituents that I will push for a continued spotlight on international development issues and am pleased that the Government have already signalled that in the Queen&#039;s Speech. Julia set high standards, and I will do my best to follow her.

<a name="stpa_229">Swindon has its roots in the railways and there remains a strong manufacturing base in the town.

<br>&nbsp;<br>problem of people on long-term incapacity benefit. I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has pledged to help those trapped on that benefit, but our major challenge in Swindon lies in improving the skills base of our work force so that we remain an attractive place for international companies to locate and a dynamic place for small business to flourish.
</p>

<a name="50519-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_230">I grew up in a new town, similar to Swindon, and lived in a council house until I was 25. I was the first girl in my family to go on to higher education. Education provided me with expanded horizons and my parents gave me the determination to prove that I was just as good as those born in better circumstances. That determination has seen me elected to this House despite many setbacks. Education is my passion, and while I congratulate Swindon&#039;s local education authority on its recent good inspection, I am dismayed that it is thinking of closing local schools such as Salt Way, Windmill Hill, Freshbrook and Toothill. They are all good neighbourhood schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_231">Swindon has an historically low education funding base and I want to look into that. I urge the Government to look at the pockets of deprivation that exist among areas of wealth. Averaging out tends to disguise deprivation, which is then much more difficult to tackle without adequate resources. Our investment is making a real difference to the life chances of Swindon&#039;s children. However, staying-on rates at 16&nbsp;and 18&nbsp;are below the national average, and if Swindon is to remain and grow as an attractive place for successful companies, it is vital that that is rectified.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_232">That brings me to one the most exciting yet problematic issues facing Swindon. We have the opportunity to expand the university of Bath in Swindon to include faculties of medicine, arts and manufacturing. That would undoubtedly provide schools, colleges and industry with a focus to improve the skills base in the town as well as develop an international learning base for industry. I would go so far as to say that it is vital to the continued success of Swindon that the university comes to us. The problem lies with its chosen site, which is on greenfield land next to Coate water, our much-loved, beautiful country park. Some 17,000&nbsp;people have signed a petition to stop Coate being developed as the university plans include four faculties, a campus, 2,000&nbsp;houses and a business park. I now truly understand the meaning of the phrase &quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot;. I am seeking a third way and will do my best to work with all the parties involved to try to reach a viable solution.

<a name="stpa_233">South Swindon is a constituency of great contrasts. It contains areas of outstanding natural beauty, such as the villages of Wroughton and Chiselden and a section of the Ridgeway. We have a second world war airfield at Wroughton, which now houses the science museum&#039;s national collection. I look forward to supporting its ambitious plans to create a science park on the site.

<a name="50519-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_234">My constituency also includes the original railway village built during the great railway expansion of the early 19th century. That contrasts with the housing estates built in the next expansion of Swindon in the mid to late 20th century, many of them providing affordable rented housing for London overspill families.

<a name="stpa_235">I am concerned that Swindonians who seek help with debt owe an average of &#163;35,000, before mortgage debt. Many are young women with children who have been abandoned by their partners and are left to sort out the debt on their own. That cannot continue, and we are right to emphasise the responsibilities of credit companies as well as those of the individual.

<a name="50519-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_236">Crime and antisocial behaviour are issues that local police, neighbourhood watch groups and other constituents will not tolerate, and I firmly share that view. The new police community support officers in Swindon will help, and, thanks to the Government, Swindon now has an antisocial behaviour hotline. Fifteen ASBOs have been issued in the past five years and we have seen a 5&nbsp;per cent. drop in overall crime. However, it remains a concern for my constituents, and I pledge to work hard to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour in Swindon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_237">The street scene and built environment are hugely important. Swindon&#039;s town centre is a poor example of 1960&#039;s architecture.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_238">I move on to another architecturally exciting British innovation&#151;the roundabout. If Wimbledon is home to the Wombles, South Swindon is the land of the magic roundabout&#151;a central roundabout surrounded by five satellite roundabouts. Swindonians nonchalantly negotiate the magic roundabout, whizzing clockwise round the outer circles and anti-clockwise round the central circle. A community that can do that without inflicting major harm on itself is capable of almost anything.

<a name="50519-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_239">There is one conundrum in Swindon: it is a town and a people with much to be proud of&#151;great community spirit, hard working and innovative, and home to some of our best national and international companies. It is a great place to live, yet Swindon has received a bad press over the years. I am calling time on that. Swindon has the potential to be a world-class community, and I shall be there as its cheerleader.

My overall verdict on the Government programme is that it shows alarming signs of hyperactivity, which is as wearing in a Government as it is in a small child. Forty-five Bills and five draft Bills are all to be put through the House by autumn next year. Given the parliamentary timetable, which, I observed during business questions, has been reduced again as we are having a longer summer holiday than we expected, there will probably be fewer than 40&nbsp;weeks in which to discuss those 50&nbsp;Bills. Are we likely to legislate well or wisely in those conditions? Of course not.

First, can we meet our long-term emissions commitments without a new generation of nuclear stations? Clearly, the evidence can be used either way, but it seems to me that the answer to that question is probably not. Secondly, can we afford to build nuclear plants if we include the costs of waste?

On that, it seems to me that this country&#039;s time scale for going from the idea of building a nuclear power station in a particular area to the point at which that station might come on stream and start to generate electricity is ridiculously long. Broadly speaking, we assume that it takes 15&nbsp;years from start to finish. If we started building some stations tomorrow, they would not be on stream in time to avoid the stresses and strains on electricity generation that we will face in the next decade, especially if we are to meet our long-term commitments. However, we know that we will not start building any new ones tomorrow, because we have taken so long to take the decision in principle.

 Before the hon. Gentleman leaves nuclear power, may I ask him about the economics?

The claim is that we need more house building and that the Government have accepted the Barker analysis that there is a long-term undersupply of housing. All the evidence points against that analysis. The average number of people per household continues to fall and the average space that people have in their homes is increasing. Overcrowding is declining and there are more homes than households. There is a surplus of some 670,000&nbsp;houses in this country. It seems perverse to say that the answer is to build more and more houses when the thick end of 750,000&nbsp;houses is empty. It appears obvious that demand factors, not the supply of housing, cause the stresses and strains on house prices. Trying to build our way out of the so-called housing crisis in the south-east of England will not solve the crisis but create&#151;and is creating&#151;a new environmental crisis. Any good work that might be done by the new agency&#151;I wish it and the Ministers who will support it all the best&#151;will be outweighed by other Government policies that are higher in the hierarchy of importance and cause great damage.

It will impose huge costs on individuals and taxpayers, restrict personal freedom and prove ineffective in the fight against terrorism and benefit fraud.

 I should like to start by welcoming the maiden speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Burnley (Kitty Ussher), for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) and for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove), and of the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond). I particularly want to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley for giving me an insight into a procedure that I had not realised existed. She told me that her impending maternity, and the pact that she had made with the Speaker, had enabled her to speak early in the debate. I now realise just where I have been going wrong in my four years in the House. My hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon mentioned roundabouts and circumlocution. Some years ago I stayed in Swindon. When trying to find my hotel, I experienced just what she was talking about today, so her words had particular resonance for me. I want to thank all those hon. Members because they clearly demonstrated the passion that they feel for the areas that they represent, and the dedication and commitment that they will display in the House when representing those constituencies.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_270">West Bromwich, West is a heartland manufacturing constituency. Manufacturing industry still accounts for 30&nbsp;per cent. of local employment there. It is also the constituency with the largest number of foundries. If ever an industry was symptomatic of traditional British industry, it is the foundry industry. Partly for that reason, I am the secretary of the parliamentary all-party group on cast metal.

<a name="stpa_271">The collapse of Rover has had an impact on my constituency. I do not want to rehearse the many arguments about that issue, but I want to make two points. Devastating though the collapse of Rover has been in some areas&#151;my constituency is affected mainly in terms of the supply chain, rather than of people there being employed by the company, although there are some who were&#151;that devastation would have been even greater had it taken place five years ago, before the supply companies had had the chance to diversify and refine their procedures in the way in which they have now done. I therefore pay tribute to the Department of Trade and Industry for the role that it has played in sustaining Rover for those five years. I am sorry that, in the end, it could be sustained no longer, but local employees attach no blame to the Government because they recognise the effort that the DTI made to keep Rover thriving and successful in the west midlands.

<a name="50519-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_272">I have heard a lot of doom and gloom about manufacturing. The explanation put forward by the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) was that the tide of regulation was to blame for the decline in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 338</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>manufacturing in this country. I would be the first to say that there is an issue about regulation, and I shall talk about that in a moment. However, to single out regulation without referring to any other pressures is a distortion of industrial reality. The doubling of oil prices has hit industry, as have the soaring raw material prices that have resulted partly from the huge acceleration in the economies of China and India. Another factor is the competition from low-wage European and other companies that are increasingly taking on the lower-skilled industries here. Those factors are having a far more significant impact on British industry than regulation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_273">It is a tribute to the Government and their macro-economic policy, and the low interest rates and benign local economic environment that they have sustained, that manufacturing industry is surviving despite all the difficult international economic pressures. We can only speculate on what would have happened if manufacturing industry, having been confronted with the situation that arose under the Conservative Government 13&nbsp;or 14&nbsp;years ago, with interest rates at 10 and 15&nbsp;per cent., had also faced the combination of international economic circumstances that it faces now. We would have experienced economic Armageddon: that, I think, goes without saying. It is indeed a tribute to the Government&#039;s management of the economy that notwithstanding those difficult international economic circumstances, they have managed to sustain employment and output. Our economy is seen by the rest of Europe as the most successful in western Europe and the G8. Thirteen or 14&nbsp;years ago, we were regarded as the sick man of Europe in the context of a far more benign international economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_274">The gloomy remarks about manufacturing are not reflected locally. My constant dialogue with the foundry industry has informed me that the industry is doing better, is more optimistic and has better prospects than has been the case for nearly a decade. Only a couple of years ago it was confronted with soaring scrap metal prices, a dearth of coke supply and a rise in other raw material costs. Those pressures have now been alleviated, partly as a result of the DTI&#039;s work through Europe and the World Trade Organisation in negotiating with China, which is now releasing more coke on to the market. The deceleration in the Chinese economy over the past year has taken some of the pressures from raw material prices, as well. Industrial prospects are much better locally, partly because of those developments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_275">All the evidence suggests that where foundries are moving into specialist niche markets requiring higher skills, they are surviving. In the past year, Hitachi Metals has opened the first new foundry in this country&#151;in my constituency&#151;for some years, producing high quality, environmentally friendly car exhaust systems. That is an interesting example of what can result from good investment and environmentally friendly quality techniques allied to traditional industry. We can survive, and I am confident that in my industry we will. Let me also make a general point. If foundries in my constituency are producing castings, other manufacturers must be using those castings and must be confident that their prospects justify the placing of orders. So it is not all doom and gloom.

<a name="stpa_276">I must, however, mention an issue that has arisen in my constituency in the last few weeks&#151;partly because of the Rover situation, but partly because of a company that I can only describe as a rogue employer. RDS Automotive Ltd. and RDS Automotive Interiors Ltd. supply both Rover and Jaguar. They knew that they would be in some difficulty when Rover closed and they embarked on redundancy negotiations with the employees. However, they said, and it was accepted, that they still had secure markets with Jaguar and that they would continue.

Workers were informed that some would receive no redundancy pay and some would not even get paid for the work that they had done. On 5&nbsp;May, another company, RDS Advanse Ltd. from the same group, bought that company, so a company that went into administration was bought by another in the same group, laid off workers and did not pay them. It is now recruiting other workers, starting with a clean balance sheet. It has not met any of its obligations.

<a name="stpa_278">I flag that up as an issue that the Government must confront in their company law and insolvency policy. I will lobby the Government and the DTI to take action on that matter. It is wholly unacceptable in this day and age that a group of employers and directors should close a company, absolve themselves of all their responsibilities, commitments and obligations to their employees, and try to start afresh with a different work force. It is an important issue that I will take up with the Government.

<a name="50519-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_279">Local employers mention that regulation needs to be addressed by the Government. I welcome the Secretary of State&#039;s comments on the matter. The prime concern is that there is not sufficient consultation before the implementation of some of the European regulations. It is not always done badly&#151;one of the good examples that I have had quoted to me was the introduction of the aggregates levy, where there was consultation and the industry felt that the outcome was satisfactory. There is particular concern in the metals industry about European legislation that is known as REACH: the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals regulations. That was a specific issue with the chemical industry. My understanding is that in the discussions and negotiations between the industry and the Government, a more or less satisfactory position was reached. What was not appreciated was that the regulations could have an impact on the metals industry. There is concern that European legislation that was designed just for the chemical industry could have an impact on the metals and foundry industry. I ask the DTI to carry out a thorough consultative exercise to ensure that the European legislation is proportionate to the problem and that it reflects the difficulty that it may create for that industry.

<a name="stpa_280">I wish to talk about another aspect of the Queen&#039;s Speech. It was mentioned in the background note: the so-called compensation culture. I welcome the comments on the need to address that matter. Although I am as committed as anyone to supporting good health and safety legislation, there are concerns in industry about the increasing use of frivolous and potentially expensive claims against companies and local and public authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_281">Two years ago, industry was hit by soaring employers&#039; liability costs. There were a number of reasons for that. I would not put it down simply to the increase in the number of claims against them, but that was a contributory factor. That has been mitigated in part by companies improving their medical rehabilitation policies to pre-empt some of those claims. That has certainly taken pressure off industry. However, it remains a potential cost and driver of employers&#039; liability insurance. More significantly perhaps, in my constituency it is an obstacle to getting industry and education together.

<a name="stpa_282">I am told by schools that teachers may have to fill in up to 40&nbsp;forms to take children on a trip to a particular event. It makes me wonder whether we have the balance right. Foundries will not invite children to visit because of health and safety costs and the need to conform to regulations. It is essential that we fill young people with enthusiasm for science and industry. If regulations act as barriers preventing children from seeing industry and getting enthusiastic about it, we seriously need to do something about it. Will the relevant Ministries consider this issue? There is little point in investing large sums in scientific training if we do not also facilitate a connection between students and practitioners, so that those undergoing training want to practise what they have learned.

Unemployment has dropped and people are more prosperous. We are less dependent on manufacturing industry, which is to be welcomed. Secondly, the picture is not one of universal doom and gloom. We are still world leaders in any number of areas and we are surviving some of the most difficult international economic circumstances. Thirdly, I trust that the Government and the respective Ministries will ensure that regulation is designed to balance the need to promote industry with the need to promote health, welfare, healthy living and a good work-life balance. Ultimately, our prosperity and creativity are dependent on manufacturing industry. I look forward to the

<a name="stpa_285">Cambridge has had a turbulent political history. In the 19th century the seat changed hands many times between the Liberal and Conservative parties, frequently following the unseating of Members for corruption and bribery&#151;I have to say, mostly Conservative Members. There have been a great number of very close elections, none closer than the second election of 1640&#151;the election to what turned out to be the Long Parliament&#151;when an opposition candidate was allegedly elected by a single vote. The name of the candidate elected was of course Oliver Cromwell, who sat for Cambridge in both the Short and the Long Parliaments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_286">Cambridge is then an ancient parliamentary borough, long represented in this House. The borough, now the city, of Cambridge is indeed older than the university of Cambridge. The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2001; the university will not celebrate its 800th anniversary until 2009. Nevertheless, the university of Cambridge is a major feature of the city. Despite its recurrent financial problems, it is still one of the world&#039;s leading universities&#151;a fact perhaps better appreciated in other parts of the world than in this country. In this country, universities tend to be judged sometimes by stereotypical and outdated ideas about what kind of students attend them. In the rest of the world, a university&#039;s reputation rests on the quality of its research. On that basis, Cambridge university is still a force to be reckoned with.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_287">However, Cambridge university is not the only university in Cambridge. Anglia Polytechnic university provides excellent higher education to a diverse group of students&#151;students who will perhaps be even more adversely affected by increased tuition fees than those at the older university.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_288">In sheer economic terms, however, higher education is no longer the most important activity in Cambridge. That title belongs to high-tech industry, which now employs tens of thousands of people in the city and nearby. The growth of high-tech industry in the past 30&nbsp;years has transformed Cambridge. It is no longer a

</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_289">However, there are also parts of Cambridge where tourists and business people rarely go that have not necessarily shared in the prosperity of the rest of the city&#151;places with problems especially of housing and transport that are in some degree the result of economic success.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_290">Cambridge is a city of high property values but ordinary salaries; a city of high bicycle usage, but one that is still plagued by traffic congestion. Housing is a pressing problem for many people. Many Cambridge families could not possibly afford to buy the property that they occupy. Many fear that their children will never be able to live in their own home in Cambridge. The pressure on social housing is immense. There is a crying need for more affordable housing. Subsidising buyers merely puts prices up even more. It is more housing that we need. I fear that in this I may differ to some extent with the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green), although I should say that I agreed with every word that he said about identity cards.

<a name="50519-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_291">Some hon. Members have said earlier in the debate, notably on Tuesday, but the Secretary of State said it in his opening remarks today, that the green belt should be preserved at all costs. I fear that there is some confusion here between &quot;green belt&quot; and &quot;greenfield sites&quot;. I agree that greenfield sites should be the last development option, but green belt land is not necessarily greenfield land. The Cambridge green belt, as the Minister for Competitiveness, who is in his place, will doubtless remember, long included Cambridge airport. Far from an unused site, the airport borders the existing built-up area and many in local government believe that it would be an excellent site for a new urban extension to Cambridge, incorporating housing, open space, public transport and civic amenities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_292">Green belts are not always very green. The best environmental option is not always to prevent building on what is technically green belt land. Compact urban development can be more environmentally sustainable than spread-out rural and suburban development. Each case must be judged on its own merits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_293">Transport is at the centre of Cambridge&#039;s problems. Unusually, there has been a major increase in bus usage in the town, though the unregulated bus service is still letting some parts of the city down. Overall, Cambridge&#039;s public transport system is still that of a small market town rather than of a growth point in the new economy. We need major investment in infrastructure, but the system of local government finance means that we are unlikely to get it. The nationalisation of business rates and the obsession with centralised bidding for capital funding mean that we have to beg central Government for infrastructure funds&#151;funds that the Government seem inclined to allocate elsewhere.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) and, indeed, other hon. Members on making their maiden speeches. It is an honour for me to rise to make my maiden speech on industry and the environment, not least because my constituency of Stoke-on-Trent, South has played a central role in our industrial heritage. Stoke-on-Trent continues to be a major player, particularly in ceramics, but in other areas, too. For example, this year sees the 100th anniversary of Michelin in the UK, and &quot;the Mitch&quot;, as it is known, is an important employer in my constituency.
</p>

<a name="stpa_295">I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to my predecessor, Mr. George Stevenson, who served the people of Stoke-on-Trent for many years&#151;for the last 13&nbsp;years as MP for Stoke-on-Trent, South, for 12&nbsp;years before that as an MEP and before that as a councillor. Like me, George was not born in the city, but as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) said a few days ago,

</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_296">A Yorkshire man by birth, George and his family moved to the city. In his time, he worked as a bus driver, miner and at the clay end in the Potts. He is a well-known figure in the city. Indeed, George is so well known that I had some concerns at one point about the size of our local schools, as on one day there must have been hundreds of people who said that they had been at school with George. Wherever one looks across the constituency, whether it be at rebuilding works, improvements or renewal, one can see a lasting testimony to George Stevenson.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_297">It would be remiss of me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to talk about George without mentioning his wonderful wife, Pauline, so I want to take this opportunity of wishing them both a long and happy retirement.

<a name="50519-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_298">It is a delight to live in Stoke-on-Trent, South. There is something almost magical about the place that, once in the heart, never leaves it. I have received kind letters of congratulation from the sons and daughters of the city, who have moved to other parts of the country but for whom Stoke-on-Trent is for ever their true home. My constituency represents many of the challenges and opportunities in Britain today. The skyline was once dominated by bottle kilns and winding gear, but alas those industries&#151;like many traditional British industries&#151;are no more, or are much reduced. However, the tremendous talent of the people lives on. On election day, I was honoured to share in the 80th birthday celebrations of Vera Leese, a former paintress. Vera embodies a creative talent that now shows itself in her superb fruit pies and cakes&#151;the reason why I must now walk to the House rather than take the tube.

With the help and support of my agent, Tim Mullen, and the hard work of many dedicated volunteers&#151;to whom I will always be grateful&#151;we visited many places. From the cold, dark, wet nights of winter to the brighter mornings of spring, the volunteers pounded the streets with me, from Caroline street to the Trentham road. Together we visited the Thursday market in Fenton and the indoor market and precinct in Longton, perhaps pausing to buy Eccles cakes&#151;or, as they are affectionately known, dead fly pies. We walked many miles around Blurton, from Hollybush to Newstead. We met with the police and local residents at Sandford Hill. We spoke to the residents of the Meir, Coalville and Weston Coyney. We met retirement clubs, such as those at Meir Park community centre, Fenton community centre, and Pauline and the gang at the John Marston retirement club. We walked many miles in Trentham and Hanford and we journeyed around the whole constituency.

<a name="stpa_300">Stoke-on-Trent is starting once more to take its rightful place at the heart of Britain. For too many years our city was overlooked, but that is all changing. Unemployment has been slashed by 42&nbsp;per cent. Brand-new schools are springing up in my constituency. Parents to whom I spoke during the campaign welcome the new investments in schools such as Blurton primary, The Crescent primary and Newstead primary&#151;all brand-new schools. Parents told me of their delight at the new sports hall at Trentham high school, at St. Augustine&#039;s new kitchen and classroom, and at Glebe primary&#039;s new classroom block.
</p>

<a name="50519-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_301">There is much work in progress. Sandon high is to be rebuilt, starting in September, and Clarice Cliff and Gladstone primary schools are in planning. Ash Green is getting an extension to its nursery and The Crescent is getting a brand new children&#039;s centre.

<p>
<a name="50519-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_302">The constituency is also benefiting from new health facilities. The Willow Bank surgery opened in February of last year and patients have told me how they are able to have treatment there which previously would have needed a trip to hospital. Older members of the community have spoken to me about the new step-up, step-down beds at the refurbished Longton cottage hospital, which are making a tremendous difference to their recovery. Residents of Ripon road told me during the campaign about the significantly refurbished Blurton health clinic. That is not to mention the &#163;370&nbsp;million university hospital in the neighbouring constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)&#151;a brand-new hospital to serve the needs of the whole region. A lot has been done, but a lot more remains to do, and I shall press for the new Fenton health centre to be up and running by the end of the year.

I must declare an interest here as a resident of the Meir. I have already given a commitment to my fellow residents that while we must not pass over the opportunity of a generation that that money affords, the plans must be for the good of the people, not for the good of the architects.

<a name="stpa_307">Stoke-on-Trent has other heroes. I shall keep with me an enduring image&#151;that of the Treetops children&#039;s hospice run by the Donna Louise trust. In the week before the election, the hospice held an open day and I was shown around by one of the bereavement counsellors. In circumstances in which many people would, I suspect, find it impossible to cope, a dedicated team of staff and volunteers give hope and happiness to young people and their families. The trials and difficulties of an election campaign pale into insignificance when compared with the strength of the users and carers of Treetops&#151;an organisation that depends on charitable donations.

<a name="stpa_310">Many Members will be familiar with Bournemouth, as it is a seaside town on the party conference circuit. However, it offers much more than eight miles of glorious beaches and a major conference centre. There is a thriving business sector, with small and large businesses and a focus on financial services. There is also a cultural focus in the form of Shelley manor, built by the family of the poet. It includes a small theatre that is currently being renovated. Bournemouth can also lay claim to one of the best NHS trusts in the south.

<a name="stpa_311">There is a vibrant tourism industry but, alas, no donkeys at present. If people want donkeys they still have to go to Blackpool.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-21_para17">
<a name="stpa_312">Bournemouth boasts some of the highest education standards in the country. I do not want to be too controversial in my maiden speech but I made the funding of Bournemouth schools a priority during the election campaign. I visited several schools; for example, Queen&#039;s Park infant school, Epiphany primary school, Avonbourne, St. Peter&#039;s and Pokesdown. Two themes were common in my visits to all those schools: first, the high standard of education and the commitment shown by teachers and, secondly, the harsh financial conditions that the schools face. I should be grateful for the chance to meet an Education Minister at the earliest opportunity to discuss how Bournemouth&#039;s funding settlement can be increased so that we retain the highest standards of teaching and education.

<a name="50519-21_para18">
<a name="stpa_313">Bournemouth is also home to a great football club&#151;AFC Bournemouth is in the first division and was pipped at the last game by Hartlepool for a place in the play-offs. Like many clubs in the constituencies of other Members, it is a focal point not only for football but many other sporting and community activities. Like other non-premiership clubs, the club&#039;s sporting successes are unfortunately marred by the financial constraints that it faces. Clubs such as AFC Bournemouth now look to the FA cup almost as a mini-lottery, hoping to be drawn against a premier league club simply to balance the books. In fact, Bournemouth were drawn against Liverpool in the fourth round, but unfortunately Liverpool, perhaps knowing that they might be confronted with playing Bournemouth, lost their first-round replay match, thereby denying Bournemouth the crucial financial support that they need.

I was born a few months afterwards, and it may well be that I have a lot to thank that feel-good factor for. If we are ever to win a World cup again, we must invest in home-grown talent and ensure that we

<p>
<a name="50519-21_para20">
<a name="stpa_315">Like many seaside towns, Bournemouth must now compete with holiday destinations abroad because the cost of travel has dropped. Low-cost airlines are making places such as Bournemouth compete with the likes of Berlin and Barcelona. Bookings for weekend holidays, let alone holidays for an entire week, have reduced as it is so much cheaper to travel abroad. Tourism is Bournemouth&#039;s biggest industry. The town has so much potential but is unfortunately denied the ability to explore new ways to deal with that competition and to pursue its own strategy to pursue visitors. I am afraid that the reason why it is held back, again without being too controversial in my maiden speech, is the growth in the power base of the South West regional assembly, which has taken power away from councils and given it to Taunton, denying councils the ability to decide their own strategy for the future. The biggest example is the threat to the green belt area around Bournemouth, where 13,000&nbsp;more homes are being planned. I am not a supporter of the South West regional assembly. Bournemouth deliberately became a unitary authority in 1997&nbsp;so that it could control its own future. I should like more power to be given to councils instead of having larger local government outside the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-21_para21">
<a name="stpa_316">As in other town centres around the country, pubs and clubs have sprung up in Bournemouth at a rate that is altering the character of the town. In Bournemouth&#039;s case, this is deterring families from visiting the area in the evenings. I am not saying that we should not have any pubs or clubs&#151;far from it&#151;but the local council needs to have more control over how the character of the town develops. Pubs and clubs generally lead to the development of a yob culture and the drinking that occurs on Friday and Saturday nights, and I am afraid that Bournemouth is no exception. On a Friday night, half the police are forced to focus on the quarter of a square mile where all the nightclubs are based.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-21_para22">
<a name="stpa_317">One idea that came up during the election campaign is that of imposing a levy on pubs and clubs to pay for the extra policing that is needed, so freeing up the police to cover the rest of the town. The concept is not new&#151;it is already used at football matches, where the extra policing that one sees is not paid for by taxpayers who are not necessarily there but out of ticket sales. That idea could be explored for Bournemouth, and I would very much welcome the opportunity to work with the council in order to pursue this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-21_para23">
<a name="stpa_318">When the Prime Minister opened the Queen&#039;s Speech debate, he mentioned the role of the police community support officer. I have spent time with many agencies in Bournemouth, including the police and CSOs, but have yet to meet a CSO who would not jump at the opportunity of ditching that uniform and wearing the uniform of a special constable&#151;if special constables were paid a salary. In Bournemouth, only one third of the quota for specials is met. Were we to pay them a salary, we would benefit from their better training, their power to make arrests, and meet the policing needs in Bournemouth.

It is therefore surprising to learn that it was he who made the announcement in the House about the threat of the Y2K bug&#151;the big issue leading up to the year 2000, when it was feared that all our computers would crash. How on earth he came upon that information, I do not know, but his reluctance to harness IT never prevented him from dealing with constituency matters. Perhaps the lesson for us all is that we should not be so reliant on the IT equipment that we are given.

Despite all the high-tech gadgetry that MPs are now armed with, David Atkinson proved that what is important is not so much the speed with which constituency matters are dealt with, or the turnover, but the quality of the response and the pursuit of a solution. I hope hon. Members will join me in wishing David Atkinson well in his retirement. I am pleased that he has chosen to retire in Bournemouth, as he will not be too far away if I have any questions or advice to seek.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) on his impressive speech. The last three speeches have all been maiden speeches and have all been excellent. All the Members will make their mark in the House. I hope that they do, and I wish them well in that process. I congratulate all who have made their maiden speeches in the House today.

<a name="stpa_325">Labour&#039;s election manifesto was fine, up to a point. The Queen&#039;s Speech is fine, up to a point. The manifesto was published during the election campaign, following a restrictive system for what went in it. Anyway, it was too late to put such commitments into local campaigning literature or into an election address. The pledges on the pledge card were so general this time that they amounted in worth to only one day&#039;s spin. I did not use them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_326">However, what a manifesto does not contain can be as important as what it does. Last time, there was no indication that the Government would support a war as foolhardy as the one in Iraq, and what was said about tuition fees was quite different from what was actually proposed. Something similar could happen this time. The Leader of the Opposition struck a chord when he said that some of the new policies announced in the Queen&#039;s Speech had a familiar&#151;and he suggested Tory&#151;ring.

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_327">I fought the election not on a new Labour ticket, but on a Labour ticket. I do not feel bound by an unremittingly new Labour agenda. I welcome the commitments to education that were contained in an e-mail sent to candidates, but which did not appear in the manifesto. Under &quot;Building Schools for the Future&quot;, over the next 15&nbsp;years it is proposed to rebuild completely, or refurbish radically with new classrooms, sports halls and computer centres, more than 50&nbsp;per cent. of our primary schools and the entire secondary school estate of every local authority in the country. I also welcome the promise that spending per pupil will rise from &#163;3,850&nbsp;to &#163;5,500&nbsp;by 2008. More pre-school and after-school clubs are also promised, as are better school meals, and I welcome that too, as I do the intention to provide 3,500&nbsp;children&#039;s centres by 2010. Moreover, the aim is to make extended schools&#151;with much more widespread links with the communities that they serve than is presently the case&#151;the norm rather than the exception
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_328">Improved education, with opportunity for all and not just an elite, is a true Labour objective that I am happy to support. However, how does effective private control and, perhaps, ownership of city academies&#151;funded overwhelmingly with taxpayers&#039; money&#151;square with that? I wait to see exactly what is proposed.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_329">I am also wary of the first proposal made by the new Health Secretary, which was no doubt required of her by No. 10. The proposal is to increase massively the number of private operations contracted for by the NHS. She said that she foresaw no limit&#151;presumably up to 100&nbsp;per cent.&#151;to the number of such operations carried out in the private sector. In the short term, that may lead to more operations being carried out, given the amount of money being pumped in, but the effect on the NHS, in the medium and long term, would be bad.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_330">Consultants will set up private companies to feed off the NHS. Their services will not be available in-house in NHS hospitals, and in-house provision is likely to be wound down in direct proportion to the expansion of those private companies. In due course, those companies will charge what they like and the NHS will be over a barrel. The care offered by the private companies is likely to be more expensive than NHS in-house provision were that to be similarly expanded, with more resources, for the same number of operations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_331">However, what really alarmed me was the new Labour rhetoric that uncompetitive local hospitals could close as part of the process. Communities need their local hospitals. If any hospitals are not running efficiently, it is the job of the health executives and the Government to ensure that they become efficient. It is not their job to close them. What we have is the Nicholas Ridley agenda applied to the NHS, where the state is seen as an agent or enabler, not the provider. Increasingly, the private sector is the provider. The NHS has worked well as a provider of health care, achieving results for the amount of resources put in that are a lot better than is the case in other countries. It does not need this sort of reform, which I have considerable doubt will be for the better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_332">I give the Government the benefit of the doubt on identity cards. Before the election, I voted for the cards in principle, but the devil is in the detail. Another example of that might be the children&#039;s registers: the intention is good, but the Government must do the necessary work to ensure that they operate properly. Care must be taken about the data that are kept and who is allowed access, and proper provision must be made for the correction of inaccurate information. Moreover, the purposes of the registers must be made clear and not continually added to. If the Government do not do that necessary work, the project could end up discredited and unable to fulfil its intended goals. If that happens, it will be an expensive failure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_333">There is also a case for a carefully calibrated policy on incapacity benefit. Nobody wants malingerers to freeload and nobody wants seriously ill people to be denied their benefit, but there are a lot of people in between. In my constituency, some 6&nbsp;per cent. of the working population are on incapacity benefit. As an urban area, it is a tough place to live. The living environment, let alone the working one, is tough. It makes people sick, even if that sometimes manifests itself in just an inability to cope at anything other than a low level. To be brutally frank, many such people are mentally sick or inadequate when held up against what we want of them: to work and to cope for themselves. Tougher invalidity rules would be unfair to them. I favour the option, suggested by the Government, of seeking to help such people remove the obstacles to working, but we should not be swift to punish them by 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 351</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>cutting off their benefit if the process turns out to be a slow one. There still remains the suspicion that the Government&#039;s main objective is to move swiftly to cut the overall invalidity bill, so the detail of the proposals will need to be scrutinised very carefully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_334">Local government workers, key workers, teachers, nurses and health care professionals must have secure pensions. They have paid in over the years for their pension rights, and the terms of those rights have been successfully negotiated by their representatives. It is not right that the Government should take a heavy-handed approach and adversely change such pension rights. There must be proper talks and negotiations with the public service trade unions, and agreed solutions must be reached. Public sector workers are paid relatively low wages for the important public service that they perform, and their pensions should be protected. I will not support a fast fix that seriously penalises such workers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_335">The Government must also take action to protect the pensions of people who work in the private sector. Effective robbery from pension savings by fat-cat directors of finance companies&#151;who take excessive salaries and dividends for themselves, even when the savings that they are managing are underperforming&#151;must be stopped. The whole commission system is now seen as lining the pockets of the financial adviser, against the interests of the saver. Employers have not contributed properly to pension funds, taking long contribution holidays for themselves and worsening their workers&#039; pension rights when the funds failed to match commitments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_336">Finance capital associated with the stock exchange has brought about a depletion in pension funds, without the stock exchange being accountable. There is no transparency in its performance. The Government have stood by and said, &quot;This is a private sector matter, not a matter for us.&quot; Individuals saving more for their old age are increasingly mooted as a major factor in any future system, but that will not be a solution if they can so easily be robbed of their money as is currently the case. If the Government want a savings culture, they must get rid of the corporate robbery culture. According to a report in <i>The Independent</i> of 12&nbsp;April, the Prime Minister bowed to pressure from business and shelved the threat of compulsory employer pension contributions until a fourth Labour term of office. If so, that was an irresponsible capitulation. In any workable solution, employers must pay more and pay consistently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_337">I wish to discuss three other matters, the first of which is Iraq. Some 100,000&nbsp;Iraqis have been killed and the country has been plunged into the hands of militant insurgents. Execution-style murders have become a new trend in the violence in Iraq; some 450&nbsp;people have died in that way so far in May alone. The desperate security situation is matched by the almost non-existent administrative infrastructure. There has been no serious effort at reconstruction or at rebuilding Iraq for the people. There has been no clear-up of cluster bomblets or of other unexploded ordinance. Iraq&#039;s resources, most notably oil, continue to be plundered. Deplorably, proper plans to follow &quot;shock and awe&quot; were non-existent, and the Iraqi people continue to suffer.

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_338">Moreover, we have lost 87&nbsp;UK service personnel in Iraq. Those troops and their families, along with Iraqis and all the others who have been killed or maimed, are the victims of a decision to go to war that was taken on a false premise, and on legal advice deliberately changed under pressure that did not properly reflect the illegality of the action. The policy and the interpretation of the law were left to the Prime Minister, and he interpreted the United Kingdom&#039;s national interest as being to side, come what may, with the warmonger in the White House. The national interest, from now on, must be what the British people want and need, not what a right-wing Republican President of the United States wants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_339">I continue to support the campaign to bring the troops home at an early opportunity. That is not cutting and running, but facing up to our responsibility to bring about a solution. There can be none while foreign troops&#151;ours and those from the United States&#151;are there in occupation. We have to pay for our mistakes and to help to build Iraq, even after we have left, but we need not pay with the loss of more lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para15">
<a name="stpa_340">On 2&nbsp;May, <i>The Independent</i> disclosed the Government&#039;s plan to develop and deploy new nuclear weapons. That is hardly visionary, although it is par for new Labour. Nor is it for the good. As Robert McNamara, the United States Secretary of Defence during the Kennedy and Johnson eras, has said, human fallibility and nuclear weapons mean the destruction of nations. The policy would also doom non-proliferation efforts to failure, as the non-proliferation treaty was a bargain between those nations who agreed not to develop nuclear weapons and those states with nuclear weapons who agreed to eliminate them. The unnecessary holding of nuclear weapons&#151;indeed, the development and deployment of seemingly smaller, usable weapons&#151;fuels proliferation. It will lead to the solution of perpetual Iraq-style wars and occupations against unfavoured states, while favoured states such as Israel, India and Pakistan will continue to expand their nuclear arsenals until they either become unfavoured or use them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para16">
<a name="stpa_341">Nuclear weapons will be used if we take that route. It is not a sustainable policy. We must return to treaty, international law and inspection arrangements. That must include our properly meeting our NPT commitments. That should mean that the option of a new generation of nuclear weapons for Britain is out. Otherwise, we shall have the hypocritical spectacle of a British Prime Minister falsely accusing another country of having weapons of mass destruction while he is authorising a big expansion of his own.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-22_para17">
<a name="stpa_342">Nuclear power is my last matter. I strongly support the Government&#039;s renewable energy policy of getting 10&nbsp;per cent. of electricity from renewable sources by 2010. We are below 3&nbsp;per cent. at present. The Government must use compulsion and invoke the national interest, as they did with the immigration and asylum centre in Oxford, to ensure that there are sufficient wind and wave farms and that there are solar panels in all newly built homes. It would not be right to abandon that and to switch to building new nuclear power stations. Many such as myself suspect that that option is returning to the table only to supply a discreet means of sourcing the new nuclear weapons programme. Nuclear power is hugely wasteful. The cost to the British taxpayer of its debts and of clean-up is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>counted in billions of pounds. It spreads radioactivity. There is the risk of a Chernobyl-type disaster, and there is still no safe disposal option for nuclear waste. It is not the solution. We must press ahead more insistently on wind, wave and sun power, and not be fooled by the allegedly easy nuclear option.

 I am grateful for being called in the Queen&#039;s Speech debate. May I dare say, however, that this Queen&#039;s Speech is almost beyond parody, if not beyond criticism? That could not, of course, be said of the speech that we have just heard from the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen), who demonstrated to us the duty and job of a Member of Parliament, whether he be a member of the Labour party or any other. That duty and job is primarily to speak up for his constituents in this Chamber and to hold the Government to account. If he did anything, he made a speech on his feet and not on his knees, and I was delighted to hear it. I cannot say that I agree with everything he had to say, but he demonstrated to those of us who have been Members of the House for some while and those who have been Members for only a few days what it is that a Member of Parliament should do. Accountability is what we are about, and holding those on the Treasury Bench to account. I hope that more Members during this Parliament will behave as he does and as he did today. I congratulate him on his speech.

I look forward to hearing a lot more of what he has to say on matters of great public concern, as I do in respect of my hon.

 I have heard such moans from Conservative Members on a number of occasions.

I remind him that some very senior Conservative Members who are extraordinarily respected on both sides of the House have long expressed the view that the processes of the House, by which we used not to examine many parts of Bills, were wholly undesirable. They felt that to have a structure that facilitated scrutiny&#151;to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the seriousness of the chunk of the Bill in question&#151;of all elements of the legislation was a huge improvement. It is ridiculous of Conservative Members to pretend otherwise. I sat on the Opposition Benches when the Conservative Government whom the hon. and learned Gentleman supported introduced a whole new section into a social security Bill, to get rid of widows&#039; pensions, after a guillotine. I really do not want to hear these criticisms from the Conservatives, because they are totally unjustified.

I can tell her that it is not just my experience but that of people across the Chamber in all parties that we are dissatisfied with the way in which legislation is pushed through the House. Of course, she has a mandate to get her business through. Fair enough. But she ought to have the self-confidence&#151;when I say &quot;she&quot;, I mean the Government as a whole&#151;to allow Parliament to do its job, and to listen to people such as the hon.

It should be a place in which legislation is considered, and in the last part of the last Parliament, it manifestly was not. It became an embarrassment, and if she does not know that, she should do.

 Does my hon. and learned Friend recall that, in the last Parliament and the one that preceded it, it was commonplace for the Government to table large numbers of amendments and new clauses to their own legislation on Report? When Conservatives and other Members complained that there was not enough time to debate them, it was common for Ministers&#151;not a Minister of the experience and celebrity of the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but a number of her colleagues&#151;to say that the matters involved had been debated at considerable length in Committee. That is all very well, but for those of us who did not have the great privilege to be chosen by the Whips to serve on those Standing Committees, it was a very unsatisfactory explanation.

What will the Government do to ensure that, if we have been sold a false prospectus, someone should be held to account? What will the right hon.

Would you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, expect East Midlands airport to fine its customers and thus to discourage them from using the airport? It will take a lot of convincing to persuade me that the civil aviation Bill will have the desired effect of making airlines behave themselves when they do not fly down the requisite routes and ensuring that East Midlands airport behaves as a good neighbour. I hope that the Secretary of State will help me, as I wish to help her, in ensuring that NEMA behaves itself.

<a name="50519-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_381">The past half-century has seen some idiosyncratic Cornish voices here. A distinguished predecessor, David Mudd&#151;rather curiously, he was one of the opponents whom I defeated&#151;comes to mind. So too does Candy Atherton, a doughty and courteous opponent. However, Cornwall has produced one genuine political superstar, a strong voice for the county and a man who became a national treasure. I refer, of course, to David Penhaligon, our late, great Liberal Member of Parliament. I was just eight years old when he was tragically killed but, every day that I have campaigned in Cornwall, his name has been mentioned and his spirit evoked. His work, not just for Truro and his constituents but for everyone in Cornwall, earned him admiration, love and respect from people all over the county&#151;actually, all over the country&#151;regardless of their personal political persuasions. Just a few days here has reinforced that respect in which he was held by all parties. Every Member representing any part of Cornwall has had a tough act to follow and a high standard to meet. I shall do my best to look significantly less crumpled than David Penhaligon did but, Mr. Deputy Speaker, you may be assured that I will follow his lead, which has been followed by a growing body of Liberal Democrats in Cornwall, to put the needs and demands of my county above everything else.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_382">In preparing this maiden speech I looked back to that of David Penhaligon to see what issues were important to him and to people in Cornwall in 1974. I was shocked at how many of the problems that he raised then remain problems today. Before I was even born, before this Labour Government or the last Conservative Government, Cornwall already suffered from spiralling house prices, low wages and lower-than-average funding for our hospitals, schools and police. Today we can add to the list the fact that we have the highest water bills in the country and, like many other parts, face the increasing burden of the unfair council tax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_383">In the 31&nbsp;years since Mr. Penhaligon was elected, successive Governments have hardly recognised, let alone addressed, many of those problems. We have lived too long with the assumption that beautiful beaches, a sunny climate and an extraordinary landscape must mean a wealthy population. The truth is quite to the contrary: we are still the poorest county in the country. Indeed, many problems are getting worse. Since 1998, house prices in my constituency have increased by 144&nbsp;per cent. While that may be caused by the desirability of many areas as locations for second homes, a recent report by Shelter states that Cornwall is the least affordable place to live in the UK, including London.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_384">In Cornwall, doctors, nurses and teachers are struggling to afford to live where they work. It is even worse for people on local wages. Low and often seasonal incomes put home ownership far beyond the reach of many people who live and work there. Wages remain about 20&nbsp;per cent. below the national average. Action is desperately needed to build the economic capacity of the county and to develop a stock of skilled, permanent and well-paid jobs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_385">In Scotland and Wales, there has been detailed investigation into the cost of public service provision in rural areas, whereas in England there has been no such 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 362</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>adequate investigation into, or account taken of, how deprivation manifests itself in rural areas. NHS funding illustrates the illogicality of the existing situation. Funding is tied to low local wage rates, which will hit Cornwall&#039;s hospitals for years to come. Instead, they should be used as evidence to justify increased investment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_386">People in Cornwall do not demand more funding for public services than anyone else, but they reasonably deserve levels of funding and support that reflect their needs. The Queen&#039;s Speech sadly shows that the Government are still not listening to the concerns of the Cornish people. I am determined that the voice of the people of Falmouth and Camborne will not be ignored in this Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_387">I do not wish to dwell entirely on problems. Progress has also been made, due in most part to hard work and cross-party consensus from politicians, for whom putting Cornwall first has been their No. 1&nbsp;goal. Objective 1&nbsp;status for the county was secured through the hard work of all of Cornwall&#039;s MPs, through the efforts of our then MEP, Robin Teverson, and with the support of this Government. Our qualification for objective 1&nbsp;is long overdue recognition of the fact that Cornwall is the poorest county in England, and I hope that the Government will support the next phase of the programme so that Cornwall&#039;s economic growth can continue to build.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_388">The scheme has helped to develop the county&#039;s economy through its work with small businesses and its support of important strategic projects, such as the Combined University in Cornwall at Tremough in Penryn. It is an ambitious project, which has finally provided access to higher education in Cornwall. For the first time, young people who could not otherwise afford to go away to university have the opportunity to study at home, although sadly now only if they can afford the tuition and top-up fees. For those achievements I pay tribute to my colleagues as well as my predecessors, Candy Atherton, Seb Coe and David Mudd, for their hard work. I hope that this spirit, working across party and political boundaries to achieve what is best for the constituency and for Cornwall, will continue.

<p>
<a name="50519-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_389">For the first time since 1923, the entire county is represented by Liberal Democrat MPs. That is even more remarkable given that the seat of Falmouth and Camborne, since it was created in 1950, has never previously been represented by a Liberal or Liberal Democrat and was won at this election from third place. This will help provide a united voice for the county, but I want to make something very clear: the ambition of all Cornwall&#039;s Liberal Democrat Members of Parliament is to put the interests of the county first. That includes making sure that we work with people of all political persuasions, including locally elected representatives from Labour, the Conservatives, Mebyon Kernow and especially Cornwall&#039;s many independent councillors, to make the case for Cornwall. People of all parties and none can make a real contribution to winning the case for a fair deal for Cornwall, and as Liberal Democrats our ambition is to make sure that that voice is heard.

Three quarters of the constituency was previously within the Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber constituency.

I wish him well for the future. Of course, the highlands of Scotland have a long and radical tradition. Hence it has been for many years a stronghold of Liberalism and now Liberal Democracy. Prior to 1997, much of my constituency was represented by that great Highland Liberal Russell Johnston, who continues his service in the other place. Throughout his 33&nbsp;years representing the area, Russell exemplified the thoughtful and independent-minded approach that is characteristic of the highlands. I was especially grateful to him for spending so much of his time with me during the election campaign. It is striking to think that Russell was a Member of this House for as many years as I have so far spent on this earth. Russell Johnston was to me, as to many others, a political inspiration, but he was not the first Liberal influence on my life.

It is also one of the most diverse, encompassing the fast-growing city of Inverness, the remote splendour of the Cairngorm mountains, the mysteries of Loch Ness and the popular seaside town of Nairn. I have not yet had the pleasure of canvassing the most famous resident of Loch Ness, but I am reliably informed that she is not a Labour supporter. Like the Prime Minister, Nessie was not seen in my constituency during the election campaign, but unlike the Prime Minister, her reputation has grown as a result.

<a name="stpa_396">One of the most important recent developments in Badenoch and Strathspey has been the creation of the Cairngorms national park, and I previously worked for the park authority. Readers of the <i>National Geographic </i>Magazine recently voted the highlands one of the top 10&nbsp;sustainable tourism destinations in the world. Clearly, the need to develop the tourist industry further must be accommodated in such a way that it does not at the same time undermine the natural features that attract the visitors in the first place. We must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.

<a name="stpa_397">As Members on both sides of the House are all too aware&#151;the right hon. Member for Fylde (Michael Jack) eloquently made the point in his speech earlier&#151;threats to our environment are more often international than local. The threat and indeed the current reality of climate change are all too apparent to my constituents, not least because they are highly visible through the fortunes of the Scottish ski industry. The Cairngorm mountain ski area has successfully diversified into a very popular summer attraction, as the amount of time and the snow available for winter sports have fallen as a consequence of global warming. I hope that we might finally see some genuine progress made on that most pressing question when the G8&nbsp;comes to Scotland in the summer.

<a name="stpa_398">I am proud to represent the whole of the city of Inverness, capital of the highlands. Britain&#039;s most northerly city is also one of the country&#039;s fastest growing. The quality of life, as well as the quality of

<br>&nbsp;<br>employment, have caused the population to rise, especially in the Inverness and Nairn areas. As well as being a service centre for the highlands, with much income from traditional areas such as tourism, Inverness is home to an increasing number of innovative modern industries, particularly in the medical field. The success of LifeScan Scotland, formerly Inverness Medical, which now employs more than 1,200&nbsp;people, is helping to attract many new businesses to the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-25_para19">
<a name="stpa_399">Inverness&#039;s growth and success present challenges, not least the fact that, despite recent progress, with wages at 80&nbsp;per cent. of the UK average, the highlands and islands is still one of the poorer areas in the United Kingdom. Problems caused by remoteness are as pressing as they were when Russell Johnston raised them in his maiden speech in 1964. Of course, there has been progress, and I pay tribute to the work of many public agencies in the highlands. The fact remains that there is considerable room for improvement in all aspects of the transport network&#151;bus, train, road, and air&#151;in my constituency, despite the substantial progress made under Nicol Stephen, our Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive Minister for Transport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-25_para20">
<a name="stpa_400">Effective transport links between the highlands and London are vital for the region&#039;s continued growth, so it is a matter of regret that the Government have so far not seen fit to protect vital air routes between Inverness and London with a public service obligation. Considerable further investment is also needed to improve road and rail infrastructure around Inverness and between Inverness and Nairn, particularly by upgrading the A96&nbsp;and completing the Inverness southern link road.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-25_para21">
<a name="stpa_401">Perhaps the most pressing problem across the highlands&#151;and, as we have heard in other speeches today, in many areas across the country&#151;is the shortage of affordable housing. The rapid rise in house prices has pushed owning a home beyond the means of many local people. One Conservative Member has already confessed to me that he owns a second home in my constituency. I look forward to meeting him there, but I have to say that demand for second homes has enormously exacerbated the problem of the shortage of affordable housing. We need radical solutions, which will be one of my priorities during this Parliament. Although housing policy in Scotland is a matter for the Scottish Parliament, decisions made here can have a significant impact on the problem.

<p>
<a name="50519-25_para22">
<a name="stpa_402">Our rural areas are home to many thousands of people, so services in small communities such as those that I represent must be preserved and enhanced, not undermined or removed, as has been the fate, for example, of too many post offices in recent years.

<p><a name="st_166"><a name="50519-26_spnew0"><b> John Hemming  (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD):</b> 
 I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to make my first speech. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)&#151;I hope that I managed to pronounce those names right&#151;and also the hon. Members for Burnley (Kitty Ussher), for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond), for Llanelli (Nia Griffith), for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove), for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello) and for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), and my hon. Friends the Members for Cambridge (David Howarth) and for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy). I especially congratulate the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South as today&#039;s was his second maiden speech, his first being as councillor for the Longbridge ward of Birmingham city council, which includes the Rover plant, an office he held until June last year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_405">I have been told that one of the challenges I face in this speech is not to be controversial and I shall try to manage that. It is not controversial to say that Estelle Morris was well liked, courteous and hard-working. As was said on &quot;Woman&#039;s Hour&quot; on Radio 4&nbsp;on 25&nbsp;October 2002:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;Estelle Morris&#039;s refreshing candour has provoked tributes from across the political divide.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_406">I fought Estelle Morris in 1992, 1997&nbsp;and 2001, and now she has been sent to the other place. There is no doubt that she was always very courteous and worked hard on behalf of all the residents of Yardley.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_407">I am not the first person to fight Yardley three times before winning. Archibald Gosling fought it three times in the 1920s, before winning on the fourth occasion. I also wish to pay tribute to David Gilroy Bevan, who sadly died recently. He was educated at King Edward&#039;s school, as I was, and was also a Birmingham city councillor. There is a tradition of Birmingham city councillors representing Yardley.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_408">Yardley is part of Birmingham, which is a difficult place to understand for people from outside. An &quot;A to Z&quot; would be one way to learn about it, but there are other mechanisms. People who live outside London first learn about Mayfair and Park lane, through the Monopoly board. So I bought a Birmingham Monopoly set, which I shall place in the Library, and anyone who wishes to learn more about the city can play a game. Park lane and Mayfair are replaced by Hurst street and Victoria square. Victoria square is the location of the Council House, but Hurst street is also important as part of Birmingham&#039;s history. The city is based on migration&#151;both immigration and emigration. Most people have heard of Birmingham, Alabama, but there are more than 20&nbsp;other Birminghams around the world, some of which are very small. They include a New Birmingham in Ireland. Immigration to Birmingham came substantially from Ireland, the new Commonwealth and other areas, but initially it came from Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Staffordshire, the three counties that make up Birmingham.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_409">In the 1800s, Birmingham was very small and densely populated. Industry developed in Birmingham for several reasons. There was less regulation in the area and also a critical mass of scientific developments. For example, the Lunar Society and others worked together 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 367</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to develop new industries. As a consequence, Birmingham became the city of a thousand trades. Indeed, in Hurst street one can still see the back-to-back properties in which people lived. By our standards today, such properties would not be highly regarded, but they were then seen as being of better quality than other existing properties. The courtyard design led to dense population and was not very sanitary, so people wanted to move away. Although the population of Birmingham in the early 1800s was about a million, living in a very small space, the population doubled every 15&nbsp;years. In an attempt to improve the quality of life, especially in housing terms, Birmingham expanded to take in neighbouring areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_410">In 1912, Yardley came into Birmingham from Worcestershire, along with Handsworth, Small Heath, Kings Norton, Aston and Moseley, from Worcestershire, Warwickshire and Staffordshire. That is why although a lot of people in Yardley work in manufacturing industry there are not many factories in Yardley itself, apart from in Tyseley and Garretts Green.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_411">That brings me to a point about roundabouts&#151;to refer to the hon. Member for South Swindon who was talking about a Swindon roundabout earlier. At the junction of Garretts Green lane and Sheldon Heath road, there is a roundabout with seven exits and I challenge any Member to find a roundabout with more than that. Of course, the Swindon roundabout may be a strange one, but the Garretts Green roundabout is straightforward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_412">Like the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), I come from a family of immigrants, but we invaded&#151;as Vikings in the year 600. Everyone knows about King Offa, but he was a descendant of the Danish king, Hemming, as we can see from &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Sadly, as a result of the Norman conquest many historical records were destroyed, but in chapter 27&nbsp;of Beowulf, at around line 1,950, we read:
</p>

<p align=center><img src="05051901.gif"></p>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_413">That means that Offa was a descendant of King Hemming of Denmark. So although there are many Hemmings in Warwickshire and Worcestershire, our origin is Danish.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_414">Back in 699, there were of course no railways although there were a few roads. The main boundaries were rivers and the River Cole, in the Yardley constituency, was the boundary between Mercia and Hwicca. Mercia gradually expanded to colonise London. If that situation had been maintained, this place would be in Tamworth and we should have much better parties. In Birmingham, we know how to party. At our VE day celebrations, for instance, there were about 10,000&nbsp;people. We had a street party and a massive celebration but I believe that in London things were relatively mild.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_415">We celebrate all sorts of things. We celebrate St.&nbsp;George&#039;s day, St. Patrick&#039;s day&#151;about 100,000&nbsp;people turn up for that&#151;Christmas, Vaisakhi, various Eids and the international carnival. Birmingham is definitely a city that knows how to party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_416">To return to the Mercia of several millennia ago, it may surprise Members to learn that there was an early currency union. Offa minted dinars in this country. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 368</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>There is one of those coins in the British Museum; a mixture of Arabic and Latin is written on it. The idea was to have the same currency as Spain so that trade would be easier. There is only one of those coins left.
</p>








<p><a name="st_167"><a name="50519-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 A single currency.
</p>








<p><a name="st_168"><a name="50519-26_spnew2"><b> John Hemming: </b> 
 Exactly. A single currency in 800&nbsp;rather than in 2000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_417">Members may not be aware of another interesting Anglo-Saxon aspect. Tolkien, who wrote &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, was also educated at the King Edward VI school in Birmingham, as was the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), although not at the same time. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was based on Birmingham locations, which may seem strange to people who have seen the films because they were made in New Zealand. However, the ideas developed in Birmingham.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_418">Yardley has existed as an entity since 699. It was known as Gerlei in the Domesday book, which means a clearing in a forest. It has been a clearly identifiable community for a long time, and although it has been brought within Birmingham, Birmingham is not an homogenous city. As I explained, the city expanded, especially in 1912, to take in several villages around the industrialised centre. The villages of Yardley, Stechford, Hay Mills, Acocks Green and Sheldon are the main ones in the Yardley constituency. They are easily identified because they all have an old church.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_419">Industrial philanthropy is another interesting feature. In the 1800s, companies such as Webster and Horsfall, Latch and Batchelor built houses for their work force, like the Cadburys at the Bournville village trust in the Selly Oak constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_420">That very clear local identity has, sadly, been challenged by the Boundary Commission&#039;s proposals to divide up Yardley and Sheldon, which have been together since 1912&nbsp;in the constituency of Yardley and prior to that in the constituency of East Worcester. Those communities have been there for millennia, yet the Boundary Commission apparently&#151;although there is a report coming out on 28&nbsp;June&#151;do not think that important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_421">Among the local issues that worry local residents is the proposal to have a second runway at the airport. We are greatly concerned about that not only because of the local impact but because it is not sustainable to have massive increases in air flight all the time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_422">Another issue is that of the challenges that face the manufacturing sector. Most of the things that I would like to say about MG Rover are far too controversial for a maiden speech, so they will have to be left for another time. However, I should like to quote from Estelle Morris&#039;s maiden speech of 12&nbsp;May 1992, in which she said of Yardley:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;It relies for employment mainly on manufacturing industry within Birmingham and neighbouring Coventry. The economic prosperity of manufacturing in the west midlands region is the main factor which determines the economic prosperity of my constituents and I hope that in the next few years we will see an upturn in the fortunes of that industry.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 12&nbsp; May 1992; Vol. 207, c. 562.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_423">In essence, there is agreement across the House that manufacturing is important. I shall return to the contentious issues at a later stage as I cannot raise them now.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 369</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para19">
<a name="stpa_424">Among other local issues is the 99&nbsp;bus. It may sound relatively trivial, but the closing down of a bus service that takes people to the hospital is not very good in an environment in which one would prefer people to use buses rather than their cars. That is a consequence of the Transport Act 1985, which should have made a change to sector tendering. That still needs to be done. However, we are where we are and the argument will continue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para20">
<a name="stpa_425">As for the Queen&#039;s Speech, I was a little concerned about the idea of legislating to ensure that hospitals are clean, as one would presume that a mop would do a better job, but it remains an important issue however it is dealt with. In terms of MRSA, we should really consider over-prescription and inappropriate prescription of antibiotics and whether antibiotics are fed to farm animals outside this country, creating a bacteriological resistance to antibiotics that causes great hazards to human beings. If the relevant Bill moves down that route instead of setting simplistic targets on mops, alcohol washes and the like, we have some hope that it will be useful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para21">
<a name="stpa_426">On MG Rover, I should raise an issue that fits into the environmental and industrial subject matter. One of the projects that has been going on at Powertrain has been the hybrid engine, which is a combination of a generator and an internal combustion engine. It is a good, useful mechanism for the efficient generation of power, but it still relies on fossil fuels, which remain a problem in themselves. Fusion was mentioned earlier. We already rely to a very great extent on fusion power&#151;the power plant is known colloquially as &quot;the sun&quot; and is fortunately at a very safe distance. I am happy to continue using the power of the sun, which is generally the main source of energy in biodiesel and other sustainable systems. In fact the only source that does not come from the sun is nuclear fission, as opposed to nuclear fusion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para22">
<a name="stpa_427">I want to end by paying tribute to the work of my predecessors in the Yardley constituency: Estelle Morris; David Gilroy Bevan; Syd Tierney; Derek Coombs, who also represented Wyre Forest; Ioan Evans, who also represented Aberdare; Leonard Cleaver; Henry Usborne, who also represented Acocks Green; Wesley Perrins; Sir Edward Salt; Archibald Gosling; and Alfred Jephcott.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-26_para23">
<a name="stpa_428">I am proud to represent my constituents and a seat with which my family has been associated for a very long time, and my party in the House. It is important that we recognise that we are all working, as we see it, in the best interests of those whom we represent. I only ask that over time my record shows that I am at least as hard-working and loyal to Yardley as those who have gone before me.

<b>19 May 2005 : Column 370</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>afternoon have I learned so much about the towns, cities and suburbs of our country. Clearly, they are all delightful. I imagine the claims of some might be stronger than others, but we have certainly benefited from some very good maiden speeches this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_429">Before I get on to the main points that I want to make, I shall refer to the contribution of the right hon. Member for Fylde (Michael Jack), who spoke about the case for biofuels. The Secretary of State and other Ministers in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are, I believe, genuinely committed to trying to find a way forward for biofuels, but in the past week <i>The Economist</i> reported on the development of biofuels across the globe and highlighted the extent to which the UK has fallen behind.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_430">Many other countries in Europe, the US and Brazil have gone far further ahead than we have, and there is a great danger that if we do not develop a domestic industry we will suck in imports from elsewhere. I urge the Secretary of State to do everything she can to use her influence to pressurise the Chancellor to take the decisive step. A biofuels obligation is what we need&#151;an obligation to have a mix of biofuels in any fuel sold for road transport. The consultation about it goes on and on; now we must have action. If the Secretary of State could apply pressure for that, the Liberal Democrats would be immensely grateful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_431">I shall focus my remarks on the aspects of the Queen&#039;s Speech relating to the Department of Trade and Industry. The leader in the <i>Financial Times</i> yesterday was headed, &quot;What the Queen should have said&quot;. It started by stating:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;My Government will interfere as little as possible with the economy and business&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_432">That seems a good starting point. It neatly encapsulates the Liberal Democrat approach to the role of Government in the management of the economy. It is clearly proper for the Government to have a role in producing carefully thought out regulation to protect workers, the environment and the consumer, but the burden of regulation has gone much further than that, and successive Governments are responsible for it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_433">The real message is that we must get Whitehall off the backs of business. To that end, it is our view that we should start by scrapping the DTI. It is an anachronism and at its heart there is a fatal conflict of interest. It is both the promoter of industry and its regulator on behalf of the consumer. That conflict cannot be justified or sustained. The two roles should be separated. There should be a Minister with responsibility for business in the Cabinet, and separate from that there should be a Department for consumer affairs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_434">I shall deal specifically with regulation. Continuing with its alternative Queen&#039;s Speech, the <i>Financial Times</i> leader went on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">&quot;The biggest priority will be to reduce the burden of regulation, which has continued to grow in spite of my Government&#039;s previous endeavours&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_435">That is absolutely right. In a globalised economy our big challenge is to enable our businesses to compete, particularly in the face of the massive threat from Asia, with the extraordinary growth rates of China, India and other Asian economies. The mindset of successive Governments has been that any problem requires new 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 371</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>laws to regulate it. Regulation is the first resort, rather than the last, both in the UK and the EU. We legislate too much.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_436">The Queen&#039;s Speech includes a commitment to introduce legislation to


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;streamline regulatory structures and to make it simpler to remove outdated and unnecessary legislation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_437">However, as has already been noted, there is an inherent contradiction in the Queen&#039;s Speech, as its very heavy legislative programme of 50&nbsp;Bills will bring in lots more regulation. The risk is that past experience will be repeated&#151;that the rhetoric will be correct, but that the burden in the real world will grow ever greater. It was reassuring to hear the Chancellor acknowledge at this week&#039;s CBI dinner that there had been many false starts, but will it be any different this time? That is the big question.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_438">The Government have placed much faith in the concept of the regulatory impact assessment. That is a move in the right direction, but Government guidelines are often not adhered to and, crucially, the process lacks independence. Departments assess their own draft regulations, but that seems rather self-serving, as the tendency is for them to justify what they do. The process needs an element of independence, along the lines of the Dutch model or that of the US Congressional Budget Office, with a person separate from the Department proposing regulations assessing whether they are necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_439">In this country, even when the regulatory impact assessment has been robust and regulation subsequently introduced, there is no process by which that regulation may be revisited so that its impact in practice can be assessed. That is why the concept of the sunset clause is so important.The hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) noted earlier that a former Secretary of State at the DTI recommended the use of sunset clauses, but it is still the case that they are never used. What are the Government&#039;s proposals in respect of sunset clauses? I believe that they should be a standard provision in all new regulation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_440">The Government say that they intend to set targets for slashing regulation&#151;another example of good rhetoric. To achieve that, they intend to establish a new quango called the better regulation executive to enforce the new targets. However, is there not a risk that the executive will be just another bureaucracy watching over the bureaucrats? Will it have any teeth? Could it be used to provide an independent assessment of new regulations proposed by the Government? If it can perform that role, it may be of some value.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_441">I come now to the European perspective. A vast volume of new regulation comes out of the EU, but there are two problems. First, the UK continues to gold-plate EU regulations and, secondly, the EU fails to assess the impact of its directives and regulations. New measures emanating from the Commission contain a form of regulatory impact assessment, but it lacks rigour. The two pages added at the end of a proposed measure amount to no more than waffle, with no real value or substance. The Government should use their presidency of the EU to tackle that problem. The Chancellor has said that economic reform must be a priority for our

<br>&nbsp;<br>presidency, and I absolutely support that. However, the problem of over-regulation coming from Europe must be addressed, as must the proliferation of regulation in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_442">Some encouraging signs are emerging from the new Commission. The flow of new regulation has subsided somewhat, and it is worth noting that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)&#151;until now a Member of the European Parliament&#151;pioneered the use of sunset clauses in provisions under the financial services action plan. That initiative should be followed in this place, as well as in Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para14">
<a name="stpa_443">As an employment lawyer, I want to say a little about the working time directive. When I worked in employment law, I made a great deal of money out of advising companies on, and guiding them through, myriad emerging regulations and guidance. Maintaining the UK opt-out will be a big test for the Government. The state should not prevent the citizen from working when they choose to work. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was right earlier today to distinguish between proper protection against exploitation of workers, which current provisions already provide for, and the state preventing a worker who wants to work from doing so. The latter goes beyond what is appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para15">
<a name="stpa_444">The impact on families, particularly children, of excessive working hours is a genuine issue, especially when both parents are in work. That is why, despite the understandable concerns of business, I do see a case for an improved deal on maternity leave and maternity pay, and for an extension of the right to request flexible working. If reduced hours, more flexibility in the hours worked or, in the case of certain types of employment, working from home enabled a worker to stay in that job and avoided destroying family life, the business itself might well benefit. On helping employers with the regulatory burden, the Liberal Democrat proposal for an enhanced maternity income guarantee would remove employers&#039; responsibility for administering that income, which would be paid directly by the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para16">
<a name="stpa_445">I want to finish by mentioning one or two other measures in the Queen&#039;s Speech. We certainly support the proposed commission for equality and human rights, but the objective must be to go beyond that and to establish a single equality Act. Doing so would codify and simplify myriad different provisions. There are 30&nbsp;Acts, 38&nbsp;statutory instruments, 11&nbsp;codes of practice and 12&nbsp;EU directives and recommendations in the field of discrimination&#151;a perfect example of the regulatory chaos that imposes an excessive burden on business and leaves the individual citizen completely confused as to their rights. A single equality Act would itself be a great deregulatory measure. It would simplify the law for business and clarify citizens&#039; rights. I hope that the Government will make a move on this issue and introduce a single equality Act, as well as creating a single commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para17">
<a name="stpa_446">On equal pay, a report this week shows that, according to the Department of Trade and Industry&#039;s own figures, there is a continuing huge income gap between men and women. On average, men still receive double the rate of pay received by women. As has already been highlighted today, for the role of Minister for Women to be an unpaid one is perhaps not the best

</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para18">
<a name="stpa_447">We very much support the long-overdue measure on consumer credit; indeed, it was extraordinary that it fell at the last hurdle before the general election. The current law dates back to the 1970s, and since then there has been a revolution in the availability of credit and the range of credit products. In the last Parliament, I was a member of the Treasury Select Committee. It conducted an inquiry into the credit and store card industry, which highlighted the fact that industry practices such as misleading promotions need addressing. It is important that the market acts properly and in the consumer&#039;s interest, and in that regard this proposed legislation is long overdue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para19">
<a name="stpa_448">We support proposals to reform company law. There should be a debate on reporting responsibilities in respect of environmental and social impacts, and on the case for the introduction of a duty of care on those impacts. We need to debate whether and how that could be done without imposing additional red tape on businesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-27_para20">
<a name="stpa_449">Finally, I want to mention the case for fair trade. A lobby in Parliament yesterday argued the case for fair trade. Given that today&#039;s debate focuses on the role of the Department of Trade and Industry as well as that of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, something should be said about that. We need to ensure that the Government and our representatives in the European Union do all that they can to press for a successful conclusion of the Doha round. In our view, we all have a moral duty to break down tariff barriers that prevent the developing world from trading fairly with us. Criticisms have been made of the United States, but in truth Europe is equally culpable. We have a moral duty to deliver fair trade and to do it quickly.

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. As Oliver Heald or as Oliver Letwin, I am delighted to be in the House. Having listened to some Liberal speeches, I am particularly delighted to be here as a recent potential victim of decapitation. It is nice to feel my head on my shoulders.
</p>

I look forward to interesting discussions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_451">This has been an excellent debate. It began with a magisterial survey from my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) of the fundamental problems associated with productivity and the effects of over-government on our economy. Very symmetrically, very beautifully and, I must say, very astonishingly, it ended with an equally splendid speech to much the same effect from the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb). I sat listening carefully for the moment when I would depart from what he was saying, but I have to say that I agreed, I think, with every word of it. That worries

<br>&nbsp;<br>me intensely: it is possible either that my hon. Friend the Member for Havant and I now find ourselves somehow oddly transmuted into Liberals, or it is possible that the Liberals have transmuted themselves into a kind of Conservative party on economics. I hope that it is the latter, but I am delighted to find that there is agreement on the whole Opposition side on the great need for deregulation and a lightening of the burden that the Government place on our economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_452">We heard an interesting and important contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton), who reinforced the observations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Havant about fundamental economic problems. That was matched, at least, by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Michael Jack), who was the Chairman of the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the last Parliament. He explained the importance of climate change and biofuels, to which I shall return. We had an instructive speech from my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Damian Green). It was a powerful and penetrating analysis of the complex debate on the future of electricity supply, to which I shall also refer. He demonstrated yet again the power of his intellect. Finally on the Conservative Benches, apart from the maiden speeches, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) stirred the Secretary of State into a passion and into arguing that the procedures of the House were somehow satisfactory. I have to say that I share my hon. and learned Friend&#039;s view that they are not wholly satisfactory. Of course, he did not discuss only that: he also analysed the wide-ranging problems relating to rural areas, another topic to which I shall come in a moment.

I listened with particular interest to the contribution from the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)&#151;I have been associated with that city for a long time, though I have to admit that I did not know some of the history that he brought out&#151;and to the speeches of the hon. Members for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy); for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander), whose constituency will, I hope, be renamed in due course; and for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming), who told us a great deal about features of Birmingham that I did not know.

Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), who told us about the effects of regional government on the ability of Bournemouth to fulfil its potential. I could add that that is a problem that stretches not only to West Dorset, but to the rest of the United Kingdom. I warmly congratulate my hon.

<b>19 May 2005 : Column 375</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_455">The debate relates not just to trade and industry, but to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Naturally enough, it is to that that I want to turn. It is appropriate that we should have a wide-ranging debate on the activities of that Department, because debates on such matters, as the Liberal spokesman pointed out at the beginning of our proceedings, are relatively rare in Government time, and more so because, while I do not doubt that Ministers intend to do the best by the countryside and the environment, the fact is that the Department, which surveys a scene including some 14,000&nbsp;bureaucratic posts, has severe problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_456">The first problem is that the Department has not established an energy policy that will enable the UK to play its full part in protecting the planet. The second is that it has not achieved a sustainable basis for agriculture and fishing in this country. The third, alas, is that it has not adequately protected rural communities and the countryside. I want to raise those three issues before moving on to the legislation proposed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_457">Let me start with energy policy. This is a remarkable scene. Between 1990&nbsp;and 1997, this country made significant progress in reaching the target on the Kyoto basket of greenhouse gases. They reduced in millions of tonnes of carbon equivalent by about 8&nbsp;per cent. in that period. Incidentally, to prevent Ministers from jumping to their feet, I fully admit that that was largely due to the dash for gas and that the large motive for that was economic rather than environmental. Nevertheless, it had a significant and beneficial effect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_458">That is mirrored in the fact that, during that period, carbon dioxide emissions themselves reduced by 6.9&nbsp;per cent., which is a broadly commensurate amount. Since 1997, I fear, the figure and the pattern have been quite different. It is perfectly true that further progress has been made in meeting the Kyoto target. The Kyoto basket gases have declined by a further 5&nbsp;per cent., broadly, but the picture beneath that is by no means so comforting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_459">Carbon dioxide emissions have risen by about 3&nbsp;per cent., and the fact that there has been ostensible progress on the Kyoto basket is accounted for by just three things. First, there has been significant further improvement in farming practice. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from farming have significantly declined. Secondly, landfill methane has significantly declined. Thirdly, and this is the single largest component, there was a one-off shift, which I mentioned in an intervention earlier, in the production of adipic acid, which led to a significant reduction&#151;some 4&nbsp;million tonnes equivalent of carbon&#151;in nitrous oxide emissions. That occurred between 1998&nbsp;and 1999. It is an admirable thing and a great contribution, but it is not replicable. We cannot do it twice. We are no longer producing adipic acid on the old technology. We cannot improve again by the same degree.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_460">We should consider the carbon dioxide pattern and, first in this context, the electricity supply industry, although we must not delude ourselves that it is the only component. It represents, however, roughly 40&nbsp;per cent. of the problem. All the trends are going the wrong way, alas. Combined heat and power schemes have been declining. There are 64&nbsp;mothballed plants, one of which 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 376</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I saw during the early stages of the election campaign. Between 2002&nbsp;and 2004, coal-based production increased, which will produce carbon dioxide problems. Nuclear production is declining and, from 2008, as stations are decommissioned, it will decline further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_461">The Government, properly and splendidly, have placed great hope in renewables. The Government&#039;s energy White Paper of 2003&nbsp;shows that the proposals would lead to only about 3&nbsp;per cent. of the 1990&nbsp;baseline, in terms of carbon dioxide emissions&#151;165&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon being knocked off by renewables entering the system by 2020.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_462">As someone who has dealt with the electricity industry here and in other countries over the past 25&nbsp;years, I can say that there is nothing in the patterns of that industry that gives confidence regarding persistent and sustainable reductions in carbon dioxide to the level required to meet the Kyoto targets, still less the appropriate and much tougher regime that the Government have established with their 20&nbsp;per cent, target.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_463">The 2003&nbsp;White Paper shows that the Government themselves effectively admit that. The White Paper realistically supposes that almost all&#151;80&nbsp;per cent.&#151;of the effect generated in meeting targets is to come from energy efficiency, but there is a problem here, too. I do not doubt the intentions of Ministers, particularly in this Department, to achieve things in energy efficiency. Unfortunately, Ministers in this Department do not have many of the levers and have not been successful so far in persuading the rest of Government to pull the relevant levers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_464">I shall give some examples. First, the energy efficiency scheme is not structured in a way that is likely to produce good results. Why not? Because it gives incentives to the utilities to reduce the use of energy in homes and, alas, the utilities have a strong commercial reason to increase the use of energy in homes. As others cannot play in that market place and are not allowed to receive the credits, it is unlikely that the scheme will be effective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para15">
<a name="stpa_465">Secondly, Ministers clearly want a movement, as I do, to increasing efficiency in the use of road transport, particularly of cars. Clearly, there is a method to do that, which is to use vehicle excise duty, on which we have made proposals. However, the incentives for hybrid and high mileage per gallon cars are slight. There is some progress, but it has been slight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para16">
<a name="stpa_466">Thirdly, UK emissions trading is a splendid idea that we backed, and which I fully back. I should like to see the scheme allied to an effective EU-wide energy emissions trading system. However, the fact is that neither scheme at the moment incorporates air transport, and that is a pretty large hole because air transport emissions are growing apace, while the Government are locked in a legal battle with the EU over the ETS in any event.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para17">
<a name="stpa_467">As I survey the scene&#151;coming back to it relatively fresh and trying to be objective, and not in a partisan manner or trying to score points&#151;I see a pattern of Ministers of good will trying to achieve effects but not having found the levers. I see a Government who are gradually moving towards either failing to meet their targets or nearly doing so, and certainly failing to meet their own superimposed targets. That is a sad state of affairs.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para18">
<a name="stpa_468">On agriculture, I am afraid that the story is not dissimilar. I have been involved in agriculture on behalf of my constituents since a time when there were quite other Agriculture Ministers. I have talked to Ministers, and to farmers and fishermen from my constituency, over the past 10&nbsp;years. I have seen the same patterns reinforced over and over again. Since 1997, farm output is down by 5&nbsp;per cent. and farm incomes are down by 14&nbsp;per cent. in real terms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para19">
<a name="stpa_469">The single farm payment is a nightmare. Only yesterday, I found some performance targets that the Secretary of State had published for the Rural Payments Agency. Not much fuss was made about them but if you examined them, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;given your constituency, you might want to look at them&#151;you would find that the first item is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;To commence payments under the Single Payment (SPS) by February 2006&nbsp;and to process and pay 96&nbsp;per cent. of valid SPS claims by value by 31&nbsp;March 2006.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para20">
<a name="stpa_470">It does not say so but it means, &quot;We the Government have given up on the claim that we will have made the payments by the end of February. Instead, we are setting a target that will allow us to fulfil it if we make a single payment to one farmer by the end of February, as long as 96&nbsp;per cent. of the remainder are made by the end of March&quot;&#151;a month&#039;s slip&#151;&quot;and 4&nbsp;per cent. at some future, unknown date.&quot; That will come as no surprise to farmers because not one farmer in Britain believed that we would get there by February. I fear that I am not convinced that we will fulfil the target of 96&nbsp;per cent. by the end of March.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para21">
<a name="stpa_471">The cross-compliance regime is set to be a nightmare. In addition, bovine tuberculosis has been increasing by 20&nbsp;per cent. a year and there is no serious solution on offer. I know that Ministers are worried about that but I perceive no solution from them despite a letter sent by 350&nbsp;vets and scientists on 24&nbsp;February demanding a selective cull.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para22">
<a name="stpa_472">The over-30-month scheme continues to impose huge costs on the taxpayer and the National Beef Association tells us that it also imposes huge costs on the industry. I know that Ministers would like it to end, but, again, it has not happened. Margins in the liquid milk industry are much greater in the supermarkets than for the processors or the farmers, yet I have been persistently unsuccessful in persuading the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry or the Office of Fair Trading to do anything serious by way of an investigation or improving the code of conduct.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para23">
<a name="stpa_473">The disposal of carcases remains a terrible problem, which has recently got worse as a result of Government action. Again, I am sure that Ministers want a solution but none is forthcoming. Illegal imports continue apace. We have the spectacle of nine sniffer dogs trying to control all the illegal meat imports at 110&nbsp;entry points. It is clear that, in addition to failing to find the levers for achieving a sustainable, effective reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, Ministers have failed to support sustainable agriculture.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para24">
<a name="stpa_474">Let us consider the countryside and rural communities. I am sure that Liberal colleagues and the majority of Labour Members share our desire for the countryside and rural communities to flourish. That element of our society works. Indeed, our villages are models of societies that work. People look out for one 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 378</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>another and grow up in ways that do not lead to the sort of behaviour that rightly preoccupies the Prime Minister. Alas, those communities have been neglected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para25">
<a name="stpa_475">I shall give only three examples of that. The first is simple but important: village halls. I dare say that, to most Labour Members and those who represent urban seats, village halls do not appear an important matter. A village hall is only a small object; a little space sitting in the middle of a village somewhere. Yet the whole social fabric of villages in the rural areas of our country depends on the village hall. That is the place where people come together for the many voluntary activities, from playgroups to Gilbert and Sullivan, and from art clubs to first responders. That is where they meet and manage to create something that gives meaning to terms such as &quot;community&quot;, which are often meaningless and abused.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para26">
<a name="stpa_476">What is the pattern? Until 1997, many village halls were being reformed and reconstituted through lottery grants. What has happened since 1997? I fear that the Department, which was designed to preside over the protection and enhancement of our rural areas, has not allowed those halls to be funded substantially through the lottery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para27">
<a name="stpa_477">I accept that village post offices have been closing for a long time and that the Government inherited the problem. Have they done anything to lessen it? Alas, no. Despite the splendid origins of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who is now in his place, despite the fact that he and I locked horns on the subject some years ago, and that he and the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) also locked horns on the matter, rural post offices continue to close in large numbers in my constituency and many others throughout the country. There have been 3,000&nbsp;closures since 1997, despite rate relief and the so-called promotion of co-location of services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para28">
<a name="stpa_478">The worst case of all is that of affordable housing. Many Members from rural constituencies&#151;not only Conservative Members but others who have no axe to grind for the Conservative thesis, including some Liberal Members making their maiden speeches&#151;have said today that the problem of affordable housing in rural areas is now acute. This is a two-edged problem involving high house prices resulting from the pressure of people purchasing holiday homes, second homes and retirement homes, alongside the relatively low-wage economies in rural communities. A solution is required, and I do not deny that Ministers clearly wish to find one&#151;in fact, they have talked about doing so&#151;but no solution is on offer today. Any solution has to involve shared ownership, but that is not forthcoming on a major scale.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para29">
<a name="stpa_479">All these rural problems&#151;village halls, post offices, affordable housing and a range of others&#151;can be set against a background of specific disadvantage in the grant regime for rural areas. The grant regime has consciously been reoriented to pour money into the cities. There are real problems in our inner cities: I know from my time as shadow Home Secretary just how acute the problems in our most deprived inner-city areas are and just how much needs to be done to re-create a sense of solidarity, community and society in those areas. I do not deny that that need exists, but the fact is that the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 379</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>rural areas are now significantly and unfairly disadvantaged by the grant regime. The Department has, in part, presided over that, too.

<p>
<a name="50519-28_para30">
<a name="stpa_480">Are these fundamental problems addressed by the legislation in the Queen&#039;s Speech? I fear that they are not. There is nothing in the Queen&#039;s Speech on the energy agenda, or on the agricultural agenda. I promise that we will engage constructively with the Government on the animal welfare Bill, and on the common land Bill, which I can tell my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) is not a land grab. We think that it involves a series of technical measures that deserve our support in principle, and we will work with the Government to ensure that they work. We are also glad to see the draft Marine Bill, although it is a pity that it is only a draft Bill and that it does not address the wider issues of the common fisheries policy. Nevertheless, we will engage constructively with the Government on that Bill as well.

 Does not the list that my right hon. Friend read out inform us about the way in which the Government operate? There are now more civil servants than soldiers in the Ministry of Defence or policemen in the Home Office. I dare say that there will be more civil servants in DEFRA and its various agencies than there are farmers throughout the United Kingdom and that before very long there will be more civil servants than sheep and cattle on our farms.
</p>








<p><a name="st_173"><a name="50519-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 I must correct my hon. and learned Friend. We have studied the ratio, and it is not quite as he says. It is only true that there are more officials in DEFRA and its satrapies than there are dairy farms in England. It is not, however, just a matter of the number of people. It is a matter of the number of bodies, of the interlocking structures that they create, and of the forms and the regulation that they produce. It is a matter of the fact that our farmers and rural communities are being driven mad by over-regulation. That is not because Ministers want to over-regulate to such a degree. It is not because Ministers want to create administrative chaos. It is because they have not managed to find a means of slimming down a leviathan.
</p>

<a name="50519-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_484">Let me say something about how we intend to pursue these matters in the coming months. This is a new Parliament. The Government have a new mandate: they have a mandate to rule. It would be absurd if we spent the next few months talking about what we would do four or five years from now, but we want to be constructive. We will present proposals in the spirit of applying constructive pressure on Government in the national interest. Let me describe some of those proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_485">In relation to energy policy, we put pressure on the Government to create more incentives for cleaner cars. We will put pressure on the Government to implement the renewable transport fuels obligation, which our colleagues in the other place installed in the Sustainable Energy Act 2003&nbsp;and which was originally suggested by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde. We will put pressure on the Government to promote micro-generation, as provided for in the 2003&nbsp;Act. We will put pressure on the Government to work with house builders on zero emissions developments, which could make a major contribution to energy efficiency. We will put pressure on the Government to open up competition in the energy efficiency commitment, so that the scheme begins to produce the dividends that I believe it could produce.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_486">Most important, my hon. Friend the Member for Havant and I will put pressure on the two Secretaries of State for a full review of the electricity supply industry, taking full account of both the environmental and the economic constraints so that we can try to achieve a national consensus on a way forward that can reconcile our economic requirements with our environmental obligations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_487">In relation to agriculture and fisheries, we will put pressure on Ministers to simplify the cost compliance regime massively, and we will make specific proposals. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 381</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>We will put pressure on Ministers to improve the labelling regime, so that consumers in this country can know for the first time where their food comes from, what they are eating, whether it meets the animal welfare standards imposed in Britain, and how far it has travelled. We will put pressure on Ministers to take real steps to improve public purchasing of meat and other commodities so that it does not disadvantage our farmers. We will put pressure on Ministers to come up with a serious solution to the bovine tuberculosis problem, using culling licences under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992. We will propose, and put pressure on Ministers to implement, revisions of the fallen stock scheme to solve the fallen stock problem. Most immediately, we will put sustained pressure on Ministers to provide relief under the single farm payment scheme through interim payments in the next few months, based on historic grants, and a set of guarantees that farmers will not be penalised for submitting forms based on faulty data from the Rural Payments Agency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_488">In relation to rural communities, we will press Ministers for a serious approach to shared ownership. We will press Ministers for a new look at village facilities and at the unfairness of the grant regime to rural areas. Finally, we will put whatever pressure we can on the Government as a whole to devolve power to counties and districts and away from the rural development agencies and other large and unnecessary regional bodies. I hope that, over the coming months, we will be able to persuade the Secretary of State to adopt increasing proportions of that agenda, because we do not want another four years of wasted opportunity.

He also drew attention to the legislative proposals in the Queen&#039;s Speech. The speech by the hon. Member for Havant was, in some ways, witty and it was interesting, but my overwhelming impression was that it mirrored strongly the stance taken during the general election by his party in that it identified some of the problems that face the country without contributing any potential solutions. The closest he came to saying anything concrete was when my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) challenged him on regional selective assistance. The hon.

<a name="stpa_490">We have had a most interesting general debate. As a number of hon. Members have said, it has been distinguished not only by the fact that a considerable number of maiden speeches have been made, which totalled 10&nbsp;I think, but by the fact that the maiden speeches&#151;I say this entirely sincerely and it is not a criticism of returning Members&#151;have been of unusual quality. Hon. Members of every party, on both sides of the House, made maiden speeches that were truly excellent. They were an indication of the quality of our new Members, who will clearly make an immense contribution to our debates.
</p>

<a name="50519-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_491">My hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) was the first to make a maiden speech. It is obviously customary to compliment all maiden speeches, but today that has not been at all difficult. I was particularly pleased to see her in her place making her first contribution. I have been fortunate enough to work with her in varying capacities&#151;both in her case and mine&#151;over a number of years, most latterly when she served as a special adviser to the previous Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Both her constituency experience and her other experience made her able to make a good contribution to the debate. Hers was a very good start to the maiden speeches. I particularly welcomed her reference to modern apprenticeships.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_492">As I say, 10&nbsp;maiden speeches were made in all. One of the distinguishing features of the maiden speeches&#151;I hope that no one will mind if I weave them all together&#151;was the skill that new Members showed in weaving in particular issues while observing the customary courtesies of the House by being not too controversial and not too long, describing their constituencies and being graceful to their predecessors. As all of us know, that is not as easy to do as it sounds.
</p>

<a name="stpa_493">The hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) touched on his concern about phone masts in his constituency. As he will find before he has been here much longer, that concern is widely shared and expressed in the House. The speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) was not only clear and witty but poetic, which is perhaps not so common. My hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove) talked of her passion for education. Like a number of hon. Members, the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) talked about affordable housing. That is a common theme across the House. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello) welcomed warmly and effectively the renewal that he has seen in his constituency. That was a feature of the speeches by Labour Members, who identified and welcomed the improvements, not least in levels of employment&#151;almost every one of them mentioned the fall in unemployment. For some curious reason that was not such a common feature in the speeches of new. Members from Opposition Benches, but I am sure that the trend will change. In future they will be happy to give credit to the Government where improvements have taken place.

<a name="stpa_494">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr.&nbsp;Ellwood) talked about education funding and the hon.

Members will not always find it easy to remember the full glory of his constituency title and I hope that he will not take that amiss. Sometimes one wonders how the Boundary Commission spends its time, but never mind. I say that with particular feeling because in the last boundary changes commissioners came up with the distinctive treatment for my constituency of calling my seat Derby, South and my immediate neighbour&#039;s seat South Derbyshire. If they had been a little more inventive, as clearly they have been with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, it might have been easier for people to remember which was which.

He said that the job losses that we have now seen in manufacturing would previously have been unthinkable, but I recall a number of job losses, not least in manufacturing, under the Tory Government over many years. I also, however, remember that he was as equally keen to challenge that Government on these issues as he has been to challenge ours. That is reasonable enough.

<a name="stpa_498">I disagreed in part with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s emphasis on productive jobs. I take his point entirely and he knows that I share his view about the importance of manufacturing as part of our economic base, but I do not share the assumption, which perhaps did not underlie his remarks but which often seems to underlie such remarks in this House, that jobs in the police service or in nursing, for example, are somehow not productive. They are extremely necessary and welcome. I am very conscious of the fact that some measures of productivity are rather artificial and do not create a full picture. I do not think that he would dispute that. He asked me specifically to comment on the issue of Rover. All I can say is that, as my right hon. Friend said in his opening remarks, we are mindful that Sir Brian Nicholson is undertaking a study at present and we do not wish in any way to pre-empt what he might say.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>indeed a reference, particularly in the context of the G8, to the important issue of climate change. Without making the Queen&#039;s Speech inordinately long, it would have been difficult to work in some of the references that he would have liked to the need to influence other member states, whether the United States, China, India or others. I accept that those are key factors.

<a name="stpa_500">The right hon. Member for Fylde also said that it would have been desirable to say more in the context of the G8&nbsp;about biodiversity. In fact, we were lucky recently, at a meeting in Derbyshire of the G8&nbsp;Environment and Development Ministers, to reach agreement on illegal logging, which we hope will have much effect in the future. I wholly share his concern for the development of biomass and biofuels as an energy source&#151;a concern also expressed by the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb). I remind both of them that we have a taskforce under way under the chairmanship of Sir Ben Gill, which I hope will have some useful contribution to make on these issues.

I am not arguing that any of this is enough. There is much more undoubtedly to do, but to talk as though there has been no improvement is to ignore not only the record of the previous Government, but the record of change and improvement over which this Government have presided.

Friend an injustice because I am sure that he would not be in favour of taking anything from the people. It is indeed the case that a Bill on common land is needed. It has been called for by nearly every rural organisation, including the Country Land and Business Association, although I do not doubt that, as always, there will be issues about the detail. The Bill is intended to modernise outdated legislation, to provide better local management of common land and to enable commoners and landowners to work together to manage the land, update the register and so forth. It will be a worthwhile measure, which some sceptical Members might even support.

I doubt whether the business community would welcome that. Only a few days ago, the deputy director of the CBI said that a Department for wealth creation was the best place to deal with regulation, trade and business issues. Only by handling such issues are we able to deal with problems relating to the growth of red tape that are often raised in the House. I do not believe that the clientele to which the hon.

Secondly, I accept that the right hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>small and, I hope, speedy advisory commission on rural housing. It should specifically deal with the issues that the right hon. Gentleman and others have raised. We are very conscious of the degree to which that is an issue, not least in rural areas.

However, the right hon. Gentleman is right to say that we have not made as much progress in tackling CO <sub>2</sub>  as we had hoped, although in the early years of this Government we did do so. He made a common error&#151;I hope that he does not mind me saying so&#151;in referring to the contribution made by the switch in power sourcing from coal to gas. That makes a diminishing contribution to the reduction in emissions. It is often claimed that most of the changes are accounted for by the switch from coal to gas, but that is no longer the case. Only about 25&nbsp;per cent. of the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can now be attributed to that switch.

He also mentioned vehicle excise duty and fuel incentives, and he knows that the Government have taken action on those and keep continually under review where and how we should do more, not least on aviation. That issue will be a key feature of our EU presidency. It is such a relief to be able to refer straightforwardly to our EU presidency, instead of adding the caveats, &quot;If we win our seats&quot;, or &quot;If we are the Government&quot;. It will be a key goal in the Environment Council to seek agreement with our colleagues to introduce aviation into the emissions trading scheme by 2008. That would be an important first step, because although the international community as a whole has long said that we have to tackle the issue, nothing has been done. If we can show that such steps work in Europe, it might provide the entr&#233;e for a much wider approach.

We would have liked it to be less onerous and less detailed, but&#151;as he will know&#151;such matters are decided on a cross-governmental basis. In his remarks, the right hon. Gentleman rose above the substantial change in the CAP that I negotiated two or three years ago and which will mean, over time, a real revolution and simplification for British farming. I accept, with great regret, that considerable teething problems have occurred in the transition, perhaps inevitably, but I assure him that we are doing everything that we can to overcome those problems.

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State, not only for what she has just said but because she has been in correspondence with me about a constituency company called World Flowers. It has faced a hugely intrusive and expensive inspection regime that is partly the fault of the European Union. However, the implementation of the regime by her Department has made it much more intrusive and expensive than it need be. Will she agree to have a meeting with me and, possibly, my constituents to talk through whether something can be done to alleviate the regime? It is part of the over-regulation that impinges on the company in this country and on the farmers in Kenya who produce the flowers that World Flowers import, and it is doing serious damage to them as well.

 I will do what I can. If I can meet the hon. Gentleman and his constituents I shall certainly do so, but if not I will ask one of my ministerial team to do so. I take his point, which is a serious one and is among a number on which we are conscious that there are legitimate concerns about whether we are handling things in too detailed a way that can become oppressive. The balance is always difficult to strike and I am the last person to assert that we always get it right, which is why we are grateful to Members on both sides of the House for bringing such issues to our attention, and why we will always undertake to consider them as carefully as we can.

 I have been patiently waiting to see whether the Secretary of State would raise the issue of bovine TB, which is a serious one for those of us who represent constituencies in the west country. Bovine TB is a cause of great economic loss, especially when subsidies are being reduced. Will the Secretary of State have another real look at the issue? Farmers in my constituency believe that her Department is now in possession of sufficient facts from the Krebs reviews to make a real announcement and take proper action on the matter. I shall be writing to ask her if she will meet a delegation of my most informed farmers.

We are keeping the issue under review and we look closely at the evidence.

We are working through our presidency of the G8, as we shall through our presidency of the European Union, to see how much we can do to tackle that issue. We have already held a successful scientific meeting in Exeter, which established that there may be even greater dangers than we thought.

<a name="stpa_517">In March, we held an immensely successful meeting of Energy and Environment Ministers from about 20&nbsp;countries, which may not have impinged as fully on the attention of Members as it might have done had we not been thought to be approaching a general election. There was a real stimulus and exchange of ideas about how to tackle energy supply across the world in future. The choices that are made in coming years, not least in China and India, for example, will have an immense influence on the impact of climate change.

<p><a name="st_189"><a name="50519-31_spnew2"><b> Mr. Graham Allen  (Nottingham, North) (Lab):</b> 
 My constituents in Nottingham, North are fed up and sick and tired of the activities of a small group of antisocial Travellers who have lighted on my constituency on six different sites over the past seven weeks. At Easter, that group broke into Springfield primary school, for the second time in a year, then into a local leisure centre, then on to a local cricket field, and then on to other leisure facilities attached to a local college. This is not about the proper provision of Traveller sites, which I fully support, since an official Traveller site is located only a few hundred yards away from where most of the illegal encampments took place. This particular group of Travellers has no interest whatsoever in locating on the approved site, and equally has no concern for their damage and despoliation, the human and other waste that they left behind, and the inconvenience to and intimidation of local residents that they caused.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_522">There was a far greater impact on the schoolchildren than just their playing field being occupied and out of action, meaning no games lessons. The children were unable to use their playground because it bordered the camp, and the Travellers&#039; dogs kept climbing through the fence, barking and chasing them. The Traveller children shouted abuse or threw things at the pupils when they did try to play outside, and on one occasion fired air rifles close to the fence until the police intervened. That lack of outdoor exercise space has obviously had a great impact not only on the sport curriculum but on the breaks and lunchtime play of those young people. Incidentally, personal antisocial behaviour orders are prohibitively expensive to pursue in such circumstances, where individuals are highly mobile.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_523">There are many other examples of that behaviour, some on other sites, in my constituency over the past two months on which I could elaborate if time permitted. The law needs to be changed to protect my constituents from this extreme antisocial behaviour, and here are 10&nbsp;suggestions that I should like the Minister to think about and perhaps respond to today. First, provision has been made in the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003&nbsp;for the police to be able to move trespassers off a site when they have no legal right to be there. Unfortunately, that power is available only if the local authority has itself provided a site for Travellers in the area. The power does not acknowledge the existence of private site provision in the local authority area and does not recognise the difficulty that compact and fully developed cities such as Nottingham have in finding land in their area to provide a suitable site. Even if a local authority provided a site just a few yards over its boundary into a neighbouring authority, it would still not be able to use the aforementioned provisions in the 2003&nbsp;Act. That has been confirmed by the Home Office to staff at Nottingham city council. Nottingham does own some land that may be suitable, but it is in the nearby Ashfield district council area. Those three legal inhibitions need to be amended in the light of our experiences.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 391</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_524">Secondly, I ask the Minister to consider a change to section 61&nbsp;of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. At present, one of the preconditions for the use of that power is that there must be six or more vehicles on the site. I suggest that a reduction in that number should be seriously considered. Splitting a group of 10&nbsp;vehicles into two nearby groups of five is a common device. Last month, in my constituency, one Traveller caused difficulties at Bulwell lido, and he only had his own caravan on the land.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_525">Thirdly, rather than the occupier having to ask trespassers to leave, the legal onus should be on the group that is trespassing to produce proof from the owner of authority of permission to stay. At Springfield primary school, it took nearly two weeks to move the Travellers on the first occasion. On the most recent occasion, it took six days, and that was supposed to be a rapid eviction as some residents signed statements to say that they recognised people from the previous visit, meaning that the first eviction order could be re-served. If the Travellers were moved off more rapidly, they would not have time to create the waste&#151;for example, the building rubble and the unguarded household appliances&#151;or time to set fire to and leave burned-out caravans on such sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_526">Fourthly, land with a clear pre-existing use should be safeguarded. It beggars belief that school grounds and playing fields can suffer such loss. They should be put on a list of prohibited sites safeguarded by criminal trespass legislation, which would enable Travellers to be moved on by the police instantly, without the need to go through expensive and time-consuming court processes or the two or three-day wait for bailiffs to be available to act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_527">Fifthly, perhaps the Minister&#039;s team can examine how criminal damage and criminal trespass provisions can be more easily enforced. In the school example, the school field was secured with padlocked and chained gates. Residents saw the Travellers cut through those to gain entry. Then the Travellers claimed that the gates had been open all the time and were open when they arrived. Sadly, no one would make a formal statement to the police because they had to live in close proximity to those Travellers until the Travellers&#039; eviction, and they feared the consequences. On the second occasion, a policeman saw three people with bolt croppers, but they vanished into the group of caravans and the Travellers denied everything.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_528">The school had to reinforce the gates even further with welded plates on hinges, boxes over the locks and so on. As the work was being completed, the convoy of Travellers, who had just been evicted from the cricket ground round the corner where they had settled again, told the workmen that they would be back and no one would stop them getting on the field again. Perhaps the Minister will re-examine relevant provisions relating to collective responsibility, and look again at the use of the legal device &quot;common purpose&quot; in respect of a group of people who arrive at a site that was secure before they arrived.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_529">Sixthly, eviction orders should apply for a longer period. Once they have been granted, the direction should be not to return to that particular land at any future time. More modestly, a five-year limit could 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 392</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>apply, with a clause that does not require a further return to court or 24&nbsp;hours&#039; notice of eviction, to make it possible for police to evict on receipt of a signed witness statement from a member of the public, which is usually available within hours of Travellers moving on to a site. It took the Springfield head teacher just three phone calls to find someone prepared to provide a statement last time. If the Travellers decided to contest the eviction, the signed statement would surely be sufficient for court evidence.
</p>

<p><a name="st_190"><a name="50519-32_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bill Olner  (Nuneaton) (Lab):</b> 
 I recognise the scene that my hon. Friend is describing to the Minister. It is all the more galling when there are spaces available on licensed sites but Travellers will not go there. Where there are vacancies on such sites, Travellers should be forced to go there. More importantly, there should be provision to prevent them from leapfrogging from one place to another. I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s case and I hope the Minister will respond robustly.
</p>








<p><a name="st_191"><a name="50519-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Allen: </b> 
 My hon. Friend speaks with great authority and, sadly, great experience. I hope the Minister will take my hon. Friend&#039;s points on board when he responds today and in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_530">My seventh point is that the eviction order should prevent Travellers from resettling within the county boundaries except in an authorised site. In my constituency Travellers were finally moved from one site, only to settle just down the road, so the whole process had to start all over again. That happened not once, but six consecutive times within seven weeks, making clowns of the police, the council and local residents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_531">Eighthly, compensation for damage needs to be levied. There is currently no deterrent for despoiling sites or leaving waste behind. For example, at Springfield school it required specialist contractors to remove the waste. Even when the site is cleared and cut, it takes time for the field to be washed by the weather of some of what was left behind by the Travellers, which I shall not describe in detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_532">When the Travellers left Springfield infants school last September, they were told not to use the field for a month. In April, after the winter weather, the school was just about to begin using the field again when the Travellers returned. Since that time, the youngsters have not been able to go back and use the site. They have been without a playing field for nine months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_533">Each time such a thing happens, the school budget suffers, as it costs &#163;875&nbsp;just to clear the field of debris. That amount does not cover any other of the processes, such as cutting, that may be required. Mine is one of the UK&#039;s most deprived constituencies, and schools there can ill afford to pay out such sums from their budgets. The head teacher has to choose between providing books and equipment for children struggling to do well at school, and cleaning up after that group of antisocial Travellers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_534">Last summer, Travellers in my constituency cost local council tax payers about &#163;40,000&nbsp;in damage and in environmental costs. I have yet to get an estimate for the cost of the court cases, but there is no doubt that it runs into thousands of pounds. Therefore, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider the use of fixed penalty 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 393</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>notices for littering. Where individuals refuse to pay, orders should be attached to their caravans and vehicles. Fixed penalty notices are difficult to administer when people refuse to give their names and permanent addresses, but it should be possible to build up information on the small number of antisocial Travellers through use of their permanent winter bases, as that is where their benefits are sent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_535">I also hope that the Minister will look at the Police Reform Act 2002, which allows property to be seized. That should be extended, so that police can clamp and seize cars, caravans and land assets if eviction notices are not obeyed, if fines are not paid and if damage caused by antisocial Travellers is not paid for. Of all the issues that anger my constituents, it is the ability of antisocial Travellers to despoil land with impunity and without effective redress that enrages them most. The Government must put a stop to that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_536">Ninthly, the Department for Constitutional Affairs should issue clear guidance to the courts to ensure that proceedings are much faster. Local delays with the Traveller group to which I have referred meant that local communities had to suffer to an unacceptable extent. Perhaps the DCA can learn from what has subsequently been agreed locally by Nottingham city council and our area courts service. I pay tribute to both organisations, and to the police, in the very difficult circumstances that I have set out. They have agreed that cases involving Travellers will be dealt with the same degree of urgency as domestic violence injunctions, although that remains subject to the judiciary being prepared to add such cases to the list. However, the DCA should ensure that that practice becomes commonplace. Government have a responsibility to devise effective protocols.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_537">It is recommended that local council officers serving notices be accompanied by a police officer to prevent delays. That results from the fact that council officers going about their normal duties have been intimidated by dogs owned by the Travellers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_538">My tenth and final point is that the current law of trespass&#151;and the word &quot;trespass&quot; merely means &quot;illegally passing through&quot;, perhaps only for a minute or two&#151;needs to be updated. I hope that the Minister will look at the concept of &quot;extended trespass&quot;. That would mean that a person who stayed on someone else&#039;s property for longer than a specific time&#151;say, three hours&#151;would be committing an offence, and therefore liable to penalties and the payment of compensation. Everyone to whom I have spoken has pleaded that the time should be made specific, as should all other prohibitions in this area. Invariably, the legal term &quot;reasonable&quot; becomes a lawyer&#039;s playground at the expense of those who have to suffer extended antisocial behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_539">I hope that the Minister and his new Travellers unit in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will look at my 10-point plan, and give my long-suffering constituents some relief. I invite the unit to visit my constituency so that its members can learn from our recent experiences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_540">I emphasise that none of the powers that I have suggested would be used against law-abiding Travellers. I hope that the changes will be welcomed by settled communities and by the majority of law-abiding Travellers and their organisations. It is in everyone&#039;s

<p><a name="st_192"><a name="50519-32_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick): </b> 
 I begin by thanking my fellow out-of-trade member of the Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty&#039;s Household trade union, my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen), for his very generous remarks, and for bringing this matter to the House&#039;s attention. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recognises the very difficult problems that can arise when trying to find suitable accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers, and I acknowledge the considerable disturbance and distress experienced by my hon. Friend&#039;s constituents in this case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_542">We in the ODPM take these issues very seriously. We have been working hard, and will continue to do so, to find solutions to these problems and to alleviate the distress that local people are experiencing. In the last Session, we put in place a framework of powers and resources to allow local authorities to provide the necessary new authorised sites, and to take effective action against unauthorised sites. We now need to make sure that local authorities pick up those powers and use them effectively. The ODPM has established a dedicated Gypsy and Traveller unit to work with local authorities and to support them in that process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_543">We are also helping in a practical way: with money. Government funding is now being made available for sites. In 2005&#150;06, the Gypsy sites refurbishment grant is available for new sites, as well as for the refurbishment of existing ones. Its aim is to increase the number of authorised pitches available to Gypsies and Travellers, and therefore to reduce the need for unauthorised sites. In addition, mainstream funding via the regional housing pot will also be made available for local authority and registered social landlord sites from 2006&#150;07.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_544">Our aim is to reduce tensions between Gypsies and Travellers and the settled community. But where situations such as those described by my hon. Friend arise, we believe, like him, that firm and prompt action is necessary: firm action to enforce against encampments in inappropriate places; firm action to provide the right sort of authorised sites in appropriate locations; and, when people are unwilling to respect the rights of others, as seems to be the case here, firm action to enforce against antisocial behaviour and environmental damage. Where persistent and repeated offences occur, action must be relentless in upholding the law. As I hope to show, there are powers to achieve this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_545">My hon. Friend has made a number of suggestions on how the law might be changed, to which I would like to respond. First, he pointed to the difficulty that cities such as Nottingham face in securing action under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003&nbsp;if there is no local 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 395</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>authority-authorised site in the area. It might be helpful if I rehearse the full legal position. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994&nbsp;sets out police powers to deal with unauthorised encampments. Section 61&nbsp;allows the police to direct trespassers to leave private land if the landowner has taken reasonable steps to ask them to leave, and if there is damage to land, threats or abuse, or more than six vehicles. The 2003&nbsp;Act added stronger police powers. The new powers can be used if at least two persons are trespassing, if the trespassers have between them at least one vehicle, if the trespassers are present on the land with the common purpose of residing there for any period, and if there is a suitable authorised site to direct them to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_546">My hon. Friend suggested that the link with alternative provision in the area should be removed so that trespassers can be moved on more quickly, given the difficulty experienced by unitary authorities in particular, which cannot use the antisocial behaviour powers if the alternative site lies outside their boundary. I recognise that there are particular problems in Nottingham, where the city boundary is tightly drawn. Nevertheless, the aim of the power is to encourage local authorities to provide sites. My hon. Friend also suggested that the requirement that six or more vehicles must be present before section 61&nbsp;can be used should be amended. Section 61&nbsp;can in fact be used in respect of fewer than six vehicles if the Travellers have caused damage to land or used threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour to the occupier of the land.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para17">
<a name="stpa_547">My hon. Friend also urged the need for faster action. I agree. Fast action is achievable, but it depends on local agencies working closely together. We would encourage them to put in place local protocols to ensure close co-operation and effective use of the powers. In February 2004, the ODPM and the Home Office issued joint guidance on the management of unauthorised encampments, and it was updated in March to include guidance on the new Anti-social Behaviour Act powers. The guidance recommends that working protocols be put in place between local authorities and the police. In areas where they exist, they have proved very effective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para18">
<a name="stpa_548">A further suggestion was that land with a clear pre-existing use should be safeguarded in legislation. Section 61&nbsp;of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994&nbsp;allows the police to remove trespassers from all types of land. My hon. Friend will be pleased to learn that the ODPM and Home Office joint guidance on managing unauthorised encampments gives specific advice on dealing with encampments on school car parks and playing fields. Each encampment location must be considered on its merits against various criteria. The guidance makes it clear that there are locations where encampment will not be acceptable under any circumstances. They include school car parks and playing fields, and recreation and public playing fields.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para19">
<a name="stpa_549">I have every sympathy in respect of the problems described over enforcement action where there has been vandalism and criminal damage. Issues about identification and securing witness statements apply, of course, to any criminal activity and are not particular to the Gypsy and Traveller community. Again, I think those must be primarily operational matters for the police. The powers exist: it is a question of the police 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 May 2005 : Column 396</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>using them effectively. We recognise that fear of reprisals is a key factor in preventing the reporting of crime, and we take intimidation very seriously. Specific witness intimidation offences cover witnesses in both criminal and civil proceedings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para20">
<a name="stpa_550">We have a wide-ranging strategy in place to ensure that agencies throughout the criminal justice system provide appropriate support to those witnesses who feel vulnerable or intimidated. For example, professional witnesses can be used where witnesses are too frightened to come forward or where some independent verification is required to resolve complaints of antisocial behaviour. The use of professional witnesses as an alternative method of gathering direct evidence is thought to be particularly useful where victims are too frightened to come forward as witnesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para21">
<a name="stpa_551">My hon. Friend also suggested that an eviction order should apply for a longer period than three months and that eviction orders should prevent Travellers from resettling within county boundaries unless within an authorised site. Given that we are talking about a direction administered by the police, without reference to the court, there is a question of what can be considered as proportionate for the police to administer. We believe that three months achieves an appropriate balance as it is in line with other similar direction powers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para22">
<a name="stpa_552">We recognise the problem of &quot;hedge hopping&quot;, mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner), as well as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, where Travellers who are directed to leave one unauthorised site move a short distance and set up another unauthorised encampment. That is why the new powers in the Anti-social Behaviour Act create an offence of returning to the local authority area as a trespasser, when a direction is given under the new powers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-32_para23">
<a name="stpa_553">Local authorities also have strong powers to deal with antisocial behaviour. Antisocial behaviour orders now have a proven track record and can be used against members of the Travelling community, just as they can against others. Changes introduced in the Police Reform Act 2002&nbsp;mean that ASBOs can extend across wider geographical areas than just local government areas. That tackles the problem of antisocial behaviour by individuals who are likely to move to other areas of the country and continue their antisocial behaviour.

<a name="stpa_554">A number of powers are also available to tackle environmental antisocial behaviour. Fly-tipping is a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of a &#163;20,000&nbsp;fine and/or imprisonment of up to six months. Prosecutions can be taken by the local authority or the Environment Agency. We have asked the Environment Agency to prosecute vigorously any person found to be illegally disposing of waste. The cost of cleaning up fly-tipped waste can be recovered from those responsible for causing the offence. The Environment Agency has set up an emergency telephone hotline so that members of the public can notify it of fly-tipping and swift action can be taken. The number, incidentally, is 0800 80 70 60.

<a name="stpa_555">Powers available to local authorities for dealing with fly-tipping were extended by the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, which gave local authorities powers to stop, search and seize vehicles suspected of being used for fly-tipping and to investigate incidents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_556">Fixed penalty notices for littering are available and can be used by local authority-authorised personnel under powers in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005&nbsp;or the police under the penalty notice for disorder scheme. Under the local authority-operated scheme, if the person fails to pay within the specified period, the authority can prosecute them. Under the police route, if the recipient fails to pay or request a court hearing within the specified period, a fine of one and a half times the penalty is registered against them. If the fine is not paid then, the relevant court will take enforcement action against the individual as it would for any other fine, which may include deploying bailiffs to seize goods in lieu.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_557">I note the point that my hon. Friend made about serving fixed penalty notices on those who refuse to give their name and address. In those circumstances, the police could arrest individuals under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984&nbsp;to obtain their identity. However, we will continue to keep those issues under review, in the light of practical problems that are encountered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_558">Section 59&nbsp;of the Police Reform Act 2002&nbsp;specifically allows the police to seize a vehicle in limited circumstances. There are already powers in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994&nbsp;to seize vehicles where trespassers fail to comply with a direction to leave land. It is also a criminal offence to fail to comply with a police direction to leave land.

<p>
<a name="50519-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_559">My hon. Friend asks me to consider the concept of extended trespass. I shall certainly consider it in more detail, but I remind him that the current legislation goes some way to dealing with this as it deals with trespassers who are

<a name="stpa_560">In summary, I seek to assure my hon. Friend that there are remedies available against some of the problems he has described.

<p>
<a name="50519-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_561">If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I want to link this discussion to another matter. Action against illegal encampments cannot be considered in isolation from provision of authorised sites. Moving encampments around an area is an expensive and frustrating business that achieves little. He has illustrated that very well, but greater provision would help to end it. Our aim is for those who wish to settle to be able to do so lawfully on permanent residential sites. Those who wish to travel should be enabled to do so lawfully on transit sites or stopping places.

<a name="50519-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_562">Local authorities have the lead role in site provision. The Housing Act 2004&nbsp;requires local authorities to carry out housing needs assessments for Gypsies and Travellers, as they do for the settled community. They will also need to draw up a Gypsy and Traveller accommodation strategy. These will feed into the regional planning process to enable an assessment to be made at regional level of the totality of need and the appropriate pattern of provision as between one authority and another.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50519-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_563">Ultimately, local authorities will have to identify sites suitable for Gypsies and Travellers as part of their local development framework. The opportunity provided through the regional planning process to look across the region should help to counter the concerns of some authorities that they are being left to shoulder the burden on their own.

<p><a name="st_195"><a name="50519-33_spnew2"><b> Mr. Olner </b> 
: I want to get one point set on the record. If an authority already has an established authorised site, can it move Travellers on to that site?

 That is my understanding of the law as it is interpreted, but I will clarify the matter and write to my hon. Friend to ensure that he specifically and clearly understands the legislation.

<a name="stpa_564">I again thank my hon.

We have a strong package of measures. We will be working with local authorities to ensure that they understand their powers and duties, to encourage site and service provision, to promote the effective use of enforcement powers and to tackle antisocial behaviour.

<a name="stpa_565">I understand that my hon. Friend is soon to meet the Minister for Housing and Planning further to discuss these issues. Furthermore, ODPM officials from the Gypsy and Traveller unit will be contacting Nottingham city council to discuss the difficulties that have been raised by my hon.
