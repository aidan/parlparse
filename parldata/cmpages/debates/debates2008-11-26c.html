 I commend my hon. Friend for his tremendous enthusiasm on behalf of seaside towns, and Rhyl in particular. He is absolutely right to stress that partnership is vital to success. The Rhyl city strategy brings together a range of partner organisations behind the shared strategic goal of reducing worklessness in the town. The Rhyl city strategy recently benefited from the Department for Work and Pensions deprived areas fund and the Welsh Assembly Government’s decision to provide funding for employability training. I would be delighted to join my hon. Friend in visiting some of those projects in Rhyl.</p>

 What consideration has the Minister given to the impact on the seaside economy of the presence of large numbers of transient residents?

Does the Minister acknowledge that the presence of large numbers of transient residents can put a significant burden on the public purse, and will he raise the issue with colleagues at Westminster and in the Welsh Assembly?</p>

 This is an important issue, which should be looked at in a cool and moderate way. We should be careful to use terms that are not emotive and that do not paint an inappropriate picture. It is therefore important for us to have objective studies, while of course recognising that visitors are welcome to our seaside towns. Let us be clear: there are real signs in Wales of the tourist industry picking up after the admittedly difficult past few months. There are also clear indications that that progress is far ahead of what is happening on the other side of Offa’s Dyke.</p>

 Of course I will do that. As all Welsh Members and other Members will know, the Welsh automotive industry is hugely important. In my constituency, for example, at least 2,000 to 3,000 people work for that industry directly—and a few thousand people indirectly—making brakes. I recently visited Meritor in Cwmbran, and we discussed the impact on the automotive industry of the fact that small businesses could not get money from the banks which, in turn, meant that they could not buy things produced by larger industries. The action we have taken to try to encourage banks to lend to small businesses will have a knock-on effect on the automotive industry, which is a very important point indeed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="08112644000080"><a name="81126-0001.htm_spnew20"><a name="08112644001417"><b>Mr. Murphy:</b>
 Yes, of course I agree. My hon. Friend is right to point out the importance of the manufacturing sector in many Welsh constituencies, including his constituency and my constituency. It will play an important role in bringing us out of recession, which will undoubtedly occur in years to come. At the moment, however, our job is to ensure that we help small and large businesses and families in Wales. It is no good doing nothing, which is what the Conservative party wants to do. We must do something positive to help Welsh people and Welsh businesses.</p>

 Unemployment is increasing in Wales at a faster rate than in any other part of the UK. Manufacturing jobs, particularly at Hoover in Merthyr Tydfil and Bosch in Llantrisant, are at risk. Even a Tory Minister promised to intervene in industry before breakfast, before lunch and before tea to protect jobs. When will the Secretary of State and his colleagues in the Assembly intervene to ensure that that massive loss of jobs is staunched as soon as possible?</p>

<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="08112644000082"><a name="81126-0001.htm_spnew22"><a name="08112644001419"><b>Mr. Murphy:</b>
 The criticism levelled against the Government over the past couple of days has been that we have intervened too much—we cannot win. The Government have committed hundreds of billions of pounds to stop the banking system collapsing. If it were to collapse, what would happen to manufacturing industry and small businesses in Wales? The hon. Gentleman knows as well as me that all the agencies, the Welsh Assembly and the Government are bending over backwards to help our manufacturing industry and people who have unfortunately become unemployed, by finding new jobs and reskilling people. There is positive intervention by government, whether at local level, Welsh level or United Kingdom level.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that, because of the work pattern history in Wales—slate, coal and steel—Welsh workers have proved themselves to be adaptable and are prepared to learn new skills? Is he aware of the excellent work carried out at the Faenol skills centre, which is now the conservation centre, in my constituency? Will he link my question with that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) and ensure that sufficient funding is available for such skills centres, working closely with further education colleges in the area?</p>

 Yes of course I will. My hon. Friend makes the extremely important point that Welsh people have over the past dozen to 20 years been so adaptable and flexible in moving from traditional industries—in my constituency, coal and steel—to many others. That is important, because there is now a diverse range of jobs in Welsh constituencies. When the recession hits, we will be able to sustain ourselves more effectively than we could when we were reliant on one or two industries. I agree with my hon. Friend about the importance of reskilling in further education colleges and other institutions.</p>

 Yesterday, Hammersmith and Fulham council announced a 3 per cent. reduction in council tax, for the third year running. The council has also reduced its debt by almost £20 million, producing annual savings on interest rate costs of £1.7 million per annum. Over the same period, the council’s services have been upgraded from three stars to four stars by the Audit Commission. Will the Minister come to Hammersmith and Fulham to see how public finances should be run? Will he bring the Chancellor and the Prime Minister with him when he does so?</p>

 I cannot speak for the Prime Minister or the Chancellor on this occasion, but I will come to Hammersmith and Fulham and visit where the hon. Gentleman wants me to go with his council. However, I will also visit the areas where others tell me about savage cuts to many services and grants that support some of the neediest people in the borough. I look forward to my visit.</p>

 Local authority services, such as homelessness services, are being affected by the recession. In the PBR on Monday, the Chancellor announced additional resources for the relevant Departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions. Why has no extra provision been made for local authority services, which are also under severe pressure?</p>

 I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was in the Chamber when I made my statement. I think that he was here to hear me say that I recognise the pressures on local authorities, but that those pressures are just as strong on national Government. The central feature that is helping local councils to manage long-term decisions, address the pressures on their finances at present and prepare for the other side of the downturn is stability in the core grant. The three-year settlement does not include the strings that have been attached in the past, which is what I am reconfirming for the House this afternoon.</p>

 Will the Minister confirm how many specific grants will be wrapped up in the rate support grant or even changed into permitted borrowing? Is that what he euphemistically means by “mainstreaming”? If it is, it will have no positive effect on floor authorities such as those in my constituency and the rest of the south-east.</p>

 What I mean by “mainstreaming” is precisely what I said earlier. Forty-three specific grants are now paid each month to authorities without any strings attached under the new area-based grant. This afternoon, I have also announced the indicative figures for next year and the year beyond, which councils can use to plan. In total, there are 70 different funding streams from nine different Departments, which, along with my announcements on the formula grant, add to councils’ certainty.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.

I did not receive a reply, so on 19 November I asked a further question seeking a reply to the original question, but I have not received a reply to that. If I were a cynic, I might suggest that the Department was trying to push the matter through to prorogation, so that the question would fall; it may, of course, be just incompetence in the Home Office.

Those measures are being debated by families across the country who fear their impact, and it is astonishing that the Government did not want them debated in the House of Commons.</p>

This Budget started to unravel from the moment it was delivered. The doubling of the national debt shocked the entire country. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Labour MPs may not be shocked, but the country is shocked to realise that the Government have taken it to the edge of bankruptcy. Within minutes of the report being published, it became clear that the national insurance rises would, contrary to the Chancellor’s claims, hit people on modest incomes. The small print of the Budget book shows that the Chancellor had been less than candid about the stealthy duty rises on alcohol and petrol. Then we discovered the £100 billion black hole in the tax revenues with no explanation of how it will be filled.</p>

Yesterday lunchtime, the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out that the new top rate would raise, in its words, “virtually nothing”. The Governor of the Bank of England told the Treasury Select Committee yesterday that the Government should be focusing on fixing the banking system. Meanwhile, retailers are up in arms about the huge costs and logistical nightmare imposed by the temporary VAT cut. Last night, the Chancellor U-turned on the proposed hike in whisky duty, which he had announced only 24 hours earlier. Finally, it has been revealed in an official Treasury document signed off by a Treasury Minister that there is a secret tax bombshell to increase VAT to 18.5 per cent.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman seems to have forgotten that the national debt doubled when John Major was in power, and that the Labour party brought it down. In the early 1990s, net borrowing was at 7.4 per cent., 7.7 per cent. and 6.2 per cent. Last year, under Labour, it was at 2.6 per cent., and the Library brief shows that net borrowing will not rise to anywhere near as high as it was under the Conservatives in the early ’90s, so what is he complaining about?</p>

Even the Chancellor struggled to keep a straight face when he told the House on Monday that he was replacing the fiscal rules with a “new temporary operating rule”—no rules, no framework, no independent oversight of the kind that our office for budget responsibility would provide. As the chief European economist of a major investment bank put it today:</p>
<a name="81126-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="08112644001348"><ul><p class="tabletext">“The UK has no serious medium-term fiscal framework: the fiscal rules have been abandoned, with nothing to take their place.”</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="81126-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08112644000316">Yesterday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies predicted that if the Government had persevered with the golden rule, they would now be on course to miss it by a mere £296 billion. The bond markets have passed their own verdict on the Chancellor’s new temporary operating rule, through the credit default swaps on British Government debt—the cost of insuring someone against the consequences of the British Government’s failing to honour their debts. The cost used to be about the same as that of insuring German Government debt, but it is now almost three times as high. Indeed, the markets today take the view that holding the debt of the British Government is riskier than holding the debt of British Petroleum.</p>

 I shall make some progress, if hon. Members will allow me. They may want to hear this, because they are concerned about it. It remains the case that more than 500,000 of the lowest-paid people in this country have lost out as a result of the abolition of the 10p tax band, and their loss was not compensated for on Monday. That is the truth. The Government are giving £20 billion in temporary tax giveaways, and taking back £40 billion in permanent tax rises—giveaways for Christmas, tax rises for life. That is not a stimulus, it is a tax bombshell. It will make the recession worse because it will make the recovery more difficult.</p>

On that test, even he must agree that it has failed. It may have rescued the banks and the bankers, but it has not rescued the economy. The country has lost count of the number of times we have been told that the Government were summoning the banks to a crisis summit, ordering them to lend to small businesses and forcing them to pass on rate cuts. That may have secured newspaper headlines, but it has not helped businesses to get the credit they need. Now is the time for more direct action.</p>

They should do so for a commercial insurance fee, passed on by the banks, that would fully protect the taxpayer. Businesses want credit and credit insurance. They are prepared to pay a fair price for it, and the problem at the moment is that they cannot get any credit or insurance. That would not increase Government borrowing. Instead, it would be more like the secured guarantees for a fee that the Bank of England has already put in place for inter-bank lending, which we supported. The idea is supported by all the major business organisations. That is the kind of radical policy action that we urge the Government to undertake—not fiddling around with temporary VAT changes, but getting to the heart of the credit crunch and solving Britain’s credit problems. That is what would help get the British economy back on track and stop the terrible rise in unemployment now taking place, again, under a Labour Government.</p>

Now, their emergency Budget is unravelling, their secret tax bombshell is revealed and their scorched earth policy is leading this country’s economy to ruin.

 I will give way to hon. Members on both sides of the House, but first I should like to address the important matter of VAT. The shadow Chancellor asked me to address a particular question about the impact assessment that referred to a higher rate of VAT, which was lodged on the website of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, and which has been the subject of a lot of newspaper reports. I want to deal with that, head on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="81126-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08112644000374">First, as the Prime Minister said earlier at Prime Minister’s questions, in the run-up to the pre-Budget report, I considered—as any Chancellor would—a large number of options about just about every aspect of tax and spending, as the House would expect. As I had to raise money in order to ensure that our borrowing is reduced in the medium term, I concluded that the best and fairest way to do it would be to increase national insurance contributions by 0.5 per cent., as I announced on Monday. I also said that while VAT would come down to 15 per cent., it would return to its 17.5 per cent. rate at the end of 2009. That is the Government’s position, and that remains the Government’s position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="81126-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08112644000375">When I saw press reports this morning that an impact assessment containing a reference to 18.5 per cent. of VAT had been put on a website and been signed by my right hon.

permanent secretary at the Treasury to find out what had happened, as the House would expect. What I found was this: the Financial Secretary had not, in fact, signed that document. It transpires that someone within either the Treasury or Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs had typed the Financial Secretary’s name alongside an impact assessment that he did not know about, he had not seen and he had never authorised. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> The shadow Chancellor asked me for an explanation, and the House is entitled to it. That is it. In other words, the Government’s policy is and remains that VAT will fall to 15 per cent. at the beginning of next week. It will then rise to 17.5 per cent. In other words, our policy is exactly as I set out in the pre-Budget report on Monday.</p>

 The Chancellor has explained how the document ended up on the website. What we want to know is how it was prepared in the first place. We want to know how many Budget options there was a draft order and regulatory impact assessment for. Would he also confirm that the Treasury was considering a 20 per cent. rate in 2012?</p>

 The shadow Chancellor asked me for an explanation as to why the Financial Secretary signed it, and I have given that. As I said to the hon. Gentleman, like any Chancellor, I considered a wide range of options, and I decided that the fair way to raise money would be through the national insurance system, with a rise of 0.5 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="81126-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08112644000378">The debate today gives us an opportunity to set out, as the shadow Chancellor said on Monday, a clear choice. I believe that, faced with today’s extraordinary economic circumstances, there is a choice between supporting people, business and the economy, as countries across the world are now doing, and walking away, saying that we will do absolutely nothing and letting the recession run its course. We have been there before, in the 1980s and 1990s, and we will never return to those days again. The Government and I are determined to do everything that we can to support people and businesses during these extraordinary times, which are affecting this country and every country in the world.</p>

 But surely creating a bureaucratic nightmare for many small businesses through the VAT reduction does not target help on the poorest in the country. At the same time, the Government are threatening to pay for that by putting a tax on jobs in the future, when we want to keep employment, in order to recover from the downturn that the Government have forced upon us. That is surely not the way to tackle the poorest in our society.</p>

 I believe that cutting VAT, from which everyone can potentially benefit quickly, and the measures that I have implemented to reduce the amount of income tax that the lower paid pay, to increase child benefit and increase the amount of money going to pensioners will all benefit people in this country, as well as the economy as a whole. To stand back and do nothing—that is what we saw in the 1980s and the 1990s, when I think that the hon. Gentleman would have taken a different view—and thereby allow a recession to be deeper and longer would be more painful for the whole of the country, including the people whom he represents. I am not prepared to follow that course.</p>

 I will return to that point shortly, but may I just say that I believe that the steps that we took to recapitalise the banks were absolutely essential, because if we had not taken them, we might have been faced with the collapse of the banking system, as the Governor of the Bank of England has said.

We are not prepared to repeat those mistakes, whether they were made in this country or in Japan in the 1990s. The hon. Gentleman’s advice is completely wrong once again.

<p><a name="st_o372"><a name="08112644000599"><a name="81126-0013.htm_spnew0"><a name="08112644001780"><b>Dr. Palmer:</b>
 Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that a 5 per cent. cut, to 12.5 per cent., would require consultation with the European Commission, and would have taken longer to implement?</p>

<p><a name="st_o373"><a name="08112644000600"><a name="81126-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="08112644001781"><b>Mr. Lilley:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right: we are forbidden, under the present laws, to reduce VAT to under 15 per cent. That is absurd, and we should have asked for a waiver from that requirement. We should not allow that to be a restriction at a time of national emergency. However, it is significant that, by the modesty of their package, the Government recognise that even these measures are at, or even above, the maximum that we can afford, and that more might have had a negative effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="81126-0013.htm_para0"><a name="08112644000601">We need to consider in what circumstances a budgetary stimulus or fiscal expansion has a positive effect, and in what circumstances it has a negative effect—the Government clearly fear the latter if they do more. Helpfully, the European Central Bank and the European Commission have studied the research done on all the fiscal—or so-called Keynesian—measures undertaken by different Governments in the past few decades. They come to some striking conclusions. They say that when Governments deliberately increased their borrowing to stimulate the economy, the effect of such expansionary measures was, at best, small. On half the occasions, the effect was the reverse of the Government’s aim. My right hon. and learned Friend pointed out that we know from British experience that that is often the case. In 1976, we had what the Keynesians would call a contraction. Under the influence of the IMF, we cut spending and raised taxation. The effect was immediate. As Lord Donoughue said on Monday last week—and he was a member of Callaghan’s Cabinet—the economy started recovering the next year, much more rapidly than expected. In 1981, 364 economists said, at what subsequently turned out to be the nadir of the downturn, that the measures that Lord Howe introduced in his Budget would accentuate the downturn because he raised taxes, cut spending and reduced borrowing. In fact, that marked the beginning of a sustained period of rapid growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="81126-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08112644000602">The documents produced by the European Central Bank also show that the opposite has happened. Governments introduced what they thought would be expansionary measures, but they had a contractionary effect—they are called contractionary budget expansions. That is our worry—that the Government have done too much and it will have a contractionary effect. The studies show that such measures are most likely to have the opposite to the Keynesian effect when the Government start with a high level of borrowing—precisely the position we are in. Other countries that have managed their finances prudently and have low borrowing are in a position to take expansionary measures, and I hope that they do so and create markets for us to grow through export-led growth, but we are not in a position to do that on any scale.</p>

 I was not trying to make an absurd party political point like the hon. Gentleman: I was quoting the European Central Bank and the European Commission studies of the experience of other countries. They have shown that when other countries have tried to launch a fiscal expansion on the back of a high level of borrowing or deficit—and the hon. Gentleman knows the difference between a deficit and the inherited debt of previous Governments—there is a danger that it actually leads to contraction. Why does it do so? There are three reasons. First, it undermines confidence. People think, “Gosh, the Government’s finances are already pretty shot through. If they are going to borrow even more, we had better get out of here.”</p>

<p><a name="st_o376"><a name="08112644000605"><a name="81126-0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="08112644001784"><b>Chris Huhne:</b>

 The hon. Gentleman has just made one silly party political intervention: he does not get a chance to make a second.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="81126-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08112644000607">The second reason is the possible effect of the risk premium, even for Government borrowing. My right hon. and learned Friend made the point that the Government now have to pay more to borrow than private companies, and even French banks. The third reason, which is not often mentioned, is the fear among the general public that the additional money they receive from the Government borrowing more will have to be paid back through increased taxes. The public therefore save that money to pay the taxes in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="81126-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08112644000608">I have always found the idea of Ricardo equivalence—that the general public can estimate the likely tax effects of borrowing in the distant future and predict on whom they will fall—very unlikely. But in the present circumstances, when the Government have spelled out that the short-term boost will be followed by specific and immediate increases in taxation, and when we know from what they have been trying to hide that any uncertainty is only that taxes may be even higher than so far revealed, it is all too likely that people will increase their saving to meet their future tax bills, thereby negating the effect of this attempt at expansion. Having said that, I hope that it works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="81126-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08112644000609">The Government are relying on an increase in taxes, and they will withdraw the personal allowance for people who earn more than £100,000—or £1 for every £2 of extra income. In effect, that will restore a 60 per cent. marginal tax rate for income above £100,000. In the past, that had a negative yield. We got more money when we reduced the top tax rate than when we maintained it. The Government have learned nothing and forgotten everything, and I hope that they will give us more time in the next Session to rub their noses in what is a very dangerous and risky Budget.</p>

 My view is that nothing happened in America that did not happen here, and that nothing happened here that did not happen in America. Our worst mistakes were a failure of regulation and our bad public finances. They are the particular features of the crisis here, but should not the hon.

Has it not occurred to him that we might be in this recession’s early days, and that 2009 might be very much worse?

Again, at 42.5 per cent., it was higher under the Conservatives, as was pointed out in the earlier helpful intervention. Now, at 37.7 per cent., it is lower than the figure for the US, Japan or the euro area. In the 1990s, two thirds of all public spending went on servicing debt and the costs of unemployment. This Government have freed up £23 billion to invest in public services that used to go on servicing the debt and paying for unemployment. That sum is equivalent to half the schools’ budget.</p>

 That has obviously been made clear in the account: we had the statement and we are having this debate because we recognise the severity of the problem, but we are not going to take lessons from a party that plunged us into two recessions, caused 76,000 people to lose their homes and oversaw a crisis in manufacturing the like of which this country had not seen in history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="81126-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08112644000630">On business competitiveness, the Government have taken positive steps to ensure that our economy is strong. At 28 per cent., our corporation tax is the lowest in the G7—it was 33 per cent. under the Conservatives—and that has helped to create 750,000 more businesses, 90 per cent. of which paid 10 per cent. tax, which is one of the lowest rates in the world.</p>

 No, I am not giving way again. No one is in any doubt about the scale of the economic problems. Just a few short months ago, when my right hon. Friend the Chancellor warned that the UK economy faced problems not seen for 50 years, the shadow Chancellor got to the TV studios as quick as he could to denounce that. Now we know that my right hon. Friend was looking ahead to the problems that we now face, and so was in a better position to measure them up and take the steps that he announced on Monday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="81126-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08112644000633">The House will not have forgotten that in 1997, our poorest senior citizens had just £69 a week to live on—more than £50 a week less than they do now. With that £50, the Government have lifted 1.9 million senior citizens out of poverty. The country has not forgotten that in 1997, spending per pupil was less than £3,000. It is now £5,430. Investment in school buildings, including roofs, more than doubled, and we now have 40,000 more teachers in our schools. In our NHS, we have 130,000 more nurses, doctors and consultants, and Labour’s investment in our health service means that 240,000 people are alive today, recovering from cancer and heart disease, who would simply have died had Tory levels of investment continued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="81126-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08112644000634">There has been a decade of growth, a decade of cutting public debt, a decade of lowering taxes, a decade of creating 3 million more jobs, and a decade of investing in public services. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) made a number of telling points about the decades of failure under previous Governments, but today, the shadow Chancellor showed that, having trawled the record for lessons that the Conservatives could learn, he has found none. As for solutions, he proposes none. He now proposes to do virtually nothing, and that is not an option.</p>

 If there was a prize for political irrelevance, the speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths) would get the accolade of the year.

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="81126-0013.htm_para13"><a name="08112644000638">The idea was that that disclosure would be planned for, and revealed, by 31 March next year, but that is too late; it is too long a period. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), a former Chancellor, made the point that we need to have some idea of where we are with the toxic debt in our banking community, but that has not been addressed properly, either on this side of the Atlantic or in north America. However we choose to clean up the mess of toxic debt in banking, clear it up we must if we are to get proper banking relations to prevail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="81126-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08112644000639">If LIBOR and the bank rate are to come into touch with each other and money is to become more affordable, that problem must be addressed. I have not heard anything from the Government to suggest that they are seriously addressing that issue. All that we hear is that the bankers have been called in—the Government are talking to them and trying to persuade them—but nothing happens in the real world to help small businesses desperate for money that they can afford, or to assist medium-sized businesses with their cash flow or, indeed, to help large businesses so that they can carry on the job of raising working capital at an affordable price.</p>

 One problem is that the Government themselves do not even follow transparency. In the pre-Budget report, which is a large document, there are no proper figures on Northern Rock or RBS. I cannot get the accounts on those banks from the Vote Office—I have to get them elsewhere—because the Government have no intention whatsoever of revealing their own transactions to the House.</p>

Further to the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), there has not been a single reference to the fact that, only last week, Northern Rock decided to allow its principal securitisation vehicle, Granite, to go under and go into default asset recovery. As a consequence, the Government have sold a share in their own bank worth £3.3 billion, which is much less likely to be recovered, and it will take many years to do so. Where is the transparency on that toxic asset?</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) both make the point that we need a great deal more transparency, and that action is required to address the question of banks’ balance sheets. Unless banks have the confidence to lend to one another, normal monetary policy will not be resumed.</p>

 This first group of new clauses and amendments covers a wide range of subjects. I propose, with your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, to speak to the Government new clauses and amendments, and then to seek to catch your eye at a later point in the debate to respond to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08112644001233">Let me start with Government new clause 11 and Government amendment No. 26, which is consequential on it. As was discussed in Committee, the Bill provides a number of ways for compensation to be calculated and paid to compensatable persons. As hon. Members will know, it allows the Treasury to make regulations to provide for no creditor being worse off following a partial transfer. The purpose of new clause 11 is to make explicit provision in the Bill for the Treasury, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or other specified persons to pay or contribute to compensation payments under clauses 49 to 61.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08112644001234">Government amendment No. 26 is consequential on new clause 11. It removes the provisions in subsection (6)(c) and (d) from clause 60, as new clause 11 now supersedes them. In Committee, the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) tabled a probing amendment that questioned whether subsection (6)(c) and (d) appropriately placed in clause 60. New clause 11 sets out more clearly our intention to ensure that if needed the appropriate persons can pay or contribute towards compensation. These are sensible amendments that reflect the consensual debate that we had in Committee, and I hope that the House will support them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08112644001235">Government amendments Nos. 23 to 25 amend clause 60, which, as hon. Members will know, puts in place a safeguard to protect creditors following a partial transfer, as it aims to ensure that they are no worse off than they would have been had the bank gone into a whole bank insolvency procedure. This is part of the package of safeguards on which the Government are consulting. The basic principle that will be implemented in the regulations to be made under the clause is that there should be a comparison of the treatment that creditors of a residual bank created by a partial property transfer receive in fact with the treatment that they would have received in the hypothetical circumstances of the whole bank entering an insolvency procedure. Should that process show that creditors have received less in fact than they would have done in the hypothetical circumstances, the difference is to be made up. As drafted, the hypothetical circumstances used in clause 60 for the purposes of comparison are those of the winding up of the bank. This is a reference to a particular form  <br></br>

of insolvency procedure involving the appointment of a liquidator and the realisation of the bank’s assets and their distribution to creditors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08112644001236">The purpose of amendments Nos. 24 and 25 is to make a technical change to provide greater flexibility. The references to winding up will be replaced by references to a full range of different insolvency procedures, because a bank might end up in some form of insolvency procedure other than the bank insolvency procedure—for example, administration under the Insolvency Act 1986. The amendments aim to preserve the flexibility of the Treasury to select the most appropriate hypothetical circumstances for comparison in secondary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08112644001237">Amendment No. 23 is a technical correction to subsection (2) of clause 60, which relates to the insolvency procedure that the residual bank, rather than the hypothetical whole bank, is likely to enter. As a partial transfer is likely to render the residual bank insolvent, and as the residual bank may need to provide services and facilities to the transferee, this procedure is likely to be the bank administration procedure. Again, the amendment provides flexibility to select the most appropriate procedure. I hope that the House will agree to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08112644001238">I turn to Government amendments Nos. 41 to 48 to clause 165. The effect of these amendments is to require the Financial Services Compensation Scheme to be able to contribute up front to the costs of a resolution. Let me briefly set out how such an approach would work. The amendments to clause 165 will allow a “payments on account” approach to be adopted. That would allow the Treasury to impose a requirement early on, possibly immediately after use of the stabilisation powers, for the FSCS to contribute an amount to the resolution. That would be based on an estimate of the eventual payment under clause 165. The FSCS would be obliged to make the payment. Thereafter, there would be an evaluation exercise and an assessment of the final costs of resolution, with a balancing payment being payable either from the Treasury to the FSCS, or from the FSCS to the Treasury. Following the experience of recent resolutions, including the Bradford &amp; Bingley case, it is important to have the flexibility to require the industry to contribute to the costs associated with resolutions before the end of the process. That flexibility could allow the FSCS to start paying, from day one, towards interest costs on any loans from the national loans fund in relation to a resolution. Paying up front could be preferable to leaving the cumulative interest costs to the end of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08112644001239">I have mentioned the importance of having safeguards to protect the use of FSCS funds, and I should like to reassure hon. Members that current safeguards surrounding the use of such funds will still exist. The safeguarding principle that resolution costs should be capped at the level at which depositor compensation would have been payable had the bank entered insolvency proceedings will be retained, as will the safeguard that ensures independent auditing of the amount that the FSCS will have to contribute. The amendments provide useful flexibility to allow the FSCS to contribute up front, rather than only at the end of the process, while preserving important safeguards to protect the interests of levy payers. I hope that the House will support these amendments. As I have said, Madam Deputy Speaker, I should like to catch your eye later to reply to the hon. Member for Fareham’s comments on his amendments.</p>

 Let me deal first with the Government’s new clause and amendments. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) will be heartened to hear that the Government took note of his comments, in Committee, about the appropriate place for the institutions that have been mentioned. We have no problem with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08112644001241">We would expect resolution regime costs to be paid up front, especially in the light of recent transactions in which the FSCS has taken part. The Minister will know that we are not as convinced as he is about the safeguards, and we will discuss the contribution that the FSCS has to make in such situations when we come to later amendments. On the concept of being able to meet up-front payments, we are content.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08112644001242">The new clause and amendments that I have tabled tackle three issues, the first of which is the pre-funding of the compensation scheme. We touched on this matter in Committee, and I want to revisit it today. The second issue—how to protect people who bank with branches of overseas banks—has caused a great deal of concern to constituents. The third issue is who should bear the costs of the special resolution regime. That has already been mentioned in relation to Government amendments Nos. 41 to 48.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08112644001243">Clause 164 gives the Treasury the power to make regulations for a pre-funded compensation scheme that could cover any part of the financial services sector, not just the banking sector. The argument in favour of pre-funding is that the FSCS needs to be pre-funded to ensure that there are sufficient resources to make a payout to the customers of a failed bank or other financial institution. Currently, the FSCS works on a post-funding basis. There is a levy on financial services businesses through industry groups. One such group, deposit takers, includes banks, building societies and credit unions. Once the levy payable by that group is exhausted, other financial services institutions outside that group will be required to make payments to the FSCS. The scheme is important, in that it has an impact not only on the sector concerned but on others as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08112644001244">When we debated these matters in Committee, the Minister would not be drawn on whether he thought it necessary to have a pre-funded scheme. He thought it appropriate for the powers to be available and for there to be further consultation and discussion on whether that was the right way to proceed. Not knowing whether this will be the next step forward will put the financial services sector in a difficult position, because it will not know what preparations it needs to make. However, the case for pre-funding was not made properly in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08112644001245">An argument for pre-funding can be made, and new clause 6, which requires a report to be laid before Parliament before the regulations are made, is a vehicle for making that case. Amendment No. 5, which I have tabled, would remove clause 164 from the Bill entirely. I would like to make it clear that I want to press that amendment to a vote at an appropriate point in our deliberations.</p>

very different risk profiles of the various institutions that might be called on to contribute. For example, building societies have historically cleaned up their own difficulties in that sector, but they might be called on to contribute to institutions that have followed much higher risk profiles in business.</p>

<p><a name="st_o443"><a name="08112644001247"><a name="81126-0016.htm_spnew9"><a name="08112644002344"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. In the wider debate on the pre-funded scheme, the Building Societies Association has highlighted instances in which building societies might be called on to contribute to resolutions. It says that the building societies have swallowed their own smoke, to use a phrase beloved by the Minister in Committee, and that a requirement to contribute to a pre-funded scheme would reduce the money available to them to lend to their members, which would perhaps reduce their attractiveness. We need to think about who would contribute to the scheme and what the impact of that would be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08112644001248">This is not just about building societies. Credit unions could be placed in a difficult position, as they do not often have huge reserves, but, as deposit-taking institutions, they could be covered by the provisions. Such contributions would take money out of the credit union sector, when that money would be better employed being lent to people than being put into a pre-funded scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08112644001249">The case has not been made for a pre-funded scheme, and there are strong arguments against introducing such a scheme. The first is that the important point is not whether the scheme is pre-funded but whether it has access to liquidity and resources to enable it to make payments to customers when a bank has defaulted. The second argument asks whether a pre-funded scheme would be the best use of assets. We have touched on that question in the context of building societies, but I want to make some broader points on that in a moment. Thirdly, while this debate has been primarily about pre-funding in the event of a bank failure, the powers in the clause could require other financial sectors to contribute to a pre-funded scheme to rescue a bank—or, indeed, any other financial institution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para26"><a name="08112644001250">The Bill makes provision for the scheme to access the national loans fund. This is what has happened in the context of Bradford &amp; Bingley, where money has been borrowed from the Government to lend to Banco Santander to cover the deposits. Consumers are given confidence not because there is a pre-funded scheme or a pot of money already sitting there, but because a bank has access to resources that enable the Financial Services Compensation Scheme to make payments to customers in the event of a default. With a post-funded scheme, a reasonable amount of time would need to be allowed to recover the money from the bank, so as not to put undue strain on the balance sheets of banks, building societies and other deposit takers at a time when the whole financial system is under distress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="81126-0016.htm_para27"><a name="08112644001251">Given the increasingly concentrated nature of the UK banking system, the pot of money that it would be necessary to build up against any failure would be quite significant. The position is very different from that in the US, which has a much more fragmented banking system. It also has the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and needs to have a pre-funded scheme, because the likelihood of a bank failing is much greater, given the sheer number of institutions involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08112644001252">A pre-funded scheme would be capital-intensive, and the second argument is that that money would be better used by a bank, building society or credit union, rather than being tied up in the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Accumulating the fund could increase the pressure on bank capital and liquidity. There is also the possibility—at least we hope so—that once the scheme had been built up, it would never be used. We have gone through a period of extreme volatility and instability, and I am not sure of the value of having a significant sum sitting in the hands of the FSCS that might never be used. We do not expect another comparable period of financial instability, and there are better ways to use that money than having it tied up in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08112644001253">The report envisaged in new clause 6 would be a good way to set out the arguments about a pre-funded scheme. Before the Government laid regulations in this area, the House would have to be persuaded that this is the right approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08112644001254">The third point is that the pre-funding debate encroaches on more than just the banking sector. The hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) talked about building societies, and there are other categories of deposit-taking institutions, such as credit unions. There is also concern in other parts of the industry that they would have to pay the costs of mistakes in the banking sector. The Association of British Insurers has said:</p>
<a name="81126-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="08112644001370"><ul><p class="tabletext">“We are concerned...that the present approach requires all sectors of financial services to contribute to the costs. This involves cross subsidy which imposes an unfair burden on the insurance industry, particularly in cases where, as in Bradford &amp; Bingley, insurers have already made substantial contribution through the provision of additional capital by their investment arms.”</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08112644001255">Several insurers subscribed to the rights issue, and they would be doubly penalised if they lost that money and had to make an excess payment to the FSCS. The present arrangements mean insurers could end up paying twice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08112644001256">A powerful case has been made that a pre-funded scheme is not the appropriate approach. There is another argument to be made, and we will come to that in the debate on the special resolution regime in the next group, but I shall flag it now briefly. For customers, the best deal is continuity of service. They want to be able to go into their bank and withdraw cash, or have their cheques cashed, use their debit cards and have their standing orders and direct debits honoured. They do not want to have to wait for five days, seven days, a month or however long it takes for the FSCS to send them their cheque. Continuity of service is a much better way to resolve the problem than dependence on a compensation scheme. If continuity of service were the priority for protecting depositors, we would not need a pre-funded scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08112644001257">The argument for a pre-funded scheme has not yet been made strongly enough. The arguments against it are much stronger, which is why I have tabled new clause 5.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08112644001258">Amendment No. 17 is a probing amendment, and flags up a debate that we had in Committee, although it was truncated. It concerns the challenge posed under the passporting arrangements for financial institutions in the European economic area. That enables an institution regulated in one state to establish a branch in another. It is part of the liberalisation of financial markets in the EU. The home state acts as a prudential regulator,  <br></br>

looking at capital and deposit protection, while the host state—the country in which the branch is established—looks after the conduct of business rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08112644001259">It was those rules that enabled the Icelandic bank Landsbanki to establish a branch trading as Icesave in London. Icesave was able to upstream some of the money attracted from UK depositors to Landsbanki in Iceland to reduce its dependence on funding from wholesale markets. Customers of Landsbanki would have realised that they were covered up to £50,000 under the deposit protection schemes in place when Landsbanki went into administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08112644001260">The first layer of the protection was under the Icelandic guarantee scheme, while the second layer was a top-up from the FSCS. However, as events have demonstrated, the first layer of support depends on the capitalisation of the bank and, in this instance, on the sovereign guarantee of the home country. In the absence of support from the Icelandic Government, the UK Government could have been on the hook for that first layer of protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08112644001261">That problem has been resolved by the IMF and UK loans to Iceland, but it illustrates the challenges that we face. As EU financial services markets are liberalised, customers are being put at risk because they depend on the home state for an element of consumer protection. I raised this matter in a debate on a European directive, when the Minister’s predecessor, the present Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, was Economic Secretary. It was not adequately resolved then, and the Treasury and the FSA need to think very carefully about how we alert UK consumers to the risk that they face when they do business with a branch of an institution incorporated in another EEA member state. That is a lesson that we need to learn from the debates about Landsbanki and related matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08112644001262">I turn now to amendments Nos. 13 and 14 in this group. Clause 165, as drafted, sets out how the special resolution regime is to be paid for and provides for the FSCS to contribute to the cost of a resolution regime. Initially, that contribution will be made by the deposit-taking sector: when it exceeds the levy from that sector for a year, it will be picked up by other contributors to the scheme. The amendments would insert into the clause a recognition of what would happen ordinarily when a business is either acquired by a private sector company or goes into liquidation or administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08112644001263">Traditionally, the cost of a private sector acquisition is borne by both the vendor and the purchaser. For a company that goes into liquidation or administration, the costs of resolving the problem that I have described are borne by the shareholders and creditors. It is important that that is clear. Rather than it being discussed by way of a comment in Committee, or put in the code of practice, it should be in the Bill, so that people know fully who is expected to pay for the resolution regime.</p>

 May I say a few words about the compensation scheme? The essence of any such scheme is the confidence that the public can place in it. Whether we are talking about a pre-funded scheme, which is fairly unlikely to cover the whole amount that might well be necessary, or some other mechanism, depositors will need absolute confidence, first, that the money is there for them to have, and secondly, that they can get their hands on it fairly  <br></br>

quickly. Even after Committee and our other debates, we have not yet quite got what the public would recognise as a clear compensation scheme in which they could have absolute confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08112644001265">Some issues are still up in the air, such as pre-funding. There are issues about the way in which foreign banks with UK branches will form part of the scheme. There is also the question of an absolute assurance on whether different branded products are treated similarly. Even now, in the Bill’s Report stage, I do not believe that the average member of the public clearly understands that they can have real confidence in the compensation scheme, as they understand it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08112644001266">I suspect that there is a growing feeling among many members of the public that what happened was, in many respects, a debacle. They had to put their hand in their pocket to bail out the banks in whatever way, and given the cheap loans situation and everything else, they may well consider that any future compensation scheme should in some way be the responsibility of the banking industry. If such a scheme, however drawn up, is somehow dependent on the Government underpinning or guaranteeing it—of course, it is not the Government’s money, but the taxpayers’ money—I am not quite certain that members of the public will be thrilled to bits. They think that they have probably paid enough. They are looking to Government and Parliament to come up with a proper scheme in a new banking Bill to address those issues, so that they can have confidence in a compensation scheme, and their ability to access and understand it. They want to know that wherever they put their hard-earned cash, they can have confidence in a compensation scheme.</p>

In some respects, the Minister may agree that the measures are still a work in progress, particularly as regards pre-funding. I accept that there are improvements, and that we are getting closer to arriving at such a situation, but I still do not think that we are close enough.</p>

 Let me start by addressing new clause 6, tabled by the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban), which would require the Treasury to lay a report before Parliament before bringing forward any regulations under section 214A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to introduce pre-funding. It is worth recalling that those regulations will be laid before Parliament in draft. They will need to be debated and approved under the affirmative procedure before they are made, so there will be ample opportunity for debate and parliamentary scrutiny—plenty of time for the Government to set out their thinking, and for Members of this House to challenge and question that reasoning. As I have said before, this is not a matter on which the Government would expect to have to act without prior consultation. Pre-funding is not an emergency action after the event—quite the reverse—so I expect that there would be plenty of material, including consultation documents, in the public domain before the regulations were laid, or before  <br></br>

the report that new clause 6 proposes had been prepared. In short, I do not think that such a report would be of much use or assistance to hon. Members when they consider the draft regulations. I hope that I have made it clear that there would be extensive consultation beforehand, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his new clause any further. As well as requiring consideration of the impact on the levy payers who contribute to the contingency fund—as I said, that will be considered in any case through consultation and parliamentary scrutiny—the proposed measure would require the report to consider whether pre-funding was the best way to achieve the objectives of the special resolution regime. I do not see the connection between pre-funding and the achievement of those objectives.</p>

The choice of tools, and any decision about whether the scheme should contribute to the cost incurred, would need to be made in the light of circumstances. Decisions would then need to be made about the way in which any FSCS contribution was to be financed, so I do not know what a report prepared before pre-funding was introduced could usefully say about the hypothetical future use of the special resolution regime tools. The new clause is unnecessary, because there will be extensive consultation, and by referring to the special resolution regime objectives it does not help in any event.</p>

 One of the objectives of that regime is the protection of depositors. In justifying any need for a pre-funding scheme, the report would have to address whether such a scheme would help to protect depositors. That is the link between what the report should set out and the regime’s objectives.</p>

 I do not think that the hon. Gentleman’s new clause makes that particularly clear. He is referring to the principle of pre-funding, which he addresses more directly in amendment No. 5, which would remove from the Bill the clause that amends the Financial Services and Markets Act to allow the introduction of pre-funding. Before dealing with the points that he has just made, may I stress again that the Government have absolutely no plans to introduce pre-funding for the FSCS at this time.</p>

Recent events have highlighted the way in which pre-funding could allow for spreading the costs of bank failure over a longer period of time, and reduce the extent to which firms have to contribute after such failure, when financial stress may be greater. Pre-funding can also mean that the failed firm will contribute to the costs of failure on the “polluter pays” principle, or, as I said before, according to the principle of companies consuming their own smoke.

better, we believe that it will be right to consider the case for it again. All that clause 164 does is to allow that to happen. There will be time for consultation and debate, and parliamentary approval will be required through the affirmative resolution procedure. The introduction of pre-funding will not be hidden away in any respect—quite the reverse, in fact, as we would want an open debate on the issue.</p>

He needs to reflect on the comments made by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) and on how the general public will see the issue. To say, as a matter of principle, that the official Opposition are against pre-funding is tantamount in the public’s eyes to saying, “Conservatives do not think that banks should pay up front in the event of a future bail-out.” The hon. Member for Fareham argued in Committee that banks should pay after an event over a very long period on an interest-free basis.</p>

 I will check the record. The general public will not consider it unreasonable to take a power to allow banks to pay up front for the costs of dealing with potential future difficulties. They will think that that is the right thing to do.</p>

If I explain how the FSCS applies to foreign banks, it will answer some of his questions. First and simplest, if a foreign bank owns a subsidiary that operates as a bank in the UK, the subsidiary is a UK-authorised person with a FSMA part 4 permission to accept deposits. In other words, it is a UK bank, which means that the FSA regulates it, that it is a full member of the FSCS and that it pays FSCS levies exactly like other UK firms.</p>

It must be a full member of the FSCS, and it must pay levies like UK firms, although that is, of course, calculated solely on the deposits held at the UK branch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para20"><a name="08112644001278">Thirdly, as is well known now, an EEA bank can operate through a branch here using a passport under the relevant EC directive issued by its home member state. Depositors are protected by the home state deposit guarantee scheme, and the bank may also join the FSCS top-up arrangements, provided that the FSCS offers better protection to depositors than the home state scheme. If it joins the FSCS top-up arrangements, it must pay an appropriate contribution to any levies. Foreign banks are already required to make appropriate contributions to any FSCS levies that apply to the relevant class of firm.</p>

the FSCS arising from the default of such a bank. In the Government’s view, there is no need to include any additional provision in the Bill along the lines proposed by the hon. Member for Fareham to make that happen. I hope that he agrees with that point on reflection and will not press his amendment.</p>

 Does the Minister take on board my wider point that depositors with those branches depend in part on the guarantee given by the home state of the branch?

 I fully understand the hon. Gentleman’s wider point. He is suggesting that some depositors might have put their money in a branch of an Icelandic bank, for example, without actually knowing how that savings account was regulated. I agree with the hon.

 On that point, it was established in Committee that in all cases of deposits, we need absolute clarity about the precise protections. That example is a good one, but there are many others in which customers may not be entirely clear about how the deposits are protected and what risks they may bear in depositing with a particular institution. I am aware that the FSA is consulting on many of those aspects, but Members would welcome an update on its progress.</p>

 My hon. Friend is exactly right that the FSA is consulting on many of the relevant issues, but it is not currently possible to say what the outcome will be. There is a clear policy issue and a clear public interest in ensuring that the basis on which people put their money into banks, and the guarantees that underpin them, are clearly understood and communicated, and we want to ensure that that is sorted out.</p>

Member for Fareham raised in Committee the matter relating to amendments Nos. 13 and 14, and I have set out before the reasons why it is important that the FSCS contributes to the costs of the special resolution regime, so I shall not repeat them in detail here. From what the hon. Gentleman said, I understand that his concern is to ensure that other persons, particularly a private sector purchaser or the insolvent estate, contribute to the costs of a resolution before the FSCS is called upon, and his amendments seek to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08112644001285">Let me set out why I have sympathy with the general principle but do not agree with his amendment. As I said in Committee, I agree that in some circumstances, a private sector purchaser should be called upon to contribute towards resolution costs. However, there are also certain circumstances in which it would not be appropriate for them to be required to do so. For example, there may be administrative costs or additional compensation costs that a private sector purchaser would not be willing to pay, and any requirement that they do so might reduce the likelihood of a successful private sector solution, therefore I do not believe that, in all cases, the private sector purchaser should pay resolution costs before the FSCS or the authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para24"><a name="08112644001286">I have significant concerns about imposing the proposal that the insolvent estate fund resolution costs before any call upon the FSCS is made. Taking money out of the estate to fund resolution actions would lead to a smaller pot of money from which creditors and others would benefit. We wish to avoid that situation, as demonstrated by the “no creditor worse off” safeguard, and by objective 5 of the special resolution regime which emphasises the importance of minimising interference with property rights. In the case of one of the more likely resolution actions, a deposit book transfer, funding the resolution out of the insolvent estate might result in a de facto depositor preference regime, which the Government have sought to avoid, with the support of banks and investors in banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="81126-0017.htm_para25"><a name="08112644001287">Of course, the cap will ensure that any recoveries that the FSCS could have secured from the insolvent estate had it paid out in the normal way will be taken into account. The FSCS will not be required to pay more than it would have paid under a normal payout. Although the private sector purchaser may be called upon to contribute in some circumstances, I hope that I have explained why I do not think that they should be the first port of call in all circumstances, and why there are also risks with requiring the insolvent estate always to be called upon before the FSCS.</p>

 Amendment No. 14 reflects that point by stating “may require” rather than “must”.

It is totally unacceptable that there should be any bonuses if it is taxpayers’ money that saved the institution from failure. It is unbelievable that directors are paid for failure and for jeopardising the public interest, at a time when they are costing taxpayers a great deal of money, when they are jeopardising their customers’ livelihoods and those of countless businesses and individuals, and when they have got into a situation where the banks own a huge amount of toxic debt and effectively seize up. In those circumstances, bonuses should not be paid—in fact, they should be clawed back from the directors who got the bank into that situation. The new clause would require that no bonuses should be paid for risky activities and that we get some repayment where they have been paid on a false or inaccurate basis.

They are all part of the bail-out process. Even if they are not benefiting from the direct recapitalisation in terms of preference shares, other parts of the package referred to £200 billion being available in short-term loans from the Bank of England—that went up from £100 billion—and to £250 billion in loan guarantees being made available at commercial rates to encourage banks to lend to each other. Those are huge sums of public money that have gone to banks other than the rescued banks that we have taken preferential shares in, and they should also be subject to restraint and control over bonuses.</p>

Under that agreement, there were strict restrictions on our emoluments while those preference shares were being held. Until we had repaid them, we had to comply with those conditions. That seemed absolutely fair to me. We were receiving an investment from the Government, and it would have been unwise and unfair for the directors of the company to settle their own salaries.</p>

However, there will be no return to the taxpayer on that £37 billion for a minimum of five years. The Minister might want to pop up and say that the £9 billion of preference shares will mean a 12 per cent. return, but that is not true. They are non-cumulative preference shares, so that the directors of the company can waive that dividend every year until the preference shares are repaid. They cannot be repaid for five years, and I would argue that the directors have a duty to waive that dividend, because they have to look after the interests of the whole company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="81126-0020.htm_para27"><a name="08112650000123">Taxpayers have therefore invested £37 billion in banks with no return for five years, and we have not bothered to say anything about the bonuses or salaries of the directors. We cannot do anything about that in this Bill, but it is an issue that we should address. I sat in Committee for many an hour and we briefly discussed this issue, but it did not get the airing that it deserved.

 I am grateful for that assurance, but if he made his points now, I could contradict what he said. I urge the House to take this matter seriously. People are struggling. Constituents of mine are trying to secure an extension to their business loan of £10,000. They are being asked to pay a charge for that, and being charged higher interest. That is unacceptable when every person in this country, man, woman and child, has paid more than £600 each to the banks to recapitalise them. Such loans should be made easier. The businesses should not have to go through a lot of kerfuffle. I have been in business and I know what it is like to have to go and see the bank manager<i>—</i><i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> The Minister asks what this has to do with the new clause, but that is the problem with this Government. They do not recognise that these directors, who are on huge salaries, are not getting the money to the small businesses and, as a result, they are closing up and down the country every day.

The newcomers quickly took control in several former Confederate states, dragging their political machines into line with their cousins in the north. Those transient opportunists had arrived in the south with their belongings carried in holdalls fashioned from old carpets, giving rise to their nickname of carpetbaggers. The name persists in use today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08112650000129">Sadly, the story of the demutualisation of building societies gave rise to its own breed of carpetbaggers, oily opportunists whose mercenary profiteering would lead some former building societies to abandon their traditional strengths and sow the seeds of their recent and current vulnerability. Every one of the building societies that demutualised and listed on the stock exchange—from Abbey National in 1989 to Bradford &amp; Bingley in 2000—has either failed or had to be rescued. Included among them is the largest of all—the Halifax building society. I have been a depositor with the Halifax all my working life, from being a paper boy onwards, and I have been a Halifax mortgage holder all my married life as well. In the long, hot summer of 1997, 75 per cent. of the 7 million members of the Halifax building society voted on demutualisation: 97 per cent. voted for and a glorious 3 per cent.—including David Taylor of LE67 2QP—voted against. One gets no credit for saying, “I told you so,” but I told you so.</p>

It gifted money for nothing to speculative investors. It fed into, and fed off, the boom in housing ownership, with its corollary—mortgages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para3"><a name="08112650000131">Borrowers lost out as well. The building societies’ ability to offer cheaper loans to their customers disappeared, as they became virtually indistinguishable from banks. The communities that they served lost the familiar services that they had relied on. The ethical grounding of member-oriented services evaporated. We had come to the high point of the Thatcher era—the deregulation introduced by the UK’s Building Societies Act 1986 paved the way for banks and building societies to go head to head, competing in the same space for the same customers and using the same products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08112650000132">By converting into banks, the former building societies gained greater access to wholesale borrowing, new types of investors and the unrestricted use of financial instruments such as securitisation. The collapse of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley can be interpreted in the light of their access to those new sources of funding, and to their uses of financial instruments that were either unavailable or antithetical to the mutual societies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08112650000133">The 1986 Act removed the Chinese walls between the two kinds of financial institution. In offering demutualisation, it created the means to sell out long-term security for short-term profit. In 2001, Cambridge university’s Centre for Business Research produced a working paper on the topic, and it quoted a senior manager of the Halifax before demutualisation, who said:</p>
<a name="81126-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="08112650001239"><ul><p class="tabletext">“All arguments for conversion are fairly arcane as far as our members are concerned. The single argument that will convince them is the release-of-value argument.”</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08112650000136">To paraphrase the manager of the then Halifax building society, offer people a sufficient amount of money and you can convince them of anything. In circumstances that had never been seen before, building society members stood to receive windfalls for doing little more than turning up and voting. Unsurprisingly, that led to significant numbers of speculators opening an account for the minimum necessary amount, gaining voting rights and thereby shamelessly manipulating society votes in favour of demutualisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08112650000137">Even at the time, the benefits were questionable. On the basis of a projected payout of £2,000 per head, Bradford &amp; Bingley members voted for conversion, but in reality the average conversion turned out to be worth less than one third of that, at £650. Customers with modest savings doubtless benefited from the effort-free handouts on offer, but those with more substantial sums invested were trading short-term gains for long-term losses. In many cases, people with their life savings invested in mutual institutions would have made far more in interest alone over the past 10 years than the few hundred pounds that they walked away with at the time. When they lost their mutual status, the building societies lost their ability to offer higher interest rates, and they also lost their security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para8"><a name="08112650000138">However, the incentives for senior managers were never in doubt. The pay increases that come with executive management of investor-owned rather than mutual companies guarantee positions in the newly created and higher-status organisations. The urge to increase the business rather than improve the service, as well as profit-linked salaries and a generous dollop of testosterone, all help to drive executive enthusiasm for conversion. We can still feel the power surging through the boardrooms of the former building societies 10 years ago, even though we are 10 years on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para9"><a name="08112650000139">In the case of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester takeover by Lloyds, as it then was, sweeteners included share options for the chief executive worth four times his salary, as well as cash payments to the chairman, the chief executive and their families totalling nearly £100,000. The figures from the demutualisation vote of Bradford &amp; Bingley in 2000 paint a picture that was replicated in many conversion votes throughout the ’90s. The following is a direct quote from the paper to which I referred earlier:</p>
<a name="81126-0021.htm_brev1"><a name="08112650001240"><ul><p class="tabletext">“the legislative requirements on voter turnout and voting support required for investors were set at higher thresholds than those for borrowers.

Although the high thresholds set for investor members were intended to provide protection for the borrowers, in practice they may also have made it more likely that investors would vote, so tilting the outcome in favour of conversion…although overall the vote was in favour of conversion (62 per cent.), 60 per cent. of borrowers who took part voted in favour of the society remaining mutual.

Members have a vote, and so a voice, in decision making. The company is incentivised to work for the interests of its members, not its shareholders, and still less its financiers. We must not forget that mutuals can often offer better savings and borrowing rates. They are an investment for the long term. They offer security and dependability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08112650000142">According to two independent surveys in the late 1990s, mutual building societies consistently offered the best loans over a variety of payment periods. The surveys found that nine of the 10 cheapest lenders in the UK were mutuals. Another survey shows that the cheapest 30 lenders throughout the 1990s, and the 10-year period in question, were all building societies. There is evidence, cited in the paper that I mentioned, that demutualisation exacerbates financial exclusion. The total number of building societies has fallen from more than 200 to fewer than 60 in the past 25 years. Financial institutions were merged or taken over, and their branches rationalised in the drive for efficiency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para13"><a name="08112650000143">The recognisable, reliable and—above all—reachable branches that served many of the poorest and most vulnerable in communities across the country, including in North-West Leicestershire, have disappeared in the stampede towards petty pecuniary advantage. That was not just morally wrong, but largely mistaken. Work done during the height of the fad for demutualisation showed that building societies have tended to operate with greater efficiency and higher and less volatile profitability than commercial banks. It is surely no coincidence that credit unions have increasingly filled the gap left by the evisceration of mutual institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para14"><a name="08112650000144">The need for stable, low-interest loans never went away, even during Labour’s years of record economic growth and reinvestment in infrastructure and public services. The reach of mutuals is still short, however, and the respite that they provide to struggling families will be stretched in what will no doubt be a discontented winter.</p>

Back in the year 2000, my party’s Government, who have had so many remarkable successes, singularly failed on a number of occasions to show the leadership necessary to stem the tide of carpetbagging and demutualisation.

We have seen a series of mergers, takeovers and part-nationalisations of former building societies in the past turbulent and unprecedented year, and they have largely taken place well after opportunistic investors have cashed in and moved on, carpetbags filled with windfall payments. Mutual organisations offer longevity, security and service in a manner that is completely alien to modern banking practices. I urge hon. Members on both sides of the House to support the new clause for the benefit of all those among us who have neither the time nor the voice to speak today.

In practice, that process was not financially advantageous to people who had formerly been members of the building society. We invited a range of people from all sectors—banks that had been mutuals, building societies, and even carpetbaggers—to that Select Committee-style inquiry to give evidence. I treasure one particular letter. The chief executive of Northern Rock declined to appear before the committee—surprise, surprise—but he submitted a letter stating that Northern Rock was very competitive, that it provided value for money and that its 100 and 120 per cent. mortgages were incredibly popular among consumers.</p>

Any firm participating in the recapitalisation scheme will be bound by the FSA code on non-executive, risk-based remuneration, as well as by industry best practice on executive remuneration and severance—for instance, the guidance issued by the CBI and the Association of British Insurers.

 I was about to address that point and respond to the hon. Gentleman’s contribution. The conditions on remuneration imposed on the banks accessing the recapitalisation scheme are in the public domain—they are part of the placing agreements, which have been placed in the House of Commons Library. The hon. Gentleman seemed to say that the Government are getting nothing out of the banks’ recapitalisation, but let me correct him on one point. Payment on the coupon of the preference shares is not deferrable; they are non-cumulative preference shares, and we expect to get paid as a Government. If he is suggesting that the Government should not have taken the decision to recapitalise the banks to protect the stability of the financial system and depositors, he is simply wrong. The action that we have taken has been widely welcomed, many other countries have adopted the approach and the UK has led the way in ensuring that banks have the capital requirements that they need on liquidity and on credit guarantees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para27"><a name="08112650000163">My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead asked what the FSA is doing on remuneration, and I want to be clear to him that the FSA is conducting a review of executive remuneration and regulation. It has written to the chief executive officers of the major banks, setting out good practice on remuneration. Looking forward, I should say that the FSA intends to take account of UK firms’ adherence to the principles of good practice on remuneration when assessing risk, and it is important that it does so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="81126-0021.htm_para28"><a name="08112650000164">Let me directly address the point of my hon. Friend’s new clause, which seeks to introduce some quite extensive new regulations. I hope that through what I have said, I have reassured him that, when the Government have acted on bank recapitalisation, we have taken a strict line on executive remuneration. We have said clearly and up front that access to the recapitalisation scheme is subject to the remuneration conditions that were determined as part of the discussions about the Government’s investment. We think that that is the right approach, because it gives the banks certainty about what is expected of them. It is our clear view that we have no reason to believe that the conditionality imposed on the banks participating in the recapitalisation scheme will not be followed. We will of course monitor the situation, not least through the appointment of non-executive directors, but we do not currently believe that there is a case for regulation.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Minister says that he sees no reason why the conditionality that the Government have imposed on payments and bonuses should not be followed, but the conditionality imposed on lending money has blatantly not been followed. Why does he think that one set of conditions will work when another patently has not?</p>

 Directors of the recapitalised banks are very much in the public eye and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. We have been very clear about the conditionality that we want on executive remuneration, and we will continue in that manner. We have powers to monitor the banks, and we have absolutely no reason to believe that they will not continue to take a fair and appropriate line on directors’ pay and executive bonuses.

 There is an element of incredulity about the Minister’s statement. Can we just be clear? The Government lent those banks—those finance houses—£37 billion. In return, we expected them to show some restraint on repossessions, yet Northern Rock is repossessing faster than any other financial institution. We expected them, as a result of the money, to be able to lend between themselves and stimulate the banking economy once again, yet they refuse to lend. What, therefore, gives the Minister any confidence in the idea that they will also restrain their pay? The FSA has significantly failed up until now, and the conditions have failed up until now.</p>

 I say clearly to my hon.

Basically, he said that we had to monitor the situation and that the issue was in the hands of the FSA, which has a record of being weak. Even the shareholders of banks such as Barclays are being treated badly, given the expensive deal with the Arabs, and those shareholders cannot make many inroads with the bank directors.

First, I stress that a bank’s conversion to mutual status, including the remutualisation of a former building society, is already possible under existing legislation. It could be achieved by the transfer of the property and liabilities of the bank to a building society—an existing one, or one newly created for the purpose. What happened with Bristol and West is an example of that procedure. It was a former building society that was sold to Britannia and thereby remutualised. Further regulations enabling the process in the particular circumstances to which the new clause refers are simply not necessary. The powers are already there. I hope that I have given my hon.

I tabled an amendment to change that, and now the Government have done so as well—Government amendment No. 38. We welcome it, and we accept its wording.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="81126-0022.htm_para15"><a name="08112650000194">Amendment No. 2 would make clause 72 a sunset clause. We are not convinced that clause 72 is necessary. Unless the Government have strong reasons for it to remain, it would be helpful if it were removed, which should deal with any transitional provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="81126-0022.htm_para16"><a name="08112650000195">I am keeping my remarks as brief as possible in order to allow the Minister to respond fully. In conclusion, we welcome the progress that we have seen, but we consider it vital for UK banks that we have adequate safeguards in partial property transfers and that we do not allow clause 72 to undermine those safeguards in any respect. We await the Minister’s comments with interest.</p>

group in primary legislation, as set out in clause 10. That move has been widely supported by the industry and, to be fair, by Opposition Members. When we are talking about such legislation at the level of technical detail that we often are, it is right to work with the experts and in effect co-produce the secondary legislation, in addition to keeping such matters under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="81126-0022.htm_para18"><a name="08112650000198">In putting the group on a statutory footing, it is implicit that the Government will have regard to its recommendations. Clause 10 therefore provides a mechanism for us to receive regular and expert feedback, to which we will pay due consideration. The Government consider it desirable to retain the flexibility to adjust and refine the safeguards in the light of experience. That is particularly important in the context of the set-off and netting safeguard, for instance, because those arrangements have proven to be a highly innovative field. Changes to the safeguard may be necessary to ensure not only that it continues to protect what it is intended to protect, but that innovations do not undermine the policy aims that the special resolution regime is intended to serve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="81126-0022.htm_para19"><a name="08112650000199">I agree with the spirit of the new clause that the hon. Gentleman has tabled, in the sense that reviewing safeguards is important. However, that is best done through the mechanisms that I have outlined and which we are already putting in place, in particular the expert liaison group, rather than the approach that he suggests in new clause 3. If he reflects on that, I hope that he will decide not to press the new clause to a vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="81126-0022.htm_para20"><a name="08112650000200">As right hon. and hon. Members are aware, banks comprise complex, multi-jurisdictional corporate entities. Set against that background, many of the provisions of the special resolution regime interact with and sit alongside financial services, banking, company and insolvency law. It is therefore clear that the legislative environment is both complex and varied—I think that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire can see where I am going with this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="81126-0022.htm_para21"><a name="08112650000201">There will inevitably be some degree of conflict between the public interest objectives of resolving a bank in severe financial difficulties and the provisions of legislation that are designed to work in relation to a normally functioning business. When hon. Members reflect on that for a moment, I hope that they will see that it is surely right. It is one thing to have legislation that applies to normally functioning businesses, but with a bank or building society failure, quite different and difficult circumstances arise. For that reason, we believe it is crucial to take a power to amend the provisions of primary and secondary legislation and common law, but to do so in a narrow way, which I will go on to explain in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="81126-0022.htm_para22"><a name="08112650000202">In the absence of such a power as provided for in clause 72, or clause 65 as it was in Committee, there is a real and significant risk that the authorities will not be able fully to effect a transfer, which could impact on the effectiveness of the powers in the Bill. That could lead to serious and adverse implications for the public interest through risks to financial stability, to the protection of depositors and to public funds. It could also impact on the likelihood of achieving a private sector solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="81126-0022.htm_para23"><a name="08112650000203">The purpose of the power is to provide the Treasury with the means to modify legislation to enable the powers of the special resolution regime to be used more effectively. This is set out in clause 72(1), which we  <br></br>

debated at some length in Committee. I want to make it very clear that this is not a general power to amend legislation; it is targeted and limited. In particular, the power may be used only to facilitate the use of one of the stabilisation options, so the scope is severely constrained to amending legislation that affects the resolution of banks that are under the special resolution regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="81126-0022.htm_para24"><a name="08112650000204">I emphasised in Committee that the power would not be used to modify the Bill—a concern expressed by a number of hon. Members who contributed to the debate at the time. I highlighted the fact that the Treasury would not use clause 72 to amend the legislative safeguards either in the Bill or in secondary legislation made under it. It would be inappropriate to use the clause to amend the safeguards that we are putting in place. The Government have no intention to use the power in that way, which I want to make absolutely clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="81126-0022.htm_para25"><a name="08112650000205">I committed to discussing issues relating to legal certainty and the expert liaison group. I can inform the House that I will write to the group and undertake specific consultation on this very matter. In light of the ongoing consultation with stakeholders, the Government consider it appropriate to make it clear that the powers in clause 72 cannot be used to amend the Bill’s provisions; we want to reflect the concerns expressed in Committee. This extends to primary legislation and any secondary legislation made under it—so, for example, in relation to the netting safeguard, which is one of the key safeguards of particular interest to stakeholders, both the enabling power and the statutory instrument made may not be amended by the power. I hope that that addresses stakeholders’ main concern about the power conferred in clause 72. We have directly responded to the concern and remain committed to working with the industry on issues relating to legal certainty. I believe that when it comes to transactions, it is vital for the industry to be able to have clean legal opinions. We will continue to work with the industry, but we believe that the provisions are appropriate, so we can give the industry the assurances it requires.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="81126-0022.htm_para26"><a name="08112650000206">In amendment No. 2, the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire proposes that a sunset provision be added to clause 72. This would provide the Treasury with the power to change the law for two years, but it would then lapse. I do not believe that the amendment would be in the public interest, so let me explain why. We cannot be sure that the hindrances and difficulties faced by the authorities in resolving any bank failures in the next two years will be the same as in a future period. It is possible, for example, that the nature of the banks being resolved will be different in subsequent years, with the result that different pieces of legislation need to be modified so that a successful resolution can be effected. In our view, therefore, a sunset provision is not appropriate because of the need to ensure that the legislation is future-proof as banks and financial markets develop over time.</p>
