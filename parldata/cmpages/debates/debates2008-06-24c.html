 I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that informative reply.

 Of course, I appreciate the frustrations that many people feel in this country about the lack of change in Burma. We have succeeded in getting aid into Burma, especially with the help of the Association of South East Asian Nations countries in the region.

Whichever way we look at it, we see that there have been 12 years of imprisonment and a lot of fine words, but absolutely no movement and an evil regime still in place.

 The truth is that neither sanctions by the international community nor engagement by countries in the region has brought about the result that we would desire. In the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, we have seen something of a change in the neighbouring ASEAN countries, which are now indicating more vocally that they believe that things need to change in Burma. We will continue to work with those countries and with the United Nations. Ban Ki-moon has said that he will return to Burma later this year, following up his visit after the cyclone. We are hopeful that that will enable us to move the political process forward in the right direction.</p>

 I thank the Minister for his response. He will be aware of reports from Iran that a new penal code is being drafted, which will be considered by the Iranian Parliament, that would introduce a mandatory death sentence for apostasy. The code would have extra-territorial jurisdiction and could lead to a fundamental attack on the human rights of Christians and Baha&#146;is, particularly those with one Muslim parent, who could, under the new law, be considered apostates.

 I thank my right hon. Friend for that answer. I agree that the Egyptians have made commendable efforts in the last short while. Does he agree, however, there is a great deal more that they could do? I hope that they would agree that that is the case as well. I am thinking in particular of the tunnelling under the border, which is continuing, and the smuggling of people and dangerous contraband.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. He will know that smuggling is a long-term issue that is a threat to Egypt as well as something that just goes through the country. This is intimately related to the crossings between Gaza and Egypt, and the crossings into Israel. As soon as we get properly organised legal traffic going through those crossings, which is a priority for all sides, there will be a parallel commitment to crack down on the smuggling that is a threat to all the countries in the region.</p>

 I welcome, as did the Foreign Secretary, the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel. Does he agree, however, that there is now a pressing need to ease the blockade on Gaza? I went to Gaza two months ago, and I was horrified by the crippling poverty there, and particularly by the impact of the blockade on health services. In his discussions with Egypt and with Israel, has he had specific talks about the passage of patients across the border to access better health care? I certainly saw individuals being denied that health care.</p>

 The hon. Lady raises an important point, and it is one that we raise particularly in respect of health supplies, and in general in respect of fuel, electricity and other traffic into the Gaza strip. It is important to say that we are not just calling into thin air for improved access to Gaza on humanitarian grounds. As part of the agreement, Israel itself has committed to improving the flow of goods services, and all the independent estimates&#151;and statements by Hamas and by Israel itself&#151;show that there has been an improvement of, I think, about 30 per cent. during the first three days of the ceasefire. That is certainly something that we should encourage all sides to build on.</p>

The real issue is the choice that it has to make about the role that it wants to play in the future. The Norwegians have publicised the fact that they are talking to Hamas, and Hamas has obviously been involved in discussions with the Egyptians over the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The announcement by President Abbas that he wanted to re-establish Palestinian unity on a basis that recognised the state of Israel, that renounced violence and that respected previous Palestinian agreements was the right way forward.

There is real determination in the international community to hold on to the idea that 2008 has to be made into a key year for the middle east peace process. There has not been such a process for seven years; there is one now, and it is precious, so we need to ensure that we make some progress.</p>

 In light of the Foreign Office&#146;s responsibility for dealing with human trafficking under the Government&#146;s action plan, does the Minister think it sensible to discuss with his opposite number the possibility of our embassies in both Bucharest and Sofia doing more to raise awareness of the scale of human trafficking in Bulgaria and Romania? Hundreds and thousands of children from poor Roma communities are sold into slavery every year, so should not our embassy be doing more? Could we not lead a crusade in eastern Europe with other embassies to raise the whole profile of the trafficking problem in eastern Europe?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises entirely reasonable points and I hope that he is reassured that our embassies in both Bulgaria and Romania are working very hard on these issues. That is not to say that we cannot continue to look for additional initiatives and energies to expend. He rightly draws attention to the trafficking of children in particular, and it may help the House if I say that intelligence reports have identified a network of ethnic Roma criminals involved in the trafficking of Romanian Roma children, particularly to the UK. Police forces in the UK have identified more than 200 children being exploited in London and beyond. We are grateful for the co-operation that we have with the Governments of Bulgaria and Romania, but there is more that we can do together.</p>

 I know that the Russian Federation is committed to controls on people trafficking, but it is certainly the case that, across the European Union and the wider sphere of Europe, there is far too much people trafficking, with criminal gangs exploiting the vulnerability of often frail and desperate people in a vile and sick trade. We do all we can in the EU through the European neighbourhood policy and much else besides, but if my hon.

 The fact is that as these criminal gangs become more sophisticated, we always have to develop new ways to deal with them. Working with Save the Children in Romania is one important example of what we need to do, and the voluntary return of children, if their safety and well-being can be guaranteed, is another. We continue to discuss such issues with the Governments of both Bulgaria and Romania. As I say, as the challenge changes and these gangs become more sophisticated and in some ways more subtle, we have to be equally determined and flexible in our efforts.</p>

 Should not Her Majesty&#146;s Government be impressing it upon the French presidency that the kindest thing for the treaty of Lisbon is to let it die? The people of Europe do not want it.

 The fact is that the United Kingdom Government will not seek to decide, determine or dictate to the Irish Government regarding their next move. It is for the Irish Government to make their decision. I offer an observation in passing: as has been said, the Lisbon treaty is the first treaty that officially recognises children&#146;s rights across the EU. Previous treaties recognised animal rights; this treaty recognises children&#146;s rights. That is an important innovation and improvement.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for the gracious way in which he carefully put his point. I do not agree with him, however. I think that Peter Mandelson is doing a fantastic job as Commissioner. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I had thought, until today, that the Conservative party supported reform of the common agricultural policy as we continue a wider review and reform of Europe&#146;s budget so that it reflects the future, rather than the historical past of massive subsidies being paid to farmers instead of protecting the environment.</p>

 Dr. el-Baradei, the International Atomic Energy Agency director general, reported on Iran&#146;s nuclear programme on 26 May. I spoke to him last week about his report. He confirmed that Iran had failed to suspend enrichment-related activities; had made no progress on transparency measures, for which the United Nations Security Council and the IAEA had called; and had failed to answer the IAEA&#146;s questions relating to studies with a possible military dimension. He said that these studies were a &#147;matter of serious concern&#148;, and they are the subject of continuing IAEA investigation.</p>

 Why did the Prime Minister say on 16 June, after his meeting with President George Bush, that that day he would take action that would immediately freeze the assets of Iran&#146;s biggest bank, Bank Melli, when many days later that clearly still has not happened?</p>

 I am sorry that the right hon.

I would have thought that that would be welcomed in all parts of the House.</p>

 I am very happy to confirm to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that we are 100 per cent. committed to the pursuit of a diplomatic resolution to the problem in respect of Iran&#146;s nuclear intentions, which are, of course, a threat to stability right across the region. There is now an ever wider coalition ready to put pressure on the Iranian regime, and also to try to make clear to the Iranian people that a major offer of economic, cultural and scientific co-operation is waiting for them. The economic malaise that currently afflicts Iran is the result of the choices made by the Iranian Government, but there is an alternative for them, and we are committed to make sure that the sanctions and incentives reflect that.</p>

 I am genuinely sorry that the hon. Gentleman has taken that tack because actually there is agreement across the House that a sanctions and incentives dual track is the right approach to Iran. There is agreement&#151;from Iran to the United States, to this country and to any independent observer&#151;that the sanctions are having an effect on the Iranian economy. The Bank Melli decision has been implemented, as of yesterday, and UN resolution 1803 has been fully implemented and the further sanctions to which he referred. Although the International Atomic Energy Agency discussions were completed only in May, there is the report to the IAEA board, and, as I said, UN sanctions resolution 1803 is now to be implemented. There should be a shared commitment to see those fully in force. The fact that, side by side with those measures, there is a revived offer to Iran is a good thing, not a bad thing, and I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has tried to create division about that.</p>

 The Doha accord and the election of President Sleiman were important steps forward for Lebanon, but the situation remains extremely fragile. It is now vital that a national unity Government be formed as soon as possible. During my recent visit to Lebanon earlier this month, I underlined my strong support for President Sleiman and Prime Minister Siniora, including through $4 million of UK support to the Lebanese security sector that will be so important in rebuilding the confidence of the citizens of that country in their armed forces.</p>

 We certainly do need to rebuild confidence, because earlier this year they had gone to the brink, almost reaching civil war.

 I know that my hon.

I think that it is the nomination of a Government that is currently held up, and I spoke to Prime Minister Siniora about that when I was in Lebanon and last week, in advance of yesterday&#146;s and today&#146;s conference in Austria on the rebuilding of the Palestinian refugee camps. The nomination of the Government will take place and, next year, there will also be elections for a new Government. I very much hope that all the parties will recognise their interest in pursuing a stable strategy in advance of those elections, and in allowing them to take place in conditions as close to normality&#151;certainly without violence&#151;as possible.</p>

We raise this issue regularly, bilaterally and multilaterally. There are very worrying reports of child labour in the cotton industry. We have raised these matters with the Government, but we also support the demand of UNICEF and the International Labour Organisation for an external examination and oversight of what is happening in the Uzbek cotton industry, so that those reports can be discounted or proven once and for all, and then action can be taken.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises a very important point.

For the first time in the occupied Palestinian territories, there has been a withdrawal of Israeli defence force troops and the installation of the Palestinian security forces. We are big sponsors of the Palestinian security forces financially, but also through the mentors whom we provide there. I believe that my hon. Friend the Minister for the Middle East discussed the matter with Prime Minister Fayad last night in Berlin. The critical thing is that the successes in Jenin are now repeated in other parts of the west bank.</p>

Will they include, in particular, a full visa ban for Mugabe, his officials and their families and associates, a range of financial measures, including an assets freeze on institutions complicit in the regime&#146;s abuses and a ban on their transactions, and a guarantee that there will be no more invitations to European Union summits for a criminal Government who have lost all legitimacy?</p>

 I am pleased to tell the right hon. Gentleman that no such summit is currently in prospect. I can assure him that all the options that he has described will be discussed at European Union level; last night, I spoke to the Dutch Foreign Minister. This is not Britain against Zimbabwe; the whole of the European Union now wants to recognise the importance of the situation. On the basis of two recent phone conversations and exchanges with Mr. Kouchner, the French Foreign Minister, I am pleased to say that the incoming French presidency wants to give this matter priority too.</p>

May I additionally ask the Foreign Secretary, particularly in the light of the African National Congress statement today, which is much more critical than the South African Government have been of the situation in Zimbabwe, whether he has had any indication of any change in South Africa&#146;s policy? Given that President Mbeki has been invited to the G8 summit in two weeks&#146; time, where Africa and development is on the agenda, will the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary try to ensure that the G8 communiqu&#233; calls specifically on all nations present at that summit to cease any actions that prop up a regime that is doing untold damage, both to Africa and to development, and thus give appropriate voice to world opinion on the conduct of the South African Government?</p>

 I think the whole House united yesterday in recognising the importance of South Africa to change in Zimbabwe. The right hon.

One can look at the public actions of South Africa, notably in the UN Security Council yesterday, when the presidential statement was published&#151;it is available on the website&#151;by unanimity. South Africa and China, countries that were mentioned in yesterday&#146;s discussion, signed up to language condemning the Mugabe regime, both for its humanitarian abuses and for the way in which it tried to rig the election&#151;or made the election impossible&#151; and calling on African leaders to take steps forward.

However, the history of Iran&#146;s failure to be open and transparent with the international community about its nuclear intentions has gravely undermined confidence. Therefore, at this stage it is right to talk openly and plainly about continued commitment to shipments of uranium into Iran, for example for the Bushehr reactor, for which the Russians are responsible. It is right that we are willing to open discussions with the Iranians should they first freeze and then suspend their uranium enrichment programme. It is premature for us to say that we know that there is one single answer of the sort to which the hon. Gentleman refers. We have to recognise that confidence has been gravely undermined and needs to be rebuilt step by step as the Iranians show themselves to be a trustworthy partner of the international community.</p>

 Yes, certainly. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that Zimbabwe should remain at the top of our agenda beyond the date of the end of the Mugabe regime. Both sides of the House recognised yesterday that the massive reconstruction job is one in which we are not monopoly players&#151;we are not the sole players&#151;but I hope that we will be significant players in supporting a decent Government for those decent people in Zimbabwe who desperately need the help of not only Britain but all the richer countries, and certainly all their neighbours.</p>

 I visited Addis Ababa last week and tried to discover what I could about the preparations that have been made to meet that impending catastrophe. As far as I could judge, it certainly does not look as though it will be on the scale of 1984. I was told that there are adequate food supplies and that the systems are in place to get that food to the people. I hope that that is right.

Like Ken Livingstone, I like newts and, on that basis, I would name this Bill the &#147;Livingstone Mayoralty Memorial Newt Bill&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="80624-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08062489000157">Although there may be some amusement here, this is a very serious issue. What links great crested newts and bats is that they are both European protected species&#151;EPS&#151;and that gives strict protection under the European habitats directive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80624-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08062489000158">I shall illustrate but two of many recent cases that explain the problem. First, last summer Mr. and Mrs. Histed, who live near Chippenham in Wiltshire, were flooded out of their house by 3 ft of water when a ditch blocked. Repairs to the house cost a quarter of a million pounds and, not unreasonably, they wished to unblock the ditch. However, they were refused permission by the Environment Agency, which ordered a &#147;newt search&#148;, forcing this pensioner couple to remain in a caravan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80624-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08062489000159">Secondly, on the edge of my constituency, the Earl Shilton bypass was delayed three months after it was believed that great crested newts might be on site. The council spent &#163;1.2 million erecting special newt fencing and traps, but it never found a single great crested newt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80624-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08062489000160">That is hardly surprising, as anyone who knows anything about the life cycle of great crested newts will know that they can move 1,000 yd or more from their breeding sites. One might think that this newt must therefore be rare but, according to the Government, there are 66,000 great crested newt breeding ponds in England alone, and the Secretary of State for the Environment said in a letter to me that</p>
<a name="80624-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="08062489000351"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;great crested newts are widespread in lowland England and in some areas are present in good numbers&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80624-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08062489000161">Furthermore, the decline in these newts results from changed farming practices, which have caused ponds on farmland to be filled in. May I suggest that creating new ponds would be cheaper and more effective than expecting the Leicestershire council tax payer to fork out &#163;1.2 million for nothing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80624-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08062489000162">Bats&#151;which are so beautiful flying at dusk&#151;are also an EPS under the habitats directive. They are wild creatures whose natural habitat is roosting in caves or rotten trees. They existed long before man built houses and churches.

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80624-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08062489000163">I should like to draw particular attention to St Nicholas church in the hamlet of Stanford on Avon, 100 yd outside my constituency in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell). The 14th century church is filled with the most marvellous monuments in alabaster and marble. There is an organ case from the chapel royal in Whitehall palace that was sold after the execution of King Charles I. Simon Jenkins gives the church four stars in his book, &#147;England&#146;s Thousand Best Churches&#148;, but if the mediaeval stained glass had been in situ rather than being restored, he might easily have given it five stars. The church is part of our national heritage, and deserves to be preserved. I was there on Sunday, sitting next to a 16th-century tomb of a knight and his wife. The tomb was restored at great cost, which was partly met by taxpayers through English Heritage and the National Heritage Memorial Fund. Bat droppings are stuck all over the intricate tracery and writing on the tomb and can also be found all over the walls and often on the altar. That is very unpleasant and is a hygiene risk during communion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80624-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08062489000164">Much worse is the damage being caused to another fine marble monument, which has been under a bat roost. The urine, which contains ammonia, has stained and scarred the marble and the monument itself is sometimes completely covered in piles of droppings; I am talking about not one or two, but bucketloads of droppings. I have a photograph that I am happy to show any concerned Member.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80624-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08062489000165">The church&#146;s tiny congregation is unable to take any action because of the habitats directive. Natural England has not been helpful. It has suggested ludicrous gazebos over the monuments; I wonder how that approach would work with wall paintings similarly at risk in other churches. Helpfully, Natural England charged the church warden &#163;525 for its useless advice. The taxpayer funds the restoration of churches through one Government body, but another Government body insists that they cannot be preserved from damage by bats. Even worse is the fact that the diocesan advisory committee for Coventry and Leicester wrote that the parochial church council</p>
<a name="80624-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="08062489000352"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;should seriously consider declaring the church redundant&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80624-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08062489000167">Bats, of course, will live elsewhere. According to the Bat Conservation Trust,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80624-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08062489000169">My problem with both the EPS issues that I have mentioned is that the entire approach is disproportionate. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs tells me that it advocates a proportionate response regarding great crested newts, but I note that last year Taylor Woodrow was fined &#163;2,000 for damaging a newt site in Essex.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80624-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08062489000170">If anybody doubts the ridiculous bureaucracy surrounding this issue, they should look at the way in which Natural England thinks one should deal with great crested newts.

Why is there not a proportionate response? The House might know that there was a derogation under the original legislation in 1994. Members might wonder what the European Court of Justice does, and now I can tell them: it judges these matters, and it overturned the proportionate approach and the derogation.

Then, after the Conservative Government introduced inflation targeting in 1992 and the incoming Labour Government reinforced that move in 1997 by creating the independent Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, it ceased, for a decade or more, to be an issue on the political radar screen.</p>

By &#147;lucky Chancellor&#148; I simply mean that he was riding the crest of a wave of imported deflation, which created many of the conditions upon which he built his claimed reputation. The hon.

Inflation is booming on the high street and the Prime Minister&#146;s reputation for economic competence is bust. The cost of a shopping basket of groceries has rocketed by 12.6 per cent. according to <i> The Grocer</i>&#151;that well-known authority on grocery prices&#151;while fuel and domestic energy prices are up 17 per cent. and 9 per cent. respectively, with a further increase of at least 40 per cent., or around &#163;400, for an average household predicted in domestic gas prices for the coming winter. Worse than that, the cost of a basket of 40 essentials has increased by 19.8 per cent. over the last year, piling the pressure on the most vulnerable consumers&#151;those on low and fixed incomes. Bread is up 29 per cent., eggs are up 48 per cent, butter is up 30 per cent. and transport costs are up 16 per cent. The <i> Daily Mirror</i>&#146;s cost of living index shows most people faced a rise of 11.6 per cent. over the last year, not the official 3.3 per cent. I think that even the Government are likely to agree that that is unlikely to be a Conservative plot.</p>

Apparently, more people are growing their own vegetables&#151;one in three of us according to a survey in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>, with nearly half motivated by cost. But there are some not so positive consequences. Bargain hunters are moving away from fresh foods and resorting to cheaper options. Frozen fish sales are up 11 per cent. on a year ago. A survey of citizens advice bureaux in England and Wales suggests that a growing number of people are having difficulty in paying for, and are seeking help with, essential household bills.</p>

They also report a continuing increase in problems relating to basic essentials, such as gas, electricity, water, telephone and council tax debts. The CAB&#146;s briefing reports that the combination of big increases in household bills, especially fuel, and rising housing costs is putting additional pressure on people&#146;s finances when they are already stretched to the limit. Bureaux reported that they had dealt with 215,000 new debt problems in the first two months of 2008 alone and the report goes on to list examples that all have one thing in common: people on low or fixed incomes who are living at the margin of economic viability. For many people, the surge in living costs is turning a situation that is just manageable into one that is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="80624-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08062489000197">We have tabled this motion to give the House an opportunity to debate the soaring cost of living and the Government&#146;s lack of room for manoeuvre in responding to it. The first part of the motion expresses the House&#146;s deep concern at the rapidly rising cost of living. To be candid, there are two reasons for that concern. The first, as the CAB report demonstrates, is a compassionate concern because inflation hits hardest those with the least bargaining power: pensioners on fixed incomes, the lowest paid in the most marginal jobs and people with long-term disabilities who are living on benefits. When an economic shock strikes, those groups, by definition, will be the least able to cope with it and the least likely to have any savings cushion. All of us in Parliament must voice their concerns and fears because they have little bargaining power themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="80624-0005.htm_para3"><a name="08062489000198">There is, however, a more calculating economic reason for the rising cost of living. Rapidly rising inflation also affects those with more bargaining power in the employment marketplace. Their response to the rapidly rising cost of living poses the genuine threat to our future economic stability, hence the second part of the motion, which acknowledges the dangers of a wage-price spiral.</p>

The recent Shell tanker drivers&#146; settlement has subsequently added a further turn of the ratchet. The Incomes Data Services data, which were published this morning, show how many private sector settlements now include RPI linking, reigniting memories of the disastrous flirtation with indexation in the 1970s.</p>

The prospect of a summer of discontent looms and Conservative Members wait with interest to see how a Labour Government, desperate for cash from the unions to save the Labour party from bankruptcy, will deal with the new militancy on wages on top of the already aggressive demands for further competitiveness-eroding employment legislation.</p>

With consumer prices index inflation up from 1.8 per cent. to 3.3 per cent. in the past nine months and a raft of further price increases to feed through, the Governor warned of the dangers of a wage response, which would mean that the jump in food and oil prices was embedded in our economy through an old-fashioned wage-price spiral, with wage earners trying to compensate themselves for rising prices, thus ensuring the further erosion of the value of their wages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="80624-0005.htm_para8"><a name="08062489000203">Let me take the opportunity to say from the Dispatch Box that the Governor of the Bank of England is right. Given that growth is slowing significantly below the Treasury&#146;s Budget estimate, if the inflationary pressure that has surged through into the index in the past months is reflected in future wage rises, Britain risks revisiting the 1970s, with entrenched inflation and stagnant growth&#151;stagflation in all its horror. By warning of his determination to stick to the Chancellor&#146;s inflation target, the Governor is effectively throwing down the gauntlet to the unions, with the clear threat, &#147;Go for the inflation-matching wage rises and I will bust you with growth-killing and unemployment-creating interest rate increases.&#148; They should listen to the Governor of the Bank of England.</p>

Yes, inflation has to be controlled, so that Britain can maintain its competitiveness and be in a position to respond when the upturn comes. That means difficult times ahead.

Consumer prices index inflation at constant tax rates is 3.1 per cent., which means that if taxes remained at the rates prevailing at the beginning of this year, inflation would be 0.2 per cent. lower than it is today.</p>

With inflation expectations so important, the Government must look again, as they surely will be forced to do by their own Back Benchers, at the swingeing road tax increases for next year and the year after, which are doubling the road tax for about a million older cars and raising it on the overwhelming majority.</p>

 The Chief Secretary is a reasonable person, and knows that hundreds of thousands of people across the country, in every part of the economy but notably in the national health service and social services departments, are subsidising their employers every time they fill up their cars with petrol that they use in the course of their work, because the approved mileage allowance payment scheme, set in 2002 at 40p a mile for the first 10,000 miles, has not been upgraded. Last year there was a review, which has not been published. I have tabled a parliamentary question asking the Department to publish that review, and have not been answered for three weeks. If she wants to take us into her confidence, could she not publish that report so that we can see why the Treasury has refused to take the simple step of upgrading such mileage allowances so that some of the poorest people in society no longer subsidise their employers?</p>

 I am happy to look into the point about the review and to write to the hon. Gentleman about it. Again, however, the fundamental problem faced not just by this country but right across the world is the soaring price of a barrel of oil. Fuel duty is 16 per cent. lower in real terms than it was in 1999. Every country in the world is facing problems. Egypt, Haiti and the Philippines have had riots over food prices as a result of the pressure on commodity prices. In Spain and Italy, major protests have taken place about the cost of petrol. Countries right across the world are affected, and that is feeding into domestic inflation in this country too.</p>

The record of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party on fiscal policy and debt management, however, was atrocious. Under this Government between 1997 and 2007 public sector borrowing was 1.2 per cent of GDP, whereas under the last Conservative Government between 1992 and 1997, public sector borrowing was considerably higher at 6 per cent. of GDP, and that is why debt was also considerably higher.

 I certainly think it worth reflecting on some of what has happened over the last 10 or 11 years. There have been benefits from world commodity prices, largely thanks to developing countries. There have also been significant benefits as a result of our making the Bank of England independent&#151;a decision which, as the hon.

During the same period we have dealt with global challenges: for example, the bursting of the dotcom bubble and the events of 9/11, which pushed other countries into recession. Over the past 11 years other countries have experienced recession, while the United Kingdom has continued to experience strong economic growth throughout.

We need to act at international level to help increase production in the short term. That means working with international partners to remove some of the barriers preventing increased supply. On food prices, the UK will work with other countries to put forward proposals for increasing agricultural production at next month&#146;s G8 summit. We have already committed to doubling investment in agricultural research to help improve efficiency and production over the next five years.

They decry jam tomorrow when in fact, all that they are talking about is proceeds of growth, which is a &#147;jam tomorrow&#148; policy if ever I heard one. They are the ones who caused the roof to be leaking in the first place, which we fixed literally and metaphorically around the country.

We are increasing borrowing to support the economy, and that is the right thing to do at this stage in the economic cycle. We have delayed the increase in fuel duty, and we have increased tax credits and allowances for pensioners and cut the basic rate of tax. In addition, the Chancellor has increased the tax allowance for this year not just for those affected by the 10p rate, but for all basic rate taxpayers, putting &#163;120 into the pockets of some 22 million people. The overall tax burden, which is less than it was during most of the 1980s, is set to fall this year.</p>

 I should point out to the hon. Gentleman that his own party&#146;s research document has recognised that in real terms, since 2001-02&#151;even in advance of some of the most recent changes that we have set out&#151;families with children are better off than they were in 1997, or in 2001-02. They are seeing real improvements in their income and their support. For example, lone parents are &#163;12 a week better off and couples with children where one parent works full time can be more than &#163;700 a year better off. That is why we are also providing people with additional support through tax credits. I should point out to the hon. Gentleman that this extra support being provided through tax credits and by increasing child benefit in the next year and the winter fuel payment this year is funded by the increase in alcohol duty that Conservative Members have opposed. They are opposing our measures to provide additional support to families at a time when people are under pressure, particularly from their winter fuel bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80624-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08062489000304">It is worth reflecting, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) suggested, on what the Conservatives&#146; remedy might be. They have said that they would not put up alcohol duty and would have lower borrowing&#151;not that they can point to any kind of historical record to support their position. We must remember that this is a party that has never proposed lower borrowing. Instead, it has repeatedly proposed spending increases and tax cuts at the same time&#151;that would push borrowing up. Over the past 12 months alone, the Conservatives have called for &#163;10 billion of extra spending on unfunded tax cuts. At the previous election, just at the time they now say they would have cut borrowing, they were actually calling for billions of pounds in extra borrowing&#151;the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies costed their tax and benefit plans alone at an extra &#163;5 billion. In 2005, they were also planning billions of pounds of extra spending on top of that, on things such as the pupil passport and the patients passport for private care, not to mention defence, the right to buy, tuition fees and offshore processing centres for asylum seekers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="80624-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08062489000305">At the 2001 election it was the same story: a &#163;3 billion unfunded tax cut on savings, which would help those on the highest incomes, but billions of pounds more spending on asylum seekers&#146; reception centres, defence and other areas. The Conservatives would not have cut borrowing; instead, they promised again and again to dig themselves a massive black hole for the public finances. So much for telling us to fix the roof; they promised to dig up the foundations.</p>

We have been operating within our fiscal rules to bring down debt substantially and to cut the bills of the economic failure and high unemployment that we inherited from the Conservatives.

 The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) gave a clear and forceful critique of Government economic policy, much of which I agreed with and so do not need to repeat.

I think that there is a genuine interest, both positive and negative, in what an alternative Government might have to offer. Perhaps I could start by dealing with the phrasing of the motion, by which I am genuinely a bit confused. The first five lines seem eminently sensible and fair, but the motion then goes on to talk about &#147;excessively loose fiscal policy&#148; with approval. The correct policy response to excessively loose fiscal policy&#151;this is presumably what the Conservatives think the Government should have done, and is what the Conservatives would have done and would now do&#151;is to use a combination of higher taxes and reduced spending. That is the opposite to loose fiscal policy. But the motion does not say that. It says that what the Government should have done&#151;what the Conservatives would presumably have done&#151;is to provide assistance and support to hard-pressed families, which involves cutting taxes and increasing spending. Within the same sentence, we have two diametrically opposed macro-economic policies&#151;</p>

 That does not follow at all. The hon.

There is a problem with fiscal policy, as the OECD identified, although it is less extreme than the hon. Gentleman claims. Were we to go into a period of slump, or of prolonged stagnation as they had in Japan, it would be very difficult for the Government to embark on strikingly Keynesian policies, because of the erosion in the fiscal rules that has already taken place. But that is not what the motion says. It gives the impression that we can simultaneously have fiscal austerity and crowd-pleasing measures of assistance and that is a fundamental contradiction.</p>

There are two ways in which that Conservative policy&#151;I take it as a compliment that they have borrowed it from us&#151;could be delivered. The first is to have a carbon tax, which in reality is a tax on household fuel and even I am not brave enough to argue for that. The second is to increase taxation on transport fuels. A bit can be raised from aviation taxes, but the green tax switch, which is the third element in the Conservative proposals, in fact involves increasing taxation on the motorist.</p>

I am not even sure that the shadow Chancellor has been told, because he told <i> The Daily Telegraph </i>last week that he was committing himself to not increasing the 2p rate on duty on petrol in the autumn, which struck me as an extraordinarily silly and impetuous thing to do. It might be that the Government will not increase it, and that might perhaps be the right thing to do, depending on conditions at the time. We do not know what the Government&#146;s fiscal position will be in the autumn. We do not know what the oil price will be. Any sensible person would wait before making such a commitment.</p>

Be that as it may, I agree that stamp duty needs to be reformed. In particular, it needs to be reformed not for people at the bottom end but for those who are paying more than &#163;250,000 for a property, who pay the 3 per cent. slab. There is an argument for reforming stamp duty to shift the burden on to much higher value houses from those in that price range.</p>

My understanding is that that levy is going through the Budget, but once the Budget has been completed, will that policy lapse or will there be a second levy on foreign non-doms? That is a legitimate question and I hope that at some point we might get an answer.</p>

I am very interested in the subject and have spoken a lot about it, and the Conservative suggestions are quite sensible if extremely modest. The one specific suggestion concerns illustrative scenarios for credit card users, and the only problem with the policy is that it is already happening. I believe that the Office of Fair Trading ruled three years ago that such illustrative scenarios for credit cards should be introduced. They have been introduced and they do not work because they are not comparable. The policy seems to have limited value, although it is perfectly sensible&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para0"><a name="08062489000328">Finally, I want to draw attention to the proposals on council tax, because they are fair. The Conservatives rightly point out that the doubling of council tax since the Government came in has been a major contributory factor to the pressures of the cost of living on low-income families and pensioners. It is a regressive tax that bears very little relation to current property values, and the Conservatives should know that because they introduced it. What I am puzzled about is why they have ignored some perfectly sensible reforms. We have argued that council tax should be abolished, but it does not have to be. The Lyons report contains some perfectly sensible reforms for increasing the take-up of council tax benefit, but they are not even mentioned by the Conservatives. Instead, they suggest that there should be a referendum to deal with excessive increases in council tax, and on page 18 of their document they list five councils that have imposed such increases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para1"><a name="08062489000329">The unfortunate problem is that four of those councils are Conservative led&#151;indeed, two of them, Birmingham and Leeds, have benefited from a joint administration with the Liberal Democrats. They are clearly not bad councils, therefore, but they appear to have been singled out for a referendum on the council tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08062489000330">I am genuinely puzzled about how the referendum would work in helping people with the cost of living. What question would be asked? If people vote no to a proposed council tax increase, does that mean that councils would have carte blanche to cut their education budgets? Would they be free to use their reserves without being subject to the present constraints? The policy is extremely badly thought out, yet it is at the centre of the Conservatives&#146; proposals for dealing with the cost of living.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08062489000331">In the few minutes that remain to me, I want to concentrate on what I think are the two key elements in the increased cost of living that, in reality, we face. On the front of their report, the Conservatives have helpfully included a summary of the main contributory factors to what they describe as &#147;Gordon Brown&#146;s Disaster&#148;. Those factors are nine price increases&#151;seven of them in food, and the other two in fuel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08062489000332">What is the Conservatives&#146; proposal for dealing with those nine price increases? Indeed, what can anyone do about them? Three of the price rises relate to dairy products&#151;butter, milk and cheese. What is the failing in Government policy in respect of the dairy industry? How could the Government be expected to mitigate the problem? I have sat through years of painful Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions, in which the main challenge from both Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members has related to the poverty and poor returns of dairy farmers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08062489000333">That problem has been rectified through the market, so are the Conservatives suggesting that dairy farmers are now being paid too much, or that the market should not be allowed to work? I do not know, but we are talking about part of &#147;Gordon Brown&#146;s Disaster&#148;, so I presume that the Conservatives have some idea of how the problem should be rectified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08062489000334">A much bigger problem exists, of course, and I agree with the Government motion in that much of it has to do with world trade in food.

Mr. Mandelson was responsible for millions of children dying of starvation because he was failing to support French protectionist food policy. That is completely idiotic, and I hope that the Government will make it absolutely and publicly clear that they do not subscribe to that sort of nonsense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08062489000335">The main contributor to inflation in the short run has been the price of energy. It is worth devoting some time to looking at how that problem has arisen. We might also consider some possible solutions to it, and whether any party has any answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08062489000336">The rise in energy prices is partly a function of world prices but, as the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) correctly noted in an intervention, another factor is the way that the economic rent from oil is divided between Governments, consumers and producers. For the moment, though, I want to focus on the problem with world prices. It is clear that the Prime Minister thinks that he has a role to play, as he went to the middle east in an attempt to influence the producers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08062489000337">It is important to say that some foolish myths are circulating. The Government&#151;and the Prime Minister personally&#151;have been responsible for the first of them, as they have argued that the price of oil in world markets is being forced up by members of the OPEC deliberately withholding supply. That is complete nonsense: there is less than 2 per cent. spare capacity, and there are serious production problems in countries such as Nigeria and&#151;because of the war&#151;Iraq. The price rises are not due to the malicious withholding of supplies, and the Prime Minister is totally wrong to have created that impression.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08062489000338">The other myth in circulation is that the price rises are something to do with wicked speculators. It may seem odd, coming from a Liberal Democrat, but I disparage that argument. It has become a fashionable argument; indeed, the leader of the Conservative party was advancing it yesterday. However, there is not a shred of evidence that there are accumulated oil stocks or that futures markets have systematically pushed prices in their current direction. Those markets affect the level of volatility, but not long-term trends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para11"><a name="08062489000339">Speculators are clearly not the issue. There is a policy problem, on which the Prime Minister reported yesterday: there is a shortage of investment in the oil industry. I would like to have raised two issues with him at the time, and I will communicate them to the Minister. If the oil producers are so negligent in failing to attract foreign investment in the oil industry, why was the one OPEC country that has welcomed foreign oil companies&#151;Iran&#151;threatened with sanctions the moment it did so? Foreign oil companies were only too happy to invest in Iran, but they have been told that they will be penalised if they go there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para12"><a name="08062489000340">I am sure that the Saudis and others have made another point to the Government, who should reflect on it. The Saudis and others would ask, &#147;Why are you criticising us for not investing, given that you have increased additional corporation tax and petroleum tax levies on the North sea oil industry, making the west of Shetland fields completely financially unsustainable?&#148; Through its own policies, Britain has as much responsibility as the oil producers for failing to produce a supply.</p>

 There is a complicated argument, and we could spend the day on it. I am trying to understand other people&#146;s arguments. When people complain about speculative pressures, I think that they are saying two different things. One is that futures markets do not function properly, although I do not think that there is any evidence for that&#151;those markets may be volatile in the short run, but they do not cause enormous shifts over periods of years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para13"><a name="08062489000343">The other thing that such people are saying is that a lot of people who are nervous about investing their savings are putting them into commodity-based securities. That is the argument that the Conservative leader advanced yesterday. However, the actual magnitudes of money involved in those commodity securities is trivially small in relation to the turnover of oil markets. It is difficult to explain what has happened in any way other than through the fact that world oil demand has been rising unsustainably and that supply is fixed in the short run. That is the problem.</p>

 In that context, will the hon. Gentleman reflect on his party&#146;s policy of an 80 per cent. cut in CO2 emissions in the United Kingdom by 2050? World demand for oil is increasing, and the suggestions that he seems to put forward in respect of bottlenecks because of lack of investment is a policy for increasing oil output. The rest of the world continues to use oil. The macho gesture politics of 80 per cent. cuts in the United Kingdom&#151;probably in isolation from almost the rest of the world&#151;are ridiculous, given that demand for oil is increasing and will continue to increase. I urge the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party to reflect on that; otherwise, it will go on asking UK residents to undergo a painful transition, which will not prevent climate change.</p>

 This is a complicated argument, and we are getting a bit off the cost of living. However, I refer back to the excellent report produced by the Cabinet Office in 2003, under the original editorship of the then Prime Minister Tony Blair. It suggested that a very large shift to renewable power could be achieved without nuclear power and at reasonable cost within the time arrangements that we are talking about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para14"><a name="08062489000346">The challenge to all parties is to face a few home truths about oil and energy prices. The first is that oil prices, and energy prices generally, are likely to remain high. It is important that they should, for conservation and environmental reasons and because of the need for long-term security of supply. There is no argument for pandering to populist demands to cut oil prices to the final user; that would make very little sense. Although there are real problems for people in remote rural communities, which is why we have argued for a derogation for them, motorists&#146; costs have risen less rapidly than costs for public transport users, and that remains a basic feature of transport policy. Moreover, although British diesel prices are exceptionally high because of diesel taxation, which is one of the truckers&#146; grievances, and a reasonable one, British petrol prices are not out of line with western Europe&#151;they are pretty comparable  <br>

with those in France and Germany and lower than those in Holland, Belgium and the Nordic countries. The one European country that could, if it wished, offer its residents low petrol prices is Norway&#151;a major oil producer that has much higher taxes and prices than the United Kingdom. Perhaps those are the truths that should be spelled out when we are talking about the high cost of motoring and the high cost of petrol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80624-0008.htm_para15"><a name="08062489000347">The one area where the Government could sensibly intervene to reduce the cost of living in relation to energy prices is gas. The Conservative document has some sensible comments to make about the wholesale market in gas, although it does not go nearly far enough. There is a lot of evidence that there is a case for a Competition Commission reference as regards the gas and electricity producers. Social tariffs are far too ungenerous in relation to the prices that companies offer to their direct debit users. As my party leader has been arguing over a period of weeks and months, there is a case for using the windfalls that producers are earning as a result of the non-auctioning of licences under the European trading scheme to ameliorate the problems faced by poor gas users, particularly pensioners. The Government could do something constructive and useful about that in the short run.</p>

 It is a pleasure to speak after my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

It is one of those metaphors that repays close study, because in fact we did fix the roof. There were a lot of roofs to fix&#151;in our hospitals, in our schools, in our police stations and elsewhere. The legacy of leaking roofs in our hospitals was such that we had to provide 100 new hospital schemes, as well as 2,850 new or improved GP surgeries. The hospital buildings were needed to cater for the investment in training that Labour put into the 83,000 extra nurses, 35,000 extra GPs and 33,000 extra consultants.

 My hon. Friend could not be more right. National debt is now far lower than it was under the Conservatives. The Tory debt was 41.1 per cent. of GDP at the start of the 1997 economic cycle. Labour has cut that to 37 per cent., which is a lower level of national debt than in the United States, the euro area or Japan.

 I understand why the hon. Member does not want to respond to my points. Of course, people are having to examine their individual budgets and I am sympathetic about that. However, without the economic stability and considerable growth that we have enjoyed, which no other G7 or advanced industrial country has experienced, people would not today enjoy a standard of living unparalleled in history&#151;we all want to co-operate to protect that. Of course, I want young couples to access the housing market. I realise that people have suffered problems and I am therefore delighted by the two thirds increase in real terms investment in local authority housing.

Tory borrowing peaked at 7.8 per cent. of national income in 1993, which is equivalent to &#163;110 billion today.

We have made three cuts in corporation tax since the Conservatives set it at 33 per cent.&#151;a full five points higher than it is under this Labour Government.

One in five families had no one in work and one in three children grew up in poverty. Yet in spite of the makeover, the Conservatives would still scrap the new deal.

Now, however, the Government are saying that it is all the Asians&#146; fault for daring to buy all these other things with the money that they have earned buy selling us those cheaper goods, even though the Government did absolutely nothing for 10 years to increase our capacity in agriculture or energy, when they should have been making a contribution to the world situation.</p>

 I am well known for believing that because there is such a rip-off at the pumps in this country and a rip-off on North sea production, we should be reducing the rates in order to keep the amount of tax coming in at the forecast level rather than over it. I suggest that the hon.

It is their problem; they created it. They have the power to say to the House today, &#147;We are very sorry.

Bank independent, they stripped it of its responsibility to manage public debt and its responsibility to have day-to-day supervision of the clearing banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80624-0009.htm_para14"><a name="08062495000050">When the credit crunch and the crisis hit, the Bank of England was blind and deaf to its own money markets and did not know minute by minute what the Government&#146;s debt position was&#151;crucial to the functioning of the money markets&#151;and it did not know minute by minute what the clearing banks&#146; position was, when they were clearly extremely short of funds. That meant that at the crucial point where the Bank needed to be expert at running the money markets to enforce the rates laid down by the Monetary Policy Committee, it was not able to do so. There was a complete collapse of monetary control across the August through to October period as they lurched from boom to bust in their handling of the economy. It was a failure of the Treasury, as well as the Bank of England; it was the tripartite system, led by the Chancellor, that led to the run on the Bank&#151;a disgrace in an advanced economy that makes its living primarily out of financial services through export markets. It was a disgrace that this Government presided over such an embarrassing situation when all previous Governments had been able to keep the banking system just about liquid enough, even in bad times, so that there was never a run on the banks for more than 100 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80624-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08062495000051">All that happened because of those bodged reforms. The Monetary Policy Committee is alleged to be independent. The Government&#146;s best case is that the MPC was made a bit more independent; clearly, the Bank of England was very badly damaged by being made less independent, as it lost big functions. Even the MPC was not really made independent, however. Let us remember the record. Before the 2005 election, the Government clearly wanted lower interest rates, so they fiddled the target. They replaced the retail prices index target&#151;the RPI is used in all the index contracts; the RPI is used for wages and indexed debt&#151;and substituted the consumer prices index. Why did they do that? They did it because they knew it would go up less quickly, which would mean easier money and lower interest rates. I see the Economic Secretary shaking her head, but she is an intelligent woman and she knows that that is why they did it, and the adjustment to the target rate was not sufficient to take into account how big the gap was between the more truthful RPI and the less truthful CPI in respect of the prices that people were having to pay in our economy. We had that damage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80624-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08062495000052">There is also the problem that we were never told why some members of the independent MPC were reappointed and others were not. I tabled questions asking about the criteria for reappointment. I asked whether there was some external test for reappointment, whether the voting record was examined and whether only the dovish ones who would vote for lower rates before elections were reappointed. No answer was forthcoming from the Treasury. This Government, who introduced the Freedom of Information Act 2000, will not even tell a Member of this House of Commons why they reappointed some MPC members but not others. They will not even tell me what the criteria were for trying to create some independence for that committee.</p>

They have mis-sold the proposition that they created stability as they created instability. They have still not got a grip on this situation. We had the big lurch from too much liquidity and low interest rates between 2003 and 2006 to interest rates being too high and too little liquidity in 2007. We had the run on the Rock. We then had a welcome reduction in that illiquidity. Money was belatedly injected into the markets and interest rates were lowered a bit, because the Government suddenly realised that fighting slowdown or recession was more important than fighting the inflation that they had already created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80624-0009.htm_para19"><a name="08062495000055">More recently, we have had a lurch the other way. The Bank and the Treasury seem to be worried again about the inflation, which they cannot control because it relates to their past mistakes. This lurch is happening at exactly the point where the housing market is in collapse, the property market is in collapse, there is a second phase to the credit crunch and there are problems with mortgage banks and others because of the extreme squeeze that the Government are putting through. The price of that lamentable failure of monetary policy, the botched reform of the Bank of England and the lurch from boom to bust and from boom to bust again in credit and money markets will be severe for people in this country to pay.</p>

He said to her that the adjustment to the credit crisis and the inflation crisis triggered by the Government must surely come through lower living standards. That is what the Chancellor&#146;s policy is all about when he says that people cannot have RPI-matching pay awards. He has said that public sector pay should go up by considerably less than RPI and is now trying to talk the private sector into exactly the same position. Perhaps he has not realised that a lot of the private sector came to that conclusion a long time ago because it is struggling to remain competitive in an extremely competitive and difficult world.</p>

 It was interesting to listen to the speech of the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), because his critique included points that I have never heard him raise previously. During all the time that the CAP was being renegotiated to decouple subsidies from food production, I never heard him make the point that we should use the CAP to increase food production. Nor have I heard him argue previously for increased support to ease the pressures on low-income families. More of his critique was based on his profound disagreement with this Government&#146;s overall economic policies&#151;that is clear, as he is in a different party and has different priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80624-0010.htm_para0"><a name="08062495000067">Today&#146;s debate touches on one of the most fundamental issues affecting our constituents: their family finances and budgets. A lot of the debate is fairly self-evident. It is obvious to anyone that the cost of living is going up, and that there are differential increases between the rise in the costs of fresh food and in those of manufactured food and manufactured goods generally. For example, the cost of clothing, which is an important factor for many households, has gone down by 6.7 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80624-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08062495000068">It is also clear to everyone that the cost of fuel has gone up. If we examine the details, we see that we are in the third phase of very large fuel price increases. In the first, in 1973, oil prices quadrupled, producing sharp inflation. In the second, in 1989, oil prices went up two and half times, which was a major factor in a massive recession. Since then, oil prices have gone up from $30 a barrel to about $140, and those costs have substantially been managed and absorbed, albeit that we now see the pressures. It is also clear to everyone that apart from fuel prices, a major factor in the cost increases is the increase in commodity prices. People have seen food riots happening in countries around the world.</p>

He said it would be difficult until next March or April, and I am sure he is right.

If they have a family, they will also want to know that the party in Government understands that having children costs more, and that those costs need to be covered. That is why this Government were right to increase child benefit and to make changes to the tax credit system to ensure that in difficult times people know that some safeguards are built into the system for their children. That has been a hallmark of this Government, and the Conservatives have consistently opposed it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="80624-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08062495000085">I must add that the Liberal Democrats have also consistently opposed that, too.

 I am extremely flattered that the hon. Lady thinks that anything I say in this Chamber will influence the vote in Henley.

 If the Liberal Democrats care about what happens to people during these difficult economic times&#151;we must all accept that we are currently going through difficult economic times, and that they will continue for a while&#151;they should be committed to policies that protect those on low pay and families, and give people the chance to rebuild their families&#146; finances, and help to build the UK economy.</p>

However, if he looks at the Joseph Rowntree report produced last year, he will see that the big increases in child and pensioner poverty both occurred during the &#146;80s. It is widely recognised that the current Government&#146;s policies have served in particular to increase the incomes of families with children and those of pensioners, which is why much of the recent debate about the tax credit and the 10p tax rate focused on the single working poor. When my hon. Friend the Minister winds up the debate, I hope she will say what the Government will do to make sure that the incomes of people in that group are protected as well.</p>

sure that schools have kitchens and that children have free fruit, and similar support will be important now. That is a crucial element of this Government&#146;s commitment to protecting people on low incomes. Another is the winter fuel allowance. That replaced the Conservatives&#146; awful cold weather payments, which in fact left most people cold during the winter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80624-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08062495000092">One of the biggest changes&#151;and one of the major ways in which the Government have equipped people to withstand recession&#151;is the strong commitment to employment and job creation. That, above all, will make it possible for people to manage, although there will be problems with pay and the cost of living. In particular, it will make it possible for them to maintain their mortgage payments and keep their homes, which is extremely important.</p>

Friend the Minister responds to the debate, I will be grateful if she deals with the following points in particular. What steps will the Government take to support single working people&#151;particularly young people&#151;who will face difficult times in the coming period? Secondly, might the Government extend some of the fuel poverty provisions? We have been incredibly generous to pensioners with winter fuel payments, but might that be extended to people with disabilities and people with young children, who will also find it difficult to pay their fuel bills if prices increase further and their income does not? Will she also think about driving costs, which particularly affect people such as my constituents who live in an area that does not have very good public transport to take them to work, and many of whom work shifts? In particular, will she consider the Council of Mortgage Lenders proposals for providing some support for families who get into financial difficulties with their mortgages, so that they do not have to wait nine months to get relief? I am sure that that will be an increasing pressure for some families, and I would be grateful if my right hon. Friend addressed that point.</p>

And what have the Government done to those who cannot afford the rich cars&#151;the Jaguars and the BMWs? Why, they have decided to double vehicle excise duty on older cars. So not only do such people experience difficulties buying the diesel and the heating oil that they need to live; on the motor car that, by scrimping and saving weekly, they manage to keep on the road&#151;just about&#151;the Government are about to double vehicle excise duty to hundreds of pounds more. Ministers look upon that with indifference. I see them smiling. The inhabitants of the rural communities whom I represent have no cause to smile. An extra couple of hundred pounds a year will be a serious burden on these people. It is a keenly felt axe upon their quality of life.</p>

The problem we have is that over the past 10 years the Labour Government have not constructed the ideal environment for those companies.

My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) has mentioned the problems that rural communities face in respect of petrol price increases. I met a delegation of 50 Shropshire haulage industry operators the other day, and they are appalled about what is happening to their industry. They are on their knees and they do not see how they can see out the year if petrol prices remain at current levels. One thing that would cost very little would be for Ministers to impose a tax on foreign hauliers using our transport system. That would be a relatively cheap measure for them to introduce, but if we are to save Shropshire&#146;s and England&#146;s haulage industry, it is pivotal that the Government undertake it.</p>

The Government&#146;s grants to Shropshire county council are so minute that volunteers who undertake extremely important work, be it providing meals on wheels or another type of important voluntary activity, come to my surgery to tell me that the mileage allowance that they are paid by the council does not even cover the cost of operating their motor cars to undertake those vital services on which people in remote rural areas and villages depend.

He tried to say that the ball is in the court of the Saudis and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and that they must start increasing production in order to lower the cost of petrol. However, as has been said on many occasions throughout this debate, he is responsible for massively ramping up taxation on petrol in this country. We might want to convince the Saudi Arabians and others to increase production, but friends of mine in Saudi Arabia say, &#147;Your Government have to start by cutting their taxation on petrol before he will convince us to take the issue seriously.&#148;</p>

Rural villagers depend on heating oil to heat their homes. I, too, undertook some investigation into this matter. On 18 February 2007, heating oil cost 39.9p a litre, whereas today it costs 58.75p a litre, which is an increase, in Shropshire, of 147 per cent. Everybody will be paying an extra &#163;340 for a tank load of 1,800 litres, and as certain families normally use up to two tanks, we are talking about an additional cost of &#163;680 for heating oil. Those figures were provided by Oakley&#146;s Fuel, a company in my constituency. The Minister should, of course, be providing grants for individuals to have microgeneration and heating pumps in their homes, rather than have people being dependent on heating fuel. I saw such things being used in Sweden in early 1980s, so they are relatively old technologies, and we should be using them.</p>

One can always think what one likes about the American Government, but they have injected massive liquidity into the economy and given huge tax rebates to their constituents. They see the inherent danger of the coming recession and they want to help individuals to start spending again so that the economy picks up.

It has made the front pages of newspapers and been the lead headline in many news bulletins in only the past six to nine months, but the increasing cost of living has been a fact of life in London for some time. It was one of the main reasons why we had the largest swing in the country at the last general election.</p>

Friends at the complacency of the Government, as shown in the speeches by the Minister and by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths). This Government were happy to take undue credit when things were going well for the economy, but over the past 12 months they have argued that the problems are due to global causes. There are some global issues, and it would be wrong to deny that entirely, but the public have been so hostile because the Government sought to claim that the days of boom and bust were gone and to take credit for the economy being in such an apparently strong position.</p>

The reality of the global world is that the competition we face is from India and China, those two economic superpowers of the 21st century. With 2.5 billion people, they will make far more important competitors than many European countries, and if we do not learn how to adapt our economy&#151;as we evidently have not learned over the past decade&#151;we will all suffer.</p>

The very fact that people start paying income tax when they earn barely &#163;105 a week is a nightmare. It is an especial problem in London and the south-east, where even people doing the worst-paid, part-time jobs pay income tax. The Government will no  <br>

doubt point out that tax credits make a difference, but the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) was very complacent. She gave undue credit to the implementation of the minimum wage. It has made a difference to many of the less well-off in our society, but there is a price to pay for that, and we are beginning to pay for it as the economy slows down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80624-0011.htm_para20"><a name="080624111000034">In London, there is a thriving&#151;indeed, an over-thriving&#151;black economy. We rely on many thousands of immigrants being willing to earn relatively small amounts of money, often paid in cash. One of the biggest indictments of some of the broader aspects of this Government&#146;s policy is that London now has the highest level of unemployment&#151;a total inversion of the position in decades gone by. That is in part because too many Londoners lack the aptitude or the skills to hold down even the most basic jobs. They often live in social housing, which is very scarce, and that has the makings of some serious social unrest in the years ahead.</p>

The servers will be Lithuanians or Poles, or from some other far-flung country, doing some of the relatively unskilled but important jobs in the hospitality sector. That has the makings of a disaster in the future, as unemployment rises. It will not be those who come here short term, to earn some money and learn the language, but our indigenous British who end up unemployed without the skills or aptitude to hold down a job.</p>

Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) when he said that we would have to ensure that public spending fell or taxes would rise. The state of the public finances is dire, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) rightly pointed out, with some trepidation, that he had said that the overall burden was &#163;1.5 trillion, but he had had so little negative comment on that that he suspected that the situation was even worse.</p>

There are some problematic times ahead.</p>

They are a disaster in the making and the complacency of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South was breathtaking. He can talk about the new hospitals and schools, but where is the money coming from? It has not been paid by this generation. It is effectively jam today to be paid for by generations to come. Our children and our grandchildren will foot the bill.</p>

of the idea from the Prime Minister&#146;s point of view is that the room for manoeuvre will be limited for any future Conservative Government, just as, in many ways, the success of privatisation was irreversible once the Labour Government came in to play. Even railway privatisation, which happened in 1996, was not reversed in 12 months when the Labour Government came in to play. The same will happen, I fear, but in reverse, with the increase in public expenditure that is a requisite part of the PFI burden. That tax will have to be paid during the course of the next two decades and that will make the room for manoeuvre more limited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80624-0012.htm_para1"><a name="080624111000040">I fear, in a way, that we might have an election in the next 18 to 24 months, because we will have to take on an economic inheritance that will lead to an appalling state of affairs.</p>

 No. The state of affairs will be far worse than it was in 1979&#151;at least at that point we had had two and a half years of monetarism courtesy of the International Monetary Fund, after the Labour Government had to go cap in hand to the IMF. As we have already seen, there is little doubt that the Government seem set on effectively borrowing against the bank and they keep on borrowing and spending. There are only two ways in which they can possibly get out of the political hole in which they find themselves. One is to make borrowing grind to a halt and the other is to keep on spending to ensure that the cost of living problems to which we have referred will seem to be better for the purposes of an electorate who, they hope, will be grateful come election time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80624-0012.htm_para2"><a name="080624111000043">This country has some severe problems ahead, I fear. The cost of living is an issue that the Government, in their arrogance and complacency, might have thought that they had put on the back burner over much of the past decade, but it will be the leading issue in relation to not only off-balance sheet financing but day-to-day costs. The real worry, which I hear when I speak to constituents who are perhaps slightly older than I am&#151;in their late 40s and early 50s&#151;is that they worry that the situation for their children will be a lot worse than it has been for them. They worry that they cannot pass the standard of living that they have come to take for granted for themselves on to a future generation. Outside wartime, I think that that is roughly the first time in history that that has happened. That would be the worst indictment of the Government&#146;s complacency. The past decade was the best of times. So much should have been invested rather than frittered away. We will see, I fear, the disasters of those years in the decade or so to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80624-0012.htm_para3"><a name="080624111000045">Every Saturday morning, I try to run a street surgery, as I call it, on a street corner in one of the four towns in my constituency, whether on Toll Gavel in Beverley, on Newbegin in Hornsea, in Withernsea or in Hedon. Week after week, people come to speak to me, take me aside and talk about the difficulties that they are having in meeting their basic bills. I have been struck&#151;and pleased, as someone who wants to see a Conservative Government and believes that that would be good for this country&#151;to find that people say, &#147;I&#146;ve always voted Labour, but now I&#146;m going to vote Conservative.&#148; When we look at the context in which people say that and at the weight of their disappointment and despair, and when we consider how much they believe that they were promised and how little they believe has been delivered, we realise how serious the situation is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80624-0012.htm_para4"><a name="080624111000046">Yesterday, a constituent from Withernsea wrote to me to say that their family have a modest family car, but they are selling it because they can no longer afford to run it. Withernsea is a town and has a relatively large number of services, but residents are dependent on other services elsewhere. Other constituents of mine, who do not live in a town but in one of the many villages across the constituency are in a similar position financially but cannot possibly do without a car because of the dearth of public transport and the difficulties that that causes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80624-0012.htm_para5"><a name="080624111000047">When my constituents speak to me at the street surgery, they are pleased to have that opportunity because it at least allows them to feel a connection. Someone from Withernsea, on a very low income, sees certain services withdrawn and needs to feel a connection. They need to feel that there is some way in which they can influence those in power so that they can cause change. When they hear a debate such as this about the cost of living and when, as lifelong Labour supporters, they recall that the Labour party was founded and led by people such as Keir Hardie precisely in order to represent the working poor&#151;the working class, as it traditionally was&#151;they see, instead, a Labour party that has lost its sense of mission. Hundreds of Members&#151;all of us here&#151;are on very high wages compared with my constituents, with high expenses support, too. When those people discover that Labour Members no longer judge participation in such important debates as relevant, their disappointment is compounded further. When they hear speeches such as the one given by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths), whom we all know is extremely close to the Prime Minister, and hear his master&#146;s voice speaking with such a level of complacency while the traditional supporters of the Labour Government are suffering and struggling, not least in rural areas, their sense of disappointment is palpable.</p>

In fact, people are turning to us because they want to believe that there is a positive alternative and my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) is offering one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80624-0012.htm_para7"><a name="080624111000049">Most of all, it is the failure of the Labour party and its representatives to stay connected with its original core support that is the problem.

Where are the Labour voices speaking up on behalf of the people who they were traditionally here to represent?

He has some rhetorical gifts&#151;perhaps that is a professional requirement&#151;but his speech&#146;s power mostly stems from the fact that, like me, he speaks to people who are living the reality of this Government&#146;s policies.

 The argument at the centre of the debate is that we are about to face a period of prolonged inflation above the 3 per cent. target, as the Governor of the Bank of England made clear last week. As a consequence, families will find it increasingly difficult to make ends meet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80624-0012.htm_para11"><a name="080624111000056">However, at the very time when families are under such pressure, the Government, because of their mismanagement of public finances, can do little to lift the burden. That is why people are not turning to the Government for a solution to their problems, but are asking how they can get higher pay increases. The pressure for higher pay would be less if the Government were in a position to help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80624-0012.htm_para12"><a name="080624111000057">Before I elaborate on that, I shall comment on some of the speeches in the debate.

They want to take the credit in the good times and blame someone else in the bad&#151;an approach evident time and again in her speech. She talked about global pressures, but did not mention the deterioration in the exchange rate over the course of the past year, or the impact that that has had on inflation.</p>

There we have it&#151;it is the people&#146;s fault that the Government have their lowest poll ratings in 11 years, and their fault that they cannot understand what the Government are doing.

The reality is that it was the protest against the scrapping of the 10p rate that led to the Government having to increase personal allowances for one year only. However, even that will not compensate the lowest paid for the losses that they have suffered as a result of the abolition of the 10p rate.</p>

In difficult times, families instinctively turn to the Government for help and support but we know that, because this Government failed to prepare for economic uncertainty, they have little to offer. As the OECD pointed out, the Government&#146;s loose fiscal policy during the good times means that they have little room for manoeuvre in the bad times. International league tables show that this country has one of the largest budget deficits among all the industrialised nations. Other Governments&#146; more prudent management of public finances means that they are able to cut taxes on families and businesses, but what have this Government done? They have put up taxes on cars, small businesses and successful entrepreneurs.</p>

 This debate is about an important subject and I have enjoyed listening to the speeches of the hon. Members who have contributed. As we have heard, people across the country are concerned about the cost of living. They feel the effects of rising food and fuel prices across the world. The doubling of world oil prices has led to rising bills at the petrol pumps as well as to increases in gas and electricity bills. At the same time, the price of basic foods has gone up.</p>

Even now, inflation is far lower than in the past. It rose above 20 per cent. in the 1980s and above 10 per cent. in the 1990s. Families are rightly&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80624-0013.htm_para0"><a name="080624111000084">Families will be concerned by the increases at supermarkets and petrol stations and in their energy bills. To address those concerns, we have to tackle the root causes of the higher prices. Those causes are international. We are not alone in saying that; the Governor of the Bank of England also says it. He said that 1.1 per cent. of the 1.2 per cent. increase in inflation since the end of last year has been due to international circumstances. We have to work with our international partners to find the right response and we must respond to the ongoing impact of the global credit squeeze, which is contributing to the challenging economic times that we face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80624-0013.htm_para1"><a name="080624111000085">As I listened to the opening speech from the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), I found it interesting that he did not at any point indicate that the problem was international or that the solution lay at an international level. At no point did he urge us to work through OPEC to raise oil production; neither did he urge us to work with our EU partners to liberate the global food market. I can only presume that when his party was in power, it had an empty-seat policy at EU level; its record gives it no credibility on the international stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80624-0013.htm_para2"><a name="080624111000086">It is important to work with our international partners to address what is an international issue; at the same time, domestically, we must provide families with support when they need it. That is what we are doing, through the increases in personal allowances this year, the additional payments that we are making through the winter fuel allowance and the delay in the fuel duty increase that was due this April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80624-0013.htm_para3"><a name="080624111000087">I turn to some of the specific points raised in the debate. Disparaging remarks have been made about the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths). I enjoyed his excellent and factual contribution. He pointed out that the roofs of the schools, hospitals and railway stations have been fixed under this Government. The investment in public services&#151;extra police, doctors and nurses&#151;has been widely welcomed. In the past 10 years, real pay has gone up by more than 20 per cent. in each of those sectors, and we are rightly proud of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80624-0013.htm_para4"><a name="080624111000088">By contrast, the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) said that we should have made earlier decisions about nuclear power. What&#151;like his party, which deliberately said that it would defer the decision, despite the long lead time required to invest in this low-carbon technology? He also said that we should try to reform the common agricultural policy, but in many ways we have succeeded in doing that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o287"><a name="080624111000089"><a name="80624-0013.htm_spnew0"><a name="080624111000637"><b>Mr. Graham Stuart:</b>

 We have, with the shift from pillar one to pillar two of the common agricultural policy, and we continue to make our case. The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s party would not even engage on the European stage; if it were still in power, we would not have achieved that progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80624-0013.htm_para5"><a name="080624111000091">In an intervention on the right hon. Gentleman, the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) pointed out that the Conservative party&#151;far from anticipating what it now says was the need for a different economic policy  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Jun 2008">

during what the Governor calls the non-inflationary consistent expansion, or NICE, years&#151;went into the last two elections explaining how it would spend more while cutting taxes. It would, apparently, have surfed the wave of economic prosperity&#151;in a way that would have created even more of a problem, given the black hole in its finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80624-0013.htm_para6"><a name="080624111000092">That gets to the core of today&#146;s debate. On the one hand, the Conservative party says that it will match our spending; at the same time, it tries to imply that it will return money to the British people by sharing the proceeds of growth. I do not know where that extra money would come from. I can only presume that the Conservatives are hoping that the black hole in their finances will suddenly spew out pound coins for them to distribute liberally throughout the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80624-0013.htm_para7"><a name="080624111000093">That all relates to what we have seen in this Opposition day debate. The Conservatives are trying to imply, in a salesman-like way, that there is some huge problem with the Government&#146;s record on the cost of living. At the same time, their own words in their own research document show that the standard of living has risen under the Government. Since 2001-02, pensioner couples have been &#163;30 a week better off in real terms under Labour, say the Conservatives; single women pensioners have been &#163;21 a week better off under Labour, say the Conservatives; and couples of whom one partner works full time and one works part time are &#163;14 a week better off under Labour, say the Conservatives. The Conservatives say that lone parents are &#163;12 a week better off and that on average everybody is &#163;9 a week better off because of our policies. I will take no lessons from the Conservative party about the cost of living under Labour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80624-0013.htm_para8"><a name="080624111000094">As always, my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) made a helpful and well informed speech. In response to an intervention from the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart), she pointed out that real wages have risen under the Government. Using Institute for Fiscal Studies data, the hon. Gentleman seemed to try to imply that incomes had fallen. I have read that report, which is extremely credible. However, the authors admit that the specific figure that he cited was within the scope of the margin of error, so it was not appropriate for the hon. Gentleman to use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80624-0013.htm_para9"><a name="080624111000095">Perhaps we should look at the report resulting from the survey of households of below-average incomes. It shows that the incomes of the poorest and richest 20 per cent. of households have risen by 2 per cent. a year since 1997 and that real household disposable incomes across the board have risen by 27 per cent. Let us put it all into context: from the 1980s until the mid-1990s, the real incomes of the poorest 20 per cent. of households rose by less than 1 per cent. a year, while those of the richest 20 per cent. rose by about 2.5 per cent. a year. It is absolutely clear that the tax credit, benefit and welfare to work policies of the Government have arrested the relative increase in income disparities that happened under Conservative Governments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80624-0013.htm_para10"><a name="080624111000096">My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North urged me to continue to focus on the needs of the working poor in our future policies, and we will of course always do that. On fuel poverty, I should point out that we have got the six major energy suppliers to increase their spending on the most vulnerable by &#163;225 million. The Warm Front programme has been  <br>

Driving costs are 16 per cent. lower under this Government than they were under the Conservative Government. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I do not know why hon. Members are muttering among themselves. I can only presume that it is because they do not want to listen to the facts and are attempting, by spin and innuendo, to imply to the country that we have not made the enormous inroads that we have, as everybody knows from looking at their own standards of living compared with 10 years ago.</p>

 Considering the occasion, the purpose of the debate, the nature of the motion that we have tabled and the way in which I am introducing it, that was a wholly inappropriate response. As far as I could tell from listening to it, it was probably inaccurate, but it was difficult to say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80624-0014.htm_para3"><a name="080624123000015">In the 60 years since the establishment of the national health service, it has been under the stewardship of Conservative and Labour Governments&#151;Conservative Governments for 35 years and Labour Governments for 25 years. In that time, the NHS, for all its vicissitudes and the ups and downs that it has suffered, has none the less exhibited continuous gain, from the point of view of the people of this country. It has benefited us individually and collectively and remains part of the glue that holds society together. From the point of social solidarity and a sense of security in this country, it is immensely important to people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80624-0014.htm_para4"><a name="080624123000016">Conservative Members know&#151;as do all hon. Members&#151;how much we rely on the NHS. I suspect that many of us, from all parties, have occasion to visit other countries&#151;I am thinking especially of America&#151;where the experience of people visiting their health services is too often of worrying about whether they can pay for their care, what the circumstances will be if they become chronically ill and whether, if they visit an accident and emergency department, they might first be asked for their insurance policy or visa number. We do not have those experiences in this country. We have a sense of equity and an understanding that, as part of our social solidarity, we are collectively committed, through taxation, to providing a comprehensive health care service, free at the point of delivery and based on people&#146;s need, not their ability to pay. Those principles are unchanging, even though policies may change or be debated. I do not believe that we disagree about the principles.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on the tone with which he has begun the debate, in which hon. Members of all parties will celebrate the foundation of the national health service. There have been huge increases in spending on the NHS, for which the Labour party deserves some credit, but a focus on outcomes rather than false targets will end the distortion of clinical priorities and of the value for money and excellent health care to which the expenditure should lead.</p>

 I am grateful for that intervention and it will not surprise my hon. Friend to know that I feel strongly that the NHS needs to become much more focused on outcomes for patients. That policy does not derive from our thinking alone, but is the product of speaking to literally thousands of people in the national health service. They say that they want to care for the patient and determine their actions on the basis of the patient&#146;s need in a framework where policy is geared to that. Unfortunately, although the Government have been talking about outcomes since my right hon. Friend  <br>

the Member for Witney and I started to make it clear that we would move in that direction, they are not designing health outcomes into the policy of the NHS. The policy, as dictated by the Government through national targets, is still geared towards processes and targets rather than health outcomes for patients. A change of direction is vital.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman started with a brief synopsis of the Conservative party&#146;s position in the 1940s. Will he remind the House of how the Conservative party voted in 1948? Did it vote for or against establishing the national health service? It is a simple question.</p>

<p><a name="st_o298"><a name="080624123000020"><a name="80624-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="080624123000269"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 I have not looked back&#151;[hon. Members: &#147;Oh!&#148;] However, my recollection is that Conservative Members at the time, in opposition, took a view about the specific proposals that the Labour Government presented and objected to aspects of them. Labour Members appear to believe that the British Medical Association&#146;s difficulties at the time were a measure of its opposition to the NHS. It is no more true to say that the Conservative party since 1948 or today opposes the NHS than it is to say that the BMA opposes it. Neither statement is true and it is absurd to claim either.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way because I want to make a helpful intervention. In these straitened economic times, will he reaffirm his personal commitment to increasing NHS spending by &#163;28 billion a year over and above the current Government figure?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman must not believe everything that he reads in the newspapers. I made no such commitment. Our commitments are clear: we are committed to the same increases in NHS spending up to 2010-11 as those in the Government&#146;s spending plan. Beyond 2010-11, my colleagues are committed to further real terms increases in NHS spending.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend aware that, although most people recognise the anniversary, it is not being celebrated everywhere? For example, in Bridlington in my constituency, there is genuine concern that a relatively new hospital, which a Conservative Government built, maintained and sustained is under threat from the Labour Government, with services being cut.</p>

<p><a name="st_o302"><a name="080624123000024"><a name="80624-0014.htm_spnew9"><a name="080624123000273"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 Labour Members should listen to my right hon. Friend because attachment to the NHS is often expressed through support for one&#146;s local health service. It should be no surprise that, as I know from my visit to my right hon. Friend&#146;s constituency, many thousands of local people have signed a petition to maintain services at their local hospital. Instead of carping, Labour Members would be well advised to acknowledge that that is true not only in Bridlington but in many places throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80624-0014.htm_para5"><a name="080624123000025">People are signing petitions not in contravention of medical evidence, but with clinicians&#146; support and on the basis of evidence for the desirability of maintaining care closer to home. Labour Ministers have adopted that policy, which my former right hon. Friend, Virginia Bottomley, began. She started the process of providing care closer to home, and that care is being lost too often under a Labour Government.</p>

 I want to make progress and I do not want to take much time because I want as many Members as possible to have a chance to express their views about the NHS. It is not an occasion for me to make many&#151;or, indeed, any&#151;party political points or to talk about policy in great detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80624-0014.htm_para6"><a name="080624123000028">However, when one considers the current position in the NHS, we should take account of some things from the past. A couple of years ago, I was at Papworth hospital, which was celebrating the 25th anniversary of the first heart transplant. I was surprised to hear Sir Terence English, who carried out that transplant, say that the 1980s was a golden age in the NHS. That is not a phrase that I normally hear applied to the 1980s, so I asked him what he meant by it. He replied that, in those days, if he could convince the board of governors at Papworth hospital that he should innovate through undertaking something groundbreaking, there was nothing to stop him. We need to consider that carefully. The Conservative party is geared towards health outcomes because the structures of targets and micro-management in the NHS have made many NHS staff believe that they are no longer in a position to innovate or have the freedom to deliver high quality care in the way they should.</p>

However, central among those risks are the impacts of public health demands, if we are unable to achieve what he describes as a fully engaged scenario, whereby the public understand the health implications, including obesity and sexually transmitted infections, of behaviour such as alcohol abuse, substance misuse and the like. Unless the public recognise that, it will be very difficult for the NHS to cope with the disease consequences that will arise.</p>

Indeed, we have set out clearly how our public health infrastructure should be geared to that, and how we should have separate public health spending. Right across the country, there is no positive relationship; indeed, the average spend per head in primary care trusts on preventive health care spending is just &#163;20, from an average allocation to PCTs of well over &#163;1,000 per head.

Secretary of State repeated what he said when he took office&#151;that there should be no further major organisational upheavals. I will not dwell on all the things that have happened, but even now the NHS does not know whether it is working to the NHS plan from 2000, to &#147;Keeping the NHS local&#148; from 2004, to &#147;Commissioning a patient-led NHS&#148; from 2005, to &#147;Your health, your care, your say&#148; from 2006 or to whatever is contained in the document to be published next week.</p>

 Local people in Kettering are rightly proud of their district general hospital, which this year celebrates the 111th year since its foundation. Although they are positive about the NHS in respect of the local hospital, they are negative about it in respect of NHS dentistry. Local people have never had such limited access to an NHS dentist as they do now.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes an important point. If my memory serves, over the past year we have seen a reduction of about 1 million in the number of people accessing NHS dentistry. We must recognise that the experience of dentistry that many people throughout the country have is genuinely one of a two-tier system. There are people in some areas who can access NHS dentistry or receive it free, because there are still contracts and dentists available, yet in other places it is simply not available or people pay so much that, frankly, they might as well be in the private sector, because of the costs that they have to meet.</p>

This is a debate not just to say thank you, although that is an important part of it, but to listen to the staff of the NHS. Last week, the Government published the annual survey of NHS staff, &#147;What Matters to Staff in the NHS&#148;. There was much in it about NHS staff feeling positive about their hospitals or surgeries, and they were very supportive of what the NHS stands for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80624-0014.htm_para13"><a name="080624123000039">However, staff were asked, by Ipsos MORI on behalf of the Government, whether they would praise the NHS as it currently stands. Unhappily, those figures were not as good. Forty-three per cent. of staff overall said that they would speak critically of the NHS as it now stands and only 27 per cent. said that they would speak highly of the NHS as it now stands. That is very depressing. Any organisation&#151;public, private or whatever&#151;in which more staff would, unprompted, speak critically of that organisation as it stands today than would spontaneously speak highly of it has serious problems with staff morale and motivation, which needs to be changed.</p>

 Yes, I did not have the opportunity, I am afraid, to listen to my hon. Friend on &#147;Newsnight&#148;, but I understand that he made it clear subsequently that he had not been correctly quoted. I thought that the Secretary of State was rising to respond&#151;I hoped positively&#151;to the fact that 43 per cent. of NHS staff, including 54 per cent. of medical and dental staff and 49 per cent. of junior managers, said that they would speak critically of the NHS as it is now.

We know that the public support us, but at the same time they know that we are not allowed to achieve what we should achieve, and that although we&#146;ve seen a doubling of resources in the NHS in the last 10 years, this hasn&#146;t reached the front line and it isn&#146;t delivering the patient gain that it should. From our point of view, not only do we need organisational stability, empowerment of professionals and freedom to deliver for patients, but we are prepared to be held to account for the outcomes that we achieve and held to account by patients for the services that we provide.&#148; Patients should be able to access choice and control over their health care and, to an extent, those with long-term conditions should even, where possible, be able to manage personalised budgets.</p>

 Let me explain two things to the hon. Lady. First, many clinicians to whom I have spoken over many years, as well as their representative organisations, have made it clear that the impact of a waiting time target is less about delivering reductions in waiting times than it is about distorting clinical practice and the clinical judgments that have to be made. Waiting time targets can thereby have a damaging overall impact on health outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80624-0014.htm_para15"><a name="080624123000048">Clinicians want to focus on outcomes and be held to account for some of the performance measures that go into delivering high-quality care for patients. There is no doubt that clinicians know that their local hospital should be responsible for publishing referral-to-treatment times and that patients and commissioners should hold them to account for that. That is performance management; it is part of the contract and nobody is proposing that we get rid of it. However, the hon. Lady must recognise the truth about imposing a national, one-size-fits-all, 18-week referral-to-treatment target. Almost every clinician to whom I have spoken says, &#147;This is nonsense. There is no clinical evidence for this and it distorts.&#148; Indeed, we can see that happening already, with hospitals having to pay well over the tariff to access private sector providers and deliver the target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80624-0014.htm_para16"><a name="080624123000049">Another thing that I would like to say to the hon. Lady is that the staff at her local hospital, Chase Farm, are saying, &#147;Don&#146;t take away our maternity services and our A and E services&#148;. The people of Enfield care about services at Chase Farm, and I wish that she had got up to tell the House about that, instead of making a party political point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80624-0014.htm_para18"><a name="080624123000055">International benchmarking is absolutely critical. Let us look at a simple example. The Government rightly say that, over the past decade, we have seen reductions in premature mortality from cardiovascular disease and stroke. However, they never go on to say that that has been true not for 10 years but for 20 years. They never go on to say that, when we compare our data with those of other countries, we see that we have not narrowed the gap. They do not go on to say that studies suggest that we have the worst outcomes for stroke among the European countries. They do not go on to say that there are routine procedures in other countries for stroke services and heart care services&#151;for people having a heart attack&#151;under which people are treated as an emergency when they have a stroke or when they are taken for primary angioplasty when they have a heart attack.

 Is not the situation actually worse than my hon. Friend describes? Some years ago, there were two gaps. We spent less per head on health care than our European comparator countries, and we had worse health outcomes. Now, our spending is broadly in line with our European comparator countries, but we have not eliminated the gap on health outcomes. That is the core challenge, and the Government have failed to deliver on it.</p>

 I am afraid that it is, and this takes us back to one of the central issues that most depresses people who work in the national health service, and those whom they look after. They want to see those resources, and they want to use them productively. Unfortunately, however, the nature of the system means that when spending was rising fastest, productivity in the NHS was falling by 2.5 per cent. a year, according to the Office for National Statistics. In those circumstances, they cannot deliver the quality of health care that they should.</p>

The Commonwealth Fund, from New York, which Ministers like to quote, states that the UK health care system is the worst for waiting times, for mortality rates, for hospital-acquired infections, for preventive care such as breast cancer screening, for caring for those with long-term conditions and for GP access out of hours. So, precisely&#151;[<i> Interruption.</i>] Hon. Members laugh, but this is not a matter for amusement. The Commonwealth Fund is quoted by Ministers, and I have just quoted it as well. They should recognise this. We should look at outcomes, at the overall benefit for patients and at international comparisons. The Government&#151;and any future Government&#151;must focus on overall outcomes for patients and not on trying to micro-manage the way in which they are achieved.

In my own constituency, the Addenbrooke&#146;s and Papworth hospitals are excellent examples of innovation and high quality care, and we attach enormous importance to them. But the NHS knows, and we know, that the route for the future is not just about things as they are. It is about achieving a stable organisational framework for the NHS that will allow real dynamism for reform and change. Under the twin levers of patient choice and a competitive environment among health care providers, information based on health outcomes, rather than on micro-management, will deliver the framework within which those levers can work most effectively.</p>

When I go to America or, as I did recently, to the Netherlands, I see that people are seeking to achieve a structure that will provide universal coverage, or a maximum risk pool, as they put it. They want to achieve the combination of equity and efficiency that everyone is looking for in health care. The scale of spending on health care in many of those countries is similar to our own or even higher. In America, for example, the scale of public spending on health care as a proportion of gross domestic product is almost exactly the same as it is in this country, but there is an additional 7 per cent. of gross domestic product on top of that in private contributions. That is not a situation that anyone could contemplate. The inefficiencies involved are not to be contemplated.</p>

Unfortunately, over recent years in particular, it has become bureaucratic and monolithic. It does not exhibit the characteristics towards which all those other health care systems are moving in regard to exposure to efficiency. That exposure to efficiency, through choice and competition, is essential for the future, and I believe that NHS staff are happy to contemplate that. They are prepared for it, as long as the competition is fair and they are judged on genuine outcomes, and as long as they are given the opportunity to do the best for patients in a framework that continues to be supportive and true to the principles of the national health service.</p>

She said to me that it was the greatest decision ever taken by any Government in the last century, because it took away the fear that she had in the 1930s of having to make a decision on health on the basis of whether she had &#163;2 to call a doctor, rather than whether she needed help.

As the chief medical officer tells us, when he was working in the north-east an 81-year-old man wrote to him to ask whether he could bequeath his place on the waiting list for a cataract operation to his nephew, who was 60 and developing eye problems.

 The public will be bemused by all this discussion about outcomes. They want to get through A and E in a reasonable time. They want not to wait years for an operation. Samia al Qadhi, chief executive of Breast Cancer Care, said this morning that targets had their uses. She certainly thinks that it is important that there are targets for the timing of cancer care in particular, not only because of the emotional distress of waiting for a diagnosis or for information, which should certainly not be underestimated as it is considerable, but because there is plenty of evidence that early diagnosis saves lives with breast cancer and other cancers. So there was no support there for this weird argument that we concentrate just on outcomes and there is no place for targets at all.</p>

 I have referred to this before, but it is a key point about cervical cancer screening. We know we have a problem, which has developed more recently, with young women in their 20s and 30s falling away and not attending screening. There have been some wonderful initiatives, including one at Salford PCT, which has studied the process, worked with GPs and improved our uptake of screening in Salford by 7 per cent. It is true that we have to focus on process and on targets to achieve those different outcomes.</p>

 I saw what is happening in Salford when I was there a couple of weeks ago.

Those are very important local initiatives. We reject totally the Opposition proposal that we should abandon targets.

In 1999 we relinquished power to determine which new drugs and technologies the NHS should adopt, and put it in the hands of a new independent body, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. In the same year, we established the Healthcare Commission and the other commissions, making them responsible for setting standards, and inspecting and reporting on every hospital, mental health and social care provider in England&#151;completely beyond the influence of politicians. Four years ago, we established NHS foundation trusts&#151;independent of Whitehall, accountable to their members and making their own decisions on how best to serve their patients.</p>

On Monday, we will publish our next stage review. From the NHS plan in 2000 right up to now, there has been consistency: first the resources; then the mechanisms for reform; and now a fundamental concentration on improving quality. A national, enabling framework will be driven by the local priorities set out by thousands of clinicians, patients and members of the public; they drove the process that set the direction of the health service in every region of the country. It was developed locally because local clinicians, patients and managers are best acquainted with the specifics of improving patient care, and are best equipped with the knowledge and ideas necessary to shape the future of the service.</p>

The burden of modern and future health care systems will be to support an ageing population, to help those with long-term conditions to manage their care better, to promote health and well-being so that we can ward off disease, and to keep up with the astonishing advances in medicine and technology. Only through universal health care, free at the point of need, can we make sure that all citizens benefit from those advances. Whereas our national health service makes screening and vaccination programmes available to all, an insurance-based system could use what we discover about disease to increase premiums. Under such a system, the scientific knowledge that could liberate a patient from the threat of disease and early death would instead remove their right to treatment.</p>

Only because of the attention and care that the Labour party has shown the NHS&#151;running beyond a mere expression of support, welcome though that is&#151;can we address the challenge of today&#146;s health requirements. Massive increases in investment put us in touching distance of European spending levels. There have been huge gains in staff numbers&#151;80,000 more nurses and 38,000 more doctors.

At the end of the Conservative years in government, whether we look at cancer, heart disease or stroke care, the outcomes&#151;the issue on which the Conservative spokesman focused&#151;for people in this country were poor compared with those in other European Union countries.</p>

Health inequalities in this country continue to be completely unacceptable, and indicators suggest that they are getting worse, not better. I fully recognise that the causes of those inequalities are often well beyond the remit of the national health service, but the NHS has a role to play. Part of that role is to ensure equal access to health care, which we simply do not have at the moment, and that should be addressed. In some areas of health care, particularly those which are not subject to targets, access is still poor. I want to focus on mental health.</p>

people have to wait more than two years; in many areas, the wait is more than one year. Given the view of clinicians that outcomes improve significantly as a result of early access to such treatment, it remains a scandal that people are having to wait so long for something that could make a real difference to them. One of the themes on which I want my party to continue to focus is the inequality between the treatment of patients suffering from mental health problems and the treatment of those suffering from physical health problems. That disparity cannot be justified, and must be remedied.</p>

We see funding that always has strings attached, because the Government know best how the money should be spent. We see micro-management from Whitehall: the Government tell every hospital in the country to undertake a deep clean, at vast expense. The clinicians tell us that that is not the best way to tackle hospital-acquired infections; but the Government know best.

 The crux of the problem is that, as my hon. Friend says, we do not have an IT system. It was a system designed in Whitehall, a political imperative. No cost-benefit analysis was undertaken. There was no proper review to ensure that people who were building the system, the people who were paying for it and the people who were using it understood the same thing. Nothing like that happened; all that was undertaken was a massive commitment to spend over very many years. What do we see now? We see the whole scheme running years behind schedule, according to the National Audit Office, and we see the total cost massively above budget.</p>

It is not sensible to tell every primary care trust that it must have a GP-led health centre and that contracts must be concluded before the end of this year. Again, that is dictating to the health service because of political priorities and political imperatives rather than sound clinical judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para5"><a name="080624123000156">How can we meet the challenges of the future better than the top-down, command-and-control approach that has proved so wasteful over the past 10 years? We face enormous cost pressures in a modern health service. New technologies are emerging, and new drugs are constantly being developed. There is a continuing debate about top-ups and about how on earth we are to fund new drugs which, in many cases, can provide good clinical benefits but may not meet the NICE criteria for public funding. We face all the challenges posed by lifestyle conditions such as obesity, alcohol consumption and smoking; and, critically, we have a massively ageing population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para6"><a name="080624123000157">I recently met a specialist in mental illness in the elderly in Liverpool. He showed me a graph showing the number of centenarians in our society over the next 50 years. It was frightening to observe the growth in the number of people who will reach the age of 100. At the same time, the ratio of people of working age to older people will change dramatically, so we are losing the work force that will provide the care for older people. Therefore, we face massive challenges. As well as all the extra cost pressures, we have to recognise that patients now expect something different. Nowadays, in all aspects of life, people behave as consumers&#151;they want to make their own decisions and to have control over their lives. That is the case in health care as well, and the NHS must adapt to that. On top of all these matters, tackling the gross health inequalities that continue to afflict our country must be a priority in the years ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para7"><a name="080624123000158">What is the Conservatives&#146; solution? First, let me say that they are right to focus on outcomes. There can only be any point in all of this vast amount of public spending if we manage to make people stay healthier and live healthy, longer lives; that is the aim. However, that focus is only a partial solution, as willing the end does not always achieve delivery. We must always ask how we are going to achieve the improved outcomes that today&#146;s Conservative paper rightly points to the value of trying to achieve. Its approach is to scrap all national targets&#151;to have no access incentives at all, as far as I can see. Under its plans, there will be no entitlements for individual patients across the country, wherever they live, to ensure that they get access to the health care they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para8"><a name="080624123000159">It is worth remembering the origins of targets. They emerged when the new Government came to power in 1997 because of the dreadful and unacceptable waste under the previous Conservative Government. The political debate in 1997 focused particularly on the fact that people were waiting so long for treatment. I remember when I was first elected to Parliament in 2001 taking up cases on behalf of constituents who were waiting three or four years for orthopaedic operations&#151;for hip and knee-joint operations. It is worth remembering what it was like; it was dreadful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para9"><a name="080624123000160">Therefore, I believe that access is an important issue in its own right. While waiting for treatment, people often suffer from anxiety and trauma. If they are waiting for a hip or knee-joint operation, when it finally takes place the outcome might demonstrate that the operation has been performed well, but if they have waited two years to have the operation, they will probably have waited in severe pain and will also probably have had a carer who had to cope with them in that condition during that period.</p>

That is not to say that the NHS board will not be responsible for issuing commissioning guidelines. It will be responsible for the contracting process between commissioners and providers. For services such as accident and emergency, there will be contractual conditions for the necessary quality.

I also think it will run the real risk of worsening health inequalities. Our approach focuses on entitlements for patients and recognises entitlements to access treatment. It recognises that many people, who might not be articulate and understand how to play the system, will need help in exercising their choice and in making the right informed judgment. That is why we think that a network of patient advocates can help people in making the right decisions about their own health care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para11"><a name="080624123000164">Let me now turn to what I think the priorities should be for the future of the health service, and to what the Liberal Democrats&#146; approach would be. Let me deal with the question of pruning back the role of the central state. I have made the case against the Government&#146;s approach, which stands alone, if one makes international comparisons, in the extent to which it seeks to control the delivery of health care from Government offices in the centre. It seems to me that the Government should focus on key functions such as, first, the fair distribution of resources around the country, so as to ensure&#151;without political interference, incidentally&#151;that the resources get to where the need is greatest. Secondly, it is right nationally to focus on high professional standards within the NHS. Yes, the Conservatives are right to focus on setting a framework for the delivery of improved outcomes, but it is also right to focus on the right to access to health care wherever people live in the country, and irrespective of their means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para12"><a name="080624123000165">So yes, our approach is to recognise that access is important and to introduce the idea of an entitlement to access treatment within a defined period. The system in Denmark works well there. The idea is that people get access to condition-specific treatment within a defined period, and if they do not receive the treatment, it is paid for by the locally elected health board, if necessary  <br>

in the private sector. Interestingly, it has not led in Denmark to a haemorrhaging of patients to the private sector; rather, it has been the biggest single driver of improved efficiencies within the state hospital system. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It is absolutely not the patient passport, and the hon. Member is either being disingenuous or not understanding. The patient passport was a subsidy for people who could afford to top up the rest of their care for private treatment in the private sector. This system pays for a person&#146;s operation in its entirety. Crucially, in mental health, the person who has no resources to go to the private sector to circumvent the one-year wait for cognitive behavioural therapy would also be entitled to their treatment within that defined period, and if they did not get it, it would be paid for privately. That is giving real power to individuals, irrespective of their needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para13"><a name="080624123000166">We also believe that we should be empowering local communities, democratising primary care trusts and imposing on all PCTs&#151;locally elected health boards, as we would call them&#151;a duty to ensure the efficient use of resources. The health think-tank Reform has talked about an economic constitution for the NHS. That is the right approach, ensuring that money is used most effectively. Compare that approach&#151;empowering communities&#151;with that of the Conservatives. At the moment, one person is democratically elected within the health service: the Secretary of State. The Conservatives would lose that one person and have an independent board that was not democratically accountable in any shape or form. Just imagine: when a local community faced the loss of their hospital, they would have no right to decide locally whether that hospital would close. Decisions would be made by unaccountable, unelected bodies nationally. At that stage, in my view, the wheels would come off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para14"><a name="080624123000167">The Secretary of State recognises that there is a democratic deficit within the health service but he appears unwilling to do anything about it. The Minister may well want to address that issue when he winds up the debate. We recognise that there must be democratic accountability within the health service. The Government recognise that there is a problem; what are they prepared to do about it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para15"><a name="080624123000168">Thirdly, we want to empower patients far more than they are at the moment. No longer can we accept the idea of care delivered from on high to grateful, passive recipients. People want to take charge of their care and they need, as the Conservative spokesman said, access to information so that they can make the right choices; but as I have said, they also need access to support in guiding them in making the right decision. We also support the idea of individual budgets being piloted in the NHS and of seeking to give people more control in coping with long-term chronic conditions and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para16"><a name="080624123000169">Our fourth principle is fairness, equity and addressing those health inequalities that scar our society. One of the issues that must be addressed is the fact that there is less access to primary care in poorer areas than in wealthier suburbs. The mechanism that the Government use is the central imposition of GP-led health centres, and they are also promising to bring more GP practices to impoverished areas, but surely the financial incentives to undertake primary care must also be addressed. At the moment, a GP receives more money if they practise in a wealthier area than they do if they practise in a  <br>

poorer area. There should be financial incentives to encourage GPs to practise in those more challenging areas. We are developing the idea of a patient premium, whereby extra funding is attached to patients from deprived backgrounds to encourage GPs to provide support for those communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para17"><a name="080624123000170">As the NHS reaches its 60th birthday, it is time for an injection of Liberal thinking, as there was at its very beginning. The NHS can adapt, evolve and prosper. I am passionate about giving power to those people who have no power in our system. That is as important a principle in health care as it is in any other walk of life. Communities, not Government, should be in the driving seat in shaping the delivery of local health services; patients should take control. Fast, efficient, high quality care should be guaranteed to patients, putting individuals before institutions. That is how we should build on the past successes of the NHS as we look ahead to the next 60 years.</p>

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health on setting out his case. I recognised more of a celebration of the national health service, which is supposed to be the theme of this debate, from the tone of his remarks than from those of the hon.

In the 1940s, not only did the Opposition vote against the principle of the national health service, but the Conservative Government, led by Winston Churchill, who took over from the splendid Attlee Government of the 1940s and 1950, were still so dischuffed with the NHS that they set up the Guillebaud committee in the early 1950s. The specific remit of that committee was to review NHS spending and the then Conservative Government hoped it would say that the NHS, as a publicly funded institution free at the point of use, was too expensive. In fact, the Tory Guillebaud committee said that the NHS was very good value for money, and so the Tories, at that stage, were stuck with the NHS. I submit that they have never properly digested that lesson.</p>

 As the hon.

 My point was that the Conservatives may have set up a committee to get outsiders&#146; views on the way forward, but they then continued to increase the funding for the health service each year. The previous Labour Government may have set up the health service, but they brought in financial cuts that led to three Cabinet Ministers resigning.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes his point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para20"><a name="080624123000180">I now want to come up to date. I have some sympathy with the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)&#151;[<i> Interruption.</i>] Yes, I do. We both entered Parliament in 1997 and I have watched his career with interest. I hope that that is not too much of a bar to his future progress, if any. I have always thought that his personal position is sympathetic towards the NHS. His problem&#151;and his party must address it&#151;is that the instincts of his party and his leader do not align with his. The hon. Gentleman is forced to be a cheap and shallow salesman for the NHS. On closer examination, Conservative policy is smoke and mirrors. As we get closer to the election, in 18 or 24 months, we will want to return to that argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para21"><a name="080624123000181">The hon. Gentleman is also a roadblock to reform. He and his party will not support the necessary reforms to take the NHS into the 21st century, and I shall give a couple of examples of that. The Conservative leader has promised to scrap extended hours for GP surgeries. That is not taking GP practices into the 21st century: it is going backwards. The hon. Gentleman well knows that most people&#146;s experience of the NHS is through general practice and primary care. If his party scraps extended hours as it has promised to do, it will reduce people&#146;s access to primary care. That is the charge that he must answer, and on which the House must decide today by voting for either the motion or the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80624-0017.htm_para22"><a name="080624123000182">A further roadblock to reform is that the Conservatives would scrap the guaranteed two-week treatment wait for those with suspected cancer. They would scrap the guarantee that all patients should be seen within 18 weeks, from their first visit to the GP to their operation. The Conservatives do not seem to like that target or that guarantee. Why not? When they come to power, if they ever do, they do not want to be put on the spot and to be expected to deliver an NHS run on such guidelines.</p>

 I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, because he is making such a helpful speech from our point of view, but I must tell him that the 18-week target does not apply to cancer. Different targets apply specifically to waiting times for cancer. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would care to visit Clatterbridge and discuss the matter with patients there? They will tell him that a target geared towards the time to first treatment that fails to take account of the time lapse before subsequent treatment or to consider the holistic outcomes is not a target that works in the best interests of patients.</p>

Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has made empty promises on hospital closures, but the Liberal Democrat spokesperson, the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), has already identified the problem: closures will be made without any political accountability, unlike at the moment. The Conservatives say that in effect there will be no local closures, but how on earth will the system be regulated when the service must modernise and new facilities, operation procedures and the like must be implemented&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>The hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80624-0018.htm_para1"><a name="080624123000186">The Conservatives would also put NHS finances at risk and, as I have said, finance has been a contention between the parties down the years. The right hon. Member for Witney is on record as saying that his party would allow hospitals to borrow against building and equipment, but that would put the financial stability of local hospitals at risk. Who would bail them out if they went wrong? Would they be allowed to close under the independent board? The Conservative party must explain to my constituents why such financial instability would exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80624-0018.htm_para2"><a name="080624123000187">I suspect that the reason that the Leader of the Opposition is considering the idea of local hospitals&#146; borrowing against their capital is that an element of central funding would be cut, so local hospitals would be required to consider raising their budgets. That policy would reduce central responsibility and create local responsibility, but run the risk of creating a postcode lottery and financial insecurity for local hospitals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80624-0018.htm_para3"><a name="080624123000188">The final element of the roadblock to reform is that the Conservatives are against GP-led health centres. Again, if there was a 21st century, forward-looking Conservative programme, I cannot see why they would be against them. In my constituency, for example, there will be a GP-led health centre. It will not destabilise local GPs. That entirely new facility will be open from 8 am to 8 pm and will bring new doctors into the Wirral. My working constituents&#146; busy lives will be enhanced, as they will be able to choose between dropping in at the new centre when that is appropriate or convenient or going to see their own GP. That is a significant reform and improvement of the service in my constituency.</p>

A few months ago, I visited the Wirral university teaching hospital NHS foundation trust. That is my local hospital, and I was shown an example of innovation&#151;a new machine in the urology department that enables the consultant to look at prostate trouble using a laser, thus eradicating the need for invasive surgery or investigation. The procedure takes only about two hours, as opposed to the overnight stay that used to be required.</p>

The urology consultant had read about it on the internet and then had a word with the hospital&#146;s chief executive and board of governors, who decided to buy it. That is a perfect example of how local innovation can make a new service available, and I simply do not understand how a system of targets designed to raise national standards and provide equity across the country can be said to be inimical to local innovation. Targets and local innovation can&#151;and do&#151;work side by side across the country.</p>

That trust has taken the courageous decision to spend &#163;15 million to &#163;30 million over the next five years on a linear accelerator across the water in Liverpool; that is a huge investment for a relatively small trust. It is doing that to save patients the trouble of having to come across the Mersey for treatment. That decision was taken at a local level&#151;not through some strategic health authority or diktat from Whitehall. It will immeasurably improve patients&#146; experiences.

 I was interested to note that the hon. Gentleman holds an important leadership position across the Wirral in respect of all the hospitals. No doubt he has had the same conversations as I have had with the people at Clatterbridge, who also serve my constituents. One of their biggest problems relates to tertiary referral. Owing to the Government&#146;s target regime, oncology centres are penalised because so many of the targets for which they are forced to try to qualify are so far outside their control, at the tertiary end of the process, that they find themselves struggling with financial penalties that they could do without.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has a point in that that was a problem historically. It is a perfectly serious point. When some of the targets were first introduced, they were clearly not designed for oncology trusts of that kind. They were designed more to relate to a district general hospital. There was some tension around that. I have investigated the matter on the centres&#146; behalf to some extent, and my understanding is that that tension is now more historic and that accommodation has been made for such trusts in respect of those targets.</p>

Under the old system, it was a three-star hospital. It became a foundation hospital and is going from strength to strength, I am delighted to say. I do not recognise the stifling of innovation at a local level that has been mentioned. The institution that I have mentioned used to be the second largest non-teaching hospital in the country. It is now a teaching hospital because it was able to innovate with local universities to provide a &#163;7 million education centre on the hospital campus.

Of course I am proud of my constituency and proud of the Wirral, but I do not believe that that is the case&#151;they are exemplars of what is going on around the country. It would be a huge coincidence if I just happened to be the lead MP for health in the Wirral and we had uniquely good health services. I would like to think that, but it is not so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80624-0018.htm_para14"><a name="080624123000207">I pay tribute to the staff in my local health service, which is the second largest employer in the Wirral. Some of the local practices have been innovative in working with part-time workers, ensuring that public transport is available, and advancing green issues by making imaginative use of the local Sainsbury&#146;s car park. Such arrangements have enabled staff and patients to use the hospital in different, innovative ways.</p>

 I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) on tabling the motion and on the tone in which he introduced it. The key point that he wanted to draw out&#151;I wholeheartedly agree with him&#151;is that the political fact in 2008, as opposed to 1946, is that the national health service is built on a political consensus that includes every single Member of this House from every party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80624-0018.htm_para16"><a name="080624123000210">A key element of the background to my hon. Friend&#146;s initiative in introducing the debate is that it is a relatively unusual experience over the 60 years of the NHS for a Conservative spokesman to be able to point to opinion polls saying that the Conservative party is the most trusted party on health policy issues. I congratulate him on achieving that as our health spokesman; I certainly never achieved it when I held that post some years ago. The important point is not to luxuriate in the fact that we are more trusted than the Government on health care, but to draw a political conclusion about the fact that Labour spokesmen go round the country saying that because the Conservative party voted against the national health service in 1946, it is somehow not committed to the principles of the health service&#151;despite the fact that we have been responsible for it over 35 of its 60 years of history and have never taken action that undermined the principles of the health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80624-0018.htm_para17"><a name="080624123000211">I say to my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire that the more often he can create opportunities for that argument to be developed, the more it suits our purpose, because it demonstrates that the arguments used by our political opponents cut no ice with the voters. The voters regard us as the more trusted party because they accept that there is no point of difference on the matter in the House of Commons. There is an all-party consensus on the principles of the national health service, and the true debate in politics is not who is committed to it and who is not, but who can deliver. On the 60th anniversary of the NHS, we should focus on that argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80624-0018.htm_para18"><a name="080624123000212">The charge against the Government is the one I mentioned during a brief intervention on my hon. Friend. The Government have hugely increased the budget of the national health service over the past 11 years. I applaud them for that&#151;it is the right thing to have done&#151;but they have not brought about the improvements in the delivery of health outcomes and health care that we should have expected for that scale of resource increase. One or two of our more partisan supporters say that all that money has been spent, but that there has been no improvement. That is not true. Of course there has been an improvement in the delivery of health care in Britain over the past 11 years, just as there was during the previous 49 years. A year-by-year improvement in the delivery of health care is the consistent story of the NHS since 1948.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80624-0018.htm_para19"><a name="080624123000213">If we are to be reflective on the 60th anniversary of the health service, what should disappoint us is that over the past 11 years there has been a huge increase in resources, but no improvement of performance commensurate with that increase. The question is, why is that true? Ironically, some analysis of the reasons for that failure is implicitly shared by those on the Opposition Front Bench and those on the Government Front Bench. If we look at what happened to health policy during the  <br>

past 11 years, we see that the truth is that, in some important respects, it has gone round in a huge circle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80624-0018.htm_para20"><a name="080624123000214">The neatest way of encapsulating that is to refer to a speech I heard made in the summer of 2006 by Paul Corrigan, the health adviser to the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair. He explained that as a result of the insights of Mr. Blair, a new idea had been introduced into the health service&#151;commissioning. By empowering commissioners, we would introduce conditionality about the use of resources, and we would ensure better value in terms of efficiencies and health outcomes for the money provided by the taxpayer. I am afraid that when I heard that speech, I could not resist observing that its sentiments were precisely the same as those in the comments made by Professor Sir Donald Acheson, who was the chief medical officer when I first became a Health Minister in 1990 and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) was Secretary of State for Health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80624-0018.htm_para21"><a name="080624123000215">The truth is that we introduced what we called purchasing and it has now been relabelled commissioning. We introduced trusts; the hon. Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) referred to the importance of local decision making and trusts and I entirely agree. We introduced what we called GP fundholding, and the Government introduced practice-based commissioning. A gigantic circle has been drawn and the health service&#146;s institutional framework today bears a sharp resemblance to the one that we left in 1997. The regret is that it has taken so much money and such a long time&#151;wasted time and money&#151;to get back to the point that we had reached in 1997, not in resources, for which I give the Government credit, but in their use and the management of health service institutions.</p>

 I shall now inveigh against a slight conspiracy between Conservative and Labour Front Benchers. It suits both sides to say that the Government invented national targets for waiting times in 1997. That is untrue&#151;they were invented by Virginia Bottomley before I became Secretary of State. Waiting times were reducing well before I became Secretary of State. They continued to decrease during my time in post and reduced further after 1997 as a result of national waiting time targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80624-0018.htm_para22"><a name="080624123000220">The point that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire makes about national targets, with which I wholeheartedly agree, is that they were introduced in the early 1990s to tackle precisely the problem to which the Under-Secretary referred. They were effective before 1997 and became more effective afterwards, but the commitment to national targets has now become obsessive, distorting the use of resources.</p>

I believe that the Government have got that wrong, and it is vital to tackle that as we look forward, beyond the 60th anniversary of the NHS.</p>

I used to say laughingly to my colleagues in the Division Lobby that I was the last manifestation on earth of Marxist-Leninist ideas. We were both saying the same thing in different ways: the culture of the NHS attributes too much authority and power to the centre and inadequate authority and influence to the local view. The result of that is the current debate on polyclinics. In some circumstances, they are a good idea. What is wrong is that Department insists that, because it is a good idea, everybody do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80624-0018.htm_para26"><a name="080624123000228">Of course there needs to be a national view in the national health service.

 I join the Secretary of State in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) on calling this debate. I am delighted and privileged to be taking part in a debate celebrating 60 years of the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para0"><a name="080624123000232">I have heard many history lessons this evening. I was not even born in 1946, when the legislation went through the House, or in 1948, when the health service was established. However, I know from experience, throughout my life as a user of the health service, that in principle it is second to none. The national health service is what this country wants, and it is what I passionately believe in. It is ludicrous&#151;indeed, I find it quite baffling&#151;to try to make complaints about an era in which we were not alive. If one worked on that argument, one could say that the Labour party still wanted to take us out of Europe, that it supported CND or that it did not believe in war, as George Lansbury, its pacifist leader in the 1930s, proclaimed. However, that is nonsense, because life has moved on, and so have circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para1"><a name="080624123000233">As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) and other hon. Members said, it is right that we should all be united on the basic premises and principles of the national health service, even though we may argue and have differences of opinion about how it should be organised and how it should evolve to continue providing a first-class health service for the people of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para2"><a name="080624123000234">Why is the NHS so important? Why is this national institution so popular with the vast majority of people in this country, who are more than happy, as I am, to pay their tax pounds to have free health care at the point of use for all who are entitled to use it? One of the reasons is this. In the 1930s, Franklin Roosevelt talked of the four freedoms: freedom from fear, freedom from want, freedom of speech and freedom of worship. I believe that there is a fifth freedom. Some hon. Members have talked about the American experience. If we exclude those people who qualify for Medicaid and Medicare, because of their financial poverty or their age, there are more than 40 million people in the United States&#151;working families&#151;who cannot afford health insurance. They do not have the freedom from fear of the next health bill landing on the mat, which might financially destroy their family. They do not have the freedom from fear that illness might come into the family, either to a child or to a parent, which might financially cripple them. Since 1948, because of our national health service, everyone in this country has had the freedom from those fears.</p>

Let those people who say that Conservatives are not committed to the health service look back over the past 60 years. They will see that Conservative Governments were in office for 35 of those 60 years, and nothing was done under those Governments to undermine the principles of the national health service or to seek to destroy it&#151;[<i> Interruption.</i>] I resent people taking cheap opportunities to try to score party political points when there is no basis in fact for that argument.</p>

 I will not give way, because there is not much time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para4"><a name="080624123000238">We have differed in our approaches over the way in which we believe the health service should operate. There has been too much of a propensity&#151;certainly under this Government, but also under Conservative Governments in the past&#151;for politicians to interfere when they come into office, and to feel that they have to prove their stamina and machismo by making changes, sometimes, it seems, just for the sake of it. The national health service has had too many changes and reorganisations under successive Governments. It is suffering from a surfeit of change and from fatigue. It needs to be able to settle in with what it has, and to get on with the job that it is meant to be doing&#151;providing first class health care for all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para5"><a name="080624123000239">That is the challenge to politicians of all political parties. The reorganisations and changes have inevitably led to money being wasted and, certainly over the past 11 years, in certain areas, to almost going full circle and coming back to square one, with upheaval and waste of resources in between. That, too, has to stop. We need a health system in which the medical practitioners, who are the best qualified to make the judgments, make those judgments for the furtherance of patient care, rather than one in which politicians dictate from Whitehall what they believe should be happening. To give the health service that freedom, within its existing principles, would be a tremendous step forward that would benefit patient care and the working of the health service, as well as saving money from waste that could then be reinvested in patient care, which is the most important thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para6"><a name="080624123000240">We can all find problems in the health service in our constituencies, but this debate is not an appropriate time to express those criticisms. There are other opportunities to make those speeches in the House. Today, we are celebrating the health service. We must celebrate the tremendous people who work day and night to look after patients and to provide patient care: the nurses, the doctors, the consultants and the often-forgotten ancillary workers who are so crucial to the delivery of health care and the working of our hospitals. They are the unsung heroes of the national health service; they are the people at the front line of patient care and health care, who do so much that is too often unrecognised&#151;not through ingratitude, but because they do their job so well that they become seamless in the whole provision of health care. To them, we owe our thanks and a debt of gratitude for all they do; we should not forget that.</p>

As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood said, it is no secret that this Government have substantially and significantly increased health spending over the last eight years. I, of course, welcome that. I have to say, however, that they have been in an extremely fortunate position because the strength of the economy over the last 15 years has enabled them to generate the revenue to invest in health care. That is a benefit for all of us. The sadness has been that not enough of it has gone to front-line services. That is why it is crucial that we have mechanisms in an ever-evolving health care system to ensure that we get the maximum amount of money that the state makes available to the health service to front-line services in order to continue to improve and advance the treatment of our patients.</p>

Government Members may not like it, but we do believe in it. There is no monopoly of caring and belief in the health service on the Government side: we all share an affection, a loyalty and a devotion to the health service. What we all want to do is ensure that it works at its finest, providing the greatest health care. We may have differences, which we can argue about until the cows come home, but no one should question the motives or the honourable intentions of Conservative Members just because it suits the political agenda of Government Members at election time.</p>

 With some exceptions, I have been desperately disappointed with this debate, which instead of being a celebration of 60 years of the health service, has descended into party political bickering. I was hoping, as there was no time limit, to devote a little time to reminiscing. I have been in the health service more than 50 years&#151;much longer than most other people here&#151;so I can remember the days when we had precisely three antibiotics: streptomycin, penicillin and tetracycline. We did not have MRSA because there were so few antibiotics that the bugs could not get used to them. We had aspirin, morphine and digoxin. We had largactil and the barbiturates, but no antidepressants, no tranquillisers, no beta blockers, no ulcer healing drugs, no ACE inhibitors, no statins&#151;and I could go on for a long time. The &#147;British National Formulary&#148; in those days was absolutely useless, because there were no drugs to put in it.</p>

We know how to prevent heart attacks, at least by attacking smoking, diet and high blood pressure and by using the statins. Now, the &#147;British National Formulary&#148; is the most prized document that any doctor carries with him, because if doctors use it well they cannot really make any mistakes with prescribing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para14"><a name="080624132000016">Any celebration has to give credit to the staff, the doctors, the nurses, the secretaries and the volunteers in the charities. Above all, credit must go to the patients, who are so tough, stoical and co-operative with the staff. I worked with patients with rheumatoid arthritis for a long time; it is a most painful, disabling disease. Until very recently it was uncontrollable, yet those patients remained cheerful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para15"><a name="080624132000017">Looking briefly to the future, what are the challenges? They have been mentioned&#151;vastly increasing longevity, the incidence of dementia, and vastly increasing costs&#151;and resources are crucial. We must optimise the use of resources. Economies must be made. The Government are to be congratulated on the better care, better value indicators, which at least make a start on making appropriate use of so many resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para16"><a name="080624132000018">We must eliminate the medical errors, along with the immense costs associated with them, and we must get prioritisation correct. I was not allowed to use the word &#147;rationing&#148; in a debate not long ago, but health care rationing is crucial, and it demands an open, honest and widespread debate. If there was more money available&#151;not by getting more, but by making better use of what we have&#151;perhaps the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence would allow us to afford more drugs. If NICE were able to assess new drugs much more quickly, we might not have the huge problems of co-payments, which have been raised so frequently recently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para17"><a name="080624132000019">Reorganisations have been mentioned many times. When the Health Committee undertook an inquiry on foundation trusts, we listed the reorganisations between 1982 and 2003. There were 18 in those 20 years, and the pace of reorganisation has continued. We face perhaps the biggest change and reorganisation of all with Lord Darzi&#146;s review. The one comfort is that he has said clearly that no changes are to be made until the replacement service is up and running. I hope that that happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para18"><a name="080624132000020">I am grateful that the Government have reaffirmed the principles of the NHS&#151;that it is funded by general taxation and free at the point of delivery&#151;and that those are immutable, but there is one vital bit of Bevan&#146;s work that is missing. Bevan realised that we had to pay doctors and nurses the same across the country to get universality of providers and a real national health service. So a consultant working in London was paid the same as a consultant working out in the country. That achieved a real NHS. My sadness is that with the internal market and the purchaser-provider split, as well as the interests of shareholders in the large commercial organisations tendering for parts of the core NHS, there is a risk of seeing the NHS as we know it disappear.</p>

 It is a genuine pleasure to wind up this debate to mark the 60th anniversary of our national health service. The debate has allowed contributions from all parts of the House expressing both personal and national gratitude for the unparalleled institution that we call our national health service, and above all for its staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para21"><a name="080624132000024">The NHS is the Conservative party&#146;s No. 1 priority. We are not unique in that&#151;it is the No. 1 priority of the people of this country. We have committed ourselves to it financially, and have laid out foundational policy to preserve and enhance its strength. We have the determination to trust front-line staff with decisions, and to set our NHS free from politically inspired micro-management. We have brought forward this motion to celebrate our NHS, and we are glad to use our Opposition time in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para22"><a name="080624132000025">As is the case with Members on both sides of the House, Conservative Members are unequivocal advocates for and supporters of the NHS. I am proud that my mother was an NHS nurse who started her training in the late 1940s, shortly after the founding of the NHS, and retired in the late 1980s. I am also married to a nurse; by that stage, the qualification was no longer as a state enrolled nurse, but as a registered general nurse. My family also uses the NHS, and I am glad that we have had excellent treatment and outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para23"><a name="080624132000026">In this 60th anniversary year, I pay tribute to the hard-working front-line staff in the NHS, and the volunteers who, together with the many charitable organisations, support and care for patients, day in and day out. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) said in a powerful and impassioned speech&#151;I am sure that the House will turn to it, and that his constituents will be proud&#151;the Conservative party, among many others, has supported the principles of the NHS from its outset. There is a strong national consensus on the  <br>

values of the NHS. The British people are rightly proud of it as an institution of whose values we can be proud internationally. We are rightly proud that everyone has access to high-quality care on the basis of need, regardless of their ability to pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para24"><a name="080624132000027">We all have stories of the hard work of front-line professionals when both we and our families have been under the care of the NHS, and will have heard similar stories from our constituents. We also take up those times when the NHS, for all its great benefits and values that we are keen to celebrate, occasionally fails to meet its own standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para25"><a name="080624132000028">The debate has been interesting and wide-ranging. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) set the tone in a way that accorded with how the House sees the NHS. He sought to ensure that we celebrated an NHS that is and should be, in many respects, above party politics. In a relatively short debate, he did not necessarily delve down into the policy and detail, but painted a clear, optimistic, enthusiastic vision for the future. It was heartening to note that the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), whose opening remarks also celebrated the staff of the NHS, largely supported my hon. Friend. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Indeed he did. I am glad that we had the chance to put him right on the question of national targets, and that he can now enter that debate in the right spirit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para26"><a name="080624132000029">The Secretary of State, who has not been able to return to the Chamber, observed that he agreed with every single word of the Opposition motion. Indeed, all that the Government chose to do in their amendment was add to the motion. That set a tone that I think we all hoped could be sustained, but to everyone&#146;s surprise it took the Secretary of State a further 15 minutes to deal with an historical obsession with 1948, and perhaps with 1946 as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para27"><a name="080624132000030">If we are honest, all of us&#151;Members throughout the House&#151;will admit that when we talk to our constituents, it is clear that one thing that does not concern them is what took place in this Chamber in 1948. What does concern them is what will happen to their health service in years to come. That is why it is so important for us to demonstrate our ability to criticise what is happening, and to ensure that we are committed to the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para28"><a name="080624132000031">Despite what struck me as unnecessary, somewhat inappropriate and disappointing partisanship on that score, one certainty emerged from all the speeches. It was articulated by the Secretary of State, and again by Conservative Members. What is clear is that there is no dispute but a total, not even qualified, consensus among Members throughout the House, on behalf of all the people of this nation, that we are committed to the operation and values of the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para29"><a name="080624132000032">I was delighted that a former Secretary of State&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), who spoke with great authority and knowledge&#151;was able to confirm the existence of that total consensus, and the adherence to those principles by all who represent the people of this country in the House. He rightly urged us to move on from what has, at times, been a sterile debate that has not resonated with what people think about the real issues, and to deal with the true debate on who is best placed to deliver what everyone wants to achieve: improving health outcomes  <br>

in a way commensurate with the huge resources that the country is willing to commit to the NHS in which we all believe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para30"><a name="080624132000033">My right hon. Friend was also able to demonstrate that we have come full circle. He gave the example of the introduction by the current Government of commissioning, which had remarkable resonances with procedures and challenges that he and his immediate predecessor had experienced. There have been some wasted years, but we can move on. What my right hon. Friend urged the House to do, above all, was ensure that we retain our confidence in the NHS and learn to let go so that we&#151;the politicians who are accountable in the House for the resources that are committed&#151;can feel confident that the NHS, clinical and non-clinical, can deliver the outcomes that we want.</p>

 My hon. Friend has made an important point. This is not a question of party political partisanship; it is a question of the accountability involved in trying to make the resources committed commensurate with the results that we are all trying to achieve. That is to do with the operation of the NHS, and that is why&#151;as my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood pointed out&#151;it is right for us to have debates such as this in order to decide how best we can deliver the results that we all want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para31"><a name="080624132000036">The hon. Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) made a long speech that went round the houses and a number of parts of the Wirral. It left us wondering what debate he was contributing to, because it did not seem to relate to anything else that was going on. As for the all too short contribution by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), I think that while many us shared his disappointment that the debate had been diverted by some chippy approaches and contributions, we were grateful for the opportunity to hear his reminiscences, not least because he is probably the Member with the most experience of the NHS over a long period. He has committed himself to the health service throughout his life, and we salute him for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80624-0019.htm_para32"><a name="080624132000037">Staff, volunteers and charities support the increasing improvements in health outcomes that we all want to see in the NHS, and we should not lose sight of the importance of research and development, either. I pay tribute to the Secretary of State for emphasising that in his speech, as it is vital.</p>

I hope that the Government, who no doubt had their eyes and ears officially at the launch of our document today, are listening carefully, because our proposals&#151;and this document&#151;are there for them to pick up.

 I, too, am exceptionally proud and very pleased to wind up in this debate on 60 years of the health service. First, let me say to the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) on his history of family nursing, I think it is time I met Mrs. O&#146;Brien.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80624-0020.htm_para2"><a name="080624132000041">This July, we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the NHS, which is not only a great institution but a great, unique and very British expression of the ideal that health care is not a privilege to be purchased, but a moral right secured for all. Opposition Members have made much about references to history. They might have a point if they were talking about 1946 and 1948, but I cannot see how history can start as recently as 2005&#151;that is not long ago&#151;when the Conservative election manifesto proposed patient passports, and not all Conservative Members agreed with the funding of the NHS in that way. Surely, 2005 cannot be described as history?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80624-0020.htm_para3"><a name="080624132000042">Much has been said in particular about the NHS founder, Aneurin Bevan, but also about Sir William Beveridge, who looked at the five giants. However, since I was first elected as a Member of this House in 1997 the main Opposition parties have voted against anything that would actually bring about the defeat of the five giants of want, disease, squalor, ignorance and idleness. That is not history; that is 1997, when the greatest inequality addressed in the House was to do with the minimum wage, and the Opposition parties voted against that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80624-0020.htm_para4"><a name="080624132000043">I therefore feel that history is not, perhaps, what we should be discussing, but I can certainly give a lesson in &#147;herstory&#148;, because &#147;herstory&#148; worked in the NHS throughout most of the time that the Conservatives were in government. I visited the north-east today, and met staff who were born in 1948 and who are working in the NHS today. I particularly want to mention Irene Lerche, who is an appointment and records officer, and Agnes Donoghey, who works for domestic services. I also met up with an old friend: an ambulance driver who was in Chester.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80624-0020.htm_para5"><a name="080624132000044">Ten years ago, people questioned whether the British NHS could survive. It is a testimony to the extraordinary work done by nurses, doctors and all NHS staff&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I ask Opposition Members just to take a lesson from &#147;herstory&#148;; she only has a few minutes. In the 10 years since I have been in this House, the NHS is more firmly than ever part of the fabric of British national life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80624-0020.htm_para6"><a name="080624132000045">Deaths from cancer and heart disease have fallen dramatically and Britain is one of the safest places in the world to give birth. The NHS is the largest employer in Europe. Its staff both past and present have helped to care for tens of millions of people and saved many hundreds of thousands of lives. We acknowledge that the NHS has come through difficult times, and it is a testimony to the hard work and dedication of its staff that it has turned a &#163;547 million deficit in 2005-06 into a &#163;515 million net surplus at 2006-07. All are to be congratulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80624-0020.htm_para7"><a name="080624132000046">Tonight, we also need to recognise the volunteers and charitable organisations that have made a huge contribution to the success of the NHS and to the health and well-being of patients. We would particularly like to thank charities not only for their contribution to patients&#146; and their families&#146; lives, but also for their support and ongoing partnership with the Government, which is so valuable in determining the best outcomes for patients. Be it our cancer strategy or our stroke strategy, all have contributed; everybody feels part of this NHS. Stakeholders are constantly consulted and their documents shared, and they are proud of the documents that they have produced. Not acknowledging the organisations that praise the national stroke strategy in particular does nothing for the Conservative party. The chief executive of the Stroke Association has highlighted that strategy, which I believe it is celebrating this week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80624-0020.htm_para8"><a name="080624132000047">One million more operations a year are performed, and heart operations have more than doubled, so I am pleased to say that we do more than hope; we are really meeting our targets on heart disease, which should be welcomed by the Opposition parties. If this is a true debate on really acknowledging the changes that have taken place, we should have the acknowledgment that the targets have made a difference. The difference that they have made is that people are alive, and their quality of life is better. They are not in pain or worried about whether they will see the end of the year out, until the next waiting list figures are produced. They are alive and well and their quality of life has increased dramatically. That is thanks to the dedication and commitment of staff. A number of NHS trusts around the country have already delivered on the 18-week target&#151;nine months early.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80624-0020.htm_para9"><a name="080624132000048">Next week, the NHS &#147;next stage&#148; review will build on the progress that it has made with a new vision for the NHS based on care that is fair, personalised, effective and safe. We commend our noble Friend and colleague Lord Darzi and his work. The major review that he has led will inevitably result in a significant improvement in patient-centred care. I am quite clear that the NHS must continue to change. To quote Sister Wendy Larmouth, the sister in charge, along with Professor Andrew Cant, of the northern regional bone marrow transplant unit,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80624-0020.htm_para10"><a name="080624132000049">That is a truly remarkable team, and the unit is ranked No. 3 in Europe. We must continue to organise medical expertise so that the highest standards of care are available to all patients. If we can achieve all this&#151;I hope Members throughout the House agree that this should be a shared objective&#151;we will make the NHS safe for future generations.</p>

slogan at the time. Well, the British people knew what to think. They re-elected a Labour Government to secure the NHS. I believe that the NHS is the best insurance system for the long term, and even more relevant to Britain today than it was in 1948. I commend our amendment to the House.</p>

I am pleased to have secured this debate this evening on open windrow composting. Let me say at the outset that I support the recycling of green waste. However, it must be done in a safe manner and without endangering the safety of those live in close proximity to recycling sites. It is in that context that I want to make two points in my contribution&#151;about the danger associated with this type of process, and about public safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para12"><a name="080624134000004">I also want to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for her reply to me of 16 June 2008, which goes some way to answering some of my concerns, but I want to encourage her to go a little further. I will refer to her letter later and suggest how we may take the matter forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para13"><a name="080624134000005">The problems associated with open windrow composting were brought to my attention by local residents in my constituency who were protesting against the proposal for a composting site near to the village of Hood Green in the hinterland to the Pennines. I know that matters to do with the site are for the local planning authority and not for this debate, but I want to speak about the dangers generally associated with the open windrow composting process and what can be done to mitigate them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para14"><a name="080624134000006">The process takes place on a large concrete base and the method of decay is helped by the natural internal combustion of the waste. As the green waste heats, the process of decay is facilitated. The waste is turned over by machine at intervals to ensure thorough decomposition. That agitation produces bioaerosols, which can be called organic dust. One such bioaerosol is Aspergillus fumigatus, a fungus that can cause serious respiratory damage and has been known to be fatal. There are other downsides to the process, including the odour that results&#151;particularly from the run-off of rain, which can collect and stagnate. That adds to the sickening smell, which also attracts vermin and flies; they are a further hazard of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para15"><a name="080624134000007">I want to draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the Giessen study, which took place in Germany; I shall read from its introduction and conclusions in a moment. I want to do that because the Environment Agency advises a 250 m precautionary buffer zone, although from its website it appears that the agency is not too sure of what the distance should be. That is an important issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para16"><a name="080624134000008">I contend that, on the evidence available, a 250 m buffer site is inadequate in many circumstances. In that context, I refer the Minister to a study carried out by scientists at the university of Giessen Institute for Hygiene and Environmental Medicine on the effects of bioaerosol-polluted outdoor air on the airways of residents. It is dated 14 November 2005. I am advised that, for some strange reason, the study was not included in the Health and Safety Executive review of research report 130.</p>

residents. The study was double blinded to the ongoing microbial levels. A total of 356 medical questionnaires were collected from residents near a green waste compost site and also from an unexposed residential control area. The prevalence of health complaints were assessed against distance from site and the recorded microbiological pollution levels...The site near Giessen, Germany processes yard trimmings, grass cuttings and organic waste. The material is shredded, formed in windrows and turned regularly. Throughput is approximately 12500m<sup>(3)</sup> per year.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para18"><a name="080624134000010">The conclusions of the study are of great interest, and I want to draw the Minister&#146;s attention to them:</p>
<a name="80624-0021.htm_brev5"><a name="080624134000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is clear evidence of elevated health changes with residents living up to 500 metres from this green waste site. Mucus membrane infections are particularly elevated, shortness of breath is shown to be an effect of spore inhalation and excessive tiredness is distinctly linked to site emissions.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para19"><a name="080624134000011">The study continues:</p>
<a name="80624-0021.htm_brev6"><a name="080624134000047"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This study is believed to be the first to actively show the causal link between levels of bio aerosols and health conditions. Other studies over the last 20 years have hypothesized over the effects on those living in close proximity to compost sites and have identified raised levels of fungal spores at 500 metres distant, but apart from stating that &#145;there is potential for chronic ill health, which may not yet have had time to manifest itself&#146;, no change in Environmental Agency recommendations for distances from sensitive receptors has yet emerged.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para20"><a name="080624134000012">The agency referred to is of course the German environment agency. It concludes in its final paragraph:</p>
<a name="80624-0021.htm_brev7"><a name="080624134000048"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Fungal spores are common in air and every cubic metre of air breathed will contain a few minute spores. Generally the immune system can cope with levels above background, but in the area of a composting site the concentration of airborne spores is increased dramatically. Exposure should be limited wherever possible up to the 500 metre line where background levels then descend to normal.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para21"><a name="080624134000013">In effect, the study is saying that we should have a buffer zone of 500 m. Given that it is the most comprehensive study that has been done, I am rather surprised that it was not included in the HSE review of research report 130.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para22"><a name="080624134000014">The Minister will be aware of the Stourbridge case, where, on 10 December, a composting site that was within 250 m of residential homes was closed. A man who acted as a consultant to the group that opposed the site advises me that it was closed because of excessive amounts of odour and bioaerosol emissions; I know that the Environment Agency takes a different view. He has provided me with the medical backgrounds of 12 of the 14 victims. Two of the 12 were suffering from the Aspergillus fungus; the others had picked up different infections on top of their chest conditions. Since the closure, I am advised that the five people who have been followed up have all reported that their health has improved and that they are using only half the medicines that they were prescribed at the time when the site was open. If we not only look at the Giessen study but draw on the experience gained from Stourbridge, it is clear that important evidence links the victims to the inhalation of organic dust from those composting sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para23"><a name="080624134000015">The Minister may be interested in the work that is being done at Sheffield university. The Environment Agency decided on its 250 m buffer zone on the basis of a study carried out on flat lands in Norfolk, but when people from Sheffield university investigated how the wind carries spores in the hinterland to the Pennines, they found that it blows up the hill and then forms a kind of vortex on the other side, carrying some of the spores up to 1 km further than was previously supposed. It is important that we take into consideration the  <br>

terrain for which many composting applications are made. I understand from a similar study that the Californian authorities have decided to go with a 500 m buffer zone instead of the shorter one that was previously used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para24"><a name="080624134000016">As the Minister will be aware, there are alternatives to open windrow processing, including complete enclosure and a system called IVC&#151;in-vessel composting&#151;which operates almost like a low-pressure cooker and deals with the green waste without producing the bioaerosols.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para25"><a name="080624134000017">Problems may be created in the work environment for employees, and that issue should also be considered closely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para26"><a name="080624134000018">The Minister wrote me a helpful letter&#151;it included one point on which we may be able to make further progress&#151;in which she referred to the development of amenity risk assessments at waste management facilities. She wrote:</p>
<a name="80624-0021.htm_brev8"><a name="080624134000049"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This project will help to develop methods for estimating downwind concentrations of bio-aerosols and focus on improving data availability to support research into dispersion modelling.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para27"><a name="080624134000019">As I say, dispersion modelling is being done at Sheffield university. She went on to say:</p>
<a name="80624-0021.htm_brev9"><a name="080624134000050"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The report will describe a number of peer reviewed journal papers examining bio-aerosol production and dispersal.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para28"><a name="080624134000020">It is in that context that I urge her to ask that the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive, which has a public health function, look at the Giessen study. As far as I can see, it is the foremost study on composting in the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para29"><a name="080624134000021">In conclusion, I ask the Minister to do four things. First, I would like her not only to ensure that the HSE and the Environment Agency review the Giessen study, but to encourage them to take a cautious view on recommendations of a more appropriate buffer zone, particularly in areas such as the hinterland to the Pennines, where it is very hilly and we get the sort of wind problems and vortexes to which I referred. I would also be pleased if she advises that research done before 2000 is outdated, because much of the relevant literature is more recent. The Cornell Waste Management Institute, which is an Ivy league institute, is making that recommendation. Will she ask the HSE to advise on the best and safest composting method for employees and the public? Finally, will she ask local authorities to defer any proposals for new sites until the Environment Agency and the HSE advice is available so that we can ensure public safety in the future?</p>

 I am very grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) for securing this debate, and for the excellent way in which he presented his case. I will attempt to answer his many questions and deal with the promises that he seeks from me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para30"><a name="080624134000023">As has been identified, open windrow composting is one of the forms of biological treatment of biodegradable waste that has increased in recent years in the move increasingly to recycle or recover waste and to reduce our reliance on landfill. Of course, however, composting is by no means new and it is, indeed, a process that occurs naturally, as my hon. Friend will appreciate. Good quality compost has a number of benefits, including  <br>

its water-holding capability and as a sustainable alternative to peat, so it is important to us. It returns organic matter to the soil, sequestering carbon, and it can be used as a soil improver&#151;in agricultural or landscape applications, for example&#151;and as a growing medium for the horticultural industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para31"><a name="080624134000024">At the heart of our waste strategy is the need to meet our European Union landfill directive targets. The amount of biodegradable municipal waste we send to landfill needs to fall to 11.2 million tonnes by 2010, 7.46 million tonnes by 2013 and 5.22 million tonnes by 2020. That is quite a challenge. We have already made progress, with the amount falling from 13.9 million tonnes in 2004-05 to 11.55 million tonnes in 2006-07. That achievement reflects the increase in waste being recycled and composted&#151;from 27 per cent. in 2005-06 to more than 30 per cent. in 2006-07. A third of that figure is made up of composting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para32"><a name="080624134000025">Open windrow composting is the form of composting green waste that is carried out in our back gardens, our community composting schemes, in large public gardens and hotels, on farms and at other establishments. Composting is also carried out on a much larger commercial scale by operators contracted to handle source-segregated green waste collected by local authorities or delivered by the public to civic amenity sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para33"><a name="080624134000026">Open windrow composting is less suited to dealing with other types of waste such as food waste or other contaminated biodegradable waste. As my hon. Friend said, other methods are more appropriate, for example, in-vessel composting, which must fulfil animal by-product regulations, and anaerobic digestion. The Government are encouraging that and we have announced a &#163;10 million technology demonstrator programme for anaerobic digestion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para34"><a name="080624134000027">At the core of my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns are the risks that such activities pose to the environment and human health. As he said, a bioaerosol is a suspension of fine biological material in a gas. Bioaerosol particles are made up of a range of different types of particles, including fungal spores such as Aspergillus fumigatum and Penicillium. Of course, they occur naturally in urban and rural environments, and can aid the composting process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para35"><a name="080624134000028">It is important to stress that background figures vary from location to location, and with the seasons, ranging from less than 100 to more than several thousand particles per cubic metre. My hon. Friend is correct to say that the dispersal of bioaerosols will vary with atmospheric conditions. That is why the Health and Safety Executive reviewed a range of data from different sites, conditions and modelling techniques. My hon. Friend asked why the Giessen study was not included in the review. The reason is that the review was carried out before the publication of the Giessen study, so its inclusion was not possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80624-0021.htm_para36"><a name="080624134000029">The review, which was published in 2003, found that fungal particles generated at any site would drop to background levels within about 150 m. That is why the Health and Safety Executive has proposed a precautionary approach and recommended not 150 m but 250 m. By taking a bigger margin than is perhaps considered necessary, the HSE is confident that it has taken account of unexpected or extreme conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80624-0022.htm_para0"><a name="080624134000030">My hon. Friend asked about specific wind speeds and dispersal. That works in a way that perhaps is contrary to his expectations. When the tiny particles are in the wind, if they are blown at speed in a specific location, they are more likely to clump together, form heavier particles and therefore fall to the ground more quickly. Of course, we would expect particles to travel as far as 1,000 m. They are being constantly spread throughout the atmosphere.</p>

 I accept that a gentle wind in a level area may take the spores further than a stronger breeze. However, in the Pennines, the modelling showed that the wind goes to the top of the hills and forms a vortex over them, carrying the spores much further and putting communities that are further away than 250 m in danger. I therefore believe that we should have a wider buffer zone.</p>

 My advice is that that dispersal mechanism reduces the density. Between us, we are unable to decide, so we probably need to leave the matter to the experts, but that is the advice that I have received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80624-0022.htm_para1"><a name="080624134000033">The Environment Agency recently reviewed the 250 m limit, in the light of our recent increases in composting capacity, and concluded that it remained valid. Therefore, I am afraid that the Government cannot accept my hon. Friend&#146;s suggestion that all composting schemes throughout the country should be deferred until further research has been conducted. There are further research projects under way, which I shall mention, but he knows that I have given him chapter and verse on those, including their publication date and what they aim to achieve, in the letters that I have sent him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80624-0022.htm_para2"><a name="080624134000034">All forms of waste recovery or disposal, including composting, are regulated to prevent harm to human health and the environment. That regulation is achieved in two ways: first, through the planning system and the requirement for planning permission for use or development of land; and, secondly, through an environmental permit, or in some cases a registered exemption from the Environment Agency. The aim is for the two systems to complement each another to achieve the overall control and protection required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80624-0022.htm_para3"><a name="080624134000035">The Environment Agency is consulted, as part of the planning process, on environmental and human health considerations and, where composting sites are involved, takes the location of the site into account when permitting a site or registering an exemption. The Environment Agency requires permit applicants and those wishing to register exemptions to provide it with a site-specific bioaerosol risk assessment where the proposed composting facility will be within 250 m of dwellings or workplaces. That assessment will need to demonstrate that the levels of bioaerosols have dropped to background levels before reaching the first receptor, which means dwelling or workplace. Where prospective compost sites are more than 250 m from occupied premises, a more basic risk assessment is completed that does not require monitoring of bioaerosols, for the reasons that I have already given.</p>

assessment, as part of a registration process for the waste exemption. That assessment determined that the risk was acceptable, given the distance of the site from the nearest dwelling. That meets the Environment Agency&#146;s requirements for assessing exemption registrations when sites are more than 250 m from a dwelling or workplace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80624-0022.htm_para5"><a name="080624134000037">It is a fundamental principle of the planning system that each application must be decided on its individual planning merits, following consultation with those potentially affected by a development. As my hon. Friend has acknowledged, given that there is an outstanding application for planning permission in respect of the Hood Green site, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage. However, I understand that the occupier of the site has already registered an exemption with the Environment Agency in respect of the proposed composting operation. The Environment Agency has advised me that it has considered the request in detail and has checked the proposed composting activity could meet the terms of the exemption before placing it on the public register of exempt activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80624-0022.htm_para6"><a name="080624134000038">Under the terms of the current exemption provided for in legislation, the amount of waste being composted at any time must not exceed 1,000 cu m. The Environment Agency has advised me that it will inspect the site if it becomes operational. If the Environment Agency finds that the site is causing harm to the environment or resulting in noise or odour nuisance, it can remove the exemption from the register. The Environment Agency can also take enforcement action, but only if there are any grounds to do so once the activity has commenced. If the composting activity is unable to meet the requirements of the exemption and is removed from the public register, the operator will be required to apply for an environmental permit to carry out the activity. The site will be subject to inspection by the Environment Agency to ensure that the operations are being carried out to an appropriate standard and in compliance with the rules of the exemption.</p>

about nuisance and other local impacts. I have checked the details specifically in relation to bioaerosols, and the Environment Agency has said that they were not the reason for closing the site. The reasons were dust, noise and smells, all of which have an impact on local people, and it was as a consequence of those factors that the agency exercised its enforcement powers. I understand that bioaerosol monitoring has taken place at the site, and they were not one of the factors involved. It is really important to assure people of that.</p>

I have not seen it, but if there is value in the work, we will undoubtedly need to look at it. The Environment Agency and others who are carrying out research and producing reports will clearly need to look at it as well. My hon. Friend has described a very small sample, however. As a scientist myself, I think that it might be difficult to draw conclusions from a sample of that size.</p>

 I share many of the concerns that my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) has expressed, in relation to my own constituency. I hope that the Minister will refer to the research that he has mentioned, as I believe that it could have an impact on the decisions that she might ultimately make.</p>

 May I give my hon. Friend, and my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone, that assurance? I am determined to look into all the issues that have been raised. As I said in my letters, if the research throws up new factors, it will of course be appropriate to review the situation, and we will have to look at the conditions surrounding the permits and exemptions&#151;</p>
