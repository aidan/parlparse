 If one looks back at the experience of far too many communities since the deregulation of bus services in 1986, one sees that the somewhat fundamentalist views of competition, which have been more prevalent among Opposition Members than Labour ones, have been defied by experience. We recognise that competitive bus services can be effective, but that is not being manifested in enough communities today. To judge by the bus services that are operating effectively&#151;for example, in communities such as Nottingham, York and Brighton&#151;such a service involves not simply the fresh gusts of competition but an effective partnership with local authorities. We are keen to make sure that the architecture for that partnership is extended across the country.</p>

 The renewable transport fuel obligation is due to come into effect in April 2008, providing a significant and secure market for biofuels in the UK.

 As a supporter of the development of sustainable biofuels, I am sure that the Minister will be as aware as I am of the &#147;Dispatches&#148; programme last night, which pointed out that were the RTFO to be a success, the UK could end up importing biofuels in a way that was even more damaging than the polluting fuel base that we have now.

 The sustainability of the biomass used to produce renewable fuels is key to the success of the RTFO. If we do not produce the renewable fuels sustainably, there is no point doing it. There will be a reporting mechanism in the RTFO to ensure that biofuel is being derived from sustainable sources. We will also ensure that the RTFO is structured in a way that encourages the production ultimately of second generation biofuels and biofuels produced from other forms of biomass, as my hon. Friend has suggested. I also encourage him, and any contacts that he may have, to respond to the consultation document so that we may build those issues into the RTFO.</p>

 The Government car fleet does not use E85 technology. The hon.

We have also said that we will go beyond 5 per cent. as soon as we can guarantee that it can be done from sustainable sources, because&#151;as I said in answer to the previous question&#151;if we cannot produce the biomass sustainably, there is no point doing it. So we will go as far and as fast as we can, commensurate with it being done sustainably.</p>

 I think that, with respect, the hon. Lady is getting the wrong end of the stick. The franchise was taken away from GNER specifically because we refused to renegotiate it, which was exactly the right decision for the Government to take. If we sent out a message that these franchises could be renegotiated, it would simply encourage any bidders to bid well above what they could afford, knowing that the Government would then come in and bail them out.

 The identifiers introduced in the postal voting system this year will show that everyone can vote as they wish. I am interested to hear that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about the way postal votes are handled in a household. I notice that in the 2005 general election, which he won with a majority of 422, 9,392 postal votes were returned. I wonder how many of those he considers were handled purely by the head of household.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does my hon. Friend accept that although the verifiers of signature and date of birth are probably about right as guarantees, there is a concern that many people who genuinely need a postal vote may not fill in the forms that have been provided because it is another form and they do not like bureaucracy, or they simply do not get round to it? Will she therefore commend the electoral registration officer in Sheffield, who has not merely sent out one form, but has sent a second form as a reminder to those who have not returned the first one? Will she encourage all registration officers to do that, and even to go beyond that and send out a third and fourth form, if necessary, to ensure that people who need a postal vote do not lose out?</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that suggestion. It is good to see that electoral registration officers are being proactive in encouraging people not just to register&#151;the register has gone up this year by some 500,000 or thereabouts&#151;but to take part in postal voting, particularly where people were used to being on the postal vote register in the past.

 Given that a staggering one in seven postal votes in last year&#146;s local elections in Tower Hamlets may have been fraudulent, does the Minister support Sir Alistair Graham&#146;s call for the Government to abandon next May&#146;s internet and telephone voting trials? Are not Ministers ignoring one hard truth: once ballot papers are allowed to leave polling stations, the opportunities for fraud multiply and the secrecy of the ballot is compromised?

 The hon. Gentleman is usually such a charming man. I can see that he was having difficulty trying to manufacture anger in his question. May I say two things to him? No, I do not agree with Sir Alistair Graham that we should stop doing pilots. The whole point of piloting is to ensure that we get the system right. Secondly, I am disappointed that the Council of Europe motion, concocted mostly by some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s hon.

 I welcome again the Government&#146;s community court initiative on reuniting communities and the justice system that is meant to serve them. Will my right hon. and learned Friend meet senior judiciary to clarify a couple of matters: first, communities&#146; involvement in the possible appointment of judges in community courts; and secondly, relaxation of the very stringent accommodation criteria that are necessary for magistrates courts so that they can be located in the neighbourhoods that they are intended to serve?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his continuing commitment to ensuring that there is effective community justice in his area of Nottingham. It is absolutely right that everybody involved in the justice system has to do things slightly differently if that connection between the community and their local court is to be re-established. That means looking again at the criteria for the kinds of buildings that could be used as courts, and it raises the question of how the local judiciary could be chosen. One of the strongest points in favour of the Liverpool community justice centre was that community representatives from local tenants associations had the opportunity to be part of choosing the judge, David Fletcher, whom they now regard as their judge for their local community.</p>

and there is no chief coroner to provide leadership such as the Lord Chief Justice provides to judges. As a result, while some areas are conducting inquests very promptly, in others there are delays that nobody in this House would regard as acceptable. We will be able to deal with that when we have our legislation on coroners. However, we are not simply waiting until that happens&#151;we are trying to ensure that we get a much better picture of where the delays are and that we work with our colleagues in local government to ensure that there are no such delays.

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="70306-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="07030670000527"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make further provision about penalties relating to parking on private land; to make provision about compliance with notices concerning parking for disabled people on private land; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07030670000186">I want to make it clear from the outset that people who provide private parking spaces on their land should be able to protect them. Many businesses are affected by people who park vehicles on their land and create problems. Pubs, shops and businesses in town centres want to ensure that their customers can park, and we need to make sure that they have the right to do that. It is important for businesses to protect their parking spaces for their customers and employees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07030670000187">Many organisations use private security companies to enforce parking regulations on their land. The Private Security Industry Act 2001 provides for the regulation of such matters. It also provides for the security industry authority to license organisations that undertake immobilising and clamping activity in private car parks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07030670000188">In addition to holding a valid security industry authority licence, vehicle immobilisers must observe specific requirements. First, a vehicle must not be clamped, blocked or towed if it displays a valid disabled badge or if it is a marked as an emergency services vehicle that is in use as such. Secondly, any licence holder who collects a release fee must provide a receipt, which must include: the location of the clamping or towing; the name and signature of the person who clamped the vehicle; the licence number of the organisation that carried out the clamping, and the date on which it happened. The immobiliser must wear a licence. Those who work without a licence commit a criminal offence, which is punishable on conviction by a fine of up to &#163;5,000, six months&#146; imprisonment or both.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07030670000189">The problem is that there is no clarity about the sort of signage that private clamping companies have to provide on sites before clamping is undertaken. There is no standard process. The fees are also a problem. The legislation simply states that fees should be &#147;reasonable&#148;. That causes several difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07030670000190">The BBC in the midlands has recently undertaken some work in Birmingham to examine the operation of private clamping in the city. It got a woman driver to park a vehicle on a privately owned space and leave the scene. Almost immediately, the clampers from a private company emerged and began to tow away the vehicle. The woman returned to be told that she had to pay hundreds of pounds in cash to the company to release the vehicle and that she would be escorted to a cash machine to make the payment. When she said that she could not pay, she was left to make her own way home alone late at night. The company&#146;s behaviour was clearly unacceptable. However, people will pay almost anything to get their car released.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07030670000191">My constituent, Paul Watling from Telford, was also caught out on an area of land in Birmingham. He fully acknowledged that he was parking in a private space. However, the signage on the site was poor and he had to pay &#163;350 to get his car released from clamping. He  <br>

was virtually frogmarched to the cash machine by some fairly aggressive and intimidating clamping agents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07030670000192">The Bill proposes that clamping companies must inform the local authority in their area of activity of the scope, style and location of signs to be used on private land. I am trying to drive towards some standardisation of the signage in local authority areas. The Bill also proposes giving the local authority the power to set a range in which penalty fees should be set. Clearly, that may vary between different towns and cities, depending on the market and the scarcity of parking spaces. I believe that the decision should be made locally by the local authority. However, we should consider setting a maximum amount for such fees&#151;&#163;350 in cash is extortionate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07030670000193">The second element of the Bill concerns the provision of disabled parking spaces on private land. The Department for Transport provides advice on the provision of spaces for disabled drivers. The Disability Discrimination Act requires service providers to take reasonable steps to ensure that disabled people can enjoy services. Department for Transport leaflet 5/95 suggests:</p>
<a name="70306-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="07030670000528"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For car parks associated with shopping areas, leisure or recreational facilities, and places open to the general public: A minimum of one space for each employee who is a disabled motorist, plus 6 per cent. of the total capacity for visiting disabled motorists. The numbers of designated spaces may need to be greater at hotels and sports stadia that specialise in accommodating groups of disabled people.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07030670000194">Most disabled persons&#146; parking bays in off-street car parks, such as supermarket car parks, are not covered by blue badge scheme regulations. Such car parks and parking bays are likely to be privately owned and managed by the individual business: the agreement, and any cost to use them, will be between the owner and the motorist or customer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07030670000195">If a disabled motorist or passenger complains to, for example, a supermarket that a non-disabled motorist has parked in a disabled bay, an employee of the store can ask the driver to move their car but cannot legally insist on it. In some instances, the owners of private car parks are reluctant to take action against people, because they think that it is bad for business. In my view, not providing bays for people with disabilities and mobility problems is bad for business. One of the problems is that spaces tend to be close to the store and people feel that they can park briefly in one of those  <br>

spaces when they use a cash machine or pick up friends or family who have been shopping. Such behaviour is not acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07030670000196">A number of surveys have been conducted on the use and abuse of disabled parking bays in recent years. In 2005, a survey carried out by Baywatch found that one in five bays were being abused on supermarket sites. The Bill would require all owners of private car parks with disabled parking bays to have a clear written strategy on enforcement, which is available to the public on request. It would also require owners to submit an annual report on their enforcement activity to the local authority and the Disability Rights Commission or its successor bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07030670000197">I have considered proposals to extend the blue badge scheme on to private land and, for example, supermarket car parks. My main concern about an extension of that scheme is that many authorities already find it difficult to enforce the provision on public car parks. The Bill does not therefore include such proposals. Supermarkets and other car park owners who provide disabled places are, however, drinking in the last chance saloon: they need to act more effectively, or we will have to bring in more draconian legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70306-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07030670000198">In closing, may I thank Douglas Campbell, chairman of Mobilise, and John Pring of Disability Now for their help on this issue? I also thank the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies), whose support for the Bill has been especially helpful. I am conscious that the House is fairly full this afternoon.

 It is 98 years sincere a wholly hereditary House of Lords plunged the nation into one of its worst ever constitutional crises as it vetoed the right of a democratically elected Government to set a Budget.

complexity of the business before them. This House already sits for longer and for more days than most comparable legislatures. If it were serious about doing the work of two Houses combined, it would mean&#151;besides many other things&#151;much shorter recesses, no light Thursdays and many fewer constituency Fridays. I suggest to Members on both sides of the House that that is a sure-fire recipe for detaching Members of Parliament from their voters.</p>

More recently, after a royal commission with a distinguished membership had presented a thorough and wide-ranging report in 2000, and after a White Paper in 2001 and a comprehensive inquiry by the Public Administration Committee and a Joint Committee of the Commons and Lords in 2002, the House in early February 2003 managed to vote down every possibility for reform, from doing nothing to having an all-elected House and every alternative in between. It was not a good day for the reputation of this House or of Parliament.</p>

right hon. Friend encouraged me to search for a consensus with the other parties and to make proposals. This two-day debate and tomorrow&#146;s votes are the culmination of the first stage of that process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="70306-0005.htm_para12"><a name="07030670000237">Four years ago, when the House last debated this issue, I voted for an all-appointed House and against the alternatives. I did so for several reasons, one of which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin). I feared the impact of introducing an elected element into the other place. I had concerns that that could impinge on the primacy of this House, and that it could create a new breed of politician, rivalling the role of Members of this House both here and in their constituencies. I am well aware, of course, that some Members still have these concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="70306-0005.htm_para13"><a name="07030670000238">However, I have to tell the House that, having thought deeply about this subject, I am now convinced that my fears of 2003 were misplaced, and that there is a very solid case for a part-elected, part-appointed House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o144"><a name="07030670000239"><a name="70306-0005.htm_spnew13"><a name="07030670000725"><b>Mr. Bernard Jenkin (North Essex) (Con):</b>

I shall vote against the other alternatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70306-0005.htm_para15"><a name="07030670000242">As I have just mentioned, the principal reason I previously supported a wholly appointed House was that I considered that the introduction of any elected element into the Lords could, by virtue of that fact, inevitably challenge the primacy of this House, which is fundamental to our democracy. However, as I read the royal commission report, the associated research evidence and much other material, I was presented with facts about other countries&#146; experience that simply did not support my view of an automatic link between an elected element in the Lords and an erosion of the primacy of this place. The evidence shows instead that a country can have a powerful elected second Chamber&#151;the United States, for example&#151;or a weak elected second Chamber, four examples being Japan, Spain, Poland and the Czech Republic. A nation may have an appointed second Chamber with relatively limited powers, or an appointed second Chamber with relatively substantial powers. There are, in truth, no iron rules linking composition and power, except the rule that allows self-confident democracies to set their own rules&#151;their constitutions&#151;and to change them when they judge it right to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70306-0005.htm_para16"><a name="07030670000243">Having considered the evidence, I was struck by two other things. First, after extensive deliberation the royal commission, the Public Administration Committee and the unofficial but authoritative Breaking the Deadlock group each came down in favour of a hybrid House of part-elected, part-appointed membership&#151;albeit of different proportions. Each of these all-party committees had thought long and hard about how a hybrid second Chamber could be established in such a way as to avoid competition with this House. They made recommendations to that end, which have greatly informed the conclusions of the Government and of the cross-party group.</p>

 I will deal with that point. I know that my hon.

The truth is that there are partly appointed, partly elected Chambers elsewhere in the world, and the evidence suggests that whether or not they work satisfactorily depends on the other ground rules that are established alongside them.

We have a very much closer and more precious relationship with our constituents, in my opinion. Could we not look closer to home and learn from the experience of Scotland?

That level of public rejection of the principle of an all-appointed or mainly appointed House in favour of a significantly or wholly elected House is a consistent feature of recent tests of public opinion. A thorough opinion survey last month for the Hansard Society, which itself has no axe to grind on this issue, showed that just 6 per cent. favoured an all-appointed House, and 82 per cent. a wholly or partly elected House.</p>

I shall come on to that point. I also point out that it is dangerous to suggest that we should dismiss the public&#146;s view on the grounds of ignorance. That was the view that was taken by our predecessors in opposing any extension of the franchise in 1832. Leaving that aside, the hon. Gentleman quoted the Hansard poll at me, but it also shows that of those who have a grasp of the issues&#151;the poll&#146;s words, not mine&#151;many more people support the proposal that the Government make today.</p>

Those who know the US system will be aware that the different relationship between Congressmen and their constituents is due not to the size of the constituency but to the intensity of elections.

One has been the Joint Committee on Conventions under the Chairmanship of my noble Friend Lord Cunningham of Felling, and the other has been the cross-party group on Lords reform that I have chaired.

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70306-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07030670000277">The Cunningham Committee made it clear that its conclusions&#151;not on those powers, which were a given, but on the conventions underpinning them&#151;related to the Lords as it is currently constituted. However, the House will be reassured that all members of the cross-party group that I chaired were agreed on the fundamental principle of the primacy of the Commons, and that any reformed Lords should be a complement to this House, and not a rival to it. That echoes similar key conclusions of the royal commission, the Public Administration Select Committee, and the Breaking the Deadlock reports.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may be right about that. I said at paragraph 22 of the Government&#146;s response to the Cunningham 2 report &#147;Conventions of the UK Parliament&#148;:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="70306-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07030670000286">But these things are perfectly possible. The crucial thing is that no one is arguing about the current practice of the powers of the two Chambers. There may be a debate about whether the conventions which in part underpin those powers&#151;they are also in part underpinned by the resolutions of this House and by the Parliament Acts&#151;are sufficient. I am very happy that we should have that debate. Indeed, I hope that we can because I hope that we can reach a result tomorrow night for the first time in 98 years.</p>

No one is arguing; everyone is agreed that the current powers of this place in relation to the powers of the Lords or any second Chamber should remain the same. The only issue is the means by which they are delivered, because in part they are delivered by conventions. If we believe that those conventions are likely to be too weak, we can supplement them by resolutions and underpin them by statute.</p>

 As a member of the Joint Committee on Conventions, I think that it is important that the House be aware that the Joint Committee stated clearly that, if the composition of the Lords were changed, the Committee or another joint committee would have to review the conventions, because the conventions apply to the present House of Lords and the composition of the present House of Lords. It is quite wrong that this House should assume that that Committee, which sat at great length and considered the matter in great depth, had any other view than that the current conventions covered the current House of Lords.</p>

 I ask my question from a genuine desire to know the answer. As someone who would like to abolish the House of Lords&#151;although I realise that the first motion may pass&#151;I am concerned that if I vote for a wholly elected House I will tie myself to accepting a particular form of election. Can my right hon. Friend clarify that point, and confirm that whatever the arguments or discussions about the composition of the House, the form of election is still to be decided and will be fully discussed and debated in this place?</p>

That is palpably untrue. I favour a hybrid House partly because I want to see those without party affiliation continue to make an important contribution to the House of Lords, but also because I want to see in the other place some of those expert and experienced in their field who have a party affiliation but whose profession or career make it difficult for them to take part in the electoral process. I am satisfied that with a statutory appointments commission in place, that could be achieved without charges of cronyism.</p>

In practice, for a long time, fair representation of minorities in the second Chamber could be achieved only by appointments.</p>

 In the White Paper, the first-past-the-post system is dismissed on the grounds that the arguments in favour of it are relevant only to the Chamber in Parliament that delivers the &#147;Government of the day&#148;.

Surely he recognises that the element of appointment by the party leadership, which is inherent in the partly open list system that he proposes, would automatically give an enormous amount of power to those who run the parties in question.</p>

 I certainly do not accept that. Let me spell out that our proposal is not for the current system in use for the European parliamentary elections. In that closed list system, in practice, voters have to vote for all members of a party's list if they vote for one. Under the partly or semi-open list system, that is not the case. Voters may, if they wish, vote for a list or they may allocate their vote to a specific individual candidate. The result is that voters can influence which candidates are elected as well as which party. In other words, they can &#147;break the list&#148;.</p>

There is as much voter discretion under this system as under the first-past-the-post system, where in each constituency it is the party that selects the candidate, not the voter.

One, which I have already referred to, relates to fears that such a reformed Chamber would challenge the primacy of this place. It need not and it will not. The second is to argue that the current appointed Chamber does such a good job that it would be difficult or impossible to improve it. Let me now deal with that second issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70306-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07030670000340">I applaud the work of the Lords in revising legislation, in holding the Government to account and in acting as a forum for distinguished peers, who are expert and experienced in their fields. But that said, I do not believe that the Lords as currently constituted has reached such a state of grace, either in terms of its activity or its membership, that it requires no change. Self-evidently my view is also the view of both main Opposition parties. One of the distinctive and commendable features of this country&#146;s constitutional arrangements is that they normally produce strong Governments. But strong government requires a strong Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="70306-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07030670000341">Over the past 30 years, this House and the other place have notably and noticeably improved the way in which the Government are held to account. But there is much more that this House can do to improve its effectiveness without paralysing good governance, and the same is true of the other place. This is not a zero-sum game. There is no fixed quantum of activity of this Parliament such that if the Lords does something, by virtue of that fact that is going to undermine the Commons or to suck power from it. With government as complex as it is today, and the issues of public concern as great, there is quite enough for both Houses to do without one becoming a rival to the other.</p>

Doing so will require all who wish to see progress not to make the best the enemy of the good, and to raise their sights to believe that after a century of argument we have it in our hands to deliver a second Chamber that is more effective, more legitimate and, above all, more representative.</p>

 The other place has a long history and a proud record of providing a check on the powers of Government and no Government can be immune to its challenges. For example, in the relatively short lifetime of this Government, the House of Lords has protected ancient liberties, such as the right to trial by jury, and that is how it should be. A second Chamber should have the confidence and the ability to make Governments think again. But the other place does need to change. The political parties&#146; power of patronage, and with it the risk of abuse, must be removed.

 First, as is pointed out to me by colleagues, Governments bring forward many things that are not in their manifestos, and the electorate cannot refer to them when they vote for a particular party.

Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) said, the European regional constituencies. The Leader of the House likes to present his proposals as a sensible compromise that would strengthen Parliament, but in reality they are a messy compromise that would weaken Parliament. Far from making the Lords more independent, the proposal puts composition in the gift of political parties. Far from strengthening Parliament, it risks the loss of the present benefits of the Lords.

If this Chamber were divided, and that Chamber relatively united, would not that be a recipe for tension that can only weaken the democratic process?

However, without a manifesto and without political parties, on what basis would we be asking people to decide who to vote for? What would be the programme that candidates stand for?

 Let me deal with that point head-on. Our party has had a consistent position on this issue in many of our manifestos, including the last one, the previous one and the one before that. Our position has been that if people read the manifesto, they could vote for us knowing that we would vote for a wholly, substantially or predominately&#151;those are the only three words that were ever used&#151;elected second Chamber. We have had discussions and reached an agreement, and we believe that the only way that we can reflect that in our votes is by voting for an 80 per cent. or 100 per cent. elected second Chamber&#151;a wholly, substantially or predominantly elected second Chamber. Other options, such as a 50:50 Chamber, are clearly not a wholly, substantially or predominantly elected second Chamber. We are therefore going to live up to our manifesto promises; I just hope that the friends of the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)&#151;who all stood on a manifesto that said that they would support a substantially elected House of Lords&#151;will also honour the commitment that they made to their electorate.</p>

 The answer is that this issue does not, of course, come ahead of health, education and housing. However, we do not necessarily need to have people on huge salaries; indeed, we already pay people in the House of Lords. Even the Leader of the House&#146;s proposal would involve far fewer Members in the second Chamber than there are now. That is our proposal too. If the right hon. Gentleman believes, as the Leader of the House does and says, that we need a strong, democratic and legitimate Parliament to hold the Executive, of whatever colour, to account, this is the opportunity to achieve that.</p>

It is entirely silent&#151;according to the copy I have before me&#151;on support for a wholly elected Chamber. Instead, it talks about a &#147;predominantly&#148; elected second Chamber.

The three words that we have used&#151;&#147;substantially&#148;, &#147;predominantly&#148; and &#147;wholly&#148;&#151;have meant that our position has always been to prefer 80 per cent. or 100 per cent.

 The hon. Gentleman began with an impressive appeal to the reformers in the House.

However, he went on to say that the Liberal Democrats would not follow that excellent maxim, because they are bound by their manifesto.

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s position. The six names appended to the amendment are only a selection of elite supporters from the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party and mine. The Order Paper would not have been long enough to include all the supporters of the amendment. The more serious answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is that there was a debate about the issue in the other place, which was led by Lord Strathclyde. An understanding was reached that abolishing the hereditaries without at the same time effecting democratic renewal was not acceptable to the majority in the House of Lords, which comprises a coalition of independents, bishops and other party member peers.</p>

To answer the question of the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), I am insistent and clear that the day that sees the first people elected to the second Chamber is the same day that the hereditaries leave. If they then want to stand for election, they can; and if they want to be nominated through the Appointments Commission to come and contribute as great and good people, they can apply. I am clear on that and I hope that it answers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question.</p>

We also believe that the people elected to the other place should not be paid to do constituency case work or housing cases because they should be doing a different job.

But I share her view that a list system whereby the parties select the names and the voters cannot choose is the worst of all possible worlds.

 I will be, I hope, commendably brief. I want to address only one real issue. It is right to say that there is unanimity about the primacy of this House in the present context, but anyone who thinks that, if the proposed legislation goes through, that primacy will remain, is living in a dream world. The primacy derives absolutely&#151;not just in part&#151;from the fact that we are the elected Chamber, and because of that the other House observes conventions. It therefore follows&#151;it seems a rather simple issue to me&#151;that if we go down the path of producing what, if this takes place at all, will eventually turn into an entirely elected House of Lords, the concept of primacy will disappear. I think that the Government recognise that, and that that is why they have gone for this rather strange compromise position.</p>

Just think of the realities of a political Chamber where the elected Members&#151;whatever percentage there happen to be&#151;time and again find that the unelected Members are swinging the majority away from them. What will happen in such a situation? The more emotive and high-profile the issue, the more likely it will be that the elected Members of the other place, backed by some Members of this House, will demand even more elected Members, and so the process will go on. Once we start down this road, we will eventually arrive at a fully elected House of Lords.</p>

Once the House of Lords is fully elected, what will happen when one party has a majority in this House and another party has a majority in the other House? As politicians, it is ludicrous for us to think that there will not be manifestos for such elections. An election will be a political event, rather than an election to a social club, so there will be manifestos; one House could thus be in political conflict with the other House.</p>

This is not a matter of giving it muscle, because all it has to do is to scrap the conventions and use the Parliament Act to gridlock the House of Commons. An Opposition party in the other House could oppose Bill after Bill to the extent allowed by the Parliament Act. If I had been a Member of the other House back in the Thatcher years, I would have done anything in my power to block some of that Government&#146;s legislation, and it is unreasonable to think that other politicians will not try to do the same. If we go down such a route, we will, at some time&#151;this will be a long time away, and I will be dead and buried when it happens&#151;be stuck in constitutional deadlock. How would we deal with that?

accountable as they should be. We need more transparency, more honesty and more democratic accountability, which is why I want a stronger upper House of Parliament. At the moment, we have a Commons that has lost its powers and an upper House that is something of an historical anachronism, which restrains it in exercising its powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70306-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07030671000002">There is nothing wrong with the present powers of the House of Lords and I would prefer to leave them unchanged. I think that we would find that any debate about those powers would lead to a frustrating inability to achieve any consensus on moving in one direction or the other. I would certainly resist any idea of weakening the existing powers of the upper House, so I am glad that the Government have so far been frustrated in their attempts to impose on the upper House the kind of timetabling of legislation that has done much to weaken the legislative process in this House, for example.</p>

He said, as others have done, that those powers are quite right, but he expressed a fear that if the upper House were elected, its powers would, in some extraordinary way, get stronger. I fail to see that. At present, the Parliament Acts ensure that it has only a delaying power, rather than any kind of veto. As far as I am aware, the Parliament Acts secure that the Commons has the monopoly on Supply. It should be made absolutely clear that only the Commons decides matters of taxation and public expenditure, and that should not be changed.</p>

If, when we have the Government&#146;s Bill, someone were to table an amendment to provide that the upper House should not, in any circumstances, be able to pass a vote of censure on the Government, I would support it. There are all kinds of other conventions with which we are familiar, such as the convention that the upper House should in no circumstances refuse to give a Second Reading to a Bill that formed a major part of a manifesto on which a Government were elected. If anyone could produce a satisfactory legal definition of that doctrine, I would support it. However, I do not believe that the Lords, if it becomes more elected, will be able by pressure to move its powers in the way in which the right hon. Gentleman suggests. The next step that we need to get to in the constitution of the United Kingdom is to persuade their lordships to use more effectively the powers that they already have.</p>

Although Members of the Lords felt strongly, they did not use all their powers to the full because they felt inhibited by the fact that we were elected and they were not and the feeling that that gave us more legitimacy.</p>

I do not believe that that is the case. As the Leader of the House said, it is not a zero-sum game. The powers of the House of Commons are not dependent on, or made greater or less by, our &#147;sharing&#148; them in some way with the upper House. The issue of the powers of the Commons needs to be addressed, and reform of the House of Lords should not be regarded as the alternative to the necessary reform of this place, which should be made more effective in holding the Government to account in the modern world.</p>

 I agree with that, and in subsequent debates on the subject, I hope that we make that point to the Leader of the House. When&#151;or if, on this occasion&#151;we get on with reform of the House of Lords, it will put pressure on the House of Commons to examine its own procedures. We should react to the fears expressed by the right hon. Member for Swansea, West and others by asking ourselves whether the Commons has not allowed itself to be emasculated in recent years. If we envy what we see as a restoration of the House of Lords powers imagined by the creators of the 1911 Act, it should reassure us to think that we will address the issue of our own powers.</p>

However, they should be scrutinised and made more accountable than they are under our current processes. That is, I hope, the most likely outcome of our proceedings.</p>

The period has to be long enough to make sure that those elected are independent, and long enough to prevent them from deciding how to get themselves re-elected for a second term. They should be immune to the Whips, but we have to be careful, because after 12 years, a person&#146;s views may be very different from the views that they held in year one, when they were first elected, and too many mavericks could create difficulties.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). As we are always told, there are strange bedfellows in politics, and like him, I would like a 100 per cent. elected second Chamber. There is a certain irony in the situation that we are discussing. Let me place it on record that I believe that the present incumbents in the House of Lords do an exceptionally good job. They are admired for what they do, and I am reminded of the old adage, &#147;If it&#146;s not broken, don&#146;t fix it.&#148; However, that is not the issue. The issue is that the Labour party said in its manifesto that it would reform the House of Lords, although it did not say how, and that is one of our problems; it has been transfixed to some degree.</p>

That would depend on the second Chamber&#146;s initial terms of reference.

We have not heard very much about it, but how on earth do other countries with two elected Chambers manage? They seem to manage as well as Britain.

It is only the beginning of a very big change&#151;probably the biggest constitutional change in the country for hundreds of years. I am mindful of the fact that this is the eighth year of the 21st century, yet the Lords is based on a feudal system. Like the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe, I am part of a small minority, but that does not matter. What matters is coming to the House to say what we believe; it is for others to come to their own conclusions, or not. I am concerned about the proposal that people should be elected for 15 years. Why can we not have a system in the second Chamber similar to the system of periodic elections to the Commons? Those elections could be held every five years&#151;I am a great believer in fixed terms, but they are not popular with those who are in power. If we wish to try to attract the right people to serve in the second Chamber, offering them a 15-year term is not as satisfactory as offering them a lifetime of service in the second Chamber. In the past, we have not discussed limiting the time that someone spends in the House of Lords&#151;they are there for life. That is wrong, but if we introduce an electoral system, that argument falls by the wayside, because they can be removed by the will of the people.</p>

Whatever we introduce, it will need quite a lot of revision, perhaps over a number of years, before we get it right. It is a tremendously big change. I will not be popular for saying so, but as we are getting rid of the hereditaries in the House of Lords&#151;I assume that we shall do so, and that we will make the upper House a second Chamber&#151;perhaps we should take a look at the monarchy, too. I do not see why the Head of State should have that role just because they belong to a particular family. I would much prefer to have an elected president, because we cannot compartmentalise democracy. We have a democratic House of Commons, but an undemocratic second Chamber and an undemocratic Head of State. We are not a proper democratic republic, and that is not satisfactory.

Some people will be elected, and some will benefit from patronage, so I do not know how such a system would work. If we do not have a Chamber that is 100 per cent. elected we would do better to keep a system of appointments. I do not really believe that, but it would be logical to take that step. It is not satisfactory to have a Chamber that is 50 per cent. or 80 per cent. elected. The only satisfactory number is 100 per cent.

We ought to bear in mind the fact that the British constitution is an extraordinarily complex organism that has developed over a long period. The notion that we can take one piece&#151;the House of Lords&#151;and reform it significantly without second and third-order effects on the rest of the constitution is a dangerous one to adopt. I should have thought that such effects were obvious from the Government&#146;s constitutional reforms in Scotland and Wales, the abolition of the office of the Lord Chancellor, the creation of a supreme court and the Human Rights Act 1998. Individually, each seems to be a good idea, but they have left a trail of toxic waste with which we are grappling and with which we will have to deal in future, as those measures have left behind a number of issues that were not dealt with at the time. If we reform the House of Lords so that it is elected or substantially elected, a trail of toxic waste will come through Central Lobby into the Chamber, and we will have to deal with it for a long time to come. No one, not even someone as wise as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), can predict what the second and third-order effects will be.</p>

It does almost everything that we want it to do, but it does not satisfy the test&#151;apparently, it must do so&#151;of whether or not it is democratic. We have a solution in search of problem. There is not a problem that has to be solved, but people have provided a solution&#151;the second Chamber is a legislative body, although it does not have very much power, so it ought to be elected&#151;and tried to impose it in circumstances in which it is neither necessary nor appropriate to do so.</p>

I agree with the right hon. Member for Swansea, West that the second Chamber will accrue greater power. Even if the conventions under which it operates are put into statute, there are ways around them, and it could screw up the legislative process by using its existing powers. An elected upper House would, quite properly, seek to appropriate more power, because it will argue that it is more legitimate and more reflective of public opinion. On many occasions, it will have the support of the media, because the majority in the Commons is inevitably whipped by the Government.</p>

Most people with an opinion on the subject say that. It is not broke. Statistically, it has not given the Government an easy ride. The number of rebellions, if that is the right term, between 1992 and 1999 was 133. Since then it has exceeded 350. There is widespread agreement that the 1999 reforms were a shot in the arm. We have an invigorated second Chamber, working to scrutinise and hold the Government of the day to account. It is more effective, more legitimate and more representative. Many of the options before us would damage the crucial tenets of the manifesto.</p>

That presumes that an all or partly elected Chamber would, of necessity, be more so. Why? Elections are an essential component of a participative democracy, but they are not the sum total of that democracy. If elected peers took the party Whip and were less prepared to challenge the Executive, would that make them more legitimate? If the turnout for their elections did not break the 30 per cent. barrier, would that make them more legitimate? If a list system prevented a clear positive vote for a single candidate, would that make it more legitimate?</p>

meddling by the Whips under any system involving elections, to the extent that debate and scrutiny might be curtailed, would be too great. One thing is surely clear and agreed&#151;that we do not want in the Lords a replica of the system of Whips and party discipline that we have in the Commons. A fully or partly elected upper House would encourage that. If, for example, a piece of legislation was stalled or even blocked by the Lords, it would be difficult for the Whips. It is in their nature not to tolerate such a situation, knowing that they could intervene with their party affiliates to bring them into line if they so chose. Thus the system of checks and balances would be weakened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70306-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07030671000053">These are only hypothetical questions at this stage, but only in the sense that the bridge has not been crossed. If we were to cross it and the decision was taken and implemented, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, and time consuming to try to reverse it. An all-elected House would present a challenge to our basic system of democracy. The principle of one Member, one constituency would go out of the window, to be replaced by an unpleasant spectacle of rivalry in particular locations between the two Houses. One can imagine that that would be difficult if two people claiming legitimacy in the same area were from different parties, but it might be more difficult if they were from the same party. Even if the geographical boundaries were different, people would still claim legitimacy within a particular area. Legislation proposed by the Executive on a mandate from the Commons could be stalled on a competing mandate from the Lords. Stalemates could ensue and not be broken without back-room deals behind closed doors, away from public view. That is surely not what we want. Far from having increased accountability, we would have less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70306-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07030671000054">A hybrid House would be even worse, with the danger that peers would not only challenge the Commons but challenge each other. Suppose that a vote was forced through on the back of the votes of appointed Members. Elected peers would be justifiably aggrieved. Elected Members might well set up &#147;constituency&#148; offices; unelected Members probably would not. Elected Members, notwithstanding the various systems of election being floated, could talk of &#147;representing their constituents&#148;, or make claims to that effect; unelected Members could not. Elected Members could campaign in constituencies, as they saw them, and speak on local issues, vying for attention with MPs; unelected Members could not. That two-tier system would be the worst of both worlds.</p>

fact it reflected the view that there was no consensus in the House and that none of the options on offer was better than the status quo. We are told that because previous attempts at wholesale reform have ended in compromise or defeat, we have a duty to &#147;finish the job&#148; and that anything less will amount to a failure, but that does not account for the changed circumstances of acceptance of the new Lords in which we find ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70306-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07030671000057">In the same way that a convention that no party has an overall majority has been established and accepted following the 1999 reforms, we need evolution, not revolution. We should of course abolish the remaining hereditary peers and ensure that the appointments commission is statutory and has a codified role, as proposed by the campaign for an effective second Chamber. Those are real and substantive reforms that would preserve the best of what we now have. They would also be entirely consistent with manifesto commitments. The proposals in the White Paper, on the other hand, would not serve anyone&#146;s interests. The test of a good policy is not that it is the one that least dissatisfies the least number of people, which is the most positive argument that has been put forward for many of the proposals. Last year, a Populus poll found that 70 per cent. of people thought that the House of Lords was &#147;doing a good job&#148;. That is a figure that most primary Chambers would die for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70306-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07030671000058">The &#147;elected&#148; options before us are all seemingly simple answers to a complex problem, but there is no simple answer other than reforming the present House of Lords on a limited basis. For all the talk of the popular vote as a means to re-engage the public, there is no clamour as regards any &#147;legitimacy deficit&#148; in the Lords. Nobody mentions it to me on the doorstep; indeed, people are astonished that we do not have better things to do at this time than to be considering this issue. Why on earth it has been brought forward now, I fail to understand. Yes, people are concerned to bring the Executive to account, but that is what checks and balances are for. We do not elect our judges or professors, but they are not illegitimate. The &#147;key principles&#148; set out in the White Paper&#151;that of a balance between parties, Cross-Bench and independent Members, religious representation, racial and gender balance and regional representation&#151;can all be achieved with a system of appointments. That may not be possible, or possible only at the cost of any real choice through a system involving elections.</p>

<notus-date day="6" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>6 Mar 2007 : Column 1440</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70306-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07030677000002">Let me begin my substantive remarks by making a few observations on what I have heard in this debate and on previous occasions. They are non-controversial&#151;some would say commonplace&#151;but none the less lead me to certain conclusions. The first and most obvious is that hon. Members in all parts of the House hold very diverse views and hold them passionately. That means that any Bill to be enacted will be long, controversial and arduous. Next, the House of Lords, as currently constituted, undoubtedly performs the modest role allocated to it extremely efficiently. Next, in the modern world, political authority stems from election and election only, and it is certain that if we had an elected or largely elected second Chamber, it would deem itself much more legitimate than it does now. I feel confident, too, that it would seek to take to itself powers that it currently does not have, or alternatively make more robust use of the powers that it does have. It seems to me that those are non-controversial views that would be shared by most right hon. and hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70306-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07030677000003">From those observations I draw a number of conclusions that have guided my thinking on the matter. If it be the settled will of Parliament that the second Chamber should not possess or exercise greater powers than it has now, then subject to three minor adjustments we would be ill advised to embark upon change. If hon. Members wish the second Chamber to have greater powers or, alternatively put, to make a more robust use of existing powers, then we should support a largely or wholly elected second Chamber. That is the choice that right hon. and hon. Members must make. My own view, as one of those who supports a wholly elected Chamber, is that I do so because I want it to have greater powers or to make more robust use of existing powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="70306-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07030677000004">I recognise that there is an argument in favour of the status quo, and I therefore make three suggestions to those who support that option as to how we can improve the House of Lords as presently constituted. First&#151;I hope that hon. Members will not misunderstand this&#151;the presence of the hereditary peerage in the second Chamber cannot be justified. Whether we get rid of it straight away or phase out the by-election system is a matter for debate, but there can be no argument for the hereditary peerage being Members of the legislature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70306-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07030677000005">Secondly, I agree with the Leader of the House when he speaks about a statutory appointments commission. It is very important that the independence of that board be enshrined in statute and convention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70306-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07030677000006">Thirdly, I want to see a diminution in the powers of party patronage. I therefore suggest that when a party puts forward for nomination to the second Chamber candidates from within that party, it should be required to put forward a number in excess of the places to be allocated to it, so that the appointments commission has an unfettered choice from that list. That would diminish patronage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70306-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07030677000007">I favour a wholly elected Chamber, and I shall briefly advance the reasons for that. Throughout the debate, we have referred to the primacy of the House of Commons. Perhaps we should be more modest and recognise that the concept of the primacy of the House of Commons in our constitution is pretty meaningless. It would be meaningful if we had a genuine separation of powers, but when the Executive are part of the legislature, &#147;the primacy of the House of Commons&#148; is an empty phrase.</p>

As we all know well, those functions are: to scrutinise the Executive; to scrutinise legislation; and to call Governments to account. We know, if we are honest, that we do not do those things well, because the House has become largely the creature of party. As my father wrote in the 1970s, provided that the Executive retain control over their party, they can do what they please. That is not a proper way to govern in a democratic state.</p>

I presume that those with particular areas of expertise will be appointed to that revising Chamber to perform the reform and scrutiny function and amend legislation, thereby using their expertise in the most beneficial way.

When the Leader of the House was Home Secretary, he set up the Special Standing Committee for the Immigration and Asylum Bill, which involved people from the wider community with an interest in the subject in making a difficult piece of legislation more effective and acceptable. That is one of the best examples of the process, on which we should build.

 There is one commanding principle&#151;certainly for me&#151;about the making of laws: those who make the laws should be accountable to those who bear the laws. That theme ran through the Labour party, and has run through most democratic, common law societies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07030677000030">The United States provides an instance of a second chamber that was elected with the thought that it might be less powerful than the House of Representatives. In the telling of that tale, we also learn that what we think we are doing might not be that which comes about. It is difficult to see the United States Senate as subordinate to the House of Representatives. It has taken on a duality of roles and an equality of purpose in the making of laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07030677000031">I rather hope that that will be one of the consequences of an elected second Chamber.

A leader of a party with a majority in the House of Commons has effectively been able to do almost anything, and we have harrumphed that. I have always been a Back Bencher&#151;and for compelling reasons&#151;because I am nervous of the great men on white horses who want to go to war, I am nervous of those with great schemes, and I want to ask the question, &#147;Why?&#148;</p>

Over recent years, however&#151;I have been here for 28 years&#151;I have seen the rise of the Executive almost unstopped. I have watched the parties&#151;good men and women, elected and accountable to whole constituencies, areas and regions&#151;lay themselves down in front of an Executive and ensure by their vote that what may not be a representative opinion prevails. I have heard about the mantra of the manifesto, which is mostly read&#151;only read&#151;by those who write it, from end to end. That is one of the truths. I came long ago to the judgment that a mention in a 78-page manifesto should not make it the compelling document that drives public policy in this country.</p>

One does not have to agree with it, but it is clear that what the Americans have had for 200 years is a second Chamber that is accountable. That is why I believe that excluding the ministerial team from our second Chamber so that no powers of patronage can reach it is an important development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07030677000039">The Leader of the House has suggested that the House of Lords should have 540 Members. Ours is an extraordinary country, if we think about it. With 1,400 Members of Parliament, we should be drowning under elected people. Why not 150 Members? America seems to run a second Chamber with 100.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07030677000040">I am fearful of what might happen if we are not clear about what we want to achieve. I am quite clear about what I want: I want Governments to fight for their business. I want them sometimes to lose their business. That does no harm to the greater entity. We are now living in a world in which the House of Lords is held in higher esteem as it blocks measure after measure from the Government that touches on our liberties and freedoms, and I think it important for us to retain that check.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07030677000041">I know that this is only the beginning of a process, but I profoundly believe that the House of Lords should be 100 per cent. elected. It is true that, as was said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), we shall lose some very distinguished expertise, but are we not capable, as a people, of governing ourselves? Those who feel passionate about the processes of public life will engage in them properly, through election, through pamphleteering, through the ways in which laws are changed. I seek, passionately, a real check on the power of the Executive in this Chamber, for given the nature of human beings and the nature of our own history, I too have reached the conclusion that men and women are driven by patronage and the desire for office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07030677000042">The very function and purpose that sent us here to be representative has increasingly become something that we put to the back of our minds. The history and interests of Scotland, the north-east, the north-west, the midlands and the south-east are in many respects very different. We now have an appointed House of Lords that is essentially an SW1, W14, south-east House&#151;a London House. How can we revitalise our nation? Where are the people who live in the midlands and come down to speak in the House of Lords? By and large, they are the political appointees who have retired from this House.</p>

I want a House whose Members are chosen by their people. That is why I think that something along the lines of the first European electoral areas would be satisfactory, with two Members who are elected &#147;a third and a third&#148; over six years. It is nonsensical for someone to stand for election for 12, 14 or 15 years with no possibility of ever being re-elected. There is no accountability in that.

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), who made a characteristically thought-provoking speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07030677000047">I want to speak about an issue that has arisen time and again today, the primacy of this Chamber. Let me put my cards on the table: I agree that this Chamber should have primacy, but I think it worth exploring what we mean by that. We should ask what is the primacy that we fear we shall lose if we have a predominantly elected second Chamber, what it allows us to do, and what the main function of this Chamber is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07030677000048">A number of those who argue most passionately against an elected second Chamber are those who are often also most passionate about the &#147;majoritarian&#148; system here in the House of Commons. It is no secret that I am not a great fan of our current electoral system, but there is a logic that tells us that if we go along with it and our party wins under first past the post, the role of the majority party is to deliver the Government&#146;s programme for that Parliament. Conversely, the role of the Opposition is to oppose and seek to thwart that programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07030677000049">As I have said, I am not a fan of the current electoral system, but I do not have a particular problem with that arrangement. As a Labour MP, I want my Government to succeed. However, it is not as simple as that, is it? We have another role in this Chamber, and Parliament as a whole has another role: the role of scrutiny, even scrutiny of a Government who are the same colour as us. There are examples of that working quite well&#151;I agree with those who have said the Select Committee system works pretty well&#151;but when it comes to key issues, especially legislative issues, Parliament&#146;s scrutiny role can all too easily come into conflict with our role in delivering or, indeed, opposing a Government&#146;s programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07030677000050">We saw an instance of that last week. It is no particular secret that the Offender Management Bill was somewhat controversial from the point of view of all parties. When Ministers and Whips tried to win around those of us who had one or two reservations, much of their effort consisted of trying to persuade us to exercise our scrutiny role in what they considered to be a better way&#151;to persuade us, in other words, of the arguments in favour of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07030677000051">I do not think I am revealing too many trade secrets if I add that sometimes other arguments are brought to bear. We may be told, &#147;We have made certain concessions on this Bill, and the time has come to back off. Do you really want the Government whom you support to be defeated?&#148;&#151;defeated, that is, in this place. In such circumstances, the issue of loyalty&#151;loyalty to what we believe in, loyalty to our party, loyalty to the overall cause&#151;is tied, and the test becomes whether we follow the party line on a measure. We are told that our responsibility is to support the Government not just when we consider them to be doing the right thing, but when we do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07030677000052">Those pressures apply in opposition as well. In many ways, opposition is the mirror image. I am sure that some Opposition Members thought there were some rather good things in the Offender Management Bill: indeed, I could quote Opposition spokespeople who said many of those things a few months ago. However, there was also a temptation, or a pressure, to take the opportunity to inflict some damage if there was a chance of doing so. That is the role of an Opposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07030677000053">All that is not entirely wrong. We are living in the real world, a world of 24-hour media. The ability of a Government to deliver their programme is important to their credibility, and the ability to inflict damage and, if possible, defeat a Government is important to an Opposition who wish to build up their own credibility; but we are kidding ourselves if we think that that does not compromise our ability to scrutinise. We can react to that in different ways, and the process often conspires to push us into the role of either loyalist or rebel: both are entirely possible, and in a sense quite easy, in this Chamber. However, I believe that if we are to do our job as parliamentarians we should not perform one or other of those roles, because we must be both part of the legislature&#151;we are representatives of our parties&#151;and we must scrutinise as well. Because of the pressures on us, we cannot do that properly and effectively on our own. Primacy means that the House of Commons must have the final say&#151;I agree with that&#151;but it also means that we must allow ourselves to be challenged, and not challenged only on those things that it is convenient or okay for us to be challenged on, but on those things that it is difficult for us to be challenged on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07030677000054">Therefore, the debate about the role and composition of the second Chamber is not to do with the relationship of one House to the other House. In my view, it is about the relationship between Parliament and the legislature on the one hand and the Executive on the other. Some say that if we were to accept that there is a need for revision and a democratic second Chamber&#151;one that claims democratic legitimacy&#151;that would create a problem for us. I do not agree; I think that to hold that view is to cling to a comfort blanket, and that does not reflect the real world. I take the opposite view: if we believe that a second Chamber must have the important constitutional role of scrutiny and revision, it must have a democratic legitimacy, although a different one&#151;it needs term limits and a different method of election and a system that minimises, and probably eliminates, the chances of any party having an overall majority. If we were to have all of that, that would give us the chance of having a Chamber with a different composition and, hopefully, greater independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07030677000055">I also think that there is a role for a minority of non-elected people, to retain some of the expertise that exists in the current House of Lords. In terms of an elected element, I say to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House that I can live with a list system, but I do not think that we will get the independence that is wished for if it is a closed list system&#151;or, indeed, just a partly open list system. An open list system is the route that should be chosen&#151;or something similar that achieves that end.</p>

who do not want to stand for election but who have something distinctive to contribute&#151;and who say that the way to achieve that is by appointment and only by appointment, I say that if the second Chamber is to have the role proposed for it, it must be able to say something important to the people outside Parliament. In the last Parliament when Baroness Morris was a Member of this House, she gave a powerful speech in favour of a predominantly elected second Chamber. She said that it had to ring true with the people out there, and I agree. One of the things that will allow it to ring true is if it offers opportunities for anybody in this country who wants to have a role in the process of scrutiny, a role in the process of revision and a role in our democratic process, but who wants to have different roles from those entailed by standing for election to this House. Such people can put themselves forward to an appointments commission&#151;and perhaps they can get appointed as a result of that. However, they should also have the right to stand for election and to say to the people in their region&#151;or whatever the boundary is&#151;that they want to perform those roles. If that were the case, that would be a part of what would make that second Chamber legitimate, and that would also add to its role of helping Members of this House to scrutinise legislation and to provide a check on the Executive. It would also be a stimulus to this House to do its job better and give greater clarity to the roles of Parliament and the Executive.</p>

 May I make it clear at the outset of my speech that my preferred option is a 100 per cent. elected Chamber? I used to believe in the predominantly elected option, which I defined as about 80 per cent. or 70 per cent. elected, until I attended a public meeting, and having stated that I wanted that little headroom for the great and the good who would not stand for election, somebody in the audience asked me to name them, and I could not. I therefore decided that 100 per cent. was the proper proportion. However, like the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), I am fairly certain that that will not be the outcome, and I will therefore happily accept a lower percentage of elected Members than 100 per cent.</p>

Therefore, I have a slightly different view from that of some of my colleagues, who might feel bound not to vote for a lower percentage. However, they are doing a very good job of trying to persuade me, and at the end of tomorrow night, having listened to the debate, I shall take my own counsel and decide what I should do.</p>

Several Members have tonight used the old adage, &#147;If it ain&#146;t broke, don&#146;t fix it&#148;. It is seductive to think of the House of Lords as somewhere where diligent scrutiny work is done and wonderful debates are held and to believe that it is best left alone, but to think that is to make a very great mistake, because the House of Lords is fundamentally broken. It is the lack of legitimacy, which many Members have referred to, that makes it broken. For anybody who has sat in the other place and experienced hours and hours of work in Committee&#151;with, I have to say, greater diligence than I have ever experienced in a Committee in this place&#151;and on Third Reading and Report, it is sad to then see that work cavalierly tossed aside by a House that has rushed in to vote with no knowledge of what they have done, which is what happens.

That might work in small countries, but I do not think that it can work in large countries. Even with proportional representation and modernisation, it would not be possible to arrive at a situation where that could be made to work. In parenthesis, I should say that in my judgment the experience of the Scottish Parliament highlights that, because what happens there is that the elections under PR result in a negotiation at the beginning and there is then created through partnership the same sort of elected dictatorship as we get in this place with the first-past-the-post system.</p>

Several Members have said that we should look at function before form. It is a good architectural principle that function dictates form, but therein is a dead-end and a trap that must be avoided at all costs. This is the fourth or fifth major debate on House of Lords reform in which I have taken part in one or other of the Houses. I used to think that function should come first and form should follow, but I have come to understand that that is the way of no progress. Our start point, rather, should be to say, &#147;We are broadly content with the work that the second Chamber does today, and we should therefore allow its function to evolve once we have given it its form.&#148; In looking at that form, I suggest that we need to look at its strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70306-0014.htm_para28"><a name="07030677000068">There are strengths in the other place. One is that no one party has overall control, which is important. The light whipping&#151;one cannot whip someone whom one cannot get rid of&#151;is also important and leads to independence. Peers have no constituencies and therefore have a regional or national view, and they can devote a lot of time to legislation. The most striking difference between our two Houses is that in the other place, all the work centres around the Chamber. Peers get paid only if they sit; if they are in the House but they do not sit, they do not get paid. Here, much of our work is constituency-based, outside the Chamber.</p>

When the hereditaries were there, we had innumerable debates on salmon fishing, rather than on the common fisheries policy. The current composition is heavily weighted towards Oxbridge, former Members of this House and lawyers. Election would certainly help there. The other place is also heavily weighted towards older Members, if I might put it that way. A single long term of 12 years, with a composition renewable by one third every four years, would give a system that best mirrors the House&#146;s current strengths. Such a system is most likely to deliver a House that will do the work that we require of it, and in a legitimate way that will enable it to stand up to this House to a certain extent.</p>

However, I question, at the very least, the third reason given. It is ridiculous to expect a reformed legislative House to have its views rejected as often and in as off-handed a manner as we have been wont to do. Although this House may rightfully expect to prevail on major manifesto commitments, we must expect to give way more often; otherwise, what on earth is the point of reform? So I say, primacy, yes, but supremacy, no. We want a strong Parliament, which requires a strong House of Lords.</p>

There are many things that I have not attempted to address this evening, such as the size of the constituencies and the manner in which we would hold such elections; they can wait for what the Leader of the House described as the sunny uplands&#151;if we ever get there. The practical point is that Members of the other place have a genuine self-interest in this regard. If we tell them that they are all safe and we provide for them to resign, quite a lot of them will; they will retire gracefully. If we feed in one third over a 12-year period, we will end up with a slightly smaller House&#151;certainly a lot smaller than the one that I was in.

In the 19th century, this House had to introduce legislation to protect children from being sent to work at the age of 10 or 12. We should be protecting the ancient, the elderly and the decrepit, who should not be forced still to work at the age of 85 and 93. We should be enabling them to retire or to resign.

We already have a hybrid Chamber, with people who are elected to it, some who are there by appointment and the bishops, who are halfway between election and appointment, because each diocese has a process to determine support for them to be put in their posts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70306-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07030677000084">There are only 91 hereditary peers at present, and a by-election is being held. Forty-seven people could stand&#151;they also form the electorate&#151;and 43 of them are standing. All of those people are busily going around trying to persuade others to vote for them&#151;and sometimes trying to persuade themselves to vote for themselves. It is hoped that some people will get more than their own vote. In any event, it is an extraordinary process. The last time we had a by-election for a hereditary peer, the Viscount Montgomery of Alamein&#151;who is in favour of elections for the second Chamber&#151;defeated an earl after a fifth redistribution of the votes. It is the only election in the British electoral system that uses the alternative vote.</p>

It is important that when we do have elections, we do not have the whole second Chamber elected in one go, because that runs the danger of having the two Chambers at loggerheads because they have different mandates, both clearly established by election.

They should be told that their job is to advise and consent.

give evidence to royal commissions. I was the first so-called ordinary person to give evidence to the Wakeham commission on reform of the House of Lords in 1999. I am glad to say that arriving here has not changed my fundamental attitude to the way in which the upper House should be composed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70306-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07030677000139">As other hon. Members have said, Britain is an unusual country. It is a multinational state built up over 500 years from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland and, in the past 50 years, it has become a multi-ethnic country. At the moment, 5 per cent. of the population belongs to a non-white minority community, and the proportion is much higher among young people. Yet this diversity is hardly reflected in the House of Lords. Why is it that only one parliamentarian in five is a woman? Is it right that ethnic minorities are under-represented? Is it right that 26 places are reserved for Anglican bishops and that we retain 92 hereditaries? As my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) said, the average age of a peer is rising 70.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70306-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07030677000140">Although we have no bishops and peers, the position in this Chamber is not much better. So, with institutions that look like this, is it any wonder that only 37 per cent. of young people voted in the last general election? These inadequacies in our reflectiveness of the general population represent a deeper problem&#151;an inability so far to make sense of our new British identity. To do this, we need not only laws relating to individual citizenship, rights and responsibilities; we need institutions that reflect our diversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70306-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07030677000141">Unless we happen to be a bishop or an hereditary peer, the only part of our identity that counts for political purposes in this country is the geographical constituency within which we live. The House of Commons represents us by providing representation for the community in which we live&#151;rural, urban, industrial or by the sea. But for most people, that is only part of their definition of themselves. Other aspects of our lives such as gender and race matter too. Arguably, economic and social changes mean that the geographical communities are becoming less significant over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70306-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07030677000142">I believe that House of Lords reform represents an opportunity to right some of these wrongs. We could establish a second Chamber that complements the Commons and the make-up of which suits its revising functions and focus on individual rights. I am therefore sympathetic to those who argue for option 1&#151;a reformed appointed Chamber which represents all regions, classes, faith communities, the voluntary sector, ethnic minorities, gender balance and, I would add, young people. However, I cannot agree that the Members should be appointed. It is a basic principle in a country that claims to be democratic that those who legislate should be elected by those for whom they legislate. That consideration overrides all others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70306-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07030677000143">My preference, therefore, would be for elections by colleges and to allow people to choose for themselves which they belong to, in a similar way to the system in the United States, where people can register as a Republican or a Democrat. So if a large number of people wished to define themselves as women, they could vote in that college, whereas if they wanted to represent themselves as members of the Church of England, they could vote in that college.</p>

been called indirect elections. I do not believe that they are as impractical as has been suggested. It is the system, roughly speaking, that is used for the Irish Senate. As far as I understand it, it is a system that we designed and that the Irish have used for 90 years. However, it is not on the agenda today. If nothing succeeds in getting through, I hope that we can look again at so-called indirect elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70306-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07030677000145">As that option is not on the table, therefore, I shall vote for a predominantly elected Chamber&#151;options 4, 5 and 6; 50 per cent. elected, 60 per cent. elected and 80 per cent. elected. I shall not vote for 100 per cent. elected because I am not confident that the system of elections or the political parties will be capable of producing the diversity that we need in our legislature. Appointments are needed to make up the deficits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70306-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07030677000146">I also agree with the amendment that the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) tabled, which unfortunately we will not be voting on. It suggests that either none or all the major belief systems should be represented. For example, if we went down the route of electing 80 per cent. of the Members, the Anglican bishops would take a fifth of the share of appointments. I do not think that it is right, as some people have suggested, to say that no longer reserving 26 places for the Anglican bishops necessarily means the disestablishment of the Church of England. Most of the bishops to whom I have spoken admit that they do not have time to do justice to the role. It is objectionable to many of us, and even to many who belong to the Church of England, that the sexism in the Church is brought into the legislative process here for the whole nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70306-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07030677000147">It would be perfectly reasonable for us to require the Church of England to elect its representatives as well and for us to look more widely at the other faith communities having elections.

 In considering this debate and listening to the many speeches that we have heard today, I am still no further forward as to exactly what the House of Lords is expected to do, what functions it performs, whether it represents value for money and whether it is necessary at all. We live cheek by jowl with our be-ermined Friends, who exist a few hundred metres along the corridor. We refer to the House of Lords as the other place, but to me it is totally other-worldly. Look who inhabits that place.

difference, to suggest a separateness. This belief that we should expect our betters to help us legislate suggests a throwback to a pre-democratic age, and it should have no place in a modern 21st-century legislature. For what it is worth, I believe that the House of Lords is an unnecessary, underworked, overpriced institution whose standing in the eyes of the public, contrary to what has been said here, has never been lower as a result of how the public have observed the House of Lords in the past year through the cash for peerages scandal.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning that poll. The reason why the public responded to the question as they did is because of the comparison with this place. Never before has the House of Commons been so unpopular, given the daily kicking we receive from the media and the way that people are encouraged to think about us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70306-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07030677000152">If we asked ordinary members of the public to give their predominant image of the House of Lords, they would describe two things. The first would be some belligerent old soul gently napping on those comfortable red Benches while listening to an interminable speech by a fellow octogenarian. A more sinister image would be of the House as a repository for one of the millionaire chums of one of the main parties in the cash for peerage and honours scandal. I am certain that the ordinary public do not view the House of Lords with any great affection; they do not even know what its functions are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70306-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07030677000153">We can test that statement. Is it not curious that among all the electoral options before us no one has suggested a stand-alone election to the House of Lords? The election has to be combined with another election. Let us imagine the excitement on Lords election day. The hustings would be packed to the gunwales. There would be no holding back. Everybody would be rushing off to the ballot box to re-elect the Baroness Billington of Boxington, or whatever, to reward that noble peeress for the fine work she had done while gently napping on the red Benches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70306-0016.htm_para19"><a name="07030677000154">The major context for this debate on reform of the House of Lords is the cash for honours scandal. Never before has the membership of the House of Lords been under such scrutiny from the public. More importantly, never before has the case for appointment by Prime Minister and by party been so undermined and so tarnished. In its opinion poll, the Hansard Society found that only 6 per cent. of the public favoured a fully appointed House. That shows the public&#146;s grave concerns about the potential abuse of appointment and about political parties stuffing the place full of their cronies and funders. The very suggestion that someone could sit in our legislature on the basis of having given a significant amount of money to a political party is as appalling as it is unacceptable. The defence we hear from No. 10 and others is that those people are in the House of Lords solely as party political appointees, which completely destroys any argument for political appointment.</p>

At a time when we are holding back public sector pay, when nurses cannot even have an inflation-rate pay rise and our salaries and expenses are under such scrutiny, perhaps we should suggest that our friends in the press and the public have a look at what is going along at the other end of the building.</p>

I asked the House of Commons Library for a breakdown of the peers&#146; working day but it could not give me that information, so I put together my own study. I made a list of all the peers and selected all those who had taken the name of a place in Scotland as part of their title&#151;we all know how much peers like their titles. I found 36 such peers and checked them up on the excellent TheyWorkForYou.com website. In the past year, 24 of them had made fewer than five contributions. More staggering and more appallingly, 10 of them had made no contribution at all. There is something quite out of kilter with the view of an over-worked peer even in what I admit was an unscientific, unreliable study. None the less, I believe it is quite representative of what actually goes on down there.</p>

We live in a multicultural, multi-faith society. Modern Britain is a society with great diversity of religions and non-religious beliefs, and continuing to privilege one denomination over others is preposterous and anti-democratic.

We have seen how badly wrong that system has gone over the past few years. There can be no place in our legislature for the party funders or the cronies.

The answer is a day, perhaps only for about six hours. At the end of that time, some amendments have not even been reached or debated, let alone voted on. They go to the House of Lords and, on occasions, Report can take as many as 11 days. That tells us an awful lot about what we need to do in the House of Commons.</p>

Eventually, after a closure motion was successful, the Off-Road Vehicles (Registration) Bill was given a Second Reading, but why did a Minister spend one hour and 14 minutes discussing a Bill that the Government had not moved against on Second Reading?

I can tell anyone wondering what happens next exactly what does happen. In every election in France, the candidate stands and alongside that candidate is a suppliant or substitute who takes the place of any member who becomes a Minister.

 We should always look outside our own country and the hon. Gentleman is right in what he says. However, it seems to me that the fundamental weakness of the French system is that Ministers have no electors to whom they are directly accountable, so there is no one whom they have to see every week and deal with on a day-to-day basis.

 I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman says, but the fact remains that Ministers are still accountable to the representatives in the assembly, who are, in fact, elected at the same time. A substitute is there, as I said, to take the place of someone becoming a Minister. He comes from the constituency to which that Minister belonged. We should reflect very carefully on the merits of that system. We hear new Labour claims that it wants to reform this, that and the other, so let us have a look at that particular reform.

I am very concerned about many aspects of the situation. People have spoken a lot about the expertise of the other place, but one of the things that I value about hon. Members is the different life experience that those people who have fought elections bring to this job. From miners to personal injury lawyers, there is a wide range of experience. Many Members of this House are as expert in their fields as the much-vaunted experts in another place. The claim that we require appointment to achieve expertise is not well stated.</p>

A person applying for a public appointment must admit to membership of a political party, just after admitting to any convictions. The number of people admitting to membership of a political party who have received a public appointment has been going down year on year because of that fact. Being a member of a political party is something of which we should feel proud. It was a long time before I joined a political party, because I was right 100 per cent. of the time, and the Labour party was right only most of the time, and that is the story of this debate. The Leader of the House is absolutely right that in debates on reform, we have consistently said that we wanted an answer that was 100 per cent. right; we want the perfect answer, and we have made the perfect the enemy of the good.</p>

His argument was, &#147;Because I want to keep my ball perfect, I&#146;m not going to vote for an arrangement that will get a result.&#148; I beg him to speak to his colleagues and think again before the vote tomorrow, because we have to get a result this time.</p>

Let us consider what has in the past led the other place to challenge this place. It has challenged the Commons when it disagrees with us. We should be completely clear about the occasions when the other House has voted against the Commons. It is obvious that when this House is run by Labour, the other place votes against us, and when the House of Commons is run by the Conservative party, it does not.

I think that the other place felt that it would be a bit embarrassing to defeat us too much after that landslide, so it lay low. To claim that the increased number of defeats of the Labour Government since then reflects the fact that Members of the other place feel more legitimate is absolute nonsense. It has nothing to do with that; it is to do with the fact that the Lords are getting back into their old habits, and nothing else.</p>

 I have no doubt that the hon. Lady is right about her statistics, but she ignores the central point, which is that it is only in the past 10 years that the House of Lords has been reformed so that there is no party majority. In the old days, there was a big Tory majority, so Labour Governments had a harder time, but that is not the position now, and everybody agrees, as far as is possible, that there will never again be a single-party majority in the Lords.</p>

 There is not the kind of majority that there used to be, but there is still a predominance that does not reflect the situation in the country, as it was at the last election. Let us consider the habits of the other place when the Conservatives are in government. The largest number of defeats of a Conservative Government by the House of Lords took place in the dog days of the Thatcher Government, when there were 82 in total in a Parliament. The fewest was 26 in the 1970 to 1974 Parliament. There is no evidence to support the suggestion that elections by themselves somehow encourage the other place to disagree.</p>

The excellent work of Dr. Meg Russell makes it quite clear that in many countries with a wholly or predominantly elected second Chamber, the second Chamber is effectively subordinate to the main Chamber. It is true that most of those countries have written constitutions, and, as we all know, Britain is an exception in that regard, so there are not many places that have constitutional arrangements that we can compare with ours. So far, we have managed to achieve the things that countries with written constitutions have achieved, and I see no reason why we should not do so in relation to reform.</p>

I do not believe that the only constituencies around which we organise our lives are those on the ground. Our relationships and our attitudes are important factors and, for the first time, new technology makes it possible to envisage alternatives to geographical constituencies.

The people of this country are the best people to decide who should make its laws and who should hold the Government to account. There is no better authority than the people of this country, and if we start to undermine their authority and suggest that there are alternatives to it, we do not deserve the power that they give us in Parliament. We have a responsibility to make a decision, and to make a democratic second Chamber.

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart). I missed her earlier sedentary intervention, and she did not repeat it in her speech. She demonstrated that everyone, whatever their perspective, can get into contortions and adopt tortured logic to defend their position. She concluded that the people are in the best position to determine the resolution of such issues, and she made a cry for democracy to speak out. I entirely agree, but as I shall explain, we are asking the wrong question. I am not hectored in the streets by constituents who want to know what I am going to do about Lords reform. They do want to know, however, what we can do as their elected representatives to hold the Government to account. That is a different question and, as we are starting from a different position, reform of the second Chamber, which must be dealt with at some point, is a long way down the list.

Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). If we want to challenge the authority of this House, we should settle that first.

I heard what was said by the hon.

In an excellent paper entitled &#147;A House Built of Straw&#148;, Lord Norton of Louth points out that the White Paper offers no definition of democracy, or any distinction between what is democracy and what is a modern democracy. Quite why &#147;modern&#148;&#151;according to the Leader of the House&#151;means 50 per cent. elected rather than 100 per cent. elected, or 80 per cent. elected as advocated by my right hon.

If we vote for an elected element, we will end up with senators who claim a democratic mandate. If such senators have single terms once elected, they will hardly be more accountable.

That arrangement has been subverted. Today&#146;s Prime Minister is immeasurably more powerful than the monarchy that was overthrown by Parliament in the civil war. Charles I never exercised a fraction of the power over Supply and legislation that is enjoyed by modern Prime Ministers. Even when Lord Hailsham coined the phrase &#147;elective dictatorship&#148;, he can never have imagined a House of Commons as cowed by the Executive as the House of Commons today.</p>

That grip is reinforced by whipping on almost every matter, by the promise of high office in return for obedience&#151;an interest that we do not have to include in the Register of Members&#146; Interests&#151;and by the threat of deselection under the terms now applied by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. As has been pointed out, we are little more than an electoral college for the office of Prime Minister. Whatever happened to the ideal that we should sit here in accordance with the Burkean tradition as representatives of our constituents exercising our judgment, rather than as delegates of centralised political parties? Ironically, if we implement a system for elections to the upper House, we will be implementing the same vice-like control of party over entry into that upper House. An appointed House can deal with that only through a proper appointments commission, and not by party-driven elections.</p>

It is said that the primacy of this Chamber is based on, derived from and exclusively dependent on the fact only of our being the elected House. I do not agree with that. There are all sorts of bases of the primacy of this House, and that argument ought to be strongly and repeatedly asserted. The reality is that the Commons is the source of the Government of this country. The Commons is the body that controls Supply. The Commons is the organisation that exclusively has the power to tax and to spend. The Commons is the body that has the final say on legislation. The Commons decides both its own powers and those of the other House.

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70306-0020.htm_para1"><a name="07030686000046">Why is a second Chamber necessary? The argument in the White Paper, which my hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) repeated, was simply to do with the size and complexity of the task that faces us. I am afraid that I am not quite convinced by that argument. It would imply, for example, that we should look for a second Chamber for the European Parliament&#151;a proposition that would chill the blood of most hon. Members and most citizens of the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70306-0020.htm_para2"><a name="07030686000047">The real reasons why we need a second Chamber come down to two. One is the need for revision and the other is the need for a political check and balance. I have to say that the role of a revising Chamber by itself is not quite enough, if by &#147;revising Chamber&#148; one means a Chamber of suggestions, which can improve legislation but without challenging the underlying policy. That strikes me as a council of state function, and if we want the Chamber to have such a function and be made up of experts, the best way to deal with that is the way the French do it. They have competitive examinations to decide who should sit in that body. It is a purely expert function, not the sort of function that the House of Lords has been carrying out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70306-0020.htm_para3"><a name="07030686000048">The present structure of the House of Lords&#151;a Chamber based on patronage&#151;does not seem to me to be one that can carry out such a function very well. The expertise in the House of Lords is patchy. I sat on the Committee that considered the Companies Bill. It struck me that, although there are many renowned lawyers and business people in the House of Lords, the great experts in company law in this country&#151;with one exception, who studied company law and researched it with great distinction until the 1960s&#151;do not sit in the House of Lords. If we want a Chamber based on expertise, we have to look elsewhere for the experts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70306-0020.htm_para4"><a name="07030686000049">The fundamental question is: why those experts, not other experts? Why do we have the experts in the House of Lords whom we have? The answer to that is patronage rather than inherent ability.</p>

sort of centralised patronage? Why could we not have employers, trade unions, religious bodies, the professions, students and so on each electing their own Members to the second Chamber, thereby ensuring diversity and expertise, and changing the franchise so that the second Chamber is so different from this place that it will not be a threat?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is suggesting an election system, but with functional rather than geographical constituencies. The big question then is how we make sure that we do not leave people out. A lot of the population would be covered by such constituencies, but not people who do not fit into those particular groups. The employment structure of the country is changing rapidly, so it is difficult to define what those occupational groups would be. In the end, the easiest way to run a democracy is on a geographical basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70306-0020.htm_para5"><a name="07030686000052">I want to come to the fundamental reason why we should have a second Chamber. It is to be a political check and balance, not just to represent regional and local interests, although the point about the present second Chamber being fundamentally a London-based Chamber has been made several times and very well. The second Chamber should be a check in a legislative process that often operates far too quickly. We legislate at great speed. In the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 and various terrorism Bills we have approached a knee-jerk democracy. The problem with that is that the population of the country needs time to react.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70306-0020.htm_para6"><a name="07030686000053">If we are to have any public influence on the political system, the public need time. Most people most of the time pay little attention to politics. Often they do not realise that their fundamental interests and rights may be in danger, so they need time to organise&#151;to come together to put pressure on their rulers. For that to happen, we need the checks and balances provided by a second Chamber whose job is to delay things, to get in the way and to cause creative tension in the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70306-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07030686000054">If we are to have a body with power to block, even for a short time&#151;a year or so&#151;how does that body choose which Bills to block and which to let through? How does it choose to block the Hunting Bill but not the Identity Cards Bill? If a body of people is to have that important power and choice, the only way it can legitimately exercise it is if it is elected. In a constitutional system, as the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) said, there will be other people&#151;namely, constitutional judges&#151;with the power to make Parliament think again, but in our system, we do not have that option at present. All we have is the second Chamber&#146;s power of delay. Any Chamber that has the power of delay, to allow the population to organise itself into opposition, must be elected; it cannot exist simply by power of patronage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70306-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07030686000055">On the propositions before the House, my position logically leads to my voting for 100 per cent. election, so why should I vote for anything else&#151;apart from the fact that my party wants me to? I am prepared to put up with 80:20, because in a House with 80 per cent. elected, 20 per cent. selected, the likelihood that a proposition would go through because of the votes of the 20 per cent. is quite low. It would be possible for such a House to adopt a procedure that allowed it to think again if that were to be the case. In addition, 80:20 would give a House with a profoundly democratic culture&#151;the 20 per cent. would be exceptional.</p>

I fully understand the arguments for voting for any proposal that introduces some elected element, but the problem with the 60:40 proposal is the high risk that the votes of the 40 per cent. would determine the question. The internal culture of such a House would not necessarily be a culture of democracy, so for me 60:40 is a step too far at this stage. The 50:50 proposal would in no way lead to a predominantly democratic House.</p>

The 1997 Labour manifesto promised to make the other place more democratic and representative. After removing most of the hereditary peers in 1999, completing the process of reform has slipped down the agenda&#151;despite the subject being mentioned in no fewer than seven Queen&#146;s Speeches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70306-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07030686000072">It is not just procrastination; there has been a serious lack of direction. The 2001 Labour manifesto promised a more &#147;democratic&#148; upper House. However, four years later in the 2005 manifesto, the word &#147;democratic&#148; had disappeared and reference was made instead to a more &#147;modern and effective&#148; House. That change is hardly surprising, given that the Prime Minister voted for a wholly appointed House of Lords in 2003, saying that a hybrid of the two options was &#147;wrong&#148; and &#147;will not work&#148;.</p>

Given that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is likely to be the next Prime Minister, perhaps the deputy Leader of the House will enlighten us about whether the Chancellor will use the Parliament Act, if necessary.</p>

The proposal that 50 per cent. of the other place should be elected on a list system means that party patronage will continue when determining who ranks where on the list. That is appointment by any other name. Add to that the 30 per cent. who would be directly appointed by the political parties and we would have an upper House that was effectively 80 per cent. appointed. So much for lessening the influence of the party machinery and ushering in greater democracy.</p>

At least three official Opposition Members called for a fully elected second Chamber. The hon. Members for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) and for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) argued for not changing the House of Lords at all. At least they were being true to their principles of conservatism, although I wondered whether some filial loyalty had crept in with the hon. Member for North Essex and thought that he had perhaps been listening to someone along the corridor. As I listened to his speech, I was reminded of Mark Twain&#151;or was it Samuel Johnson?&#151;who said that at 16 he thought that his father was stupid, but in the intervening period&#151;four years in the hon. Member&#146;s case&#151;he was surprised by how much the old man had learned. I make no criticism of the hon. Member for North Essex for changing his mind&#151;that would be more than my job is worth&#151;and many hon.

 On the 15-year term, does my hon.

 The debate is about whether a repeat election would challenge the primacy of the House of Commons and give Members of the other place a legitimacy that went beyond what the Chamber wanted to give them, and that was what the royal commission considered. That was the key reason Lord Wakeham and his colleagues proposed a single term, with a quarantine period at the end to deter anyone from using membership of the second Chamber as a platform to campaign to become a Member of Parliament.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on an important subject, and to the Minister for Industry and the Regions for coming to the Chamber to reply. I know that there is a limit to what she can say because of the nature and timing of the Ofcom consultation, so we have agreed it will not cause a problem if I stray over the usual 15-minute limit on Back-Bench contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70306-0021.htm_para12"><a name="07030686000108">My purpose is to alert Parliament, all users of radio mikes and the general public to a real and present danger&#151;I believe that Ofcom is now aware of it&#151;caused by Ofcom&#146;s proposal to auction the spectrum, which has been freed up by the move from analogue to digital terrestrial television. Until recently, that was regarded as an exclusively good thing, enabling a whole range of new uses for one of the most valuable commodities of the modern world&#151;the radio magnetic spectrum. It has become apparent, however, that there is a potential casualty&#151;the radio or wireless microphone. It may not sound serious at first blush, but closer examination shows that it could be a significant problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), who chairs the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, shares my concerns. Given my chairmanship of the Trade and Industry Committee, that means that the Chairmen of both Committees to which Ofcom is accountable in the House are worried about the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70306-0021.htm_para13"><a name="07030686000109">For the technically minded, when I use the phrase, &#147;radio mike&#148;, I may be referring to a range of crucial wireless gadgets such as wireless in-ear monitor systems, wireless talkback systems and wireless instrument systems. There is even a Downing street petition on the subject with about 6,000 signatures, including that of Gillian Lynne, who is perhaps the most distinguished choreographer in the world and the genius behind &#147;Cats&#148; and many other theatrical triumphs. I hope that the petition will attract many more signatures, although they may not reach road pricing levels. Ofcom is highly regarded, and rightly so, but it is only beginning to understand how serious the issue is and how incomplete its initial understanding of it was. That is not intended as a criticism, as it is a highly technical subject involving a plethora of firms, organisations and individuals. Indeed, despite having immersed myself in it for several days, I am apprehensive lest I make a serious gaffe in my brief remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70306-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07030686000110">I could have entitled the debate, &#147;The implications of Ofcom&#146;s actions and the threat to the use of interleaved spectrum by the programme-making and special events sector&#148;, but I would lose my audience very quickly. That may be why the issue has taken so long to gain traction. Unless&#151;and I think that it may be the case&#151;there is substantial change to Ofcom&#146;s proposals, we run the serious risk that some very bad things will happen. I must declare an interest: I am a passionate fan of musical theatre, and I am delighted that my son is studying at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art on a stage management and technical theatre course. His account of the gloom among his professional tutors is one reason why I wished to speak on the subject.</p>

The use of radio mikes to achieve the necessary volume and co-ordinate the stage crew is essential, so it would be goodbye to &#147;Phantom of the Opera&#148;, &#147;The Lion King&#148;, &#147;Evita&#148;, &#147;Spamalot&#148;, &#147;Porgy and Bess&#148; and the rest, as they would have to close.

 There are some arguments on the other side. I shall come to that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70306-0021.htm_para17"><a name="07030686000115">There would be an end to all UK film making, including most television drama&#151;they all use radio mikes now, not the old boom mikes. Think of &#147;The West Wing&#148;, with its long continuous shots in corridors and offices. That is what audiences expect, and radio mikes are needed to do it. Lord Puttnam&#151;David Puttnam&#151;told me:</p>
<a name="70306-0021.htm_brev5"><a name="07030686000177"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In the past decade the film and television industry has moved to a point at which virtually all sound recording is now down to using wireless technology.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="70306-0021.htm_para18"><a name="07030686000116">So no radio mikes means that no more British triumphs, like &#147;The Queen&#148;, will be made in Britain and, by the way, no Bollywood extravaganzas will be filmed at British locations, either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="70306-0021.htm_para19"><a name="07030686000117">TV news gathering would also grind to a halt. All outside broadcasts now depend on radio mikes and spectrum for the cameras to transmit footage back to the outside broadcast van. One cannot have trailing cables at scenes of terrorist outrages like 7/7, and one cannot have single-handed film crews interviewing people, including MPs, if they have to hold a furry mike in front of the interviewee as well as operate the camera. ITV told me:</p>

Finally, perhaps my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) might never have become Leader of the official Opposition without a radio mike.

It represents over 100,000 professionals who belong to organisations such as Equity, the Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union, SOLT&#151;the Society of London Theatres, the Association of Motion Picture Sound, and the Musicians Union. It relies very largely on the unused spectrum that interleaves between existing analogue TV broadcasts, to enable the use of radio microphones.</p>

Each channel is 8 MHz wide, enough for eight radio mikes&#151;in some circumstances, up to 16. The only UK channel dedicated to radio mikes is Channel 69, so when more than eight systems are needed in one location, Joint Frequency Management Group&#151;JFMG&#151;allocates other channels as required.

I recently went to a drama school musical production that used about 14 channels, while a west end production will use four or five times as many. Responding to public demand, there is a growing trend in live entertainment towards much larger live events, such as Live 8, which require very significant frequency capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="70306-0021.htm_para28"><a name="07030686000128">Following digital switchover, in each region some channels will be cleared and some re-used to allow expanded digital television coverage. There will be new interleaved spectrum, but at different frequencies from the current interleaved spectrum, demanding massive new investment by everyone using radio mikes even if they can access the spectrum. Crucially, Ofcom proposes to auction this new interleaved spectrum. Bizarrely, it said in a letter to me:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="70306-0021.htm_para30"><a name="07030686000130">However, there is no single &#147;commercially viable industry&#148;&#151;there is a massively disparate community making much more extensive use of the spectrum, often ingeniously, than Ofcom realises. Its offer of free access to the new spectrum to the end of 2012 showed a worrying lack of understanding of the sector, its use of the spectrum, and the cost of changing to new frequencies. Indeed, given that Ofcom intends to abolish the organisation that currently co-ordinates the spectrum, JFMG, it is not even clear how it would ensure access to the new spectrum at all.</p>

Yes, the big blockbusters make money, but only a lucky few have ever made their fortune out of the stage. Are the BBC and ITV awash with cash to fund new equipment and massive new charges for access to spectrum? Do the charities which benefit from major events really want to hand over enormous sums to the Treasury to pay for this spectrum? Even the relatively rich music industry believes that there are not enough superstars touring with high-income events to enable venues to continue to afford sufficient access to the spectrum&#151;and they need a lot of it. A recent George Michael concert used 17 frequencies for in-ear monitoring and 24 for radio mikes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para0"><a name="07030686000132">Ofcom has laboured under a number of misapprehensions which have, until now, hampered its ability to engage successfully with the issue. They include its estimate of the size of the PMSE sector; on a related point, its ignorance as to the large number of unlicensed users; and the true value of redundant equipment and of the time needed to re-equip. Recently, though, things have been changing, and Ofcom has been engaging more positively with the sector. The auction process is a sensible mechanism for many sectors interested in the digital dividend review&#151;  <br>

the DDR. However, for the PMSE community, which has well-established grandfather rights for the use of this spectrum, and is absolutely dependent on access to it, the auction process is unacceptable. Interestingly, one sector&#151;radio astronomy&#151;is already rightly protected from the full pressure of the market, so there is a precedent for special treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para1"><a name="07030686000133">I have to ask, perhaps on a slightly more partisan note, to what extent this process is being driven by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. With the public finances under pressure, the prospect of a repeat of the staggering success of the 3G spectrum auction in April 2000 must be very appealing, but when he becomes Prime Minister, does he really want to preside over the ending of so much pleasure? It would confirm many people&#146;s prejudices if he did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para2"><a name="07030686000134">The crucial point is that all the other bidders in an auction&#151;even high-definition television&#151;would be new users of the spectrum. Only one existing use is threatened&#151;radio mikes. Those who are providing this crucial service have those grandfather rights. They are already there, providing a service greatly valued by society, and they should be protected in some way. There is no other use of this spectrum of which that is true.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para3"><a name="07030686000135">What are the dangers to the sector of the auction process? The sector unanimously agrees that it is impossible for it to enter a simple auction system for spectrum release. It has three main grounds for saying that. In detailing them, I shall deal with some of the comments of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para4"><a name="07030686000136">First, the spectrum cannot organise a bid. It is a disparate and diverse community of content producers, manufacturers, rental organisations and others. Many of its members are extremely small. They do not possess the financial resources, nor is there a mechanism to co-ordinate bidding for the collective needs of the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para5"><a name="07030686000137">Secondly, there is the nature of the competition. The sector genuinely believes that it could not be successful in securing spectrum at auction. The other bidders have huge financial muscle. The turnover of the entire world-wide radio mike manufacturing industry is approximately &#163;l billion a year. By contrast, Vodafone alone has a turnover of nearly &#163;30 billion. Dell, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, Apple and many more IT and communications giants will also be bidding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para6"><a name="07030686000138">The third danger is the cost. The certainty of losing in an auction process is increased by the estimated value of the likely bids. Ofcom&#146;s supposition that the spectrum is likely to be of only limited value is undermined by both a letter from Dell Corporation about its value and by Vodafone&#146;s public comments on the implications of the digital dividend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para7"><a name="07030686000139">Worse, with powerful commercial forces up against a disparate sector, there is a genuine prospect of spectrum hoarding&#151;&#147;land-banking&#148; of spectrum for future possible uses. They do not make spectrum any more, and one of the IT giants could decide to take pre-emptive action to squeeze competitors out of the market. That would mean &#147;Bye-bye PMSE.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para8"><a name="07030686000140">Then there is the question of equipment. It is worth spending some time on that. The suggestion by Ofcom  <br>

that around only &#163;10 million worth of equipment would become redundant as part of the DDR is wrong and underestimates the figure by at least a factor of five. One medium-sized company, Autograph Sound, has approximately &#163;7 million worth of affected equipment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para9"><a name="07030686000141">The PMSE sector must be given sufficient time to amortise the value of current equipment that will become redundant. A considerable amount of it will be unsuitable for upgrading because of the restriction of the hazardous substances directive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para10"><a name="07030686000142">Even fully depreciated equipment holds commercial value because of its longevity and the rental nature of part of the sector. Equipment filters down through the industry. Ofcom&#146;s proposed changes would abruptly end the life cycle of the equipment by making it redundant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para11"><a name="07030686000143">The timetable for spectrum release must be sufficiently long to allow the manufacturing industry to produce a sufficient quantity of new equipment for the new frequencies. It is an international industry, so it cannot change everything just to suit the British market. It will need time to avoid disruption to production. Anyway, will international artistes really want to abandon the kit that they use everywhere else simply to perform a UK tour?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para12"><a name="07030686000144">Ofcom proposes the deregulation of Channel 69, but it may be a bad idea. Existing PMSE needs, as well as those of amateurs, require interference-free use of spectrum. If the PMSE sector continues to use Channel 69 professionally, it is certain that sound production will suffer from interference. It is absolutely fundamental that the spectrum used by the PMSE community should be licensed and co-ordinated by a successor to JFMG.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para13"><a name="07030686000145">Ofcom&#146;s argument that the current system offers no security of tenure is bizarre. Until the DDR, there was no risk to the sector&#146;s use of the spectrum. Ofcom and the review created the risk and now it wants to take the credit for a solution to a problem that it invented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para14"><a name="07030686000146">I believe that market-based, flexible solutions are good, but there are always exceptions, such as the radio astronomers, who could not afford to pay for the spectrum they use. Let us be clear: PMSE users accept that change is inevitable and that that will mean a higher price. I think that they accept Ofcom&#146;s view that current prices probably do not even cover the regulator&#146;s costs, but one does not need the perils of a full auction to correct that. The price could simply be increased.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para15"><a name="07030686000147">There must be an acceptable medium-term solution to permit investment in new equipment. The JFMG has an important co-ordinating role that must be protected. Perhaps some appropriate spectrum could be allocated on an annual rental basis to a successor to JFMG. That successor would be independent of Ofcom, which would not therefore be responsible for the organisation. The sector could bid for additional spectrum that it would ideally like, but with the comfort of some security. The new JFMG could charge and police authorised spectrum usage by the PMSE sector. Whatever happens, there must be a smooth transition to the new spectrum allocation world, with a longer time scale than that currently envisaged by Ofcom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para16"><a name="07030686000148">I emphasise that I respect Ofcom, and I am sure that the consultation is genuine and poses it real challenges in balancing competing demands. However, there is not much time left. The sector must come together even  <br>

more closely than it has so far to express a coherent view and offer a possible solution to this real problem. Individual points of view, however, are also valuable: short letters making one or two points to Ofcom will have their impact. The consultation ends on 20 March. My appeal to the sector is that it makes its voice heard so that a real danger is prevented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para18"><a name="07030686000151">I congratulate the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) on securing this debate.

Friend the Chancellor will be delighted, and &#147;Big Brother&#148;&#151;whatever the hon. Gentleman feels about it, I am sure that his constituents will want it to continue&#151;will cease.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para20"><a name="07030686000153">More seriously, the Government realise that radio spectrum is a scarce resource.

As the hon. Gentleman will know, spectrum is also an essential input into numerous public services, from defence to the emergency services, and from scientific research to transport. The demand for spectrum is growing rapidly. In part, that reflects greater innovation in wireless technologies and applications of many different kinds; in part, it stems from the fact that wireless services have unique features that are valued by everyone, such as convenience and mobility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para22"><a name="07030686000155">It is generally agreed that the digital dividend spectrum is among the most valuable spectrum in the UK, offering the right mix of range, penetration and capacity. That unique combination of properties drives the high demand for spectrum. That is the background against which the requirements of specific users must be discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para23"><a name="07030686000156">This spectrum has plenty of potential users from many areas, such as community use wireless microphones, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, more digital terrestrial television, particularly at local level, and high-definition television. Innovative uses are also being developed such as wireless broadband, and there are potential low-power uses that may not yet have reached the market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para24"><a name="07030686000157">Ofcom&#146;s duty includes ensuring the optimal use of spectrum for the UK. Both Ofcom and the Government&#151;and, I think, the hon. Gentleman&#151;are of the opinion that spectrum is most efficiently and effectively allocated via a market mechanism. The rising importance of spectrum, however, means that the way in which it is managed is a vital issue. One of Ofcom&#146;s most important objectives is therefore to ensure that the use of spectrum brings as many benefits as possible to UK citizens and consumers&#151;the public duty. I assure him that Ofcom is not driven by any Treasury diktat to extract maximum revenue from spectrum allocation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para25"><a name="07030686000158">As the hon. Gentleman said, the PMSE community currently makes significant use of the digital dividend spectrum to provide all the services that he mentioned. The joint frequency management group manages those assignments on Ofcom&#146;s behalf. Various parts of the radio spectrum are made available to JFMG for such use, including current interleaved spectrum&#151;the &#147;white&#148; spaces between transmitters&#151;and Channel 69, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. Owing to improved technology, while the amount of spectrum available may be less after switchover, Ofcom believes that the capacity for potential PMSE use will be approximately the same. I hope the hon. Gentleman is reassured by that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para26"><a name="07030686000159">In its consultation and the policy that it is developing, Ofcom is distinguishing between two categories of PMSE use: professional use, on which the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech focused, and community use, which is very important and involves church halls, community meetings, tennis association meetings and meetings to discuss local issues. Those two categories will be treated differently as we think through the digital review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para27"><a name="07030686000160">Ofcom&#146;s consultation makes it clear that it is aware of the concerns of those involved in programme making and special events. The concerns expressed by the hon. Gentleman will be brought to the regulator&#146;s attention as part of the consultation process. The debate has made a valuable contribution to discussion of this topic, and I hope it will raise awareness among the PMSE community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para28"><a name="07030686000161">In the context of professional use, Ofcom has recognised the risk of disruption to which the hon. Gentleman alluded. That is why it has suggested a phased change in spectrum management. It proposes to require that the spectrum continues to be made available for professional PMSE use until at least 2012, as much as anything to avoid the risk of disruption that  <br>

might be caused by the Olympic games. Ofcom has promised to work closely with the professional user community to develop the proposals, and to manage any period of transition that is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para29"><a name="07030686000162">I assure the hon. Gentleman that individual users will not have to organise a bid. I think there has been some misunderstanding about that. What they will have to do is go to a new contractor who will have secured the interleaved spectrum. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there will be a price impact, partly because the current prices do not entirely cover the cost to the regulator and partly because if the spectrum is auctioned there will be an element of profit. I think that about two thirds of the costs are currently met. New equipment will present a cost, and I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we must ensure that the transition is appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para30"><a name="07030686000163">I am well aware of the possibility of hoarding. Ofcom is examining the issue, and I hope that it will come back to us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para31"><a name="07030686000164">Ofcom will publish a further discussion document specifically on PMSE after the current consultation, potentially dealing with transitional arrangements. The Government welcome that listening approach on the regulator&#146;s part, and will be interested in the outcome of any further discussion of any transitional period. We will be interested to hear ideas from those on all sides about potential frameworks for PMSE spectrum use beyond 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para32"><a name="07030686000165">Where PMSE is currently used for community use, we recognise that there is a market failure and acknowledge the wider social impact that that could  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="70306-0022.htm_para33"><a name="07030686000166">The Government recognise that it is important to enable people to use radio microphones appropriately. They are essential not only for on-stage and off-stage entertainment, special events and outside broadcasts, but for churches, schools, colleges and town halls. We acknowledge that the PMSE sector is one of the only current users of the digital dividend review spectrum that is being required to change the way in which it works, and we fully understand the need for a period of transition. However, we are keen for all industries and public-sector bodies to examine their spectrum use, innovating with technology where possible in order to make more efficient and effective use of that spectrum. We also want them to value resources at market rates in order to benefit the United Kingdom as a whole.</p>
