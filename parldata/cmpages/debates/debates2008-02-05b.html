 Some 27.9 million people in England saw an NHS dentist during the two years ending on 30 June 2007. We are committed to improving further access to NHS services. We have increased central funding by 11 per cent. for 2008-09 and are requiring the NHS, through the operating framework, to increase the number of patients able to access NHS dentistry year on year. Given that prevention is better than cure, today we are launching guidance to strategic health authorities on consulting with their local populations on water fluoridation, which is known to reduce tooth decay. A central budget totalling &#163;42 million over the next three years has been established to meet the capital costs of fluoridation.</p>

 Under the current contract, dentists are paid the same for fitting one filling as they are for fitting 10. Some are refusing to treat patients with the poorest teeth. Does the Secretary of State think the arrangement the best way to improve NHS dentistry, particularly for high-needs patients?</p>

<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="08020538000043"><a name="80205-0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="08020538000532"><b>Alan Johnson:</b>
 The new contract was the best way forward. In fact, an NHS dentist is not allowed to refuse to treat patients with the poorest health. Under the old system, there was an absolute incentive to drill and fill. If a dentist moved away from the locality, the local patient population lost out. The famous queues in Scarborough happened under the old system, not the new. Although the new contract has taken time to settle down and although it was not popular with the profession&#151;sometimes we have to do things not popular with the profession if they are necessary to help patient care&#151;we have made improvements in dental care.</p>

 Despite the fact that the local population is growing rapidly, Milton Keynes primary care trust has successfully used the new funding formula to fund the opening of new NHS surgeries. Today on the NHS Choices website it is possible to find access to at least half a dozen NHS surgeries in Milton Keynes. Is the Secretary of State rolling that example out across the country, given that it appears that some other PCTs seem not to know how to use the new system effectively?</p>

 My hon. Friend has seen huge advances in Milton Keynes, and we have also seen those around the country. Every PCT now has a free helpline for people to ring if they want to access dental treatment. There has been a 20 per cent. increase in the number of dentists since 1997 and there is a 25 per cent. increase in the number of training places at not only the existing dental schools, but the two new ones that we are building. Access to NHS dentistry is getting better all the time.</p>

 I doubt whether the Minister will agree with me completely&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] There is an impression that I have a small interest in this subject. The Secretary of State may not agree, but I personally believe that access should be measured according to the numbers of dentists prepared to offer national health service treatment, regardless of whether the patients accept such treatment or choose to go private. Regardless of what the Secretary of State has said about the contract, it has hurt a lot of dentists, particularly the experienced ones. Many have moved out. What could and will the Secretary of State be prepared to do to the contract to attract those highly experienced professionals back into offering national health service treatment?</p>

me like one of the younger crop&#151;that there is a difference between the younger dentists and their enthusiasm for the brave new world under this contract and some of the older dentists.

 On the first point, my hon. Friend is right about some sluggishness in PCTs in commissioning these services.

There has never been any incentive within the framework to treat osteoporosis. We are dealing with a number of points in the system&#151;and therefore money paid to GPs&#151;that are now redundant. We all agree that they are redundant. We want to use those points for greater access.

 Is the Secretary of State aware that no one would deny the need for the Department to ensure good value for money in the health service? It is unfortunate that a very inexact contract was prepared for general practitioners. Does he accept that, whatever developments there are, the introduction of private health care, particularly from America, where I am sorry to say the state is unable to provide adequate health care for its own people, would not only undermine the confidence of general practitioners in the national health service, but would cause grave doubts for many hon.

 I do not agree with my hon. Friend that the contract was a mistake or inexact. In fact, during the period leading up to 2004, we had a crisis in GP recruitment. We could not recruit undergraduates from medical schools and we had an ageing group of GPs. A huge shortage of GPs was the big worry at that time, but our medical schools are now full&#151;that problem has been resolved. I also do not agree that GPs who are called out at 4 o&#146;clock in the morning should be expected to deal with patients and difficult cases at 9 o&#146;clock when their surgery opens.

The accident and emergency services were not centralised in Burnley, and I am, of course, aware that concern was expressed there in particular, on account of that fact, but, interestingly, the figures do not point to a large increase in the number of people presenting themselves in Blackburn instead; there has been only about a 5 per cent. change.</p>

 Tackling the problem of tobacco smuggling is a major priority for the Government.

 My local authority health scrutiny commission met last week to discuss that issue. It is a problem in my area because much of the local smuggled tobacco is counterfeit, which means that it is full of dangerous chemicals, and much of it is targeted at young people. As a consequence, health conditions are worsening because of those poor-quality cigarettes and young children are getting health problems at an earlier age.

 May I repeat again that the science supports fluoridation? Parliament did the same, on a free vote. Whenever the public are tested on this question, they believe that there should be fluoridation. There is absolutely no clinical evidence whatsoever that links fluoridation with anything other than fluorosis. Fluorosis is a discolouration of the teeth, and there are perfectly simple ways to deal with it. The major things that we should be talking about are prevention of decay&#151;and fluoride will be extremely helpful in that&#151;and tackling health inequalities. One of the biggest health inequalities is in dental health, and fluoride is there, available and waiting to assist in that process.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="80205-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08020538000476"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to define the Union flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; to make provision about the display and flying of the Union flag; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80205-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08020538000170">My Bill will affirm the Union flag, established on 1 January 1801, as the national flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It will define the Union flag as one that can truly represent all British people, including those from Her Majesty&#146;s Crown dependencies and overseas territories who have shown such loyalty to the Crown over many centuries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80205-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08020538000171">I seek to uphold the Union flag for everyone to honour and take pride in, and I want positively to encourage the flying of our flag from public buildings the length and breadth of these islands&#151;not just on the rare days designated for the flying of the flag, but on every day throughout the year. It is time we discarded the outdated convention that the Union flag should fly only on certain days; we should follow the fine example of Her Majesty the Queen who displays the Union flag from Buckingham palace every day except when the royal standard is flown.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80205-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08020538000172">The Union flag, or the Union Jack as it is widely known, is a popular modern symbol for most Britons and those with British ancestry&#151;a magnificent emblem representing an unshakeable common bond between all British peoples the world over. The Union flag represents each and every one of us: English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish, Channel Islanders, Manxmen, Falkland Islanders, Gibraltarians and all Her Majesty&#146;s subjects in the British overseas territories&#151;indeed, the Union flag is their flag, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80205-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08020538000173">Another reason for the Bill is to reclaim the Union flag from those who would use it for narrow or extreme political ends, and from those who ridicule our flag on grounds of political correctness or for their own nationalist ambitions. Our flag must be one that all Britons feel able to fly with pride, overriding other divisions that may exist in our nation. In many countries the national flag is a unifying symbol that flies proudly throughout the land: Australia, New Zealand and Canada are the best examples, but in the stars and stripes of the United States and the flags of countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland we see examples where the national flag is flown far and wide, strengthening national identity. The idea that it is somehow not very British to fly the flag is outdated and divisive, and it is time for that old attitude to be discarded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80205-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08020538000174">My Bill will give everyone the right to fly the Union flag all year round, not just from Government buildings in Whitehall but from local town, community, civic and village halls, and from police and fire stations, hospitals, schools, clubs, businesses, offices, shops and private homes, if people choose to do so. Let us start here, today, by flying the Union flag every day from the Houses of Parliament, so that all visitors to London can see our flag proudly fluttering on the mother of Parliaments whenever they visit London.

has pointed out to me, we should be proud of our heritage and more forward in displaying the symbol that unites us all. That symbol can also be highly significant for tourism. Every visitor is a potential ambassador for Britain, and our flag could be better used to promote our country, our heritage and our people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80205-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08020538000175">I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant), who proposed a similar Bill in 1996 when he called for the Union flag to fly freely throughout the nation and for the removal of planning restrictions that prevented that from happening. He, too, called for schools to fly the flag every day. I would like to see that idea adopted. Perhaps a different pupil could be invited to have the honour of raising the flag at the start of each school day. There is nothing more important than instilling in our younger people pride in our flag and our nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80205-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08020538000176">Hon. Members may not be fully aware that the Union flag has never been affirmed in law. I believe it is time that it was. The first Union flag was adopted by royal proclamation by King James on 12 April 1606. It combined the flag of the cross of St. Andrew for Scotland, and the flag of the cross of St. George for England. It was principally for use at sea. The Union with Ireland in 1801 brought the cross of St. Patrick into the flag. The result was the modern Union flag, established by royal proclamation by King George III on 1 January 1801. Nevertheless, the Union flag has never been affirmed as the civil national flag of the United Kingdom. Instead, it has existed only as a Government flag or a royal banner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80205-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08020538000177">In its detailed research, the Flag Institute discovered two significant references to the Union flag in Parliament.

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80205-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08020538000179">Those two statements are the nearest that the Union flag has ever come to being constitutionally endorsed by Parliament in its popularly accepted role. Consequently, the status of the Union flag has been the subject of controversy and misunderstanding for many years, and there is uncertainty among some people about its constitutional position and legal standing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80205-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08020538000180">My Bill will affirm once and for all that the Union flag is the official flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and it will proclaim it to be the flag of all British peoples. It will also formally recognise that the name, Union Jack, can be commonly used when referring to the Union flag. I am indebted to Captain Malcolm Farrow OBE RN, president of the Flag Institute, who has provided me with a wealth of information about the Union flag and its progress and evolution through the centuries, and I commend the work of the Flag Institute to hon.

I believe that my Bill will be the first step in wresting our national flag from the hands of extremists and giving it back to the loyal people of this country, whatever their race, colour, creed or religion. Our flag is a symbol that instils unity and loyalty throughout our nation, so let us today proclaim it as the flag that can truly represent all members of our great British family.

We now have the prospect of signing up to this one.

 We all know about the European convention, whose history the Secretary of State is describing. What concerns us today, however, is why the Government think it appropriate for this additional charter&#151;the charter of fundamental rights&#151;to come into existence and to become an integral part of European Union law, as opposed to European convention law. Are we not simply duplicating?</p>

 May I take the right hon. Gentleman back to something that he said a few moments ago? He stated that the British people had signed up to the European Union. He is a man of great honour; will he at least acknowledge that the British people have only ever voted to join a trading relationship? What we are getting now is a quite different sort of relationship, which is why the Government should honour their promise and give the British people their say.</p>

 The debate during the 1975 referendum roamed much wider than that; plenty of histories of it have been written. It is a matter for the hon. Gentleman to win an argument within his own party. Perhaps he wishes to propose that his party commit itself to leaving the European Union&#151;an idea on which the hon. Gentleman is very keen&#151;and putting the question to the British people in a referendum. That would be the appropriate way to address that absolutely fundamental issue.</p>

Lest the House forget, I was just saying how the ideas moved from being sentiments to legally enforceable mechanisms. The lessons of European history are conspicuous: good will and paper barriers, in and of themselves, are no protection from the perils of authoritarianism. The creation of common minimum standards, backed up by law and enforced by supranational courts&#151;that is the heart of the argument&#151;has turned out to be a powerful guarantee of citizens&#146; rights and freedoms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="80205-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08020538000206">Britain has played a pivotal role in developing that culture of rights and the idea of human rights across Europe. My point to the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) is that that has been of profound importance in helping to introduce across Europe shared prosperity and stability, from which our own citizens have so benefited. Without not only that culture, but the ability to enforce common standards of human rights, I doubt very much whether we would have seen the extraordinary progress made during the lifetimes of many right hon. and hon. Members, including mine. We have moved from a position in which only a handful of European states could be described as functioning democracies; there were dictatorships not only in eastern Europe but in what we now describe as western Europe. Today, almost every nation meets that description, or is working hard towards it.</p>

 How does it advance our democracy, in the terms in which the Secretary of State has put it, to arrive at a position in which rulings by the European Court of Justice on these enormously important matters displace Acts of Parliament, which are decided by the voters of this country on the basis of manifestos in general elections?</p>

 The problem for the hon. Gentleman is this: a manifesto was put forward by the Conservative party in 1970; I do not know whether he voted Conservative in that election, but it is beyond peradventure that he was alive for it. That manifesto said that if the Conservative party was elected to government&#151;and it was, on  18 June 1970&#151;it would seek to negotiate our entry to the European Union. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Somebody said sotto voce that there was no charter of human rights; I shall come back to that. The House voted, as the other place did, in favour of membership. Four years later, the Labour Government said that they wished to renegotiate certain aspects of our membership arrangements, and that was put to a referendum. That was endorsed by the British people by a margin of two to one.</p>

It has almost doubled in size, bringing together 27 politically and culturally diverse members. The time is not beyond the memory of many in the House when a trip across the channel required a feat of logistics, including having to take one&#146;s passport to the bank to withdraw a maximum of &#163;250-worth of European currency in one year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="80205-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08020538000270">Nowadays, British citizens make 55 million trips to Europe each year. Around three quarters of a million of us have homes in Spain, with a further quarter of a million with homes in France, while hundreds of thousands have settled or work elsewhere in the EU. Today, our constituents benefit from the EU and think nothing of living, working and travelling across it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="80205-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08020538000271">There is a damaging fallacy that human rights are something for the &#147;other&#148;. The old home guard is wheeled out in the name of the defence of British interests. They paint a dismal picture of some form of Napoleonic resurgence, threatening the borders and well-being of the United Kingdom. The only response as they see it&#151;we experienced it again this afternoon&#151;is drawing back from Europe into the comfort of narrow parochialism. They seem to miss the fact that the British interest of the British people&#151;yes, those who fly the flag and want it to be flown more often&#151;is best served by being in Europe so that we can influence Europe. I want my constituents to receive the same protection when on holiday or on business abroad in Europe as they are afforded at home.</p>

I ask my constituents where they go on holiday, whether they know anyone with an apartment or home in Spain, Italy or France, or anyone who has made use of his or her right to work elsewhere in the European Union.

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that the previous intervention demonstrates the difficulty that we on this side of the House have with the Opposition? They do not understand that membership of the European Union is a two-way street or that the rights of UK citizens when in other countries are protected through such provisions. It was the same in the debate on justice and home affairs, when they did not understand that minimum standards in criminal law could affect UK citizens beneficially when abroad. Similarly, in the debate on energy the issue for the Tories seemed to be all about people nicking our energy supplies in time of crisis, rather than energy supplies from other member states coming here. It is the same in this debate&#151;they do not understand the protections that our citizens can enjoy abroad owing to those fundamental rights.</p>

Before agreeing that the charter should have treaty status, the Government insisted that greater clarity was required to define precisely what the scope and effect of such a status would be, which is the answer to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. We pledged that nothing in the charter of fundamental rights would give national or European courts any new powers to strike down or reinterpret UK law, including with regard to labour and social legislation.

Does that not explain why the protocol is crucial, but only if it is watertight? Will the Secretary of State explain why it was not made clear when the terms of the protocol were negotiated that it would apply regardless of any other European treaty or other law made by the European Court?

It does not disapply rights to UK citizens; given that the United Kingdom fully accepts the rights reaffirmed in the charter, there would be no need to do so.

I should have thought that, given all the concern about competition from eastern European workers, the Conservative party would now have realised the error of its ways. The last Conservative Government negotiated an opt-out, but we had a manifesto commitment, and we joined the chapter in 1997. As many Conservatives think that there are demons in it, let me mention that it includes the right to paid maternity and paternity leave&#151;is the House opposed to that?&#151;and the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of sexuality, religion or belief, or age.</p>

Even those on the Opposition Front Bench, in spite of the endless inconsistencies and contradictions of their policy in this area, seem now to have realised that it would be folly of the gravest kind to do what many Opposition Members were toying with doing not long ago: withdrawing from the European convention on human rights.

Human Rights will interpret rights under the convention.

Now, Ministers hail the inclusion of a reference to children&#146;s rights as some negotiating triumph. The Government still refuse to come clean over whether the words do matter and they made a concession of some significance during negotiations, or whether they believe that the reference is innocuous and changes nothing about EU competence.

First, does the fact that the Lisbon treaty gives legal force to the charter of fundamental rights transfer powers, either actually or potentially, from national Parliaments and Governments to the institutions of the Union, and especially to the Court of Justice? Secondly, if the treaty does have such an effect, do the words of the protocol that the Government have secured provide the safeguards for this Parliament that Ministers claim?</p>

 Yes. I want to deal with exactly that point in greater detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="80205-0007.htm_para13"><a name="08020538000358">The Government have relied on three arguments to defend their position. First, they claim that the charter is nothing more than a declaratory statement and that it merely codifies rights that already exist. The Foreign Secretary asserted that as recently as 18 October last year, when he wrote to the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee to say that the charter</p>
<a name="80205-0007.htm_brev4"><a name="08020538000499"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;only records existing rights; it does not create any new rights&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80205-0007.htm_para14"><a name="08020538000359">Earlier this afternoon, the Secretary of State for Justice said that the charter describes rights that already exist. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80205-0007.htm_para15"><a name="08020538000360">Secondly, like the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), the Government argue that the words of article 6 of the consolidated treaty, together with the so-called horizontal articles of the charter, protect all member states&#151;not only the UK or Poland&#151;from the creation of new rights by the institutions of the Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="80205-0007.htm_para16"><a name="08020538000361">Thirdly, Ministers claim that the protocol to the treaty in respect of this country and Poland alone makes it impossible for decisions of the European Court or the Commission to overturn the definitions of rights determined by our domestic law. The trouble is that when one starts to examine those claims in any detail, one realises that the safeguards appear less than watertight, as the European Scrutiny Committee found in its most recent report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80205-0007.htm_para17"><a name="08020538000362">One also has to challenge the Government on a point of basic principle. If, as Ministers say, all the rights that are included in the charter already exist in both domestic law and the European convention on human rights, what is the purpose of the charter of fundamental rights being judicable by the European Court of Justice, too?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="80205-0007.htm_para18"><a name="08020538000363">The charter sets out a number of rights that would, as a consequence of Lisbon, become for the first time rights that are embodied in EU law and judicable by the ECJ, even if they are not new rights. Most obviously, the recreation in the Lisbon treaty of the EU as a unitary legal entity means that subjects such as policing and criminal justice laws passed after Lisbon could be interpreted by the ECJ with the Court applying the rights and principles set out in the charter. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80205-0007.htm_para19"><a name="08020538000364">The treaty goes beyond the EU simply signing up to the European convention on human rights. The charter also includes a number of articles derived from other international agreements that have been entered into bilaterally by one or more of the member states. Those rights, too, exist in those member states but they have not hitherto been part of EU law and subject to the jurisdiction of the ECJ. In practice, when we hear the Government&#146;s arguments and look at what Ministers are doing and saying, we find that they are not behaving as though they believe that no new rights are being created. If there were no new rights and no new interpretations permitted of existing rights, why is there a need for the protocol at all?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80205-0007.htm_para20"><a name="08020538000365">The same applies to the argument put by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. If article 6, and in particular paragraphs 1 and 2, do not under any circumstances permit the extension of EU competence or the interpretation by the court of what is meant by EU competence, it is difficult to see the justification for the protocol in which the Government place such store.  <br>

 That is not what my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea was advocating. The right hon.

 We confirm that point in other areas of EU law, which are not always applied uniformly; for example, in other treaties the UK has opt-outs or opt-ins on protocols and when the ECJ rules on those areas of law it is not able to apply its rulings uniformly across the EU.

 It is not only my right hon.

If we further consider the likely consequences of a European Court of Justice decision deriving from the application of charter rights, we can see that irrespective of the protocol, any company that operates in more than one EU member state will change its practices across the EU, even in the United Kingdom or Poland, once the ECJ has given a judgment on what has gone on in one particular country.</p>

 We have had a great deal of discussion of the charter of fundamental rights. I am not sure that I can add substantially to it,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 Feb 2008">

<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 819</b><br>
other than to say that I believe it brings existing rights together and makes them more visible, as the charter says, drawing them from a variety of different sources&#151;civil, political, economic and social.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="80205-0008.htm_para18"><a name="08020538000413">Although we have the protocol, there is nothing in the charter itself that we could realistically object to. Indeed, it would do a great deal to strengthen our rights in this country, and I would like to see it in force in the United Kingdom, even though the protocol ensures that it does not apply. As it is drawn, the charter applies only in relation to European Union law or action taken under the treaty. Although the charter is made legally binding by the treaty, that is only in the context of European law. It contains not just rights but aspirational principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="80205-0008.htm_para19"><a name="08020538000414">The Fundamental Rights Agency has the job of monitoring compliance with the charter. The agency emerged in 2003 under the Italian presidency and was drawn from the existing Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. Much of its residual experience is drawn from that and that is reflected in the future work pattern of the Fundamental Rights Agency. The agency was negotiated under the UK presidency as a first-pillar agency under article 308 of the Nice treaty. Its duty is to enforce the charter of fundamental rights and, although other human rights instruments could inform its work, the FRA cannot actually enforce them. Its job is to monitor member states and EU institutions. It is also its job to monitor accession states but only after accession has been completed, which is a problem. I may be wrong, but I do not think that the charter and the FRA are taken into account during the negotiations for accession. This happens only after an accession agreement has been signed. That reflects a gap in the effectiveness of the agency and the charter. A much stronger lever  could have been provided in the accession processes for Bulgaria and Romania, for example, where significant human rights issues needed to be addressed before the accession process was completed. That is doubly so in the case of Turkey where significant human rights issues have to be addressed before the accession process is completed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="80205-0008.htm_para20"><a name="08020538000415">There has been much debate about why we should have the charter&#151;and, indeed, the FRA&#151;when we already have the European convention on human rights and the Council of Europe, but until the EU accedes to the European convention, however, there is no monitoring of EU institutions for human rights compliance without the FRA. The agency can ultimately look at the gap in performance between the EU institutions such as the Commission and the Parliament.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making an important point about the need for the European Union to adhere to the European convention on human rights, and the fact that it has not been unknown for the Commission, for example, to violate human rights through its  activities. Does he share my anxiety that, although it is implicit in the treaty that accession to the ECHR will take place, the mechanism and the precise text for achieving that are not before us? Such information could give us the kind of reassurance that the Lord Chancellor described when he said that the mechanism would be such that the ECHR and the Court of Human Rights would be supreme over the European Court of Justice in this area.</p>

 I have some concerns about human rights principles, but that is not one of them. I hope to develop that argument later in my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="80205-0008.htm_para21"><a name="08020538000418">At present, human rights are subject to monitoring by the Council of Europe, United Nations treaty bodies, non-governmental organisations and national institutions such as my own Committee, the Joint Committee on Human Rights. There is a need, however, to translate that monitoring into remedial action, if it is required, within the EU framework. The agency could fulfil that responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="st_o245"><a name="08020538000419"><a name="80205-0008.htm_spnew22"><a name="08020538000792"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>

 I will be coming to the question of accession later in my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80205-0008.htm_para23"><a name="08020538000422">At the moment, I am talking about the Fundamental Rights Agency, which has an obligation to complement the Council of Europe so as to avoid duplication. The Council of Europe&#146;s responsibility is to set the standards for human rights&#151;such as those that we see in the convention&#151;to monitor compliance with those standards and to provide a judicial function through the European Court. On the other hand, the European Union has a legislative function and a political function and much better enforcement capabilities. It seems to me, therefore, that the agency&#146;s job should be to develop recommendations from the Council of Europe and to implement them in such a way as to ensure that standards are met at EU level. I am pleased that a memorandum of understanding was signed by the EU and the Council of Europe in May last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80205-0008.htm_para24"><a name="08020538000423">I have some doubts about the independence of the FRA, however, and whether it complies with the Paris principles. According to those principles, it should be independent, but, given the way in which the regulations that drew it up were framed, I doubt whether they fully comply with those requirements. Its work is to gather information, analysis and reports and to take an advisory role. It does not have investigative powers or powers of scrutiny, which is a problem. That is a major gap in the agency&#146;s work.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/debtext/80205-0009.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80205-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08020538000424">Scrutiny is not among the activities set out in  article 5. The lack of scrutiny of EU legislation for compliance with human rights is one of the big gaps. That process is pretty well missing. I believe that the European Scrutiny Committee made a recommendation about this, as did the Committee in the Lords in 2006. I suppose I am advocating something similar to part of the role of my own Committee, which scrutinises domestic legislation for its compliance with human rights standards. It is said that the Commission&#146;s job is to ensure compliance, but that raises the issue of who monitors the Commission&#146;s work, a point raised by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). Realistically, that should be the role of the Fundamental Rights Agency, although it does not yet have it. Nor, I suspect, does it have the relevant expertise. It does not have the indispensable legal advisers that my Committee has, nor a partner equivalent to ours&#151;the Ministry of Justice&#151;that has an overarching responsibility  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 Feb 2008">

to ensure compliance and to co-ordinate across government. Ultimately, that should be part of the presidency&#146;s job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80205-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08020538000425">Human rights scrutiny should be done at the earliest possible stage of European legislation&#151;long before it reaches member state Parliaments, where any such scrutiny will be cursory at most. My Committee does not have the resources to scrutinise European legislation properly for the purposes of human rights; as it stands, we are pretty stretched doing our domestic job. That important aspect should be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80205-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08020538000426">As I mentioned, the Fundamental Rights Agency is a first-pillar organisation, although originally it was intended to be a third-pillar one. The Lisbon treaty, of course, abolishes all references to pillars, but regulations for the agency remain first-pillar arrangements, although under article 31 there are provisions for review. It seems to me that in practice it would be impossible for the agency to do its job effectively if it were simply a first-pillar organisation. For example, to monitor and scrutinise effective action against people trafficking involves the full range of the three former pillars: not only European institutions, but police, justice and crime&#151;and, I suppose, foreign affairs, given the issue of source countries. If we are to enforce on the issue of people trafficking, we need to recognise that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80205-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08020538000427">The work programme of the Fundamental Rights Agency is interesting. Many British universities have also been involved in its work. The survey on discrimination against and victimisation of migrants is similar to the British crime survey. I am pleased to see that my old university, Warwick law school, is working on good practice in ethnic profiling by police and border forces, and I am sure it will produce an excellent report. As a result, there is analysis of how migrants are treated by the media. I wish the school luck on that; my Committee did some work on that issue and found it difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80205-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08020538000428">Edinburgh and Glasgow universities are supporting work on pathways to violent radicalisation, although I think it potentially rather simplistic. There is also work on homophobia and the protection of children&#146;s rights in the light of the new rights in the treaty&#151;objective indicators are being considered to measure progress in that respect. There is also holocaust education, on which we have a good record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80205-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08020538000429">Earlier, the issue of EU accession to the European convention on human rights arose. It arose because of a 1994 European Court of Justice decision that the European Union could not accede. The Lisbon treaty, of course, provides for that mechanism. The real problem at the moment is getting the Council of Europe to agree&#151;that requires unanimity on its part. All the countries involved have now ratified, save Russia, which I hope will get around to doing so before too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80205-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08020538000430">The risk of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights developing divergent views on similar issues has been raised. It is important to recognise that those who advocate that line accept, effectively, that the charter and the European convention effectively deal with the same sort of issues&#151;otherwise, the risk would not even be discussed. The answer is to look at the position of the ECJ as an EU institution. If the EU accedes to the European convention, it does so  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 Feb 2008">

<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 822</b><br>
with all its institutions, including the ECJ. Effectively, therefore, the ECJ itself, as an EU institution, would become subordinate to the convention and the rulings of the ECHR. It would have to comply with views expressed by the European Court of Human Rights as arbiter of the convention. The circle is easily and properly squared by simply looking at the status of the different institutions that would follow from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80205-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08020538000431">I am pleased that the charter incorporates children&#146;s rights into the treaty under chapter III, which covers equality. It is a pity that that will not apply in the UK, because that might help us to deal with the reservation that the UK has expressed about the convention  on the rights of the child in relation to immigration matters, which is now under review by the Government. I hope that we do not have to rely on the charter to resolve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80205-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08020538000432">Several issues arise in relation to the protocol. Nothing in the charter creates new justiciable rights, partly because of subsidiarity and partly because the solidarity heads are not rights as such but are more by way of principles. Even if they were rights, it is possible in the long term that the ECJ might make them enforceable. The protocol therefore becomes belt-and-braces protection. Having looked at the terms of the charter, that does not particularly worry me. The charter is an excellent document that sets out a whole series of excellent rights. It should inform our own future debates on a British Bill of Rights, which would, I hope, include most of the things that are set out in the charter, including the social, political and economic rights. That would be a huge step forward for our society and our democracy. I rather regret the reservation of the UK&#146;s position on the protocol. This is a very progressive document. We have nothing to fear from it and there would be an awful lot to be gained if it applied in the UK.</p>

One only has to read the reports of Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch, not just about such countries as Bulgaria or Romania, but even about this country, to learn that those who are watching EU Governments are noticing infringements of human rights. In such countries as Poland, we are seeing relatively extreme breaches of human rights. The 2007 Amnesty report states that in Poland:</p>

Most of the big leaps in human rights occurred some time ago. Before Britain acceded to the European Union, the European Court of Justice dealt with protecting fundamental rights. That formed the basis of the principles of law that governed its rulings. Perhaps more significant is the way in which protecting human rights was developed by treaties, to which former Conservative Governments signed up. Conservative Members will have to answer that point.</p>

 Of course people will refer to the document, but then they are forced to explain the underlying sources of the rights contained within it.

 Although the debate has been fairly wide-ranging, one issue that I do not think we have covered in the necessary detail is the place of working people in Europe. The Lord Chancellor devoted about five minutes of his 45-minute speech to it, and there has been only fragmentary mention of working people in the context of the rights that they can enjoy, but the issue is tremendously important. Europe cannot be a construct of the bureaucrats, no matter how much Peter Mandelson and others like him wish that it were.

In that connection, I want to refer to two important recent rulings from the European Court of Justice: the Laval case&#151;nothing to do with the Vichy traitor&#151;and the Viking Line case.

Court of Justice, which ruled that in future any strike action affecting that freedom would have to meet stringent legal tests that the Court itself could assess. At that point, a danger light went on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08020545000007">Although the Court did not, on the face of it, rule against the employer, I would argue that the ruling is excellent news for corporate lawyers in the long term. They will be able to threaten trade unions with long and expensive court cases in order to discourage the unions&#151;which do not possess the same resources as big business&#151;from taking collective action against outsourcing or similar corporate behaviour. It also has very alarming implications for basic trade union rights and freedoms. Our right to industrial action has always come from the democratic mandate of the union through its members, according to laws determined by this Parliament. Now it will also need to meet criteria imposed and assessed by unelected European judges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08020545000008">Even more serious is the Laval judgment. Although most Members will know exactly what I am talking about, one or two will not, so I shall help them out. Laval is a Latvian company which, in 2004, posted workers from Latvia to work on building sites in Sweden, including the now infamous site at Vaxholm. The Swedish construction union asked the company to agree to the existing collective agreement in the building sector. It refused, instead operating under a Latvian agreement with lower pay scales that undercut the Swedish workers&#146; wages. The Swedish union quite correctly went on strike, and as a consequence Laval's Swedish subsidiary went bust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08020545000009">Laval then sued the union for its losses and the case was referred to the European Court of Justice. The Court ruled that the company&#146;s freedom to provide services in any member state should not be restricted by having to comply with a non-statutory collective bargaining agreement. In a particularly alarming section of the judgment, the Court argued that, because the EU posted workers directive set out minimum rights, it was unreasonable to force the company to comply with further agreements at local or national level. So instead of EU legislation setting minimum standards of rights at work, we now seem to be in danger of those standards being seen as a maximum.</p>

The two cases I mention show how the EU has in too many instances become a factor in accelerating a race to the bottom on labour standards across Europe. John Monks is always seen as a big supporter of Europe, but he has said the following in the light of those two cases:</p>
<a name="80205-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="08020545000114"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The court has ruled in effect that the right to strike is not as important as the unimpeded free flow of services and labour.

To trade unionists around Europe it is plain that the EU, which hitherto has generally upheld workers&#146; rights&#151;in contrast to the US, and sometimes, sadly, the UK&#151;has now taken a neoliberal, anti-trade union turn.&#148;</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) mentioned that, where robust legal frameworks are in place, some of this case law can be circumvented.

 That is an excellent point. These cases show that the EU is moving towards a policy of undermining workers&#146; terms and conditions. I am sure that other Members will make that case today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08020545000019">Another aspect of the charter is also of concern to me: that the freedoms of capital seem to have become fundamental rights of the EU. Title II of the charter contains rights such as the freedom to conduct a business, the right to property, freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services in any member state. Unlike the workers&#146; rights under title IV, they do not appear to be covered by the provisions of article 1, paragraph 2 of the protocol, which states only that title IV cannot create new rights except in so far as they already exist in UK law. The right to provide services and freedom of establishment, which were the key points in the Laval and Viking cases, are not so restrictive. Article 15, which contains them, does not contain the proviso that they exist only in so far as they are already in law. That is one reason why the unequal status of the different titles in the protocol is of particular concern.</p>

the directive included areas that we would consider to be public services, such as health. Even more alarmingly, it enshrined the country of origin principle. That principle provided that where services are provided by a company based in a different country, the legislation of the home country would apply, with a few minimal exceptions, such as basic health and safety standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08020545000021">Thankfully, those elements were removed from the directive as a result of pressure from some member states and, eventually, a majority in the European Parliament. The Commission has never fully accepted that, and seems to be finding imaginative ways of bringing those elements back, such as in the recent health directive. In that light, I hope that the Minister can reassure me on a few points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08032816000001">First, is there any danger that by making the freedom of establishment and the right to provide services fundamental EU rights they could become even more powerful tools for big business? Can he assure us that the Court will not give them greater consideration or overrule EU legislation that does not give them sufficient weight? Secondly, will the Minister assure this House that the Government will do their utmost to resist any attempt to revive the country of origin principle or any similar measure?</p>

 The hon. Member for Elmet (Colin Burgon) made a thoughtful speech. He pointed out the significance of judge-made law, which is very relevant to some of the points that I would like to share with  the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08020545000024">This debate is meant to be about human rights, but actually it is not about that, because, despite some of the political arguments that are occasionally used, there is an equal commitment to human rights on both sides of the House, from all Members of Parliament. The issue is how we decide what those human rights should be and how we are accountable to the wider electorate whom we serve both in this country and in the other countries of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08020545000025">The significance of the protocol that was negotiated by the Government&#151;if it is watertight&#151;is twofold. First, it is important because it is a further step towards the kind of   la carte Europe that I wish to see. I believe that model will enable not only Britain but many European Union countries that have concerns about excessive integration to reconcile their membership of the European Union. The protocol curbing the power of the European Court is important in that respect. Secondly, it is about the wider issue of the European Union&#146;s accountability to the electorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08020545000026">Let me comment briefly on both those fundamental issues. If the protocol works, it will curb, for the first time, the European Court&#146;s ability to make law in  <br>

substantive areas for the United Kingdom. We should realise that this kind of   la carte Europe, which Britain has pioneered, but in which other countries have participated, has several implications. First, it is not designed just for the United Kingdom. Poland has this protocol, and other European countries, such as Sweden, Denmark and a number of other states of that kind, have also opted out in various areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08020545000027">The second implication of an   la carte Europe is that it does not just give us the right not to participate in certain kinds of integration; we should also respect the right of other member states that may wish to go further. That right should be equally important. It should not have to be haggled about or negotiated, because it should be implicit in how we operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08020545000028">The Schengen agreement, the single currency, the protocol and the justice and home affairs provisions contain opt-outs for some countries, and not only for the United Kingdom. We must also take into account the hugely long transition periods for all the new member states from central and eastern Europe. Even if they want to join the euro, they may have to wait nine or 10 years in order to do so. That is not simply a transition; it means that for a generation there will be a European Union of the kind that we in this House should be much more comfortable about. That is an important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08020545000029">The second aspect to this matter is the wider issue of accountability to the electorate in respect of how our laws are made. Most of the dispute in this area in recent years has been not about the Court, but about qualified majority voting&#151;it has been about the ability to take decisions that are not made unanimously. That covers very important issues, because inevitably when a minority of Governments do not vote for a proposition and it nevertheless takes effect in their nation states, there is no way that the electorates of those countries can hold their Governments accountable, because those Governments themselves were opposed to the measure imposed upon them. That is an argument as to why any decision to move to QMV should be taken carefully. I hope that such a move will take place in as few cases as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80205-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08020545000030">I come to the issue of the Court, because that is what we are really discussing today. The situation is much more dangerous and disturbing than QMV, because a decision made by the European Court is different from a judgment made by a national court. If a United Kingdom court makes a judgment that embarrasses the Government or leads to a law that Parliament never thought it intended, Parliament has the power, if a sufficient majority exists, to reverse that court&#146;s decision by making new law. The Supreme Court of the United States has enormous power to determine new law and develop the law in a fundamental and often controversial way. If a consensus existed in Congress&#151;it does not always&#151;and the President and Congress agreed that the Supreme Court had created a situation with which they did not want to live, even the United States has it within its own power to reverse that situation, although that rightly involves a complicated and difficult measure.</p>

reverse such a decision by itself, unless it has an enforceable protocol that can prevent the situation from arising in the first place. If the protocol does not apply, or it acts in other areas, a difficult situation arises. In theory, the only way in which a judgment of the European Court, however controversial, could be overturned would be if the Council of Ministers as a whole decided to reverse it. That would require not just a majority but a decision by all 27 member states, because any one state could veto such a change.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that point, because there is a fundamental distinction between the two situations. When one is dealing with the WTO or any international treaty that concerns itself with the relations between states, of course one encounters curbs of the kind that he mentions. We are increasingly seeing the European Union move into domestic law and into the rights of individual citizens in respect of their health, housing, education or personal rights in a way that has no relevance to the WTO situation.</p>

 I do not doubt that a choice will have to be made in some areas and that occasionally, with a great lack of enthusiasm, we will have to acknowledge that an international court may need to be the body that makes law that imposes itself on us, as it does on all other countries. The right hon. Gentleman should not get carried away with enthusiasm. I am saying that the onus will be on those who want such a situation to prove that this country&#146;s citizens have an enormous interest in sacrificing their own control over how decisions are made in order to achieve certain objectives. Sometimes that test may be met, but such occasions will rightly be relatively rare. If the European Court is able to reach judgments that cannot be overturned, however controversial, unless there is unanimity in the Council of Ministers, it in effect has the last word and is all powerful. That really is power without responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80205-0011.htm_para0"><a name="08020545000036">The other crucial point that has not been mentioned today is that the European Court&#146;s position with regard to the charter of fundamental rights is quite different from its position until now. Until now its role has been one of interpreting directives and specific pieces of legislation covering relatively narrow areas. The very point of the fundamental charter is that those rights are expressed in very broad terms, and that is exactly how judge-made law can expand in a dynamic fashion. We have seen in the US how the Supreme Court has used provisions that were put in the constitution more than 200 years ago on cruel and unusual punishment to deal with the issue of capital punishment. The right to bear arms is also used to justify the right of Americans  <br>

to carry guns in the most extraordinary circumstances. Those dramatic developments of law have an impact on ordinary people, and Parliaments and other accountable bodies have not been involved. Just as the US Supreme Court has that power, so the European Court would have a comparable power with the charter of fundamental rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80205-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08020545000037">The situation is worse than with qualified majority voting because even when we or another Government are outvoted in the Council of Ministers, and have to accept a judgment that we do not like, QMV is normally&#151;although not always&#151;applied at the end of a long negotiation in which compromises are invariably made to assist the minority Government or Governments to live with the outcome. I have taken part in such Council of Ministers discussions as part of both the minority and the majority sides. Strenuous efforts are made to help the Governments who are being outvoted to live with it and sell it to their electorates. It does not always work, but the effort is made. When laws are made by the European Court, there are no negotiations, compromises or attempt to recognise the political realities. The rules are simply pronounced in the judgment and Governments have to like it or lump it.</p>

the protocol will apply regardless of other treaties and regardless of European law. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) said, such constraints apply elsewhere and could have applied here, if the Government had not missed the trick. It would be difficult now that the treaty has been agreed for them to go back and renegotiate it. That means that we will have to be careful in analysing the Government&#146;s arguments to see whether, notwithstanding that omission, the protocol is something of value. If it is, it will not only help the Government and the United Kingdom, but it will be a big step forward in how to relate to the European Union for countries that want to be part of it, as long as it can show the flexibility and diversity necessary for an organisation of 27 and perhaps, one day, more than 30 countries.</p>

A pragmatic answer&#151;although I am struggling to find an explanation&#151;might be that the charter would ban excessive working hours. The British worker works more hours a week than anyone else in Europe and the CBI would like to keep it that way. It would also permit secondary action in industrial disputes, but at present British workers cannot take such action, although employers can. No doubt the CBI would like to keep it like that as well.

because none of the explanations that I can think of appears to carry much weight. If it is a matter of keeping the CBI sweet, I suggest that that is not the job of a Labour Government. Nor is it the responsibility of a Labour Government to implement what Tony Blair, the former Prime Minister, once commended to a business gathering as</p>

Indeed, it is very difficult to see how this discrete carve-out, so methodically prepared, can work in practice. Firms operating in one member state will be affected, but if they operate in more than one member state, the charter will clearly apply. Migrants coming from another member state to the UK would presumably still be covered.

It seems to me tragic that the Government are investing such enormous legal and logistical resources in resisting something on which they are all too likely to lose in the end, yet which every other country in Europe has decided is practical and desirable. I simply do not understand why the Government have got themselves into that position unless it is fear of the Eurosceptic press. That is the only other consideration that I can think of, but I hope that that is not the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80205-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08020545000062">For any Labour Government, enforcing a justiciable charter of fundamental rights should be integral to securing a social Europe to counter the neo-liberal orientations of the EU treaties. That is starkly illustrated by the Viking and Vaxholm cases, which were mentioned earlier. Two months ago, the Swedish and Finnish unions sought to prevent companies from massively undercutting pay rates by paying foreign workers up to 60 per cent. lower wage rates. However, the ruling was&#151;this makes it so interesting and important&#151;that although there was a fundamental right to take collective industrial action, such action represents a restriction on the employer&#146;s right of freedom of establishment. Of course, industrial action by its very nature will be an obstacle on the activities and freedom of the company. In other words, an employer&#146;s right to freedom of establishment trumps the union&#146;s right to strike. That is worryingly reminiscent, if I may say so, of the infamous judgment in the Taff Vale case of 1901. The Taff Vale railway took the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants to court for having the audacity to go on strike. The crime was known then as being &#147;in restraint of trade&#148;. Perhaps all that has changed is the terminology, because we are now talking about exactly the same point but it is now called freedom of establishment.</p>

The Lisbon treaty adopted the curious word&#151;I had never heard it before&#151;&#147;flexicurity&#148; to give the wholly false impression that if workers embrace flexibility, job security will automatically follow. Some of us might regard that as a contradiction in terms.</p>

 &#147;Flexicurity&#148; was developed by the Danish social democratic Landsorganisation. It is a term used in the Nordic countries to describe the combination of job security protection and flexible labour markets, which has allowed Sweden and Denmark to grow. It is a wholly social democratic and progressive concept&#151;not a neo-liberal idea at all.</p>

 It is always helpful to have an exegetist of such immense academic knowledge as my right hon. Friend and I bow to his superior knowledge.

Friend of any accusation of using spin&#151;the detailed language in some parts of the treaty suggests, unless it is balanced by a robust and effective charter of rights, a slippery slope on which it would be easy to slide back to the sort of casualisation and insecurity that we saw in previous decades in this country. That is my central point and bottom line in the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80205-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08020545000068">That is all too clearly revealed, to provide one further example, in an EU green paper promoting flexicurity, which says that contractor obligations to monitor employment law among sub-contractors</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80205-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08020545000069">That just about says it all. The direction of travel is unmistakable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80205-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08020545000070">For a final example, under article III-147 of the old constitution, which remains under the reform treaty, the EU would be given power to enforce privatisation in any area of economic activity:</p>
<a name="80205-0011.htm_brev9"><a name="08020545000124"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A European framework law shall establish the measures in order to achieve the liberalisation of a specific service&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80205-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08020545000071">We have already seen that in action with the EU services directive, which was seeking to extend the private sector into all areas of public service, but at least health care was left out on that occasion. However, a draft EU health services directive was adopted at the end of last year by the European Commission and was designed to create a market in health care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80205-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08020545000072">I conclude that this abundant evidence of the neo-liberal underpinning of the EU treaties is the overwhelming reason why we need a balance to secure a social Europe, not just a market Europe, and why a charter for fundamental human rights is crucial to achieve that balance.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher). He made an important speech that exemplified the extent to which rights, or at least some rights, are essentially political and economic in their origin and their importance. It should therefore perhaps be political and economic matters that lead to their definition and implementation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80205-0011.htm_para24"><a name="08020545000074">All parties and all Members in this House are in favour of basic human rights&#151;what we normally mean by human rights, which do not extend into the sphere of certain economic rights. All parties have always supported human rights, yet successive Governments have opposed the implementation into treaty law of a charter of human rights. Why is that? Why have successive UK Governments, including this one, opposed the implementation at a European level of a justiciable charter of human rights?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80205-0011.htm_para25"><a name="08020545000075">The matter would be clearer if the Government would do as I asked in my point of order at the start of the debate.

Only then will we be able to see clearly what is from time to time referred to by those who are more knowledgeable than the rest of us&#151;notably my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), who participated in that Convention. I hope that either now or when she sums up, the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice), will promise that in future, each day, alongside all the other documents that are supplied to inform our debates, we will have on the Table the resolutions that the Government moved and the terms in which they moved them during the Convention, so that we will know what the Government&#146;s position is or was.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an extremely pertinent point with great crispness, as he has throughout these debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para0"><a name="08020545000082">The reason, I suggest, that successive Governments of both parties have opposed the implementation in European treaties of a charter of fundamental rights and sought, even this time, to block its effect with a protocol is because we in this country have a pragmatic approach to human rights. We recognise that rights are not absolute. Each human right has to be balanced against another. Free speech has to be balanced against the right to protect one&#146;s reputation through the libel laws and so on. Somebody must decide the balance between those rights and, in the past, after the initial interpretations of the courts, this House has decided. Often, deciding the balance has been an intrinsically political decision. I think that that is the point that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) was making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08020545000083">The rights as laid down in the charters and conventions are necessarily vague, imprecise and general, so somebody&#151;or some body&#151;must explicate them in accordance with the detailed circumstances in which we find ourselves; they must relate those generalities to the complexities of the life that we live. Some body must do that. In the past, this body, the Houses of Parliament, has ultimately spelled out what rights mean in detail rather than leaving such decisions to general statements from a different body of people: judges, who are unaccountable to the electorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08020545000084">Once we allow lawyers and courts to have the last say, rights will mean what the court says that they do. They will not mean what we thought when we signed up to those rights, or what the people who originally drafted them meant. They will mean what the court says. If that court is the European Court of Justice, there will ultimately be no recourse except in the extreme circumstances when all 27 members can agree to override the Court and change the rights or the constitutional treaties that govern us. That is unlikely and we cannot rely on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08020545000085">I recall an example of how important the discretion of the Court was. Normally, people would expect me to be hostile to the Court. However, on one occasion it was set to adjudicate on a claim brought against the British Government on pension law. It was an extremely important case and &#163;5 billion of tax revenue hung on it. If the decision had gone against the British Government, we would have had to recall Parliament during the recess and bring in new taxes to replace the &#163;5 billion of lost revenue. I had to report to Parliament during my preparations for the event and the Law Officers had to report on the likely judgment that we could expect. They reported that in their view, according to all the legal advice and in the opinion of both the prosecution and the defence, the British Government would lose the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08020545000086">I ventured, rather timidly as a non-lawyer, to suggest to my Cabinet colleagues that the Law Officers had overlooked one thing: the ECJ, although it is a court of justice, is a political court and will always put the interests of the EU first. It was in the interests of the EU not to upset the apple-cart. At that point, we had not ratified the Maastricht treaty. It would have been hugely difficult to ratify the Maastricht treaty if Europe suddenly deprived us of &#163;5 billion in tax, and forced the Government to recall Parliament in the summer to pass &#163;5 billion-worth of new taxes. I confidently asserted that all the lawyers were wrong and that the ECJ would take the politic decision and uphold our position. It did. After that, different Departments from Whitehall used to come and consult me about legal matters because they seemed to think that I had an inner judgment about what would happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08020545000087">We need to remember that the ECJ will have the last say on what rights are. It will make those decisions politically, but without any recourse to the electorate&#151;unlike us.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is making an extremely effective point. I remind him that the situation will get worse under the treaty. Under article 9, paragraph 2, the ECJ will have to practise mutual sincere co-operation with the other EU institutions, which exclude member states. Any bias that he detects will be redoubled if the treaty is ever ratified.</p>

<p><a name="st_o305"><a name="08020545000089"><a name="80205-0012.htm_spnew4"><a name="08020545000169"><b>Mr. Lilley:</b>
 My right hon. Friend makes an extremely good point that explains why we should look very carefully at what is happening and why, in the laughably short one and a half hours that we have to consider the amendments this evening, we should take every opportunity to amend the Bill. In that way we can try, to the extent that it is in our power, to prevent the greater dangers that lie ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08020545000090">The other aspect of leaving the balancing and explication of different rights to the Court rather than to the parliamentary process is that we cannot amend decisions when circumstances change or if we find that they are not what we wanted or what our constituents feel to be fundamentally fair, reasonable and right. The fact that we cannot amend them means, in turn, that we cannot take risks with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08020545000091">Those hon. Members who have expressed concern about economic rights should know that I would feel far more confident about granting economic rights to workers, say, if I knew that they could be withdrawn if they did not work out to their advantage. For example, I might fear that a change might turn out to price people out of a job rather than increase their well-being. If I knew that it could be revised, I should be much more willing to be generous about trying it out in the first place. Therefore, we have a choice: we can either throw caution to the winds, leave all decisions to the ECJ and hope that everything turns out all right, or we have to be terribly cautious about granting specific economic and other rights, for fear that we cannot change them if they work out badly. Whatever one&#146;s position in these matters&#151;whether one sides with the Labour Members who have spoken in the debate or with the neo-liberals to whom they have referred and of whom I assume that I am one&#151;I urge the House to say, &#147;Yes, we believe in rights, but ultimately they should be  <br>

 It is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), who made some telling points. I entirely accept that this House should have primacy wherever possible, but the backdrop to the debate is that our economy has escaped our national boundaries. Parliament no longer controls it, and there is no longer coterminosity between how an economy works and the nation state. That is why, as I mentioned in my contribution last week, I believe that there has to be some sort of supranational collaboration on economic matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08020545000093">However, I fear that an open and free internal market in goods, labour and capital will have consequences for social cohesion, and I want to set out the problems that can arise. The requirements of the internal market in the EU mean that labour should be able to move around the continent freely, in the same way as both capital and goods and services. That is fine, provided that there are appropriate and adequate social protections to prevent the breakdown of community cohesion, which I fear is the corollary of having a free market in labour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08020545000094">Yet it seems that the Government are allowing that breakdown to happen, which is why I want to return to the problematic and anomalous title IV in the charter of fundamental rights. The protocol makes the extraordinary statement that title IV, alone of all the other titles, will give rise to no additional justiciable rights in the UK. Why is that qualification attached only to title IV and not to any of the others? For an answer to that, we need to reflect a little on the history of that red line.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the former Prime Minister probably had little to fear from the interpretation provided by the ECJ, given that institution&#146;s previous judgments?

They were due to acquire additional labour rights after a year&#146;s employment, but as the deadline of 11 months, three weeks and six days approached, they were sacked. Within eight days, they were replaced: exactly the same number of employees were put into the same jobs, having been imported from Poland on agency labour contracts.</p>

and freedoms under the fundamental charter and not subjecting them to the same lock-out? It seems to me that the treaty deals with rights attached to collective bargaining and collective action that the Government have decided to put at arm&#146;s length and shove away from us, but other rights, such as the right of companies to establish themselves anywhere in the UK and to provide services anywhere in Europe, are not subject to the same lock-out. The position is anomalous and creates asymmetry; on the one hand, capital has rights to provide goods and services and to move across the continent, yet on the other hand there is a lock-down on the rights of workers to organise collectively should they be faced with oppressive management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08020545000107">That leads to the point about the ECJ that my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran  (Ms Clark) raised a few moments ago. The Court is apparently inhabited by a neo-liberal culture that attempts to give primacy to the needs of the free market and the internal market, with the open movement of labour, goods, services and capital, at the expense of collective bargaining rights. We have already heard reference to the Viking and Laval cases. I shall not go into them again, save to note that a contract made between an employer and an employee in Latvia now appears to have legal validity in the UK&#151;this also applies elsewhere&#151;should the company decide to bring Latvian workers to the UK. In considering the two cases in general terms, it appears to me that there is a series of rights, responsibilities and freedoms under the charter and that the Court&#151;a non-political body&#151;will be left to arbitrate between them. The Court will make political judgments in each case about which rights or freedoms should have priority. In the Viking and Laval cases, it is clear that the decisions taken by the Court gave primacy to the right of a company to establish itself and to provide services anywhere in the EU at the expense of the right to collective bargaining and collective action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08020545000108">Arguably, other case law in the ECJ and in the UK may contest the decisions in those two cases, but the opt-out on title IV, and the particular phrase in question, seems to give a clear nudge and wink to the ECJ that it is right to interpret the hierarchy of rights and responsibilities as it has so far, and that in the minds of at least the British and Polish Governments, it is right to give primacy to the rights of companies to trade, sometimes oppressively in relation to their work force, rather than to the right of workers to take collective action. I think the ECJ will regard that wording as more than a nod and a wink to say that it should continue making decisions such as those in the Viking and Laval cases and in others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08020545000109">In the absence of the proper debate I feel I was promised, I must press the Minister to address those specific points to give us some reassurance. A large number of Labour Members are concerned and every trade union in the country has endorsed the questions we are trying to ask. Without a satisfactory explanation, I fear that there is only one conclusion: the British Government, for whatever reason, have decided that the asymmetrical relationship between labour and capital that I described should continue, and that that asymmetry should work at the expense of labour and in favour of the interests of capital.</p>

No one in the House can give him an answer; we just do not know. All we know is that those rights will progressively cease to be a matter of contest between elected politicians but will be handed over to another jurisdiction and another court, which we do not control.

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para27"><a name="08020558000006">This is an unhappy outcome for the Government; all the way through the Convention on the Future of Europe they tried to prevent it. They tabled amendments, which were not successful, and there was a sorry series of retreats from assertions made, and indeed from promises given to the House, about the status of the charter&#151;that it would never be legally binding&#151;to giving in and now trying to make the best of a bad job. Of course, the Government had a veto over the whole process. They should have made their red lines clear at the start of the negotiations, rather than come up with self-selected red lines at the end to try to show that our rights and powers had been protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80205-0012.htm_para28"><a name="08020558000007">No one has answered the question, &#147;Why do we need the charter?&#148; The European convention on human rights is much older, dating back to 1950, and it is already embedded in the EU, which is required to give effect to its general principles. That is in article 6 of the treaty on European Union. Of course, all member states are signed up to the ECHR. It has not been explained why we need a separate, overlapping charter, with its own case law to create more confusion. In my view, it is part of the EU&#146;s determination always to have a monopoly on legal rights and legal order. It is contemptuous and suspicious of any other organisation, whether legal, social or political, that might be a competitor.</p>

That is a new right. When I was criticised on that point by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), I pointed out to him that I opposed the right because I believe that Parliament should restrain scientific research from time to time, in the interests of animal welfare and so on. He then said that he, too, was in favour of such matters being decided in Parliament, so he contradicted himself in the space of 15 seconds. Perhaps it is no surprise that he does not understand the issue.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I am short of time and cannot take too many interventions. We debated the matter to exhaustion. He could conclude only, rather lamely, that the House should decide such matters, but the whole point about the charter is that we will not decide. We are talking about a bald, unconditional right in the charter, derived from no other document, which takes decision making on those subjects away from the House. It is a matter of democracy, and if the hon. Gentleman refers to <i> Hansard</i>, he will see just how foolish his defence was.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08020558000012">There is also the remarkable saga of the opt-out claim to consider. The former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, often said that we had an opt-out, which was completely untrue. That was later corrected, but none  <br>

of the well-paid officials who helped him issued a correction at the time. The fact is that we do not have an opt-out from the protocol. The European Scrutiny Committee shows, certainly to my satisfaction, that the protocol gives no defence against rights finding their way back into UK law indirectly as a result of our overriding obligation to abide by European Union law. That obligation is asserted elsewhere in the treaty that we are considering, and indeed in existing treaties. The European Scrutiny Committee shows that the protocol on which the Government constantly rely is threadbare. It is certainly fatally weakened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08020558000013">The rights are incredibly general. Human dignity and physical integrity are again supported, and, in general terms, who could be against those concepts? However, they have great relevance to the debate on abortion. Whatever one&#146;s views on abortion, I think that we all agree that decisions on the subject should be made by representative Parliaments. We can contrast that with the situation in the United States, where such issues are a matter for judicial decision. That is one of the reasons why people there shoot doctors and try to blow up abortion clinics. Decisions on whether abortion should be restricted or available on demand are, as a constitutional right, made by the Supreme Court, and cannot be changed by Congress; that would require an amendment to the constitution, which is incredibly difficult and cumbersome to achieve. Removing decision making on that subject from the congressional sphere creates more frustration, and less democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08020558000014">Exactly the same is true of respect for family life and the right to found a family; they sound fine, but they could easily be applied to issues that the House spends a great deal of time debating, such as the rights of asylum seekers and the extent to which they can be reunited with family members in other countries. At present, they generally cannot be so reunited. Would we like it if debates in the House became irrelevant because such issues were decided for us? The same is true of social rights&#151;the so-called chapter IV rights&#151;which are constantly, and rightly, raised by Labour Members. Those issues should be a matter of contest between ourselves. It is quite wrong that a decision about whether they are adjudicated on in the European Court of Justice depends on whether the protocol is strong, weak, or threadbare, or can be relied on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08020558000015">We know that the European Court of Justice is an activist, interventionist court with its own dynamic. As I pointed out in an intervention, it is not neutral in any dispute between a member state and the European Union institutions. If the treaty is ratified, the ECJ will be required by treaty law to practise mutual sincere co-operation. I would never go to court if I knew that the court had to practise mutual sincere co-operation with my legal opponent, but that is the situation in Europe. If our protocol is under attack from the European Union, the arbitrating court has a duty to co-operate not with the member state but with the Commission, or whatever the European Union constitution involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08020558000017">The charter, however, does something quite different: it drills down into member states&#146; law-making processes. It will interfere with and replace decisions that we should make here. It is a further massive transfer of power and authority from the House to another jurisdiction, and people know that. They will cease to come and lobby us about their rights&#151;about whether those rights should be extended, or whether the competing rights of, say, employers and employees should be removed or strengthened. They will not bother to do that. They will not vote for us if they know that those essential decisions are not made by us in Parliament. There is evidence that that already happens. There is disillusionment with the political process.</p>

The disillusionment is continent wide. The public are simply losing faith in the ability of elected people to influence decisions and outcomes affecting their lives. Again, in the section of the treaty that we are discussing, we are being invited to transfer more powers from the House. The Government were well aware of that danger, and that is precisely why they fought the proposals all the way through the Convention process. The Convention became the constitution, and when that was turned down, the Government fought the proposals in the new treaty. The safeguards and reassurances given are almost worthless; that is the conclusion of the European Scrutiny Committee&#146;s report. That is why I invite the House to support the amendment this evening.</p>

First, to what extent will British workers be denied the opportunity to rely on the charter to interpret and expand existing rights derived from Community law? If British workers are unable to rely on the charter, is it conceivable that EU rights will have a diluted status in the UK? Secondly, to what extent are British workers protected when they take industrial action that an employer claims violates his or her right to freedom of establishment? Is it enough that the workers have complied with domestic law, or is their action vulnerable to legal restraint?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08020558000021">Thirdly, to what extent are British workers at a disadvantage compared with workers in other member states by virtue of the fact that they are unable to rely on the charter as a defence in legal proceedings against them by an employer who claims that their action violates EU law? In effect, does the opt-out prioritise business rights over UK workers&#146; rights, as a number of my colleagues mentioned earlier?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08020558000022">Fourthly, we must assume that the charter is designed to add value to existing rights and principles in European law. If it does not, what is the point of it? What do the Government believe has been added and what do they believe will not be applicable in the United Kingdom?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08020558000023">To pursue those topics, I shall go back to the Laval and Viking cases&#151;important European case law that emerged only at the end of last year, after the signing of what was initially the opt-out and subsequently became the protocol. They have profound implications for European labour law and specifically for this country, with its history of legal abstention, in respect of the role of the law in industrial relations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08020558000024">Viking Line is a Finnish ferry company that decided in 2003 to reflag its vessel and employ an Estonian crew on Estonian pay and conditions, cutting its wage costs by some 60 per cent. The case was referred to the European Court of Justice, which ruled that in future any strike action affecting this freedom would have to meet stringent legal tests that the Court itself would assess. The key issue, which I find unprecedented, is that no longer does the legitimacy of industrial action rest upon the democratic mandate of the Union derived from its members and regulated through laws determined by the Parliaments of member states. Now it will also need to meet the criteria imposed and assessed by European judges. I see no precedent in domestic strike law in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para13"><a name="08020558000025">The Laval case is central. As my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet (Colin Burgon) mentioned, Laval is a Latvian company, which in 2004 posted workers from Latvia to work on building sites in Sweden. The Swedish construction union asked the company to agree to the existing collective agreement within the building sector. The company refused, operating instead under the Latvian agreement, including a lower pay scale that undercut the Swedish workers&#146; wages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08020558000026">Subsequently the Court ruled, essentially, that the company&#146;s freedom to provide services in any member state should not be restricted by compliance with non-statutory collective bargaining agreements in one member state. Again, that has huge implications for an industrial relations system that is built on legal abstention and free collective bargaining, as in the British case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08020558000027">Critically, the Court argued that because the EU posted workers directive set out minimum rights, it was unreasonable to force the company to comply with further non-statutory agreements at local or national level. So, instead of EU legislation setting minimum standards, which has been the argument over the past 20 years, going back to 1988 and Jacques Delors coming to the TUC, we now face the threat of those standards being seen as maximum criteria across the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para16"><a name="08020558000028">All of us on the Labour Benches should be acutely aware of the implications for further labour market deregulation. Those two cases, among others, give rise to widespread concern that in recent case law the EU has been engaged in a race to the bottom in terms of labour market standards. Indeed, it could be argued that the very notion of a social dimension to the European project, a cornerstone of the Labour party&#146;s strategy over the past 20 years, is under threat. That deserves profound discussion in this place, not least  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para17"><a name="08020558000029">Let me deal specifically with the protocol and workers&#146; rights.

However, I understand the Minister&#146;s position that this is not an opt-out, and I hope that she will make it clear in her reply that it will not affect the way that the title IV rights are applied to EU law. That has been the approach throughout the Committee stage, but we need to hear a far broader outline of the Government&#146;s position as there is confusion about that on all sides.</p>

That article deals with maximum working hours. I hope that the Minister will clarify that the protocol was not negotiated with a view to evading the article 31 rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08020558000033">A particularly important question for the labour movement is the purpose of paragraph 2 of article 1 of the protocol, which has been quoted extensively during the debate. It states:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08020558000034">In short, title IV is singled out for a unique provision within the protocol. Title IV, as we know, is the section of the charter entitled &#147;Solidarity&#148; and it contains what we would call workers&#146; rights, such as the right to information and consultation at work, the right to collective bargaining and collective action, protection from unjustified dismissal, fair and just working conditions, the prohibition of child labour, and so on. This provision has never been fully explained in the House. In fact, when the former Prime Minister reported back in his statement of 25 June last year he mysteriously omitted the words &#147;Title IV of&#148; when reading out the protocol to hon. Members. Perhaps he simply made an inexplicable error of fact, but we need to explore the Government&#146;s reasoning more fully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08020558000035">As I understand it, the existing charter was referred to by the Advocate-General in recent BECTU litigation extending paid holidays to people with less than 13 weeks&#146; service. It is unclear whether this will be possible in future in the British context, or whether any attempts to use the charter in this way would breach the provisions of the protocol stating that charter rights are not</p>

The last point was raised by the European Scrutiny Committee of the House of Commons, and according to the Committee, the charter could be used to challenge the implementation of the working time directive, as in the BECTU case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para27"><a name="08020558000041">That might also happen in one of the other member states, but because of the opt-out it may not be possible to mount such a challenge from the United Kingdom, where arguably the need is most acute, given the long hours culture. This gives rise to the possibility that established rights under EC law could have diluted content in the United Kingdom&#151;a view reinforced by the Committee&#146;s apparent concern that ECJ decisions on social policy in cases involving other countries could creep into UK law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para28"><a name="08020558000042">Perhaps the fundamental question is whether it is acceptable, especially for a Labour Government, to put workers&#146; rights on a different footing from the freedoms of employers, which are contained in title II and are thus not covered by paragraph 2. I would like to think that the Government will not in future seek to celebrate the way in which they have excluded British workers from protections afforded to European workers, and that they will not make a virtue of this to the CBI and the press. We need to be sure that title IV does not have some kind of separate status from the rest of the charter. I am worried that a clever corporate lawyer might try to argue that, as the protocol states only that title IV cannot create new justiciable rights, by implication title II can therefore do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para29"><a name="08020558000043">This is an important matter for the Minister to clarify. Many of the counter-arguments that I have heard so far seem to amount to saying that the provision makes no difference whatever. Either way, many of us would also like to hear why such an apparently specific proviso was ever negotiated in the first place and, perhaps more importantly, that workers&#146; rights will not be treated in that way in future. </p>

the charter was a wonderful document, and that British interests lay in being fully protected from it. He also told us that we needed the charter because the European Union had not acceded to the convention on human rights, and that, when it did, we would need the charter all the more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para30"><a name="08020558000045">My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells posed an extremely apt question when he asked why we needed the charter at all. We have a sneaking suspicion that concern for human rights is only a secondary motive, and that the primary motive is for the European Union to put itself in the position of a state. Like a state, it would then have a constitution accompanied by a list of fundamental rights with itself as the guarantor of those rights for its citizens and, again like a state, it would sign up to the European convention on human rights alongside the 47 states that have already signed up to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para31"><a name="08020558000046">If that is not the European Union&#146;s motive, why is the EU framing such a sweeping statement of rights in the charter? Let us remember that the charter will be directly and legally binding for European institutions and member states when implementing Union law. That being the case, why, under chapter I of the charter, do we need to be protected against slavery, torture and execution? Opposition Members sometimes question the activities of the European institutions, but I have yet to hear anyone suggest that we need to be protected against the risk of the European Union imposing inhuman or degrading treatment on us or putting us into forced labour or servitude. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) told me that the Liberal Democrats were interested in the charter having full effect in this country, unconstrained by the protocol&#151;perhaps they know something about it that we do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80205-0013.htm_para32"><a name="08020558000047">Could these proposals also be a pointer towards the day when the EU seeks a more active foreign and security policy? Could the statement of rights serve as a rationale for the foreign policy initiatives that the European Union might wish to take? We need only look at the clauses on foreign and security policy to see the extent of the EU&#146;s ambitions in this direction. Could we be looking at the foundation for gradual moves in the direction of a European defence policy and of incipient policing, criminal law and anti-terrorism policies directed towards other states and based on these sweeping assertions of human rights?</p>

 It would be a sad day if that were to happen, because the Council of Europe goes much further into Europe and has a much better provenance and a much better history, but who knows just how far the ambitions of the European Union extend in that direction? As far as our Government are concerned, the question is where we stand in relation to all this. As we have heard, the Prime Minister has stated that we were going to have an opt-out or that, if there were no opt-out, the treaty would not extend our laws any further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80205-0014.htm_para0"><a name="08020558000050">There are three points that I would like the Minister to address. First, will the charter be used by the Commission as a basis for proposing legislation in new areas? Will the protocol take effect against new rights in legislative proposals derived from the charter by the Commission? We apprehend that the Commission will take the charter as an inspiration for its policies, because it has said as much in setting out its fundamental principles in the charter. So could the charter indirectly import new rights into United Kingdom law through new legislation derived from it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80205-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08020558000051">Secondly, we are told that the protocol will not allow the charter to extend rights beyond those already recognised in the UK. Let us look at this matter from the opposite point of view from the one rightly adopted by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, however, and ask how easy it would be to decide exactly what rights were already recognised here. If a right were already deemed to be in existence here, the European Court of Justice would have full scope to interpret the charter in the United Kingdom. And who would make all the decisions on these matters? It would of course be the European Court of Justice itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="80205-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08020558000052">May I give the Minister an example? Article 49 of the charter sets out a right in respect of the proportionality of criminal offences and penalties. It states:</p>
<a name="80205-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="08020558000092"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The severity of penalties must not be disproportionate to the criminal offence.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80205-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08020558000053">Can the Minister tell us whether this is already recognised in United Kingdom law? Do we have the right not to have a disproportionate penalty applied to a criminal offence? If so, will not the European Court of Justice be able to rule on these matters in the United Kingdom in the relevant circumstances when dealing with Union law? Will the Minister tell us whether this right is already recognised in the United Kingdom?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80205-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08020558000054">Thirdly, there is an equally important point about the interpretation of decisions taken by the European Court of Justice in member states in which the charter has full effect, and about whether those decisions will have effect in the United Kingdom. We have already heard arguments on this point, but I want to put it to the Minister again because the Government have yet to deny that that will be the case. They certainly did not go that far in their response to the European Scrutiny Committee. Will the Minister tell us whether decisions taken by the European Court in the countries where the charter has full force will be effective in United Kingdom law as part of the acquis of the European Court of Justice&#151;yes or no?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80205-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08020558000055">Who has the final right of decision on whether a right already exists in United Kingdom law and how far such a right goes, and on whether decisions relating to other member states will affect this country? The answer is the European Court of Justice, and there is no appeal beyond the Court. Its decision is final on these matters. The House must face up to the fact that we are locking ourselves into a situation in which the final decision will be taken by the European Court of Justice. My right hon. Friends the Members for Wells and for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) have made extremely valuable points on these matters. Given the breadth of the charter and the rights that it contains, the ambit of the jurisdiction of the European Court of  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80205-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08020558000056">My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells raised the very apt example of abortion. Article 3 of the charter sets out the right to the integrity of the person. If the European Court of Justice were to interpret such matters that far, they could be decided by that provision. Some constituents came to see me the other day about the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill. They asked me how I was going to vote on it, and went through the arguments with me. In future, are we to say to our constituents, &#147;It&#146;s all very well you coming to see me, but at the end of the day, these decisions will be taken by the European Court of Justice, not as a result of arguments or votes in the House of Commons but as a result of arguments and decisions put forward by lawyers and judges in the European Court of Justice&#148;? What effect would that have on the standing of this House?</p>

I have no doubts about the resilience of the European Union, but I am afraid that I do have fears for the health of the democratic principle, both in the European Union and in this country. Let no one in this House be under any illusion about the extent of the authority, power and decision making that they are about to cede to European Union institutions&#151;particularly the European Court of Justice&#151;as a result of the decisions that we are taking this day. We are abdicating an important part of our historical role as the guardian of the rights of the people of this country.

 I am extremely glad that the right hon. Gentleman is going on a historical journey, because I should like to make this point. What was the most important question raised in the 19th century? It was about the right to vote and democracy, for which people such as John Bright, a member of my family, fought. It is precisely because the arrangements that we are discussing go in exactly the opposite direction, and give power to the European Court of Justice, that I completely reject them.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman cares to examine what John Bright and his great friend Cobden did, he will find that they were huge supporters of free trade and rightly argued for international institutions that would open countries up to it. However, we cannot have good words and nice policies unless we have a mechanism of enforcement, and since day one of the European Economic Community, the European Court of Justice has been that enforcement mechanism. I fully accept the points made by my hon. Friends about the Laval and Viking cases, but on balance the Court has been good for workers and for Europe. If we adopted the Opposition amendment, we would throw out the proverbial European Court of Justice baby with the bathwater of the whole European Union.</p>

Many are in Council of Europe conventions, into which we freely enter. It is preposterous to say that we accept legal rulings from the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights, but that we do not want them to be applied in the European Union through the European Court of Justice.</p>

 As the right hon. Gentleman knows, there has been a lot of debate about whether we should have a home-grown Bill of Rights; indeed, his Government are interested in the idea. I have heard Ministers say repeatedly how undesirable it would be to have a rewording of the European convention on human rights in our own Bill of Rights, because that might lead to future conflict. However, is not exactly that proposed by the adoption of the charter of fundamental rights? It does very much the same thing.</p>

For example, we had some discussion about the relationship between the ECJ and the Strasbourg Court&#151;I shall call it that for the sake of shorthand&#151;on the question of Gibraltar. This sovereign House of Commons denied the people of Gibraltar their right to vote in European Parliament elections. When they fought and struggled for it, it was the Spanish Government who took the issue up with the European Court of Justice. However, the Gibraltarians had already gone to the European Court of Human Rights and the ECJ accepted the superiority of the ECHR on that matter. We then legislated to allow Gibraltarians to vote in the Spanish regional constituency of the European Parliament. There will be that tension; of course there will.</p>

Member for Hitchin and Harpenden gave a marvellous example of the Court backing away from an alarming ruling that would have damaged Europe&#146;s standing in Britain before the Bill on the Maastricht treaty&#151;I would have thought that how that Bill was handled did quite enough damage to Europe&#146;s standing in Britain, but no matter. Such dynamisms exist. To take an example, each country has highly specific national sets of labour rights. In Germany,  1.5 million Bemtern&#151;full-time public employees&#151;have no right to strike under the German constitution. That cannot be changed by reference to the right to strike in the European charter of fundamental rights because the horizontal national protection language written into it was put in at the behest of Germany.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80205-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08020558000074">France has a completely different approach on issues such as minimum service in the event of strikes. In France, only five trade unions are recognised to sign contracts. Even if a 500,000-strong union went on strike every day, it would have no legal existence under French law. That will not be altered. To that extent, I agree with the points made about the protocol. It is a strengthening of the horizontal provisions in the charter of fundamental rights, but it is not an opt-out. The decision was made to go down that road for political reasons.</p>

I have exchanged correspondence with Mr. Lambert, the director general of the CBI, on the issue and I think that having extracted that, the CBI had a duty to reciprocate and campaign for the ratification of the treaty in Parliament.

I do a little speaking here and there at international economic conferences in Europe and elsewhere. At meetings in America, and at some of the more business-focused meetings in Europe, the European Union is regarded as a bunch of communist, lefty social-welfarists. It is thought that we in the EU, far from being neo-liberals, are far too soft on social matters. Perhaps my right hon. Friend should read article 2 of the new treaty, which says:</p>

The European Court of Justice has, on the whole, been positive for workers and employees. Only last week, it gave a ruling&#151;not a full decision&#151;on the rights of employees in Britain to be able to look after handicapped children. Some vicious, ugly firm refused a mother the right to go and look after a handicapped child, and the case went up to the European Court of Justice, which has said that employers should behave properly. We can look at provisions under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 and some of the rulings on working hours. We can look at&#151;this is a matter of deep concern to me and my constituents&#151;the rulings on the pensions stolen from steel and engineering workers, where, again, a ruling from the ECJ has forced our Government, rather late in the day, to step up to the mark and provide justice for those workers.</p>

The German Social Democratic party is now dropping its opposition and going in that direction. This is not a nirvana of high wages, but it writes into a national legal obligation what the ECJ then cannot rule against. We should be careful about objections to the country of origin principle. When I was Minister for Europe, one of my most pressing problems was trying to get European law applied to British citizens working in different countries who found all sorts of little social protectionist rackets that stopped  <br>

They are not so in this country; they are not so anywhere. The very concept of justice is based on separation of powers. The Conservatives want a European Union from which it can pick and choose the bits that it wants to support. The gist of the speech by the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) was, &#147;Let others go further forward, but we can stop where we are.&#148; I do not particularly dissent from that, but believe me, if we want to pick and choose what we like, then other countries can say, &#147;We don&#146;t like Ryanair and easyJet landing&#148;, or &#147;We don&#146;t want the environmental rules that Britain is fighting for to be applied to our nation.&#148; If we want Britain to have an effect and a voice in the European Union, we have to accept that in relation to other countries.</p>

That is why I hope that the Government will be supported tonight, and that is why the world, reading this debate, will realise how deeply reactionary and regressive today&#146;s Conservative party is in turning its back on its history of supporting international rights.</p>

If that letter does not find its way there, with a placed copy in the Library, we will know that the Minister agrees that there are indeed new rights. As my right hon.

We know that many of the votes on that legislation will be free votes for Members of this House because they are on conscience matters, and we know about the passions that will be engaged in our constituents on several of those important issues.

point of it, and if there is no point to it, why on earth are we effectively putting it into British law?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80205-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08020560000010">Some other incredibly important articles could have a huge impact on our domestic policy. Article 21 of the charter states that there should be no discrimination on the grounds of nationality. That is not limited to European states, as I read it; it means that there should be no discrimination on the grounds of nationality at all. That will have a huge impact on and wide-ranging consequences for our benefit system and our tax system. Again, it might transfer huge amounts of power from this House&#151;people accountable to our electors&#151;to judges. What the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) said about all judges not being accountable is not entirely true. Many judges in the United States are accountable because they are elected, so they have to listen; that is not a very good idea. I do not want people who have to worry about what electors think to make decisions in criminal cases. The right hon. Gentleman made that point about judges and it is not true.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="80205-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08020560000011">I do not want us to give rights and powers to take important decisions that should rest with this House to people who are not elected and are unaccountable. The right hon. Gentleman raises his eyebrows, but that is what the charter does. If it does not, it has no effect at all, in which case there is no point in bringing it into law. The Lord Chancellor seemed to be trying to have it both ways, as was ably pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="80205-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08020560000012">I draw hon. Members&#146; attention to article 50, which is the right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings&#151;the double jeopardy principle. The UK Government have already amended the rules on that, and one can take one&#146;s own view on it&#151;it would allow the killers of Damilola Taylor to be brought to justice&#151;but such a decision would not be possible if that article were enforced. Such decisions are matters for this House, and for Ministers who are accountable, but we will be handing those decisions over to people who are not accountable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80205-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08020560000013">Finally, I would like to pick up the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere finished on. From discussions over the past few weeks we have seen the regard in which hon. Members are held. People will only turn out in elections when they think that there is something significant at stake. We saw that in the French presidential elections, where there was a clear choice between the two candidates and turnout reached 80 per cent. I suspect we will see something similar&#151;perhaps not as high as 80 per cent.&#151;in the US presidential election this year. There will be a clear choice. We have already seen a significant number of voters turning out in the Democratic primaries who have not turned out before. The people they are electing can make a real difference and there is a real choice to be had.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80205-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08020560000014">In this country, we have seen turnout decline. I hope that voters will think that there is real choice at the next general election and that there will be a competitive election in which turnout goes up. But if electors think that the decisions they take in those elections and that the people&#151;and the Ministers&#151;they send here are increasingly unable to alter either the way in which our laws are made or the direction of our country, they will become even more disillusioned. They will not come  <br>

and talk to us, they will not vote in elections and they will increasingly turn their attention to hiring lawyers and fighting cases in front of the European Court of Justice. That would be not a welcome step but a retrograde one. It is exactly what will happen if we cede these powers, which is why I want the House to support the amendment standing in the name of my right hon. and hon. Friends.</p>

The court found against OLAF, so there are places to which one can go in the European Union if the European Court of Justice denies one&#146;s human rights.

Article 4 of chapter I is entitled, &#147;Prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#148;. Such a prohibition may not exist in some countries that might be considering joining the European Union. Holding up as a flagship guarantee a provision that people cannot be abused, tortured or punished inhumanely by their Governments will attract people to share our view of Europe, rather than that which some other regimes currently hold.</p>

Paragraph 28 of our third report of the 2007-08 Session, which was published after taking evidence from Ministers, states:</p>

If we rejected the treaty, we would deny the charter to every other country and trade unionist in Europe. Some need it much more desperately than our unions. It is a question of solidarity. The trade union movement should not be afraid of the impact on human rights or workers&#146; rights through accepting the treaty, for which I shall vote.</p>

There is no doubt that the advice that the European Scrutiny Committee has given Parliament is valid. If matters continue the way they are, the Government, who believe&#151;probably not sincerely because they did not want the charter in the first place&#151;that they are managing to put a roadblock in the charter&#146;s way, will end up having to accept it.</p>

 The brevity of my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) always comes when he makes those points with which I most agree. He is right in his analysis of the debate. It is extraordinary that the quality of the debate rose dramatically when the Lord Chancellor sat down. Until then, we were treated to a characteristic campaign of explanation that the charter was a wonderful, innocuous document and that those who could not appreciate its merits suffered from the usual Conservative paranoid delusions about its content.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80205-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08020567000005">We had to wait until the end of the debate to hear the hon.

We know from listening to the debate between hon. Members in the same political parties that the subject can provoke interesting discussion on a topic of great importance for this country&#146;s future. The Lord Chancellor&#151;and Government Front Benchers generally&#151;does not want anyone to realise that that discussion is happening. If I have a complaint about the process of these debates, whether today&#146;s debate or last week&#146;s debate on criminal justice, it is that those on the Treasury Bench reduce the issues to a series of facile soundbites and show an unwillingness to engage, but then complain when the public exhibit what they describe as &#147;signs of paranoia&#148;. I have to say that I might start to become a bit paranoid if I saw individuals systematically attempting to obfuscate and missing the point so much. </p>

I disagree with him about that. The reason, which I mentioned in my intervention on the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane), to whom I shall return, is that we have to ask ourselves what the charter&#146;s purpose is. Let us forget about our protocol for a moment, and ask why the charter is there and what it is designed to achieve.</p>

Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher), all of whom raised their deep concern about the extent to which the European Union&#146;s agenda might be harmful to some of the social policy issues that they want to promote.

detail of that debate, but they were right to highlight the potential impact of European Union laws and policies in areas of concern to them. Again, the Government&#146;s unwillingness to engage with the issue troubles me very much, because it is plainly relevant to how the European Union develops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80205-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08020567000008">I return to the point that we have in the European convention on human rights a document that commands total acceptance in all parts of the House, to which all European countries that are members of the EU are adherents and which provides a well established formula for defining human rights, in wording that is different from the charter of fundamental rights. The point is not just that the charter has extra text covering rights that are not covered by the ECHR&#151;that might be an interesting topic of debate&#151;but that the wording is different. If the Government are so insistent, in their project to introduce a new Bill of Rights, that they are going to keep the ECHR text within the Human Rights Act 1998 because they do not wish to differ from it, that prompts the question, which remains unanswered: why are they so comfortable with the European Union doing the very thing that they do not wish to see done domestically? I hope very much that the Minister will rise to the occasion and deal with that point.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The situation raises difficulties of interpretation. I am not saying that there are no arguments to the contrary; what I am saying is that the Government should say why the arguments that they have put forward in the context of a potential domestic Bill of Rights, which they have indicated they wish to introduce, apparently do not need to be considered in the context of the charter of fundamental rights. As yet we have received no answer whatever to that question, because the debate has, I am afraid, so frequently been reduced to such facile levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="80205-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08020567000011">The second issue is the protocol and the impact of the charter of fundamental rights on our national legal and parliamentary processes. The Government negotiated the protocol for some purpose. However, having listened to what those on the Treasury Bench have said on the matter, one begins to think that the protocol is merely a fig leaf, whereas it was originally sold as a protection. The protection that the Government wanted concerned their anxiety to persuade the public in the UK that the charter could not be used to have an impact on, effectively, domestic legal areas.</p>

Government opt into any of them. Again, we have yet to hear any explanation from the Lord Chancellor or the Minister of how the Government think that will operate in practice. If the protocol is in fact worthless&#151;as in my view it is&#151;there will be instances where the European Union and the European Court of Justice will use the charter of fundamental rights to affect the development of UK domestic law in areas such as criminal justice to which we have opted in. It may be argued that that is a good thing; indeed, some Government Members, and certainly Liberal Democrat Members, seem to think that that would be a good development. However, the issue at least merits some debate, which is the very thing that we have not had from the Government.</p>

The level of protection of fundamental rights across the Union was never intended to be, and cannot be, changed by the charter, for the simple reason that the charter reflects only existing rights already recognised in the Union, which in some circumstances do no more than restate&#151;and are subject to&#151;domestic legislation.</p>

They clearly state that the charter is aimed at EU institutions and member states only as they are implementing EU law. In addition, the official explanations, which indicate the source of the rights and principles contained in the charter, have been published together with the charter in the Official Journal of the European Union. I have already mentioned article 6, which states that due regard must be given to those explanations. By setting out the   <br>

sources of and limits of the provisions in the charter, the explanations show that it does not create any new rights, but simply reaffirms rights that are already recognised in the law of the Union and in member states&#146; own national laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80205-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08020567000026">The combination of those three measures&#151;the wording of article 6, the horizontal articles and the official explanations&#151;makes the charter&#146;s scope and interpretation absolutely clear. However, we listened to concerns expressed about, in particular, the charter&#146;s alleged interference with United Kingdom labour and social laws, and for the avoidance of any doubt we negotiated a fourth safeguard. It consists of a binding protocol, originally proposed by and for the United Kingdom but later extended to Poland. My right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor went into some detail about the content of the protocol, and I shall not repeat what he said.</p>

<p><a name="st_o346"><a name="08020567000027"><a name="80205-0016.htm_spnew7"><a name="08020567001138"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 Perhaps the Minister will answer a question put to the Lord Chancellor that he did not really address. If a country that does not have the benefit of the protocol takes a case to the European Court of Justice, which, on the basis of the charter, makes a decision, why will that decision not become part of EU law, and therefore applicable to the United Kingdom under our general EU treaty obligations?</p>

<p><a name="st_o347"><a name="08020567000028"><a name="80205-0016.htm_spnew8"><a name="08020567001139"><b>Bridget Prentice:</b>
 That issue was raised a number of times by Opposition Members, which surprised me, given that the ECJ&#146;s decisions have been binding since 1957 and the original treaty. They will continue to be binding in the same way.</p>

<p><a name="st_o348"><a name="08020567000029"><a name="80205-0016.htm_spnew9"><a name="08020567001140"><b>Mr. Grieve:</b>
 Will the Minister give way?</p>

<p><a name="st_o349"><a name="08020567000030"><a name="80205-0016.htm_spnew10"><a name="08020567001141"><b>Bridget Prentice:</b>
 Very briefly.</p>

<p><a name="st_o350"><a name="08020567000031"><a name="80205-0016.htm_spnew11"><a name="08020567001142"><b>Mr. Grieve:</b>
 If I may say so, the Minister has not answered the question that she has just been asked. It was a very specific question, to which, surely, the only answer can be that in such circumstances the protocol provides no protection whatsoever, because the charter will have been applied in this country through its incorporation in European Union law in a decision concerning another country.</p>

<p><a name="st_o351"><a name="08020567000032"><a name="80205-0016.htm_spnew12"><a name="08020567001143"><b>Bridget Prentice:</b>
 Again, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s premise is false. No new rights have been created. Let me say to him, and also to the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) and the hon. Member for Aylesbury, that the protocol&#146;s meaning and wording are very clear and that it is legally binding. It puts beyond doubt the fact that the charter simply cannot extend the powers of the courts to strike down UK laws, and that it does not introduce new justiciable rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80205-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08020567000033">My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) said that the ECJ would be subservient to the European Court of Human Rights, and he is absolutely right. The Court&#146;s primacy in setting European rights and standards remains. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) said that we had a great story to tell on human rights, and that we should tell it loud and clear. I agree, and on that basis I commend the motion to the House.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Colleagues and I have come back at this stage in the proceedings in the hope that at some stage you or your colleague in the Chair might select motion 46 on the Order Paper, which is the instruction to the Committee. I would be grateful to know whether there is any way in which, were you minded to do so, we could be given notice earlier than now so that the House was aware that the motion was coming down the track, as it were. Can you confirm that Standing Order No. 66, which the Speaker and your colleagues have determined governs this situation uniquely, not only would allow the selection of such an instruction at this stage, but would not prevent earlier notice that it was in the mind of the Speaker to select it?</p>

Last night, I watched a fascinating programme on the history of the atom. It contained things that I almost could not understand, but one thing I grasped was that according to those enormous brains&#151;Mr. Feynman, Mr. Gell-Mann, Mr. Dirac, Mr. Einstein and all the others&#151;there is a notion of virtual reality.</p>

interesting lawyers that there is no doubt that the charter of fundamental rights will be made applicable in the UK sooner or later by the European Court of Justice. It will catch up with the Government, just as the working time directive caught up with us despite my attempts to get my Government to understand in the 1980s that that would happen. Why was I right? It was not because of any stroke of genius, but simply because I know the ways of the ECJ.</p>

I shall go further and say that I have the gravest reservations about how the ECHR has impinged on the essential question.

be applied another way, under the aegis of the treaty of Lisbon and the general principles of the Union&#146;s law, as set out in article 6(3). All the abstruse debate, none of which will get into the press or be discussed in the media, is about one simple problem&#151;that is, that the people of this country are being profoundly deceived by the idea that this Bill is innocuous and will not have a dramatic effect on their daily lives, but it will.</p>

 It is not only doublethink, but&#151;if I may, somewhat presumptuously, add a little bit to George Orwell&#151;double cross. That is all part of the problem. There is an assumption that, because nobody is going to listen to any of these debates and because the Benches are so empty, this does not matter. It matters very much indeed, however. The European Scrutiny Committee&#151;on which I have the honour to sit with my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and others who are in the Chamber tonight&#151;has done this country a service by revealing the truth, which the Government cannot dispute. I shall be fascinated to hear how the Minister for Europe responds to the debate, because he knows that as this process progresses, and as the curve begins to come back to reality, this will catch up with the Government, just as the working time directive did under our own Government.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making an extremely convincing case. On his point about the increasing effects of the treaty on our everyday lives, should we not see the operation of the charter and the European Court of Justice in conjunction with the increasing competence of the European Union? For example, the treaty will enable such increases to happen in the fields of judicial and home affairs and in many other areas as well. As the reach of European Union law and European Union action are increased, by the same token will not the reach of the European Court of Justice be extended, as well as its effect on people&#146;s everyday lives?</p>

 My hon. Friend is completely right; this is an evolving dynamic. New rights are being created by these provisions, although that is denied by the Government. Every time the European Union accumulates functions, it claims that this does not involve the creation of new rights. In 1972, we agreed to go into a thing called the European Community, but the accumulation of functions since then has changed the dynamic. Similarly, if one were to have spoken about the need for democratic reform in 1848, it would not have been the same as talking about democracy in 1888, 1928 or 1948. To go back to my earlier analogy about the atom, we have now started to move into a quark-like environment in which we are actually going backwards. Our democracy is being devoured in this new virtual reality that is being created. People need to think hard about this.</p>

Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) was talking about the great 19th century reformers. I do not want to make a big issue of it, but it so happens that one member of my family, John Bright, fought tenaciously and successfully for the right of the man in the street to have the vote. Every single person in the country would support that now, but there was huge resistance to it in those days. Those rights were established within the then Liberal party&#151;not this completely vacuous, insipid abstraction called the Liberal Democrat party today&#151;which, in those days, actually fought for people&#146;s rights. People now talk about rights but they do not act to achieve them. That is the problem.</p>

 I suggest that the hon. Gentleman is demonstrating the doublethink that he earlier decried, and I will explain that. He quite rightly said that democracy evolves over time, and he gave the examples of 1848 and the achievement of universal adult male suffrage. The achievement of the vote for women happened in my mother&#146;s lifetime. However, he then said that he wanted to wind democracy back to  31 December 1971. He is absolutely right to say that it is an evolving dynamic. Democracy changes, and the European Court of Justice is subject to a democratic process, just as the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords is. It is simply a different democratic process. These things are evolving.</p>

There is a world of difference between saying that we want to be able to legislate for ourselves and facing up to the fact that that presents certain constitutional problems in the light of the European Communities Act 1972. However, before I get to that, and because my main concern is about the rights of the people of this country to have the vote and to be able to use it properly, I should like to refer to chapter 5 of the charter. It talks about citizens&#146; rights, and mentions the</p>

ones, not complementary to them. That makes a substantial difference. I do not want to labour the point, but a new citizenship is being created. It fills in the gaps about which I remember complaining to my Government during the proceedings on the Maastricht treaty. I vividly remember that that treaty said that, as has been developed by the dynamics of other treaties since, the citizens&#146; rights will be subject to such rights, powers and duties as shall be developed in due course.</p>

 As I voted against it more often than any other Member of Parliament, my answer is yes, I certainly do. It was a fundamental and dreadful mistake. I also happen to believe that we have moved on since then and that the Conservative party is united in opposition to the Lisbon treaty. As far as I am concerned, everything is moving extremely well in the right direction. The hon. Gentleman will find that the problems he has just identified in this treaty&#151;he did that by referring to the Maastricht treaty, which is part of it&#151;will hit his party very hard on the head in due course.

There are Labour Members who would like the charter to apply, but we Conservatives do not want it to apply to the United Kingdom. I should like to touch on a number of important cases that need to be taken into account. The first is Macarthys Ltd <i> v</i>. Smith, on which the famous Lord Denning sat. He said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80205-0019.htm_para6"><a name="08020569000076">It is important to bear in mind the fact that there is only one way of achieving this, on all the analyses that have ever been put forward with any serious purpose. In the famous Factortame case, we got stuck, in relation to the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, by not including the words:</p>
<a name="80205-0019.htm_brev4"><a name="08020569000111"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Notwithstanding...the European Communities Act 1972&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="80205-0019.htm_para7"><a name="08020569000077">As Lord Bridge said in his judgment, the British Government decided in 1972 that they would agree voluntarily to accept the arrangements for the European Union under sections 2 and 3 of the European Communities Act 1972, and therefore, because they had agreed to it voluntarily, unless and until they were either to repeal or amend it, it was for all practical purposes the duty of the senior court in the United Kingdom, the House of Lords, to strike down that Act. So in the pursuance of a European Union policy and a judgment of the European Court of Justice, they struck down an Act of Parliament that had been passed by this House. That is a very serious matter. If we and the Government were properly and truly united on not wanting the charter of fundamental rights to apply to the United Kingdom, we would have to apply the same formula in order to achieve it.</p>

We have an opportunity to take the steps, without weasel words and by being direct, to sort this matter out as the Bill progresses. We have this stage now and a further stage to come, and the House of Lords in due course. However, there is a problem, which I do not want to exaggerate but just to mention. I hope that the European Scrutiny Committee in the House of Lords&#151;I say this with great respect to some very eminent people&#151;in no way ends up, in the report that is coming out quite soon, disagreeing with what the European Scrutiny Committee has said in the House of Commons. I could go into this at greater length, but my concerns are considerable. There is by convention in this House a doctrine of comity, and it would be a great shame if we were to find that a serious disagreement emerged on the application of the principle that I have just enunciated.</p>

<a name="80205-0019.htm_brev5"><a name="08020569000112"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is clear that the Government accepts that the Charter will be legally binding, and it has stated that the Protocol is not an opt-out.

It says, in a nutshell, that notwithstanding the European Communities Act 1972, nothing in the charter shall have effect in UK law, and it effectively also says that that provision should be binding on our judiciary. I say that because I believe absolutely and implicitly in this House. The only way we can deal with the essential question of maintaining its supremacy in relation to the charter, let alone the national obligations that would arise later, would be by doing what I suggest. As a final point, during the course of discussion, we may be able to find a means of wrapping up all my points on the way the treaty operates in relation to the UK. This is a hugely important issue.

We may be able to come to some understanding about that in due course, but at this juncture the most important thing is that we retain the supremacy of this Parliament not only over national parliamentary matters and the Bill of Rights, but over the charter of fundamental rights.

If there was no doubt about that, why was it necessary to include the phrase &#147;for the avoidance of doubt&#148;? There must be some doubt about the rest. Having listened to comments by hon. Members from all parts of the House, I have some doubts about whether the rest of the charter could create additional justiciable rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80205-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08020569000093">However, I want to focus on title IV and the signal that it sends the European Court of Justice. We are in an anomalous position, whereby the rights contained in title IV have been distinguished, by the phrase to which I have referred, from all the other rights in the charter of fundamental rights. We have to ask why that clause was added to title IV. If that was not done simply to appease the business lobby, which was extremely vigorous and close to the former Prime Minister, one has to ask how title IV is substantially distinct from the other titles in the charter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80205-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08020569000094">I suggest that the inclusion of that provision creates an asymmetry, because when the charter and its implications come to be analysed and judged upon by the European Court, it will frequently have to strike a balance among the various rights contained within the charter. In striking those balances, legal minds will obviously be brought into play, but it is hard to escape the conclusion that some extremely fine judgments will be made that will stray from the purely legal and into the political. Indeed, the ECJ has already strayed into that area in making political judgments&#151;it is not for me to ask about the political control through which the legislative processes of the EU can exercise some influence upon the ECJ, save to say it seems to be extremely limited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80205-0019.htm_para23"><a name="08020569000095">In striking a balance among the various rights contained in the charter as a whole, the Court might be minded to reflect on the fact that the United Kingdom and Polish Governments have chosen to point a finger at title IV, which contains a series of fundamental rights that I would have thought few in the House would deny, including the right of workers to collective representation and, if necessary, the right to take strike action. There are many others, too, which are there for everybody to see. When the ECJ makes judgments in industrial or other disputes, it will be somewhere in the minds of the justices that the UK and Polish Governments have pointed a finger directly at the rights under title IV and said that they are not the same as any of the others, since those Governments have taken the step of indicating that the rights under that title will not create any additional justiciable rights in their countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80205-0019.htm_para24"><a name="08020569000096">Why was that done? As has been said, when the then Prime Minister came to the House and mentioned all the other achievements that he had gained, many of which were very welcome, he totally omitted to mention title IV.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80205-0019.htm_para25"><a name="08020569000097">In subsequent debates in the House, including today&#146;s debate, the Government have failed to articulate any reason for title IV and all the rights contained in it to be treated differently from all the other rights in the charter. I asked the Secretary of State why that should be. He is currently collecting his papers: he is probably about to leave the Chamber very quickly, but that does not matter, because his reply is in <i> Hansard </i>for all to see. He said that the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, our hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice), would give the explanation. I sat on the edge of my seat, as did my hon. Friends and, probably, Members in all parts of the Chamber. I listened very carefully to what was said by the Under-Secretary, but no explanation was forthcoming.</p>

Friends. I must tell him that that is not what we are looking for. We are simple souls, and we want an explanation of why the Government decided to treat title IV and the articles therein differently from all the others. The ECJ has already created a legal precedent: it has already decided to prioritise some rights over others. My hon. Friends and I referred to them earlier. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80205-0019.htm_para27"><a name="08020569000099">The right of any EU company to establish itself anywhere in the EU is clearly one of the fundamental rights. It is in title II, as is the right of any company in the EU to provide services anywhere else in the EU. The ECJ has already determined that those two rights have priority over the rights of workers to collective representation. That was before the Government did what they did, but I can only imagine that what they have done will accelerate, exaggerate and possibly exacerbate any future decisions when the Court makes finely balanced and, I would argue, ultimately political judgments about the various rights in the treaty. That will often be at the expense of the ordinary people whom we seek to represent&#151;increasingly so, because companies increasingly operate in a multinational framework.</p>

Certainly they will affect the Minister&#146;s constituency and his constituents as much as mine. Having looked carefully at the amendment, however, I do not think it achieves exactly what I wanted to achieve. I have discussed the matter with colleagues, and when the time is appropriate I shall not press the amendment to a vote. However, I hope that the Minister will be able finally to unlock the secret closet containing the notes that explain the curious and anomalous situation in which we now find ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80205-0020.htm_para0"><a name="08020612000004">There have been two great movements. There has been a great movement over many decades to ensure that we reach the point where all adults have the precious advantage of the vote, so that they can choose those elected representatives and decide whether to remove them when they fail to do their jobs in the imagined way. The other great movement was to ensure that the powers were in this Chamber and in Parliament as a whole, so that here the laws could be chosen, here they could be amended, and here they could be struck down. What the Government are asking us to do tonight is suspend that right, in perpetuity perhaps, and certainly for a very long time&#151;there is no fixed time for this treaty&#151;so that in future such decisions may in many areas be made by unelected people in a European court. They may, as far as the British people are concerned, in future be made by unelected people sitting in Council chambers, often meeting in private and reaching decisions in private.</p>

 I am following the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s points with great care, but I am puzzled that he seems to ignore the fact that, ever since this country joined what was then the Common Market all those years ago, there has been primacy of European Union law as decided by the collective institutions of the EU and as interpreted by the European Court. The point he is making is simply an argument for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the EU. That is a perfectly respectable point of view, although I profoundly disagree with it. Is that what he is asking this House to decide, and is that the official policy of the Opposition?</p>

 The right hon. Lady is a little cleverer than that: she knows that that is not the official position of the Opposition party, and nor is it the case that I happen to be making at present. Her history is wrong, of course: we did not give all those powers away at the beginning when we joined something called the Common Market in common parlance, or the European Economic Community as set out in the original treaty. That was not the deal offered to the British people when they last had a vote on this issue in 1975. It so happens that I voted &#147;no&#148;. I have always since accepted the verdict of the British people. I am sure that they voted for a common market, and that is what I would like them to have. They voted for co-operation and collaboration while our country retained its veto. What I dislike about the deal under discussion&#151;the clauses before us tonight highlight this&#151;is that our veto has been given away needlessly, when the Government had the veto to veto surrendering the veto; the Government just had to say &#147;no&#148;, and they would not have had so many law-making powers brought in by the back door by this treaty and this proposed legislation.</p>

The right hon. Lady has in a previous intervention in our debates today come up with a clever argument. She says that the magic of this particular block of work is that at last the EU will have to submit itself to the human rights Court and the human rights  <br>

convention that many states in Europe have signed. What she omits, however, to tell the House in that very partial interpretation is that that in no way detracts from the power of the European Court of Justice to keep on advancing its power at the expense of the British people and their elected representatives in this Parliament assembled.</p>

 That is clearly the Government&#146;s position. They have shown total surrender in the negotiations over the treaty as a whole. The Government have told us again tonight that they wish the large number of principles and rights set out in the document before us to be adopted as part of our law code. Worse still, they will accept not one but two European Courts standing in judgment over us. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), I am more worried about the European Court of Justice, because it has a long tradition of furthering a federal agenda. In case after case that Court is determining that there should be more power for law-making and decision in the European Union and less in the  member states.</p>

 Is that not why this House and the British people should approach this treaty with the greatest scepticism? They will recall the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1986, which I voted against. Our right hon. and noble Friend Baroness Thatcher was assured that employment and the social contract would be outside the ECJ&#146;s remit, but the ECJ took that area into its own power. Therefore, we should resist any Government attempt to hoodwink the British people into thinking that we should accept these assurances.</p>

 That is exactly right. The facts are stark. This Government have surrendered 10 times more vetoes than previous Governments. Some of us had reservations about surrendering some of those other vetoes, but they were at least surrendered in furtherance of the Common Market, for which people had voted in a referendum. That was why Baroness Thatcher decided to make those modest surrenders of power in the 1980s. Since then, this Government have given away massive rights, duties and powers that have nothing to do with the Common Market for which the British people voted.</p>

 I suggest that the hon. Gentleman tries reading the different treaties. The Single European Act was, as its name describes, about market measures to try to promote a common market.

subsequently developed. The SEA was a very narrow area of work compared with a common foreign policy, a common army, a common defence policy, a common criminal justice policy, a common immigration policy, a president of Europe and a much-expanded Parliament, all of which have come under this Government&#146;s watch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80205-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08020612000014">At each point, the Government have claimed that they were not giving any real power away, that we would not notice the difference, that they had protected our interest and that the famous red lines were in place. We have heard all that nonsense, but we can see from the huge amount of work embedded in this revised treaty that massive powers were surrendered at Nice and Amsterdam, and that such a surrender is being proposed tonight in this crucial area of fundamental human rights.</p>

We fight, and our predecessors fought, for those rights for the British people just as surely as the Labour party has often done in the past. We believe that those rights are best expressed in British law, in the English language and in a way that is answerable to the British people. We believe they have to stay like that, so that the British people can, through their elected representatives, change, amend and improve them as circumstances and time require.</p>

We are being asked to embody at one point in the long evolution of our national and European history, a set of principles that might make sense to some people now, but which are going to be extremely difficult to change. It will be impossible to change them in a democratic way in this Parliament, because the agreement of so many of other member states will be needed, as will a treaty amendment. As we can see, such an amendment is a complicated and difficult process.</p>

Much of it, as a general statement of the kind of rights people ought to enjoy, is motherhood and apple pie. However, there is a world of legal difference between a general statement of political goals and a legally binding text. As I have said, the European Court of Justice would apply the charter to cases that come before it, and that would allow it a far wider degree of discretion in its judgments, in effect leading to yet more judge-made law.

They should be honest with the people and with the House, and should not seek to press this matter. If they do, we will gladly vote  against them.</p>

He made a good case in arguing for his amendments in his own terms, but what was missing from his comments was any discussion of what a Conservative Government would do. Once again, he has remained silent on the social chapter. He had the opportunity to put his views on the record, but he chose not to do so. His silence on withdrawal from the social chapter speaks volumes. Of course, he could intervene now to put the record straight. The hon. Gentleman also refused to say whether, in the event of a Conservative victory, a Conservative Government would seek to renegotiate the treaty and remove the charter from it&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80205-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08020612000040">We also heard a wide-ranging and passionate speech by the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), who spoke from his great experience on Europe gained over many decades. He also referred to the experience of 1848, and spoke passionately about the Soviet era. Let me gently say to him that he has always reminded me of a Conservative version of Leon Trotsky, a man of whom it was often said that he was so far-sighted in his predictions that none of them had yet come true.

 I would not wish to test your patience too much, Sir Alan, but it is absolutely certain that the hon. Gentleman will not be and would not be allowed to be airbrushed out of history in the way that others have in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="80205-0020.htm_para24"><a name="08020612000044">On amendment No. 84, the Government are clearly committed to the protection of human rights both in the EU and by the EU, but what is proposed would undermine that commitment. Removing the charter of fundamental rights from the scope of the Bill would not undermine the rights and principles as they already exist as a result of the European Court of Human Rights, the EU treaties, European Court of Justice case law or the traditions common to all member states. The principle that fundamental rights form part of Community law and apply to states when implementing that law is long established and reflects ECJ case law dating from 1970.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="80205-0020.htm_para25"><a name="08020612000045">References to fundamental rights in the treaties are not new. The first reference to fundamental rights appeared in the preamble to the Single European Act, which the former Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), previously described as the single greatest transfer of sovereignty in this nation&#146;s history. That Single European Act provided that member states would</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80205-0020.htm_para26"><a name="08020612000046">The Maastricht treaty included the first explicit reference to fundamental rights in the text of the treaties. That reference became article 6(2) of the treaty on European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80205-0020.htm_para27"><a name="08020612000047">Removing the charter from the scope of the Bill would prevent UK citizens from using the charter as an accessible record of the rights that they enjoy as EU citizens, and which the citizens of all other member states would enjoy. The rights and principles in the charter are not new; it records rights, rather than creates them.</p>

I therefore encourage the hon. Member for Stone to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Earlier this evening, on a point of order, the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) intervened in the debate on the European Union treaty to claim that, in December, I had held a meeting in my Department to discuss press inquiries about the meetings between my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) and Babar Ahmed in Woodhill prison. That is not correct. I was aware, in December, of press inquiries from a newspaper concerning visits by my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting to Babar Ahmed, but at no stage before last Saturday was I aware of any information that the press inquiries concerned any covert recording or anything like that. I confirm what I told the House. There are of course a wide range of other questions about this matter. That is the purpose of the inquiry that I announced to this House yesterday, when I also said that a statement would be made to the House once the report of the inquiry had been received and considered. </p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80205-0022.htm_para2"><a name="08020612000627">We are tonight considering the draft order for the establishment of the new unitary Wiltshire council. The order implements the unitary proposal that Wiltshire county council itself has made. This is a proposal that the democratically elected, democratically led and locally accountable council has drawn up. It is a proposal on which the council sought the views of local people and the agencies that it deals with in the area, and one that the council has chosen to put forward to the Secretary of State as the form of local governance that best meets the needs of Wiltshire today.</p>

 The Minister has just made an assertion that the county council consulted local people. Will he give us an indication of how that consultation took place? Local people do not believe that they were consulted at all.</p>

 When we launched the process in October 2006, we made it clear that whether councils submitted proposals was a matter for them. Having been clear about the five criteria that we would use to test any proposal, we rightly left it to the councils to decide how best to seek the views in their local areas. That is what Wiltshire county council and other councils that submitted proposals did. The important and distinctive&#151;</p>

 May I finish this sentence? The distinctive and different thing about this process is that, unlike previous restructurings of local government, it is not prescribed from the centre, nor was its blueprint drawn up or designed from the centre. I say again that the starting point for the order before us was a proposal prepared and submitted by Wiltshire county council because it believes that it represents the best form of governance for the county in the future.</p>

<p><a name="st_o441"><a name="08020612000632"><a name="80205-0022.htm_spnew8"><a name="08020612001250"><b>Robert Neill:</b>
 I want to press the point about consultation a little; after all, this is the first of a number of such orders that we must consider, and a principle is involved. As the five criteria are described conjunctively&#151;the word &#147;and&#148; is used, so we must assume that all five must be satisfied&#151;what, if any, minimum evidential standard is there for any authority in such a position to demonstrate that the criterion of commanding broad support is met in respect of the public and stakeholders?</p>

<p><a name="st_o442"><a name="08020612000633"><a name="80205-0022.htm_spnew9"><a name="08020612001251"><b>John Healey:</b>
 The question of broad support is a judgment that we made on the evidence submitted to us. Originally, for each of the 16 proposals&#151;some of which we did not believe met the criteria&#151;the question was not whether there was a majority of this or that set of views in favour or not. The purpose of the criterion was to allow us to come to a judgment about whether we could be reasonably confident that, should the  <br>

<p><a name="st_o443"><a name="08020612000634"><a name="80205-0022.htm_spnew10"><a name="08020612001252"><b>Dr. Andrew Murrison (Westbury) (Con):</b>
 Has the Minister taken any account of the MORI poll conducted among Wiltshire residents in 2006? I suspect not, as there is no reference to it in his summary of consultations published in November last year. Does he not think that he should have taken account of that fairly objective assessment of opinion in Wiltshire?</p>

<p><a name="st_o444"><a name="08020612000635"><a name="80205-0022.htm_spnew11"><a name="08020612001253"><b>John Healey:</b>
 There was indeed a MORI survey&#151;it was an opinion survey, not a poll. That was an element of the evidence and information that we took, and to which we had regard, to come to a judgment about the level of support. Some thought it important and placed great store by it, but others had concerns about the nature of the supporting information and the nature of the questions asked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80205-0022.htm_para3"><a name="08020612000636">From memory, what was clear was that 78 per cent. of those who responded in that particular sample wanted the councils to work much more closely together; they clearly saw the weaknesses that often exist in two-tier areas. The balance of opinion in respect of a unitary Wiltshire was about 62 per cent. against and 30 per cent. in favour. However, in the end it was an opinion survey&#151;an element of the evidence that we took into account when we considered whether support was sufficiently broad for us to be confident that, were we to move ahead with the proposal, we could make it work.</p>

 I have a factual question, to which I hope the Minister can give me a factual answer. He will remember that a paper called &#147;Invitation to all councils in England to submit proposals for unitary status&#148; was sent out. Paragraph 3.5 of that original document states:</p>
<a name="80205-0022.htm_brev1"><a name="08020612000666"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it will be necessary for any proposal to have support from a range of key partners, stakeholders and service users/citizens.&#148;</p>

 The citizens did not disappear. Our approach was to look at the range of support that might be expressed for the proposal that was submitted by Wiltshire. There was indeed a response from the public, the majority of it in campaign form. That was part of the representations that we took into account, and we published the summary of responses back in July. There were probably more people in favour of maintaining district councils and not moving to a unitary council than there were in favour of a unitary council. Nevertheless, about a third of the public who offered a view could see the merit of a unitary Wiltshire and would like that to happen.</p>

 I am not quite sure what point the hon. Gentleman is trying to make. I have clearly stated that from the outset of this process we had five tests that we required any proposal to meet and to pass. Wiltshire&#146;s proposal was one of those that we received. We gave an indication of that in March and confirmed it in July. One of the tests involved a broad range of support sufficient to give us the confidence that were we to give this the go-ahead it would have a reasonable chance of succeeding.</p>

 I am sorry to trouble the Minister again, and I am grateful to him for his patience in giving way, but this is an important principle and it will recur. As five criteria are proposed, can he give us an indication of on whom the onus of meeting those criteria rests? Secondly, what are the criteria for saying whether or not the test is passed? Are the same criteria used in relation to every such proposal, or do they vary? What standard must be met by a proposing authority to show that its proposal passes the test?</p>

 I have been getting used to the hon. Gentleman in the short time he has been in his shadow role. He brings a lawyerly turn of phrase to the debate. The criteria were set as a test that would help us and others come to a judgment about whether the proposal could succeed, whether it has a reasonable chance of doing so and whether we should give it the go-ahead. The extent and the nature of the evidence that any proposing authority submitted in order to meet those tests clearly varied. Some failed; others that passed would have gone about their task by meeting those five tests and demonstrating that they could meet them in different ways, and they did so.</p>

That is the judgment that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I, as elected politicians charged with this job, made. We made that judgment on the back of consistent evidence, clearly set out in published criteria, and we made it in a process that gave all interested parties, particularly councils, ample opportunity to submit their views, to know the views of those arguing for an alternative, and to offer a counter-argument or counter-evidence if they wished to do so. We weighed all that together with any other representations that we received during the process in coming to our final decision.</p>

 I presume that there is some underpinning evidence that unitary authorities perform better than two-tier systems. As someone who has always felt that two-tier systems&#151;in my case, three-tier&#151;are completely misunderstood by the general public, I do not see why the Government do not realise that there is a need for consistency throughout the country. They should encourage all areas to seek sensible and rational provision of local government.

 My hon. Friend is right, and because he follows such matters closely he will be able to track this back not just to the invitation we issued in October 2006, which reflected our belief that unitary local government was a way of removing many of the weaknesses he mentions in two-tier areas, but to the White Paper that we published on local government, which set out clearly the general case for unitary local government. He is right about the weaknesses: people are often confused about what different councils at different levels do. Often, services can be fragmented, leadership can be in competition and confused, and there is a degree of duplication, inefficiency and a lack of co-ordination.</p>

In short, our clear judgment is that the proposal meets all the criteria. On affordability, first, the estimated transitional costs are more than offset by the savings that the proposal is estimated to generate, which can be expected to be achieved well within the five-year limit that we imposed at the outset. Secondly, implementation does not involve any capitalisation to deal with revenue costs. Thirdly, implementation does not impose any costs that would have to be met by increasing the council tax. Fourthly, to the extent that in any one year the costs of transition are not covered by savings, they will be met by councils&#146; reserves, which are adequate.</p>

On the basis of those figures, the advice that we were given by independent financial experts suggested both that the council&#146;s figures and the expectation that the proposal might lead to savings of more than &#163;18 million a year were sound and that the overall financial case was a low-risk one that imposed no barrier to proceeding.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way again. I want to raise a point that is not unique to the situation that we are debating. As far as I can see, no account is taken in the assumptions from the county council of any potential loss of grant. All local authorities receive &#163;325,000 by way of grant for the costs of being in business. There are currently five local authorities in Wiltshire that receive such grant. What assurances can the Minister give that there will not be just one payment of &#163;325,000 for the costs of being in business when we move to one council in Wiltshire? On the face of it, there appears to be a risk that we will lose those four elements of grant, which go to the existing authorities. Is there to be a different level of grant? That does not appear to be permissible under the rules, so how is it to be achieved and how will that shortfall be made up?</p>

If the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) is particularly interested in the detail, I can let him have it. In essence, when we move to create the new authority in Wiltshire, all being well in 2009, the allocation of budgets, set out for the next three years under the formula settlement that the House debated and approved last night, would automatically be pooled with that of the county council&#146;s budget, to create the total budget for the new authority to carry out its new range of functions and responsibilities.</p>

Rather like the process that we conducted for encouraging proposals, we tried to take an approach in the order that will allow each area to adopt the arrangements that are best suited to it. We therefore prepared the order following consultation and full discussion with the councils concerned, not just the county council. Our aim was to ensure that the arrangements were those that the local people most directly involved would consider best suited to their circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="80205-0023.htm_para4"><a name="08020613000018">First, the order provides that from 1 April 2009 there will be a single tier of local government in Wiltshire. Secondly, it provides for the existing district councils to be dissolved. The county council will be transformed into a new unitary authority with both district and county functions. However, we have made clear from the outset, and will make clear in the way in which we require the implementation plan to be produced and pursued, that this is not a case of the county council either continuing as it is or mounting a takeover of the district councils. This is a new start. We expect a new sense of leadership and direction in the authority,  and we expect it to implement the proposals set out in its plan.</p>

 I am perfectly open about this. Essentially, it was a toss-up. There was an argument for saying &#147;Let us, at the point of creating the new authority, dissolve all the existing authorities and create what will be legally a new entity.&#148; On balance, however, we felt that the advantages of that were outweighed by the complexities involved in transferring assets and staff, and the legal complexities. We decided that by allowing the county council formally to be a continuing authority&#151;while making clear that it would be run differently and would constitute a new authority&#151;we could achieve a much smoother transition and still achieve our aim of creating a new authority rather than allowing a takeover, which I have been extremely keen to avoid.</p>

The process of change is not a simple transfer of functions; this is a more radical, far-reaching change in the governance, leadership and service delivery arrangements in Wiltshire. The right hon. and learned Member for Devizes shakes his head. The order requires an implementation plan. We will monitor that plan, and staging posts along the way will ensure that we can create the fresh governance, leadership and service delivery arrangements that I mentioned, including scope for the community involvement set out in the proposals. The plan will cover budget, structure, staffing, transfer of assets and neighbourhood arrangements.</p>

There was complete agreement between the county and the districts in Wiltshire that the elections should be held in 2009, not 2008, principally because, by that time, we expect the Electoral Commission to have been able to undertake an electoral review, so that the arrangements for that 2009 election can be based on new wards that better reflect the community and neighbourhood pattern of the county. The order creates the new unitary Wiltshire council, and it puts in place the key elements of the transition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="80205-0023.htm_para9"><a name="08020613000027">I said earlier that I am keen to say a few words about the position of the employees. We all recognise that this is inevitably an unsettling time for employees of the affected authorities, and while the detailed arrangements are for local councils as employers to consider, they will be developed within a set of national principles that we will put in place to ensure that all staff are treated fairly. We have made it clear that all staff who are employed immediately prior to 1 April 2009 by the authorities that are to be abolished will become employees of the new unitary authority. We have also made it clear that those employees will be protected in line with the principles of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006, as if those regulations applied. I made that commitment when I announced our final decisions on 5 December, and I am happy to reconfirm it to the House. This means that all staff who transfer to a new unitary authority will enjoy transfer on their current terms and conditions, and it will then be for the new unitary council to decide its new staffing structures in accordance with employment legislation generally and the TUPE regulations.</p>

To restructure on the basis of a hope and a wing and a prayer is simply not good enough. Important practical, technical and constitutional issues arise.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman not believe that the system of 20 community forums and the strength of the strategic leadership set out in the proposal, and for local taxpayers not least the &#163;18 million a year in annual efficiency savings, are grounds enough for going ahead?</p>

 Because there is regrettably a dearth of specific evidence to back up those assertions, I must say that there is a lack of objective evidence to support them. The key point is that because of the implications, such a change should be undertaken only if there is compelling objective evidence. What we managed to get from the Minister was the fact that there are no objective tests to see whether the five criteria are met in any given place. An entirely subjective exercise is being carried out. That is unsatisfactory, and it sets an extremely dangerous precedent.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. It may engender a modicum of silence from further down the Chamber, and it proves the virtue of doing one&#146;s local homework. It also sits rather ill with the Government&#146;s contradictions on this issue, because this is part of a process of reorganisation that will involve a number of areas. Back in 2006, the previous Secretary of State, who is still in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Transport, described the whole question of local government reorganisation as a great distraction. I suspect that she was nearer the mark than her successor and the current ministerial team, for the reasons that we have set out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="80205-0023.htm_para12"><a name="08020613000037">I was interested to hear the Minister say that there will be a particular treatment of grant. I assume it will apply across the piece, but that was the first time that we had heard about it. That grant treatment was not taken into account in the proposal in setting out the savings. The districts have put forward their own contention, which would tend significantly to undermine the one put forward by the county council&#151;the point being that there is conflicting evidence and, to return to my principal point, there are no objective criteria by which to judge it. It is thus difficult to see how the case for change can possibly be made against that background. We will return to that issue throughout this process, because the same principle seems to apply across all the orders that the House will have to consider in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="80205-0023.htm_para13"><a name="08020613000038">One final thing worries me about the Minister&#146;s stance, although I appreciate that he may have inherited this situation. He said that there must be consistent evidence, but a few breaths before, he said that the evidence will vary from authority to authority; so it is difficult to have any great faith in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="80205-0023.htm_para14"><a name="08020613000039">I should also ask some questions about the order itself, because it concerns me. The Minister hits on a point about this not being a takeover. He has been at pains to stress that, and it is set out in the explanatory memorandum. The reality is that if he looks at it fairly, he will see that it is difficult to say to anyone outside this process that it is anything other than a takeover, given the construction of the implementation executive whereby the chairman, who has the casting vote, shall be the leader of one particular authority&#151;of the county council, as opposed to anything else&#151;whether or not there is consensus. There is no obligation to seek consensus. The fact that there has been willingness on the part of the members of all the district councils to try to work together to make the best of the bad job that has been foisted on them is to their credit, rather than to the credit of the Government, who have set forward this unsatisfactory proposition. It is difficult to sell a built-in working majority in favour of one partner as a collaboration of equals, rather than a takeover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="80205-0023.htm_para15"><a name="08020613000040">I am also concerned that the work of the implementation executive will not be adequately scrutinised. That is important because it is at the time of the transition that the hoped-for savings are most likely to be lost and costs are most likely to overrun. Scrutiny at that stage is therefore especially important. There is, interestingly, a duty on the districts to co-operate on implementation of the transition plan in both paragraph 6.7 and paragraph 11, but surprisingly there is only an option for collaboration on scrutiny. I do not understand why the scrutiny provision&#151;in paragraph 8.6&#151;is not also an obligation. The provision on scrutiny is not as rigorous as that on the duty to take executive action, but both are important. From all that I know of what happens in Wiltshire, the districts will ensure that there is proper scrutiny, but the orders do not guarantee that&#151;and they should. That is a technical concern about the nature of the orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="80205-0023.htm_para16"><a name="08020613000041">The political composition of the implementation executive also raises concerns. It is an odd creature, because it does not follow the normal requirements of proportionality. It provides certain guaranteed places, but there seems to be no precedent for that, and I would be interested to know why it has been set up in that way.  <br>

The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) has already raised the issue of the lack of parity and an equal duty to co-operate in the implementation executive and in the scrutiny process, but there is also a wider issue. Why is there no duty on the Secretary of State to co-operate to help local authorities to achieve their aims of reorganisation? That lies at the heart of the matter. Perhaps with the authority we are considering and certainly in other cases that will be discussed in the days ahead, there is real frustration because the orders will not help local authorities to achieve all they would want from the reorganisation process. There needs to be a duty to co-operate on Ministers so that they cannot stand in the way of authorities trying to achieve higher ambitions.</p>

Given that there will be a boundary review and all-out elections to the new authority in 2009, will the Minister comment on what scope there might be to enable parish elections to happen at the same time as those unitary authority elections to allow people to seek election knowing what their terms will be?</p>

Kent. None of the boundaries of the different authorities seem to coincide and they have not for a very long time&#151;even the ecclesiastical one. The county of Wiltshire is not in the south-east and not really in the south-west either. It may be in what could be described as central southern England, which is pretty unromantic. Wiltshire is an edge county and Salisbury is an edge city. If we are anything, people in Wiltshire still belong to Wessex, the ancient kingdom that is a romantic idea as well as a fact. Interestingly, the recent creation of an Earl and Countess of Wessex showed a deep understanding by the royal family of the nature of the county and of how we feel about where we are.</p>

I used to be a Local Government Minister, so I have fairly wide experience, at least across England. I know that it was right for Swindon, for example, to become a unitary authority. The structure might have worked in Wiltshire when it was proposed, some 12 years ago, that we should have two unitary authorities&#151;one for north Wiltshire and one for south Wiltshire. However, when we look at the context of the order and the proposed revolution, it is important to remember that, before the 1974 local government reorganisation and in what is now Salisbury district council, we had a Salisbury city council, and rural district councils for Salisbury and Wilton, Amesbury, and Mere and Tisbury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="80205-0024.htm_para11"><a name="08020614000017">That was localism, and local decision making. All four authorities had planning powers, although they did not include the county council&#146;s reserve powers on highways and minerals, for example. Back in 1974, we saw the beginning of the end of true local democracy when those four councils became one. Now, Wiltshire&#146;s four district councils are to become one, and using the same sort of dodgy maths that the Government are using to support the order, some might say that the people of south Wiltshire were 16 times better represented in 1974 than they will be by the new Wiltshire council.</p>

Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) will expand on it. However, it is terribly important to remember that only 53 per cent. of county councillors voted in favour of the unitary authority proposal. None of the district councils voted for it, and most of the district councillors voted strongly against it, unless they happened to be the double-hatted councillors who served on both local authorities&#151;a practice of which I disapprove very strongly. One of the few benefits of the proposed system will be that we will no longer have double-hatted councillors.</p>

We told him about the Ipsos MORI poll, which is worth looking at again, because he has created the impression that it was not definitive. In fact, 78 per cent. of people said that they wanted the status quo, but with a bit more co-operation; 71 per cent. felt that a single council for Wiltshire would be remote and less in touch with local people and local issues; 64 per cent. saw Wiltshire as too big to be served by only one authority; and two thirds of the respondents said that the current system of local government worked well for them. If that is not a clear indication of public opinion against the proposal, I do not know what is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="80205-0024.htm_para21"><a name="08020618000004">We all received many letters and I received a petition, too. I did not receive a single letter in favour of the unitary council proposal, but I received dozens of letters against it, so I do not know where the impression of popular support has come from. At our meeting with the Minister, we told him that our understanding was that only two parish councils of all the 80 parish and town councils in the county were positively in favour of the proposal&#151;only two, yet the Minister tried to give the impression this evening that local communities were in favour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="80205-0024.htm_para22"><a name="08020618000005">All the district councils were originally against the proposal.

Three of Wiltshire&#146;s MPs have opposed the unitary order throughout; my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) will have to decide how he will vote tomorrow, but three of us have made our position clear.</p>

disastrous diminution of medical provision in our area, so the only way it could justify its position was by supporting a similarly disastrous proposal for local government. All the other stakeholders, including the fire and police authorities and the local housing association in my constituency, refuse to take a position, because they do not believe that a strong enough case has been made for the change. Again, I ask the Minister: where is that support? Where does it come from? When the Prime Minister took office in June, he said that he would be a listening Prime Minister.

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="80205-0024.htm_para27"><a name="08020618000012">I want to ask the Minister what the difference is between Wiltshire county council and &#147;the Wiltshire council&#148; mentioned in the order. The first page of the order says:</p>

We have experienced a number of local government reorganisations, and I have seen a number of similar centralisations. We are told over and again that money will be saved, that things will be far more efficient, and there will be all sorts of benefits. In every single case costs have gone up, empires have been built, and people whom we thought would lose their jobs got a new title and remained in office. Ultimately, it has always cost the local taxpayer more. I predict that that is exactly what will happen now. The Government&#146;s majority will probably ensure that the order is passed. We will go through all the rigmarole and have a unitary council, but I predict that in 10 or 15 years we will revisit the issue because the unitary council does not work.</p>

They do not want services to be inaccessible and at a great distance. They want local government that represents them where they are, and for all the Minister&#146;s semantics and rhetoric the proposition before us will not achieve that. I ask him seriously to think again. Very few people in Wiltshire want the change. What is driving him to give my constituents, and the constituents of my hon.

 It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram).

May I challenge the Minister to say how he is able to draw the inferences presented in the November summary document from the responses that he received and I photocopied? If he cannot do so, the second criterion in the October 2006 invitation for unitary bids is not met.</p>

Over the past months and years, and certainly since 2001 when I was elected, we have become accustomed to what might be called sham consultations. We have had them particularly in relation to local health care, where it appears that the results of the opinion survey have been more or less determined before the exercise started. That has led to the most disastrous consequences in respect of the scorched earth policy being conducted by Wiltshire primary care trust and, before that, by its predecessor bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o520"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para10"><a name="08020618000029">This has taken place at a time when we are all trying to establish public confidence in democracy and engage people with politics and with the formulation of public policy in important areas such as local government, health care and practically every other arena. Instead, a climate of cynicism has been engendered among the public, and who can blame them if they put a great deal of time and effort into responding to consultations in good faith, in the belief that those who make a decision at the end of the day will pay close attention to what they say and act upon it? Unfortunately, in the local government consultation, like others in Wiltshire, those who are entrusted with making policy sadly seem to bat away all the time any effort put in by our constituents. They should hang their heads in shame.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para11"><a name="08020618000030">Understandably, there has been considerable judicial interest in the matter. Will the Minister outline the possible outcomes of the Congleton and Shrewsbury judicial review and what implications various possible outcomes may have on the local government review process? Will the Minister say why the estimates of costs and benefits have differed structurally from one unitary proposal to another, thus disallowing meaningful comparison? That is particularly important in the present context because Somerset, just across the border&#151;a county that is in many ways similar to Wiltshire&#151;has had a very different outcome from its unitary bid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o522"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para12"><a name="08020618000031">Will the Minister tell us why the transition costs, recurrent costs and savings, pension liabilities and extra costs for area governance and pay harmonisation have not been included in the cost appraisal for Wiltshire? Given the absence of a budget for area governance, what did the Secretary of State have in mind when talking in July 2007 of a &#147;real opportunity&#148; for people to &#147;shape their communities&#148;? Will the Minister confirm that area governance under the proposals will be no more than an unfunded &#147;selectocracy&#148; with very little accountability?</p>

 I rise briefly to explain why, unlike my three hon. Friends who have spoken convincingly of their reasons for being strongly opposed to the order, I shall take a position of principled abstentionism when we vote on this matter tomorrow. The position that I have held throughout the discussions on local government reorganisation in Wiltshire is that there are strong arguments in favour of single-tier unitary authorities. Those are the arguments that we advanced when we were in government and in precisely the Minister&#146;s position. When I was special adviser to the Secretary of State for the Environment, as the post was then known, we brought in unitary status for Swindon. It is nice to see the hon. Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove) in her place this evening. We also abolished the country of Berkshire in the same way, and brought in a variety of unitary authorities across England. They were very much welcomed by the people when we did so. We also abolished the county councils in the whole of Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o526"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para16"><a name="08020629000012">The powerful argument for doing that, which we advanced from the Bench on which the Minister is now sitting, was that it was a fundamentally good Conservative principle to have less government and fewer civil servants servicing it, with lower council tax as a result. There are clearly strong Conservative arguments in favour of single-tier unitary authorities. There is no question about that at all, and in some respects I support what the Government have been saying in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o527"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para17"><a name="08020629000013">Wiltshire plainly has good local government at the moment, however; I differ entirely from the Government in that regard. Our district councils do a very good job. They are close to the people, and they make good decisions, by and large, although there are some exceptions. I am glad to say that North Wiltshire district council had the good sense recently to throw out the Liberal Democrats who had run the council very badly for the past 10 years, and the council is now doing an absolutely first-class job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o528"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para18"><a name="08020629000014">So we have good local government at local level provided by the district councils, as well as by the town and parish councils, which provide a strong service across North Wiltshire. Localism is terribly important. As my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) commented, Wiltshire is an astonishing county geographically, split by Salisbury plain. There is no real homogeneity in the county, and it is therefore vital to have local government, which is provided at the moment by the district councils.</p>

Now is not necessarily the time to make strong, principled arguments on either side; we should be doing precisely what the Conservative-controlled North Wiltshire district council has done and Wiltshire county council is doing. We should say, &#147;This thing is going to happen. The Labour Government have created it. There is no question but that there will be a single-tier unitary authority in Wiltshire. We should not fall out with each other over it or battle over who will be councillors in a particular place or how functions will be carried out.

That is why I am ready to accept what the Government propose. I cannot bring myself to go into the Labour Lobby and support them&#151;there are strong arguments against the proposal&#151;but I will abstain during the deferred Division tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o531"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para21"><a name="08020629000017">The Minister might like to refer to one matter in his response. The boundary committee will examine local government boundaries in the run-up to the elections for the single-tier unitary authority. There is one boundary in Wiltshire that to me is more important than all others&#151;the eastern boundary that borders Swindon. We love Swindon, a first-class town in many ways, but we do not want it to move into North Wiltshire in any shape, size or form. Will the Minister please reconfirm in his response that when the boundary committee considers the borders, it will be specifically tasked with doing that within the current rural county of Wiltshire, excluding Swindon? Will he confirm that the border between Swindon and North Wiltshire will remain the same? I think that that will be the case, but I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o532"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para22"><a name="08020629000018">Leaving party politics and strong statements aside, we need to find the best means of delivering good, first-class services at a local level in Wiltshire and a lower council tax. I say to Councillor Jane Scott, and the new-look local authority when it is set up, that the reason why I do not oppose what she proposes is that I look to her to provide better services for my people in North Wiltshire&#151;above all, at a lower rate of council tax.</p>

 I hope that my colleagues from Wiltshire will forgive me for speaking for a minute before the Minister responds. I am a former leader of North Wiltshire district council and I served 12 years on the county council. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) mentioned the winding-up of the rural districts and boroughs. There are many proud towns in Wiltshire that still have the sign of when they were boroughs in the middle ages. It is a pity that the winding-up occurred; it took local government away from people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o533"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para23"><a name="08020629000020">As leader of North Wiltshire district council, I was always aware that it was an administrative area without any natural affinity, apart from being in Wiltshire. However, it had one big advantage: we discussed areas that we travelled to and knew. Wiltshire county council was a great, strategic council but those of us from the north of the county would often talk about areas in the south that we rarely visited. It can take one hour 20 minutes to get from Cricklade to the south of Salisbury and we did not go to the south often. I fear that the new arrangements will be unwieldy. It is a long way from Tidworth to the Somerset boundary, and I do not think that we will be close enough to the people. I am suspicious of the savings figures; I do not think that we will make savings. I hope that things work out well. I am sure that there are some very good councils in Wiltshire, but I fear that we are moving local government too far from the people.</p>

 I shall attempt to deal with the points that have been raised. First, I should like to pay tribute to the fact that all who have spoken have done so with strong feeling about their areas and a remarkable pride in their county&#151;its history, richness and royal and military connections. The hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) and, although I had not realised it, the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray), speak with experience of local government reorganisation and recognise that it is not easy. Sometimes one has to believe that the prize in going through the process will indeed deliver the gain that is worth some of the pain that is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o534"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para24"><a name="08020629000022">Let me say to the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) that he answered his own question as regards scrutiny. He said that districts will ensure that there is proper scrutiny, and they have done. A joint scrutiny and overview board has been set up, with nine members from across all five councils, and they will do the job that we need them to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o535"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para25"><a name="08020629000023">The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) asked about the boundary committee. It aims to complete the work to set the new wards in the county by February 2009, which means that they can be in place for elections in May 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o536"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para26"><a name="08020629000024">I will check the point that the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) raised about the district councils&#146; concern about the order and write to him if there if is any cause for concern. I appreciate that he has some scepticism about this process. However, we made the general case for unitaries in the White Paper, and there are some very good unitaries as a result of reorganisations, including Stockton-on-Tees, Hartlepool and the East Riding of Yorkshire. We used the term &#147;Wiltshire council&#148; in the order deliberately to exemplify the fact that we were not creating Wiltshire county council but an authority for the county of Wiltshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o537"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para27"><a name="08020629000025">The hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) asked about the judicial review brought by Shrewsbury, Atcham and Congleton, which was dismissed by the court in September. They have appealed, the hearing took place last week, and we await the judgment. However, nothing that they have done in the judicial review process so far has delayed us or deflected us  <br>

from our process, and I do not expect that to happen again, although that will of course depend on the court&#146;s judgment. All the costs were taken into account in the independent financial advice that we received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o538"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para28"><a name="08020629000026">In reply to the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, the work of the boundary committee will be within the county of Wiltshire and will not stray over the boundary into Swindon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o539"><a name="80205-0025.htm_para29"><a name="08020629000027">Area boards may be the answer to the concern expressed by the hon.

 I am most grateful for the opportunity to raise some very important issues concerning the Solicitors Regulation Authority, known as the SRA. I am pleased to see the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice), on the Front Bench this evening&#151;I say evening; of course I mean this morning, at such a very early time. I wish to make a declaration of my interests. I am a non-practising barrister and I am married to a solicitor who is also a part-time judge. My wife also formerly served on the Law Society Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o554"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para7"><a name="08020635000004">The SRA was established two years ago last month and operates with a budget of &#163;55 million each year. It is therefore timely that we should explore its work so far, and assess its achievements. I also want to raise some concerns regarding the issue of race and ethnicity. Previously, the regulation of solicitors was dealt with by the Law Society itself, which is the trade union for solicitors. It was rightly suggested in the Clementi report that the Law Society lacked the independence, and therefore the necessary legitimacy, to regulate properly. It found fault with the principle of one lawyer examining the work of another, and so the SRA was born. The SRA remains part of the Law Society but operates completely separately from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o555"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para8"><a name="08020635000005">There are 16 members of the board, nine of whom are solicitors. I have serious concerns about the representative nature of the board&#146;s membership, while not casting any aspersions on those appointed. Only one is from an ethnic minority background; the rest, I have to say, consist of the great and the good. However, I am worried that in this day and age, with a board so recently created, it is no way near a representation of the race and gender of the legal profession today,  and I understand that it cannot be changed until December 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o556"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para9"><a name="08020635000006">The SRA should act in the public interest as both a regulatory and preventive body, examining accusations of fault, writing regulations and ensuring resolutions. It should be fair to both the public and solicitors, and should ensure that all firms are treated equally and in the same way. A number of issues have been brought to my attention concerning the cases that the SRA intervened in. In such circumstances, an intervention essentially means that firms are closed down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o557"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para10"><a name="08020635000007">An independent consultant, funded by the SRA, prepared a detailed report as long ago as July 2006, which concluded that a disproportionate number of black minority ethnic firms were investigated by the SRA. In 2006, 62.8 per cent. of the 59 interventions made by the SRA were against subjects who were Asian, Asian British, black or black British, mixed or unknown, whereas only 37.3 per cent. were made against white or white European solicitors, despite the fact that that group makes up 78.6 per cent. of the solicitor population. The SRA has accepted that there is a serious problem; it has also accepted that it has not done enough to address it. I congratulate it on that candid admission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o558"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para11"><a name="08020635000008">In a letter to me on 28 September last year, Andrew Garbutt, a quality consultant at the SRA said that</p>
<a name="80205-0026.htm_brev2"><a name="08020635000049"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;you will note from these reports that Black and Minority Ethnic solicitors are disproportionably represented in regulatory decisions compared to their overall representation in the profession, and the SRA is exploring the reasons for this disparity.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o559"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para12"><a name="08020635000009">Firms contacted me asking why they found themselves constantly under lengthy investigations with no end in sight. The figures are quite stark. I wrote to the SRA on a number of occasions but was unable to receive a satisfactory explanation for the figures that I had been given. On 10 October 2007, I was told by Antony Townsend, the chief executive of the SRA:</p>
<a name="80205-0026.htm_brev3"><a name="08020635000050"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We share your concern about the disproportionate representation of BME solicitors in regulatory matters over several years...It is for that very reason that the SRA is addressing the matters as one of its early priorities.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o560"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para13"><a name="08020635000010">I worried about what it deemed to be a priority when it became clear to me that the SRA produced report after report stating that there was a problem without taking any action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o561"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para14"><a name="08020635000011">As the Under-Secretary will no doubt know, I called a meeting on 16 October 2007 in the House. It was attended by Mr. Townsend, several different and well regarded groups, from the Black Lawyers Association to the Society of Asian Lawyers, and several solicitors&#146; firms, that had concerns about the way in which the SRA disproportionately affected the work of BME firms. Although the meeting was useful in showing the SRA the extent of concern that many organisations and firms felt, I was unimpressed with what Mr. Townsend promised. It was clear that, although the issue was brought to the SRA&#146;s attention in July, nothing of substance had been done to try to tackle that serious problem by October 2007, when we held the meeting. The idea of a working group, to be chaired by the president of the National Black Police Association, was proposed by those attending the meeting but not acted upon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o562"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para15"><a name="08020635000012">I wrote to the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, requesting a round table discussion with the Department and the SRA to take the matter further. Subsequently, the Under-Secretary chaired a meeting during which SRA board chairman Peter Williamson accepted that the SRA had failed to do enough to deal with that major concern. His admission was most welcome. I also want to thank the Under-Secretary for attending the meeting. She did not interfere with the proceedings, but acted as an honest and effective broker. She chaired the meeting with skill and a clear understanding of the issue of race and ethnicity, doubtless drawn from her experience and the concerns expressed about other issues by her constituents. The SRA&#146;s previous hesitation in the matter may have unwittingly contributed to racism and discrimination towards BME solicitors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o563"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para16"><a name="08020635000013">Since the meeting with the Under-Secretary, we have made some progress, which is very positive. The working group met for the first time on 17 January 2008. At that meeting, it was agreed that Anesta Weekes QC, one of the country&#146;s few black silks, should be invited to be the independent chair of the working group for future meetings, and that Ali Dizaei, a distinguished police officer from London and president of the National Black Police Association,  <br>

would be the vice-chair. In addition, it was agreed that Lord Herman Ouseley, whose record of achievement on race is second to none, would be invited to act as an independent reviewer of the group&#146;s work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o564"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para17"><a name="08020635000014">Among other things, the working group will be responsible for drawing up and agreeing terms of reference for an independent review, which will carry out statistical analysis; re-examining the details of SRA interventions into BME firms or cold casing; examining the composition of the SRA board, which currently has only one BME member; considering the composition and training given to SRA casework staff, and trying to build trust between the SRA and BME solicitors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o565"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para18"><a name="08020635000015">I propose tonight that we go a step further. In my view, the Under-Secretary should appoint an independent monitor to oversee the work of the SRA, so that if any discrimination is found, it is acted upon immediately. It cannot be right that investigations continue into firms if racism or discrimination is found. Let us be clear. There was an important step forward: a clear recognition by the SRA that there was a need to tackle that serious problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o566"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para19"><a name="08020635000016">There are other issues of concern that go beyond race. I have been told by those who have dealt with the SRA that it is slow to deal with correspondence and cases. I can tell the House from my experiences that, until the Under-Secretary&#146;s intervention, I had tremendous difficulty in obtaining responses to my letters, and I expect the correspondence of an MP to be a high priority for any organisation and confidentiality to be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o567"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para20"><a name="08020635000017">After writing to the SRA about a specific firm, the confidentiality of the letter was breached as it became clear that caseworkers other than those involved in the case were aware of the details. When a firm is being investigated, it clearly impedes their work and costs a huge amount of money. It is only fair that a solution is found as quickly and simply as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o568"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para21"><a name="08020635000018">Decisions must be swift, and the actions and advice must be consistent and professional. Some firms have been advised that they have no right of appeal after an SRA adjudicator has made a decision. However, it appears that others have been told differently and that consumers have also been told a different story. I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm whether solicitors or consumers have a right of appeal after SRA adjudication. The livelihoods of solicitors can be at stake in such matters, and the questions raised by the public must be answered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o569"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para22"><a name="08020635000019">The SRA feels that one of the reasons BME firms experience a higher number of interventions than white European firms&#151;its classification, not mine&#151;is that they are in general smaller and that smaller firms are investigated more. That cannot be viewed as a satisfactory explanation. Why should small firms be at a higher risk of being shut down than big firms? In this context small is not beautiful, if small firms as opposed to large firms are immediately put at risk and small BME firms face a double whammy.</p>

I just do not come across them, and I certainly do not regard them as any more fearsome.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o571"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para24"><a name="08020635000021">It is obvious from that statement that large City firms do not feel the bite of the SRA; and yet smaller BME firms have told me that they feel hounded by it, with investigations continuing for years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o572"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para25"><a name="08020635000022">It should be incumbent upon the regulatory body to investigate all accusations and all firms to the same extent, and not to ignore the work of large City firms because they are too powerful and difficult to get results from. The SRA has accepted that it does not approach the &#147;magic circle&#148; firms in the same way, but has said that that is because it does not have the budget necessary to do the job. Yet surely it is just as costly to investigate a BME firm, sometimes for up to four years, as it would be to investigate a City firm for a couple of months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o573"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para26"><a name="08020635000023">It seems that the only explanation for the situation is the one that was given to me during a meeting in my office in December with Peter Williamson, the chairman of the SRA board, who told me honestly that the reason large firms do not get investigated in the same way is that they will often give in to complainants in order to keep them as clients, which is something that smaller firms are less likely to do. In other words, money talks. If the issue is also one of resources, I ask the Minister to look into it and provide more funds if necessary; if it is not, there are more serious questions that must be asked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o574"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para27"><a name="08020635000024">Finally, I want to mention diversity in judicial appointments. It is clear that the issue is no longer that BMEs are not entering the profession; rather, there is an issue of progression. The Government set up the Judicial Appointments Commission in 2006 to reform the system for choosing judges. Yet since those reforms, all the judges who have been appointed have been white, male and, on the whole, privately educated. The situation was in fact much better under the Lord Chancellors Irving and Falconer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o575"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para28"><a name="08020635000025">The Society of Asian Lawyers has passed me a report that claims that in many of the recent appointments the winning candidate still fits the establishment profile, and in one case does not fit the guidelines issued for that position. If that is the case, how can that person be said to be appointed on merit? In this day and age, I am surprised that only 10 of the 108 High Court judges are women and that only one is from an ethnic minority. Why has the Ministry of Justice not dealt with the issue, which has been raised year after year and which it recognises to be important? After all it is dealt with in statute, in provisions under part 4 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005&#151;I know that to be the case, because I and others put them in there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o576"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para29"><a name="08020635000026">We are posed with the age old question: quis custodiet ipsos custodes, or who guards the guardians themselves? I know that the Minister will be keenly watching the progress of the SRA over the coming months. I sincerely hope that it will not be necessary for her to intervene again. It is surely right that we ensure that the public and solicitors get the regulation body that they deserve. For that body to work, the solicitors and the consumers have to trust it. This trust must now be earned.</p>

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) on securing this important debate. He is, and has been, assiduous in pursuing his concerns about black and ethnic minorities both in and outside the legal profession, and his measured approach tonight reflected that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o577"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para30"><a name="08020635000028">As my right hon. Friend said, the SRA was established by the Law Society as an independent body to regulate solicitors in England and Wales in preparation for the new regime that we will introduce under the Legal Services Act 2007. As he said, the Act built on the recommendations of Sir David Clementi, including the requirement for legal regulators to separate their regulatory and representative functions. That is a central principle of the new framework. It is vital to both consumers and the professions that it is clear when a body is acting as a trade union and when it is acting as a regulator, when it should be seen to be separate and independent of that function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o578"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para31"><a name="08020635000029">We are encouraged by the fact that both the Law Society and the Bar have taken steps to establish independent regulatory bodies before the Act comes into force. The Law Society has delegated all its regulatory powers to the SRA apart from rule-making, which it cannot lawfully delegate at present. It has also ensured that it retains no concurrent jurisdiction on regulatory issues. The Law Society has no power to direct the SRA&#146;s board to take a particular approach, either in individual cases or in respect of policies and procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o579"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para32"><a name="08020635000030">The ethos behind the Legal Services Act was to put the consumer first, and to improve the way in which legal services are provided for the public. I am pleased that the SRA is embracing that ethos by giving the public information to help them make better decisions when choosing solicitors. However, I also recognise that, as my right hon. Friend said, the SRA has a real responsibility to the professions that it regulates to ensure that it acts effectively and fairly. As my right hon. Friend acknowledged, it is a relatively young body, and part of its future role will be to review the current procedures and identify areas in need of improvement. I am sure that it will be interested in the views of the solicitors whom it regulates, and will engage with them fully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o580"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para33"><a name="08020635000031">The Law Society requires the SRA to respect the principles of good regulation&#151;of consistency, transparency, proportionality, targeting and accountability&#151;but those principles must also be translated into the way in which the SRA regulates on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o581"><a name="80205-0026.htm_para34"><a name="08020635000032">Let me now deal with the issue of race and the SRA. I am well aware of my right hon. Friend&#146;s anxiety about the way in which the SRA has handled the concerns of black and minority ethnic solicitors in regulatory matters, and I was pleased to be able to facilitate the discussions shortly before Christmas to which my right hon. Friend referred.</p>

Friend that it has taken far longer than anyone would want for it to draw up a structured plan with clear objectives and  <br>

deadlines. However, I am glad that the work has begun to gather some impetus, and that the working group given the task of dealing with it has met and agreed on a way forward. I am also glad that the independent review will examine many of the issues raised by BME stakeholders at the meeting before Christmas, including membership of the SRA board. As my right hon. Friend will know, the board was appointed after open competition in accordance with the Nolan principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o583"><a name="80205-0027.htm_para1"><a name="08020635000034">I believe that the working group will make real progress. It is important for BME stakeholders who feel strongly about the way in which the SRA has handled investigations to play an active role, and for everyone to work together to ensure that conduct matters are investigated in an open and transparent way. Going forward, this work will ensure that the SRA is trusted by solicitors and consumers alike. As my right hon. Friend knows, I cannot comment on individual cases or alleged breaches of confidentiality, but I know that he has written to Antony Townsend, the chief executive, about the length of time it has taken to receive replies to correspondence and I hope that he is getting a better service as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o584"><a name="80205-0027.htm_para2"><a name="08020635000035">The time taken to resolve intervention cases and to respond to queries are issues the review might want to consider. In particular, it might want to examine the types of firms that are investigated and whether there is a link to the resources available to the SRA. The resourcing of the SRA is, however, a matter for the Law Society not the Government, because those bodies are funded by the profession itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o585"><a name="80205-0027.htm_para3"><a name="08020635000036">As my right hon. Friend has stated, the actions of the SRA should be consistent. He has raised the issue of conflicting advice given to firms on appeals. I have also raised that issue with the SRA, and there is no yes or no answer. Whether there is an appeal depends on the circumstances. For example, the SRA has told me that there is no internal right of appeal against a decision to refer a solicitor&#146;s conduct to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal because those decisions are not adjudications, but decisions to prosecute. The SDT must itself decide whether there is a prima facie case before a prosecution proceeds. Findings and orders of the SDT are subject to appeal to the High Court, of course. Nor is there an internal right of appeal against a decision to exercise statutory powers of intervention into a solicitor&#146;s practice. Challenges to intervention decisions must be brought in the High Court in accordance with the provisions of the Solicitors  Act 1974. However, there is an internal right of appeal against a decision to impose a condition on a solicitor&#146;s practising certificate and there is also a statutory right of appeal to the Master of the Rolls. I know that my right hon. Friend has written to the Lord Chancellor on this issue and he will respond to him more fully as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o586"><a name="80205-0027.htm_para4"><a name="08020635000037">I do not think that it is necessary for an independent monitor to be appointed to oversee the work of the SRA. The chair and vice-chair of the working group&#151;two splendid people, as my right hon. Friend said&#151;will be independent and they will be able to review the processes. That will also be carried out by the independent reviewer, Sir Herman Ouseley&#151;an excellent advocate in this area, as my right hon. Friend said. I will, of course, monitor progress and outcomes of the work being undertaken by the SRA because I  <br>

believe that that work is essential, and I will look with interest at the conclusions of the review, and at how the SRA tackles the issues that come out of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o587"><a name="80205-0027.htm_para5"><a name="08020635000038">My right hon. Friend has raised the point that investigations should be suspended, particularly if the review finds evidence of discrimination. I believe that doing so would raise serious consumer protection issues, and we would need to consider that very carefully. In the longer term, oversight will pass to the legal services board and I will ensure that the new board, once it is established, is aware of the progress and outcomes of the review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o588"><a name="80205-0027.htm_para6"><a name="08020635000039">I wish to turn briefly to legal diversity, an area that I consider to be of great importance as my right hon. Friend is aware. The key to a diverse judiciary is a diverse legal profession. There are still huge barriers, as my right hon. Friend pointed out. We are committed to working with, and challenging, the professions where we can to deliver improvements in diversity. That is why I wrote to the top 100 law firms and top 30 chambers in November 2005, and then to the next 100 firms and next 30 chambers in April 2006, asking them to publish their diversity policies and statistics on their websites. I was not hugely impressed by the response. Changes take time and they will not be achieved overnight. The fact that there was some reluctance will not prevent us from continuing to press on these measures.</p>

Those include eligibility changes under the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, which for the first time will allow members of a wider range of legal professionals, including fellows of the Institute of Legal Executives, registered patent agents and registered trademark attorneys, to apply for judicial appointment.</p>
