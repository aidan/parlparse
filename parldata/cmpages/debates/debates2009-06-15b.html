 Let me take this opportunity to welcome the new schools Ministers, Mr. Vernon Coaker and Diana Johnson, the new Children&#146;s Minister, Dawn Primarolo, and the new 14 to 19 and apprenticeships Ministers, Mr. Kevin Brennan and Mr. Iain Wright. May I also thank Jim Knight, Bev Hughes and Sarah McCarthy-Fry for all that they did to improve the lives of children and young people in our country, and congratulate them on that? As a result of their efforts, standards in school have risen. In 1997, more than half of all secondary schools were below our benchmark of at least 30 per cent. of pupils getting five good GCSEs. When we launched our national challenge a year ago, that number of schools had fallen to 631. Today it is down to 440 and we are on track to meet our goal of zero by 2011. To help ensure that we do, I can tell the House that I have today approved seven new national challenge trusts to raise school standards in Birmingham, Torbay, Nottingham, Rochdale, Staffordshire, Chester and the Medway. In recent weeks, we have approved four new academies to replace national challenge schools in Bradford, Bournemouth and East Sussex.</p>

 I visited a secondary school in my constituency&#151;Tytherington high school&#151;last Friday and it is doing an excellent job. The Secretary of State will know that the well-known independent education foundation, Edge, recently stated in a report that one in four pupils are being failed by their secondary school and that a quarter of parents are also deeply concerned that their child is being let down and believe that the education system needs an overhaul. That is slightly different from the response that the Secretary of State has given. Is there not a problem? Will the right hon. Gentleman give the matter serious consideration, as it is an issue of concern to a lot of parents?</p>

 I repeat what I just said. In 1997, more than half of our secondary schools were below our basic benchmark. That number is now down to one in seven&#151;from more than 1,600 to just 440 today. We have further to go, and that is why we are taking forward our national challenge reforms. I would encourage the hon. Gentleman to praise the children in Macclesfield, who have seen a 17.9 percentage point increase in their GCSE results since 1997. That is ahead of the Cheshire average. He should be congratulating pupils in his constituency on their efforts rather than running down the state school system.</p>

of teachers that we have ever had in our country. However, there is more to do to ensure that we get more people to join the teaching profession. The transition from primary to secondary school is crucial to ensuring that children flourish in secondary school, so I was very concerned to see Sir Jim Rose&#146;s comments yesterday that the Opposition&#146;s proposals to shift testing to year 7 would set back that vital transition, to the detriment of children&#146;s learning across our country.</p>

 May I also welcome the new ministerial team and, of course, congratulate the Secretary of State on managing to keep his position in the Department? The Government used to say that they would help to improve standards in secondary schools through the Building Schools for the Future programme. Given that the Government are planning a 50 per cent. cut in real capital spending after 2011, will the Secretary of State tell us how much of that programme will survive the Government&#146;s axe?</p>

 If I remember the content of a private conversation involving the leader of the Liberal party that was overheard on an aeroplane, I think that the hon.

As for Building Schools for the Future, I think that he has got the parties confused; it is the Opposition who are proposing a &#163;4.5 billion cut in that programme. We are determined to ensure that we keep our school building programme moving forward. I wish the Liberals would support investment in our schools rather than choosing to cut it.</p>

 May I first congratulate my right hon. and hon. Friends on their new appointments? My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be aware that different high schools and secondary schools with identical pupil intakes perform very differently, which in my view is overwhelmingly due to teaching methods and classroom regimes. Has he made specific comparisons and will he ensure that in future schools adopt the best forms of teaching and the best forms of classroom culture?</p>

 A very important report from Ofsted published just a few weeks ago considered the 12 top performing secondary schools in the most disadvantaged areas and showed that the vital factors were the quality of their leadership, their commitment to consistency, the quality of their teaching and the high expectations that they had of every child. The fact is that many schools in challenging circumstances are delivering brilliant results. We want to make sure that that happens everywhere, at all times. That is why we are the party that is taking forward the expansion of trusts, academies and specialisms, to make sure that the best leadership is put to work in schools right across the country.</p>

 It is very revealing that the NUT executive leadership should be making Conservative party policy. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that that does not happen on the Labour Benches. I have looked very closely at the arguments, and the conclusion that I have reached on the basis of the expert group report is that objective measurement of the performance of primary school pupils is vital if we are to keep raising standards. As for the Opposition&#146;s proposals, they were roundly criticised yesterday by teaching unions and experts alike because they would lead to less accountability and a poorer quality of marking, with parents being denied the information that they need to track the progress of their child. If I were the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), I would not be bowing to pressure from some unions. I would be doing the right thing by the children of our country&#151;which is what I, unlike him, am determined to do.</p>

It is good to have his support, and I look forward to more of it. The Minister is also a member of the Socialist Education Association, which is committed to equality. Like me, he will be disturbed by the fact that barely 2 per cent. of pupils eligible for free school meals sit physics or chemistry GCSE, with under 4 per cent. sitting biology.

He is the shadow schools Minister, and it is a great relief that he is finally willing, for the first time in five months, to ask me a question.

 Actually, I asked the Secretary of State questions on &#147;The World at One&#148; just 90 minutes ago, and I am surprised that that experience has been wiped clean from his memory, because once again his figures and arguments were utterly discredited. Will he answer the questions that I asked, which were about the science curriculum? The people who work for the right hon. Gentleman point out that, under him, that curriculum has, I am afraid, deteriorated. Ofqual, the exams watchdog, has said that there has been a fall in the quality and rigour of science exams since 2006.

Until recently, Ralph Tabberer was the man responsible for schools in the Department, but now he has blown the whistle by saying that current education policies fail to emphasise scholarship and high-quality study, and that the Secretary of State is simply going in the wrong direction.</p>

As he knows, Ofqual had some concerns about the quality of the new science exam, and they are being addressed, but the fact is that across English, maths and many of the single sciences, we are maintaining standards as take-up increases. He is wrong to spend the whole time running down the achievements of pupils in our state schools, who achieved half of the increase in three A-level passes in recent years. The fact is that we are investing and raising standards through policies that are consistently opposed by the Conservative party.

 I agree with the sentiments expressed by my hon.

Discussions in the school, properly structured and led by qualified personnel, especially health personnel, with young people as advocates can go a great deal further than we have been able to go to date in making sure that young people have the right information to make the right choices for them personally, and to resist the pressures that they often feel.</p>

 I thank the Minister for his answer. Does he share my concern that, with the rapid fall in the number of child minders over the past five years, there are additional pressures on working parents either to give up their jobs in the summer months or, even, to leave their child home alone? Furthermore, given the Government&#146;s welfare programme, will he assure the House that there is close working between Departments to ensure truly appropriate, affordable and quality child care for all those working parents who need it during the summer months?</p>

 I certainly agree with those last comments, which are crucial: we must ensure that adequate, safe and high-quality child care is provided to reassure parents at all times, including during the summer months. I concede to the hon. Lady the point about the number of child minders having fallen over the past two quarterly returns, but I must tell her that the number of places that have been offered has risen slightly, thus providing a greater supply of child care through child minders. On her point about cross-governmental working to ensure that work pays under the welfare system, I must point out to her that the tax credit system has been a huge success and parents can get substantial help towards the cost of registered child care. Working families can claim up to 80 per cent. of their child care costs through the tax credit system, and that equates to &#163;150 a week for one child and up to &#163;240 a week for two or more children.</p>

 I welcome my hon. Friend to his new position and hope that he will be as enthusiastic as he was in his previous one. Of course, it is quite right that we support parents who need child care.

Is my hon. Friend in contact with the education authorities to see whether nurseries can open for extra hours and to ensure that there is extra provision, and will he make sure that, if there is a shortage of funding, he tries to ease that pressure, too?</p>

 Child care is also a problem for working mums of rising fives, who in the first term of their schooling sometimes attend part time and have to go home at 12 o&#146;clock. Working mums, who in this economic climate must work to fund the family budget, find it difficult to manage that. Montgomery school in my constituency, for example, takes children only part time for that first term.

Is the new Minister taking a fresh look at why Government policy is squeezing so many trusted child care providers out of the market?

Furthermore, head teachers are increasingly marking pupils&#146; absence as unauthorised when term-time holidays are taken without permission.

 It is for local authorities to determine the best holiday pattern in their own areas; no doubt the local authority in Kettering will have heard what the hon.

However, it is very difficult for the national Government to say what the best holiday pattern is in every area across the country. But let us be clear. We expect our young people to go to school during term time; we do not expect them to miss lessons unnecessarily&#151;and that includes when their parents unnecessarily take them away from school to go on holiday.</p>

 Are not some schools guilty of sending mixed messages to parents when, on the one hand, they caution against taking holidays during term time but, on the other, organise ski trips to countries whose language is not being taught at that school? That takes not only children but key members of staff out of education at the same time. Would not such trips be better taken during the holidays?</p>

 The Derbyshire experience so far shows an excellent record, as my hon. Friend says. Young children are achieving good levels of development, and there has been considerable progress&#151;above the national average&#151;on narrowing the gap between the lowest-achieving and the rest. Funding from the Department is in place not only for the existing centres but to complete the roll-out of the further nine in Derbyshire by March 2010. I have absolutely no reason to believe that that will not happen. The Sure Start funding is ring-fenced, and the Government will watch closely. Should the local authority decide to follow the Opposition&#146;s pleas and cut Sure Start, it can be sure that it will face opposition from both the Government and, I am sure, local parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0906157000134">On the day of that last combat patrol in April, I<i> </i>welcomed Prime Minister Maliki and most of his Cabinet to London. We signed together a declaration of friendship, partnership and co-operation defining the new relationship between our two countries for the future. At the request of the Iraqi Government, a small number of British Navy personnel&#151;no more than 100&#151;will remain in Iraq for long-term training of the Iraqi Army. Royal Navy ships will continue to protect the oil platforms on which Iraq's exports depend, and we will continue to offer training to the Iraqi army as part of a wider NATO mission. We will also offer training opportunities at Sandhurst and elsewhere in the United Kingdom for Iraqi officers of high potential. At the core of our new relationship, however, will be the diplomatic, trading and cultural links that we are building with the Iraqi people, supporting British and other foreign investors who want to play a role in the reconstruction of southern Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0906157000135">I have discussed with Prime Minister Maliki a plan for British companies to supply expertise to the Iraqi Oil Ministry. Earlier this year, the Mesopotamia Petroleum Company signed a joint venture worth $400 million. Shell is working with the Southern Oil Company to bring to market some of the 700 million cu ft of gas that is currently lost each day by flaring. British companies are now competing for further contracts, and Rolls-Royce and Parsons are currently discussing with the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity proposals for a new power generation infrastructure worth an initial $200 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0906157000136">British funding will support lending to 1,000 businesses in southern Iraq, and a youth employment programme that should give training and work permanently to young Basrawis could be rolled out across the whole of Iraq as a result of its success. We are supporting the Iraqi Transport Ministry in the resumption of civilian flights; the Department for International Development and the British Council are working on a major education programme; and Iraq has already identified its first 250 students, an early initiative in Britain&#146;s contribution to Iraq&#146;s plans for 10,000 overseas scholarships for Iraqi students.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0906157000137">Issues in the region still confront us. Iran is an independent nation that deserves our respect, and the Iranian people are a proud people who deserve democracy. That is why the regime must address the serious questions that have been asked about the conduct of the elections. The way in which the regime responds to legitimate protests will have implications for Iran&#146;s relationships with the rest of the world in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0906157000138">The House will note the speech made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, in which for the first time he endorsed a two-state solution. His speech was an important step forward, but there remains a long road ahead of us. I will speak to him again later today to impress on him the importance of freezing settlements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0906157000139">With the last British combat troops about to return home from Iraq, now is the right time to ensure that we have a proper process in place to enable us to learn the lessons of the complex and often controversial events of the last six years. I am today announcing the establishment of an independent Privy Counsellor committee of inquiry which will consider the period from summer 2001, before military operations began in March 2003, and our subsequent involvement in Iraq right up to the end of July this year. The inquiry is essential because it will ensure that, by learning lessons, we strengthen the health of our democracy, our diplomacy and our military.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0906157000140">The inquiry will, I stress, be fully independent of Government. Its scope is unprecedented. It covers an eight-year period, including the run-up to the conflict and the full period of conflict and reconstruction. The committee of inquiry will have access to the fullest range of information, including secret information. In other words, its investigation can range across all papers, all documents and all material. It can ask for any British document to be brought before it, and for any British citizen to appear. No British document and no British witness will be beyond the scope of the inquiry. I have asked the members of the committee to ensure that the final report will be able to disclose all but the most sensitive information&#151;that is, all information except that which is essential to our national security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0906157000141">The inquiry will receive the full co-operation of the Government. It will have access to all Government papers, and the ability to call any witnesses. The objective is to learn the lessons from the events surrounding the conflict. It is on that basis that I have accepted the Cabinet Secretary&#146;s advice that the Franks inquiry is the best precedent. Like the Franks inquiry, this inquiry will take account of national security considerations&#151;for example, what might damage or reduce our military capability in the future&#151;and evidence will be heard in private. I believe that that will also ensure that evidence given by serving and former ministers, military officers and officials is as full and candid as possible. The committee will publish its findings in as full a form as possible. These findings will then be debated in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. It is in these debates, as well as from the report itself, that we can draw fully upon the lessons learned in Iraq. So while the format is the same as that of the Franks inquiry, we have gone much further in the scope of the inquiry. No inquiry has looked at such a long period, and no inquiry has the powers to look in so much breadth, for while Franks looked only at the run-up to the Falklands conflict, the Iraq inquiry will look at the run-up to conflict, the conflict itself and the reconstruction, so that we can learn lessons in each and every area. The inquiry will take into account evidence submitted to previous inquiries, and I am asking members of the committee to explain the scope, width and breadth of its work to Opposition leaders and the Chairs of the relevant parliamentary Committees.</p>

So I can also tell the House that in the autumn of this year a service of thanksgiving and commemoration will be held in Westminster abbey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0906157000147">We salute our forces today. Through their work, the work of their American and coalition comrades and of the Iraqi security forces, and supported by the courage and vision of those within Iraq led by Prime Minister Maliki, Iraq is emerging from the shadow of 30 years of brutal dictatorship and then conflict. Today, Prime Minister Maliki and his Government can work together for a peaceful and prosperous future. That they can now do so is the ultimate tribute to all who served in Iraq: to their skills, commitment and sheer professionalism; to their great and enduring courage in conflict; and to their immeasurable contribution to reconstruction and to peace.</p>

civilian. Of course, the Iraq conflict caused great division in our politics, our Parliament and our country, but we can all unite over the professionalism and bravery of our armed forces, the service they gave to our country, and the debt we owe to all those who lost their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para18"><a name="0906157000151">I start with some of the things we agree about in the statement. Yes, we agree about the need for a strong relationship between democratic Iraq and Britain. We absolutely agree about the need for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine and welcome what Prime Minister Netanyahu has said. Yes, we need answers about the conduct of those Iranian elections. But I want to focus my questions on the inquiry announced by the Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para19"><a name="0906157000152">We welcome an inquiry&#151;indeed, we have been calling for it for many months&#151;but I have to say that I am far from convinced that the Prime Minister has got it right. The whole point of having an inquiry is that it has to be able to make clear recommendations, to go wherever the evidence leads, to establish the full truth and to ensure that the right lessons are learned, and it has to do so in a way that builds public confidence. Is there not a danger that what the Prime Minister has announced today will not achieve those objectives? The membership looks quite limited, the terms of reference seem restrictive, the inquiry is not specifically tasked with making recommendations and none of it will be held in public. So will the Prime Minister answer questions about the following four areas: the timing; the membership; the coverage and content; and the openness?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0906157000153">First, on the timing, this inquiry should have started earlier. How can anyone argue that an inquiry starting six months ago, for example, would somehow have undermined British troops? Indeed, the argument that we cannot have any inquiry while troops are still in Iraq has been blown away today by the Prime Minister&#146;s saying that some troops will be staying there even as the inquiry gets under way. As for how long the inquiry takes, the Franks inquiry reported in just six months, yet this inquiry is due to take&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;until July or August 2010. Will delaying the start of the inquiry and prolonging the publication until after the next election not lead everyone to conclude that this inquiry has been fixed to make sure that the Government avoid having to face up to any inconvenient conclusions? At the very least, will the Prime Minister look at the possibility of having an interim report early next year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para21"><a name="0906157000154">Secondly, on the people conducting the inquiry, what is required for an inquiry such as this is a mixture of diplomatic, military and political experience. We welcome the diplomatic experience, but there must be a question mark over the military experience&#151;there are no former chiefs of staff or people with that sort of expertise. In addition, is it not necessary to include, as the Franks inquiry did, senior politicians from all sides of the political divide to look at the political judgments? The inquiry needs to be, and needs to be seen to be, truly independent and not an establishment stitch-up, so will the Prime Minister look at widening the membership in the way that we have suggested?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para22"><a name="0906157000155">The third area is the coverage and the content of the inquiry. It is welcome that the inquiry will cover the whole period in the run-up to the war, as well as the conduct of the war, but is it not wrong to try to confine   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="15 Jun 2009">

<notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2009 : Column 26</b><br>
the inquiry to an arbitrary period of time? Should it not be free to pursue any points that it judges to be relevant? On the specific issue of the terms of reference, is it not extraordinary that the Prime Minister said that it should try to avoid apportioning blame? Should not the inquiry have the ability to apportion blame? If mistakes were made, we need to know who made them and why they were made. The Prime Minister was very clear that the inquiry would have access to all British documents and all British witnesses. Does that mean that the inquiry may not have access to documents from the USA, the coalition provisional authority or the Iraqi Government, even if they are kept in the British archive? That is an important specific question and one to which we need an answer. Will the inquiry be free to invite foreign witnesses to give evidence&#151;written and oral?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para23"><a name="0906157000156">On the scope of the inquiry, will the Prime Minister confirm that it will cover relations with the United States; the use of intelligence information; the function of the machinery of government; post-conflict planning; and how the Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the armed forces work together?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para24"><a name="0906157000157">I turn now to the issue of openness and transparency. Given that this inquiry is of interest not only to us politicians but to the public and the families of servicemen and women who gave their lives, should there not be some proper public sessions? Is that not what many will want and many will expect, and is it not part of the building of public confidence that is absolutely necessary?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para25"><a name="0906157000158">Finally, are not the limitations of this inquiry reflected in the way the House of Commons is being treated by the Government over this issue? Before the Franks inquiry&#151;we are told that this is a Franks-style inquiry&#151;there was a proper debate on the terms of reference of the inquiry on a substantive motion in the House of Commons. This time<i> &#151;[Interruption.]</i> The Prime Minister laughs, but this time there is just a statement and no debate, even though last Wednesday he promised us a new era of parliamentary accountability and democratic renewal. What happened to that? It has not lasted even a week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para26"><a name="0906157000159">A proper inquiry must include a range of members, including senior politicians. It needs to have the freedom to range widely and to speak frankly, and its terms of reference must be debated properly in a democracy such as ours. So when the Prime Minister responds, will he put those failings right?</p>

<p><a name="st_o84"><a name="0906157000160"><a name="90615-0004.htm_spmin0"><a name="0906157000400"><b>The Prime Minister:</b>
 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his comments about our soldiers who have died in Afghanistan and the contribution they have made. I am glad that he also agrees with what I have said about Iran and the behaviour of the Iranian regime, including the need for it to stop any violence against people who are protesting against the election result peacefully. I also agree with him about the support that we want to give to our troops and the need to take into account at all times, especially as we consider this inquiry, the wishes, views and sensitivities of the families of the people who have died or been injured in the fighting in Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para27"><a name="0906157000161">Almost all the points that the right hon. Gentleman raised are dealt with by the remit and scope&#151;the breadth and depth&#151;of the inquiry. The shadow Foreign Secretary and he spent a great deal of time calling for a Franks-style inquiry, and that is exactly what we have&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><br>


<meta name="Date" content="15 Jun 2009">

<notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2009 : Column 27</b><br>
There are repeated references in <i> Hansard</i> to the shadow Foreign Secretary and the Leader of the Opposition saying that what they wanted was a Franks-style inquiry, which is what we have got.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para28"><a name="0906157000162">The right hon. Gentleman says that the remit of the inquiry is restricted, but I cannot think of an inquiry with a more comprehensive, wider or broader remit than the one that I have just announced. Far from being restricted, it will cover eight years, from 2001 to 2009. Far from being restricted, it will have access to any documents that are available, and that will include foreign documents that are available in British archives. As far as we are concerned, it may interview any witnesses, including British witnesses and witnesses it wants to invite, if necessary, from abroad. I do not think there is any fundamental disagreement between us on the nature of the inquiry, its scope and its comprehensiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para29"><a name="0906157000163">I remind the right hon. Gentleman about the timing. The Franks inquiry looked only at the run-up to the Falklands war. Incidentally, it was announced in a written answer to the House of Commons, not in an oral statement. This inquiry will deal with the run-up to the conflict, the conflict itself and all issues of reconstruction after the conflict. With such a broad remit, I cannot think of any set of events that can be excluded that are of importance to Iraq and the future of our relationship with Iraq. It is hardly surprising that if we are dealing with that eight-year period&#151;the run-up to the war, the conflict itself and the aftermath&#151;the inquiry will take time to interview witnesses and take evidence. Its report will be detailed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para30"><a name="0906157000164">I have said that the report should be as comprehensive as possible, given the issues of national security that are involved. In other words, all but the most sensitive of information should be reported to the House of Commons. The lessons that will be learned from the Iraq events will be learned not just from the investigation, but from the debates that will take place in this House when we receive the full report from the inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para31"><a name="0906157000165">As for the membership, I think that there is a difference between now and the Franks inquiry. For eight years, we have had politicians commenting on Iraq one way or another in this House and elsewhere. We would do better in these circumstances to draw on the professional and expert advice of people who have not been involved in commenting on this issue over the last few years. That is why we have what I believe can be regarded as a committee of people who can be regarded as both knowledgeable and expert in their field. I defy the Opposition to criticise the individuals who are named in this inquiry as people who are not capable of carrying out an important piece of work. They are suited for that task, and they will do a good job. I hope that people will recognise that they are respected in their own fields and have a great deal to offer in this inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="90615-0004.htm_para32"><a name="0906157000166">The events in Iraq are controversial. They have led to heated debate in this House and across the country, but it is possible for us to work together to learn the lessons of this inquiry. I hope that it will not become the subject of partisan in-fighting. It will be carried out by a respectable group of people who have great reputations throughout our country and I hope that it will receive the support of as many hon. Members as possible.</p>

 I should like to add my expressions of sympathy and condolence to the family and friends of Lieutenant Paul Mervis and Private Robert McLaren, who tragically lost their lives in Afghanistan in this last week. Of course I join the Prime Minister in paying tribute to our brave servicemen and women, who have served our country so courageously in Iraq over the past six years. In particular, I pay tribute to the 179 who have lost their lives. They and their families are in our thoughts today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="90615-0005.htm_para0"><a name="0906157000168">I passionately believe that we were wrong to invade Iraq, but I am second to none in my admiration for the bravery and dedication of our servicemen and women. Everyone knows that the invasion of Iraq was the biggest foreign policy mistake that this country has made in generations&#151;the single most controversial decision taken by Government since Suez&#151;so I am staggered that the Prime Minister is seeking to compound that error, which was fatal for so many of Britain&#146;s sons and daughters, by covering up the path that led to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="90615-0005.htm_para1"><a name="0906157000169">The Liberal Democrats have called for an inquiry into the build-up and conduct of the Iraq war for many years. I suppose we can be grateful that, finally, the Prime Minister has acceded to that demand. However, as is so often the case, he has taken a step in the right direction but missed the fundamental point. A secret inquiry, conducted by a clutch of grandees hand-picked by the Prime Minister, is not what Britain needs. Does the Prime Minister not understand that the purpose of an inquiry is not just to produce a set of conclusions but to allow the people of Britain to come to terms with a mistake made in their name?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="90615-0005.htm_para2"><a name="0906157000170">I met the families of soldiers who lost their lives in Iraq and just an hour ago they asked me to speak in their name and to tell the Prime Minister that nothing short of a fully public inquiry, held in the open, will satisfy them. Will he at least listen to what those grieving families need?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="90615-0005.htm_para3"><a name="0906157000171">The Prime Minister says that the inquiry has to be held in private to protect national security, but it looks to me suspiciously as though he wants to protect his reputation and that of his predecessor instead. Why else would he want the inquiry to report after the general election, when we could have at least interim reports before then? It is perfectly possible to have a limited number of sensitive sessions in camera while retaining the fundamental principle that the vast bulk of the inquiry&#151;not just a few public sessions, as recommended by the Conservative leader&#151;should be open to all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="90615-0005.htm_para4"><a name="0906157000172">I am grateful that the Prime Minister has listened to my representations and has extended the inquiry to cover the full origins of the war and given it full access to the documents and files that it will need. However, I am disappointed that he made such a feeble attempt to secure consensus on the panel that will conduct the inquiry. The experience of successfully established inquiries, such as the one now being held in the Netherlands, shows that consensus can be secured only if the Government conduct painstaking consultation over a prolonged period of time. Why did the Prime Minister not even attempt that sort of constructive discussion with other parties?</p>

The inquiry will cover eight years of our history, and will be a very detailed piece of work that has to be done.</p>

The report will be published and debated in this House. That is exactly how the Franks inquiry went about its work. To be fair to the right hon. Gentleman, he disagrees with using Franks as a model, although the main Opposition party has always wanted that. However, we must take into account national security considerations, and what is known about the capability of our armed forces and security services, and the missions they are undertaking at the moment. We also have to take into account what serving officers will want to say to the inquiry. I think that the right hon. Gentleman will come to recognise that all those things involve a degree of confidentiality that would not suit a public inquiry, where all witnesses give evidence in public. The lesson of public inquiries is that they take many, many years, because everybody who comes before one wants to be represented by a lawyer. We know that from other public inquiries that are taking place at the moment, one of which has already taken eight years and is no nearer to completion now than it was a year ago.</p>

It is up to the inquiry to decide how long it will take to do its work. I think that the best way for it to report to the House is with a comprehensive piece of work, rather than through piecemeal reports. In the end, the members of the inquiry team will decide how long it will take them to do the work, but I think the right hon. Gentleman will agree that it will take some time to cover eight years of history in the most detailed way. All witnesses and all evidence can come before the inquiry. I hope that he will agree, on reflection, that those who have been selected and asked to take part in the inquiry are people of high reputation who can do a very good job of work for this country.</p>

What the British people well understand is that after the capture of Baghdad, the political management of the occupation was extremely incompetent, as is recognised now in both America and Europe.

 In the history of the conflict, two political matters cry out for explanation more than any other.

The second matter that requires explanation is why the Attorney-General&#146;s opinion on the legality of the war was never shown to the Cabinet before the decision to go to war was made.

I believe that is exactly what will happen. For the Liberal party or anybody in the House to jump to the conclusion that the inquiry is in some way not independent is completely wrong. It is an independent inquiry, independent of Government, able to take all papers and able to interview any witnesses. I know that the Liberal party wanted it to be held in public, but I think they know also what happens when there are public inquiries.

Just look at the alternative. The alternative would mean a long inquiry, lasting years, in which everybody would be represented by a lawyer rather than by themselves. That is not the way to learn the best lessons from this conflict.</p>

Sadly, the number of fatalities in Afghanistan looks as though it is about to overtake the number of fatalities in Iraq. There are important lessons here regarding what is happening in Afghanistan.

 I very much welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s announcement of an inquiry. However, will he revisit the advice that he has been given by the Cabinet Secretary&#151;I can understand why that advice was given&#151;in two respects in particular? First, the central purpose of the inquiry is surely not just to learn the lessons, although that clearly is an objective, but to establish the truth of what happened. Secondly, the Public Administration Committee, which I chair, has been taking an interest in the form that any inquiry into Iraq should take. Last week, we held a private seminar of very distinguished people, and we are about to issue a report. I have to say that those people felt that the Franks inquiry was appropriate 25 years ago, but a private Privy Counsellor inquiry would not be thought appropriate now. The worst thing of all, surely, would be to replicate all the arguments we have had about Iraq with similar arguments about the form that an inquiry would take. As I say, I welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s statement, but could he regard it as the beginning of a short process of consultation, so that he can carry the whole House with him?</p>

 I have read the letter that my hon. Friend has written to me, and I appreciate what he has said about his views and those of other people on this. However, his point is answered by the fact that the range of this inquiry goes through eight years&#151;from 2001 to 2009. What he wanted to be sure of was that all the issues relating to Iraq would be discussed. We could have had an inquiry like Franks only into the run-up to the war; we could have had an inquiry about the conflict itself; we could have had an inquiry about reconstruction. Those are all big issues, and we have an inquiry that covers them all. The range of the inquiry is as big as it could be, as a result of the decision that we have made. Some of the points that my hon.

Will he ensure that, if possible, any of the taped conversations between the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and the then President of the United States are made available to the inquiry?

People will be able to see for themselves what conclusions are drawn by the inquiry.

 My hon. Friend makes a strong point. There is enormous concern in the agricultural community about the collapse of the co-operative and the impact on producers, who may be unable to sell their milk to alternative sources. We look forward to hearing what the Government say about that on Thursday. It is particularly important that the banks should have regard to the continuing viability of many of the businesses affected while they make short-term arrangements to change their purchasers and that they should regard those businesses with sympathy. My hon.

Do the Government not need to ensure that the supply chain receives the same support from which larger employers in more urban areas seem to benefit?</p>

As the House will have an opportunity to debate agricultural issues on Thursday, I want to focus today on the wider rural economy and the effect of the recession on it. Although rural areas have lower rates of unemployment overall, in the year to April, the average annual increase in jobseeker&#146;s allowance claimants across rural districts was 131 per cent. Some of the steepest rises in the unemployment rate have been in sparsely populated and peripheral rural districts. The number of people chasing every unfilled vacancy in many peripheral rural districts is far higher than the average across Britain, and in the worst cases&#151;Restormel in Cornwall and Staffordshire Moorlands, for instance&#151;it is actually higher than in major urban unemployment blackspots.</p>

 I urge my hon. Friend not to misunderstand what I said about farming. I said that farming was a vital industry. It is factually correct that it accounts for only a relatively small part of the economy; nevertheless, it is a primary industry and a significant employer. It also manages the land, and it is vital that we should have a viable, successful and competitive farming industry. The Conservative party has been robust in making that case, and that applies as much to Staffordshire, as an important farming county, as it does to other parts of the country.</p>

The simple fact is that, in a rural area, people&#146;s work and services are often further away from where they live. Government measures such as increasing fuel duty and the tax on 4x4 vehicles can therefore hit rural workers, particularly the low-paid, disproportionately hard. The Commission for Rural Communities has noted that fewer than half the residents in villages and hamlets live within 13 minutes of a bus stop with a service at least once an hour, compared with 95 per cent. of urban residents.</p>

Such costs for a poor connection, which would be cheaply available in an urban area, are undermining farm diversification and the potential for rural development. For businesses in the future, broadband speed will really matter, so the Government&#146;s commitment to making 2 megabyte broadband available to &#147;virtually everyone&#148; is welcome. However, we will await Lord Carter&#146;s final report later this week to find out what &#147;virtually everyone&#148; really means.

 The Commission for Rural Communities mentions two definitions of rural communities. The standard one, the DEFRA definition, relates to communities of fewer than 10,000 people. In my constituency, for example, all the villages and small towns have fewer than 10,000 people, so it amounts to a genuinely rural constituency. There is another definition, which relates to the rural nature of local authorities. The hon. Gentleman mentioned discrepancies between the north and the south, but it is possible to find rural deprivation in the rural south as well&#151;certainly in the south-west. The discrepancies between the rural deprived and the more affluent are more important than a north-south geographical divide, in my view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90615-0007.htm_para9"><a name="0906157000270">Such disparities are not only about fairness. If rural businesses are disadvantaged, we waste huge potential. Rural areas are home to a quarter of all England&#146;s businesses, employing 5.5 million people and with a total turnover of &#163;300 billion. There are higher rates of self-employment and new business start-ups in rural areas, and more businesses per capita than in urban areas.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making an excellent speech, and I am sorry to interrupt him. He mentioned small businesses and farm diversification.

That should be an absolute priority for the Government. There are many things over which they have no control, and many things that are going to cost money, but using their influence over, and shareholding in, the major banks would help to solve that problem.</p>

It is our fifth biggest industry and it does well in this country in spite of, not because of, Government. Tourism has been pushed out to the RDAs, which do not provide the level of support that our businesses need. One example is the &#163;35 million put through by DEFRA, which has not reached the farms that want to diversify into tourism during these difficult times; instead, it has gone to the regional development agencies and got sucked into the bureaucratic system, never to be seen on the front line of tourism.</p>

 I agree with my right hon. Friend. As I said, there is a danger of a growing digital divide&#151;we already have a digital divide&#151;and the challenge for the Government is how higher-speed broadband can be financed. We hope to hear more about that from the Government this week, including whether there is any potential to lever in substantial private finance to ensure wider access to high-speed broadband. Another crucial issue for the long-term potential of economic growth in rural areas in the digital age is having a decent broadband link, which many rural areas are simply lacking at the moment.

We need to reverse the trend of centralisation and end the years of thoughtless Whitehall diktat so that the needs of rural communities are respected.

We will allow councils to establish their own local enterprise partnerships to take over the economic development functions and funding of the regional development agencies.

 With respect, the Minister has already said something about his predecessor, and I rise to make a simple point. I wrote to DEFRA on 1 April with a detailed request for certain pieces of information that are highly relevant to this debate. I still have not received a reply, and on behalf of my farmers, who have been having a very difficult time, I ask the Minister to make sure that I receive one as soon as possible.</p>

DEFRA, the first Department with an explicit remit for rural affairs, was created in 2001. Having reviewed the White Paper in early 2004, we followed up with the rural strategy later that year. It was far-reaching, and aimed to build on the economic success of the majority of rural areas, while tackling those that were felt to be at either economic or social disadvantage. That strategy still underpins the Government&#146;s approach to rural affairs; it is one of equity and fairness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90615-0008.htm_para9"><a name="09061520000009">As we now know, one in five people in England live in a settlement of fewer than 10,000 inhabitants&#151;that is about 10 million people in all. Our rural communities are home to about 1 million businesses, providing more than 5.5 million jobs. There are more businesses for every 10,000 people in rural areas than there are in urban areas.</p>

They have a combined turnover of more than &#163;300 billion per year. Of course, rural England is not a single, homogenous entity; it takes many forms. Going by a wide range of social and economic indicators, rural areas are performing well; their performance is usually on a par with, or better than, urban areas, and that may surprise many. The evidence suggests that most of rural England is well connected, with strong links to nearby towns and cities and good access to local markets and job opportunities. That is why our rural areas have been performing well in both social and economic terms.</p>

 The Minister mentioned employment prospects and getting advice on employment. Does he share my concern that the Department for Work and Pensions&#151;I know it is not his Department&#151;has closed two jobcentres in west Norfolk? That basically breaks the link involving advisers and those in jobcentres who can give immediate input to people who are trying to find or move jobs. Such people now have to travel a great deal further to get that advice, and if someone does not have a car in a place such as Norfolk, they very often do not have a job, and vice versa.</p>

 I understand that the DWP has suspended any further closures, particularly in these difficult economic times, but I recognise that there has been a rationalisation of jobcentres and benefits agencies, the creation of Jobcentre Plus and an attempt to ensure that appropriate and necessary assistance is provided as efficiently as possible.</p>

In many respects, rural communities are no different from any other; people there want not only well-paid and secure employment and somewhere decent to live, but long and healthy lives and a good education for their children. It is therefore perhaps no surprise that the impacts of the current recession on rural areas are very similar to those in urban areas. More specifically, when the comparison is made with urban areas the emerging picture in rural England is one of lower risk, higher resilience and higher recovery prospects. So it is worth pausing for a minute to examine what is really happening in rural areas.</p>

The labour force survey for the first quarter of 2009 showed that 18.5 per cent. of the 254,000 people made redundant in the previous three months came from rural areas&#151;the percentage roughly corresponds to the 19.3 per cent. of the population who live in rural areas. The agriculture industry is specifically helped by the stability of demand for its produce, compared with other sectors of the economy. New tractor registrations&#151;not a statistic that I have cited much in my political past, but one that I shall be looking at in future&#151;which are traditionally regarded as a bell-wether of the industry&#146;s confidence, increased by more than 6 per cent. in the first four months of 2009 compared with the same period in 2008.</p>

In case I am accused of being in denial, I should say that none of this says that rural areas or rural communities are immune from the effects of recession, and no one would claim that&#151;especially me. It is easy to talk about averages, because that is what we can measure and compare, but the simple fact is that for an individual who has lost his or her job, and who fears losing a home as well, the effects are devastating.</p>

Nevertheless, the available indicators appear to show that rural areas are holding up well so far, and in most cases have not suffered as much as urban areas. Across the UK, there have been some encouraging signs that confidence is improving, although we remain cautious.

Given the many similarities between rural and urban economies, we believe that that is the right approach, rather than establishing a number of separate smaller rural schemes that would only add to the costs of administration.</p>

More than &#163;400 million-worth of eligible applications from over 3,600 small businesses have been assessed and are being processed or have been granted. More than 2,500 businesses have been offered loans totalling more than &#163;231 million. We are supporting cash flow by agreeing deferred payment of more than &#163;2.5 billion in tax by 145,000-plus businesses since November, as well as enabling companies to spread the increases in business rates over the next three years. A business paying a rates bill on a typical property that will see a &#163;600 rise in its rates liability in 2009-10 will be able to defer &#163;360 of that increase to future years.</p>

The appointment on 3 June of PricewaterhouseCoopers as receivers and managers of Dairy Farmers of Britain, a farmer-owned dairy co-operative with a turnover of approximately &#163;500 million a year, was disappointing to all those interested in the dairy industry, and distressing to employees, the farmer members, dependent businesses and customers.</p>

400 businesses in a dozen towns and villages around my very rural constituency, and I got a range of messages. There is a mixed picture out there. Clearly, there were some good news stories and some exceptionally bad news stories, but the modal response was something like, &#147;Things are about where they were a year ago, but we have had to work twice as hard and think twice as hard to make sure that they stayed that way.&#148;</p>

The problem remains that the rural community is nevertheless in a vulnerable position, largely because of Government failure over the past three decades to support our communities.</p>

Given that Members have become rather adept at contrition recently, I wonder whether anyone on the Conservative Benches might consider disarming those of us who are a tiny bit sceptical by saying sorry. There is nothing wrong with irony so long as one understands that it is irony, and as such we support the motion. We are concerned about the lack of any solutions presented within, however, and that is why we tabled an amendment in an attempt to provide some substance and to strengthen the hand of farmers and growers, who are so often forced to take poverty rates for their produce by much more powerful operators in the food market&#151;chiefly, those on the retail side.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I look at my own constituency as a microcosm. Rising prices eject people from the Lake district and dales parts of my constituency, so they move to Kendal, then that becomes unaffordable, so they move to Milnthorpe and Flookburgh, and then even those become unaffordable, so they move even further away. The impact on housing and other parts of the economy is palpable and seriously damaging.</p>

With farm incomes under threat as never before, and with the challenge of climate change facing every one of us, we must ensure that the new deal for the countryside has an unmistakably green tinge. We could extend carbon trading to enable large corporations to offset their carbon emissions by paying our farmers for work to extend carbon sequestration further in the countryside. In the uplands, especially, that could mean that our hill farmers finally get the rewards they deserve for their role as the stewards of our environment and our landscapes.</p>

For example, there should be a far-reaching scheme to ensure that farmers can choose to host anaerobic digesters with Government start-up funding to enable whole communities to recycle organic waste and to create renewable energy.</p>

 Indeed, &#147;The Archers&#148; is doing a great job in popularising that technology. However, this country is way behind in deploying it&#151;for example, about 70 times more anaerobic digesters exist in Germany&#151;despite the clear engagement of the farming community and their willingness to lead the way.</p>

Let us acknowledge that whatever rules apply to the provision of hospital services in urban areas, there are overriding concerns in rural areas. It cannot be right for heart and stroke services at rural hospitals such as Westmorland general hospital to be removed to places such as Lancaster, leaving patients in emergency need up to an hour and a half away from their nearest acute hospital. Neither can it be right to force cancer patients in rural areas to make daily three-hour round trips for life-saving treatment. That is why we are committed to returning acute services and to creating new cancer services at our rural hospitals. That is right not only because people in rural communities   <br>

deserve the same standards of health care as those in urban communities but because the development of, for example, a new &#163;15 million cancer treatment unit at my local hospital in Kendal, and at others, would be a significant economic driver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="90615-0010.htm_para12"><a name="09061520000097">Tourism is central to the economies of many rural areas. The Cumbrian tourism economy alone is worth &#163;1.2 billion each year. This year, there are some signs, in the lakes and dales at least, that businesses in the tourism industry are faring better than expected. I suspect that the weakness of the pound and the strength of the product have helped us, but times are still challenging. Although much of tourism&#146;s revenue goes back to the Exchequer, there is little attempt by the Government to nurture that investment. Small bed-and-breakfast establishments are forced to abide by the same regulations and rules as huge hotel chains. They are hampered by ridiculous cut-off rules on VAT, which limit their ability to grow and take custom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="90615-0010.htm_para13"><a name="09061520000098">The support for marketing of our tourism industry is dismal. We have a premier league tourism product in this country, but especially in England we have non-league levels of marketing funding. The Government must acknowledge the importance of our tourism industry if they are to help the rural economy fight its way out of recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="90615-0010.htm_para14"><a name="09061520000099">In all of that, it is essential that local communities are in control of their own destiny. As we have seen from the loss of post offices, the decline of many communities and the cuts to rural health services, there is an overwhelming sense of anger at things being done to us without our consent. We are sometimes offered consultations, but that has become a meaningless word under this Labour Government. Never have we been more consulted and less listened to. The top-down decisions to close jobcentres in rural areas, rob our rural communities of post offices, take away rural tax offices, force through the reduction in social housing stock and remove acute hospital services have all damaged our rural communities, but we were given no say in them.</p>

 Does that not bespeak a complete failure of the principle of rural proofing, which the Government enunciated clearly a few years ago when they set up the new Department? It was supposed to ensure that every policy that flowed from the Government was examined for its effect on rural communities and amended to ensure that it was either positive or, at worst, neutral for them. In fact, we have had policy after policy that has done damage to the fabric of rural society.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I referred earlier to acute hospital services, which are probably one of the best&#151;or rather worst&#151;examples of that failure. We are told that we need all bells and whistles when it comes to new heart services, for example. Absolutely&#151;I want the best possible health care available to my constituents and those of all the Members who are present. But what is the point of a state-of-the-art, cutting-edge, all-bells-and-whistles heart unit to someone who is dead on arrival because it took them an hour and a half to get there? Rural proofing appears to mean absolutely nothing in practice, and that failure must come to an end.</p>

 I appreciate that in many rural areas it is more difficult to attract a certain number of applicants for positions, but at Westmorland general hospital there were consultants available and the unit was operating. It was a life-saving service, and many hundreds of people owe their lives to it. It would have continued had the trust allowed it to do so, and had the trust been accountable it would never have got away with closing it.</p>

 To give a perspective from the other end of the country, upper gastrointestinal cancer services have been transferred out of Treliske, and the surgeon now has to travel up to Derriford to undertake surgery. Although it might be necessary to centralise services, in Cornwall we are seeing the salami-slicing of services that are going up the line. Why cannot rural areas have a centre of excellence too? That is the frustration.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a tremendous point. Surely the point is that we have put an awful lot of money into the NHS in recent years. This party supported the Government on that, but we want to get something for that money. It is galling for people in rural areas who see more money going to the NHS but then see the closure of heart units, stroke units and other services. We are paying consultants a lot of money, and we should be able to determine where they practise. That must be within the competence of the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90615-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09061520000107">To strengthen rural communities, we should start by using the Sustainable Communities Act 2007, which was mentioned earlier, to give them the right to preserve key services. We need elected local health boards, so that those who threaten to close key services such as the ones that we have been talking about can be directly held to account. We need to ensure also that the boards of the national parks that do so much good for our national environmental heritage, which are largely unaccountable to the communities that live within them, contain directly elected members.</p>

The ability of the rural communities of Britain to be economic microclimates, and in turn to be an engine room for economic recovery, is clear. We are determined to make our own luck. The strength of our rural economy centres on the creativity and resourcefulness of our communities. I look at ways in which communities have fought back in my area, such as the Witherslack community shop, the Storth community co-op post office and the Greyhound community-run pub at Grizebeck. Those are wonderful examples of communities providing social glue and economic impetus in defiance of economic hardship. All those things, I should add, have been done despite Government policy.</p>

 I am grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for calling me early in this debate. I have some regret, however, that that is as a consequence of the face that not a single Labour Back Bencher is rising to make a substantive contribution. That is symptomatic of this Government&#146;s attitude to rural communities and the effects of the recession on them. That may be the reason why, after the European elections in the south-west of England, Labour now has no representation among the six Members of the European Parliament, and why after the elections to Dorset county council there is now not a single Labour county councillor, despite the fact that Labour still holds one parliamentary seat in the county, South Dorset&#151;for the time being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90615-0010.htm_para19"><a name="09061523000002">Mr. Deputy Speaker, you and many other Members will be aware that I have a picturesque constituency that offers some of the best rural land in Britain. We have some of the best dairy farmers in the country, and each year the area offers visitors great hospitality. We have many small and medium-sized businesses that keep the economy afloat. Having a constituency of 350 square miles, with no large towns or cities, gives me the ability to speak about rural communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90615-0010.htm_para20"><a name="09061523000003">The statistics show that across the country an average of 10 per cent. of non-agricultural employees are in manufacturing, but in my constituency that figure is 17.5 per cent. according to the latest business inquiry. In fact, this morning I visited one manufacturing business there. It is an international company, and I suspect that during the day virtually all Members have sat on one of its products. It makes the springs that go in the seats of most cars manufactured in Europe, among a number of other spring-like products. The company is called William Hughes and it is in Stallbridge, a small town in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90615-0010.htm_para21"><a name="09061523000004">Later this week I will be visiting another business in my constituency, a big international business that is one of the FTSE 100 companies. It is Cobham plc, which will be exhibiting at the Paris air show. It makes the fuel systems and antennae that go on most aircraft produced in the world, whether by Airbus, Boeing or a number of other manufacturers. There are a multitude of other businesses in my constituency, including a leading paint maker, a company that makes probably the majority of trolleys and cabinets found in hospitals and health centres across the country, and many companies that are involved in food manufacturing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90615-0010.htm_para22"><a name="09061523000005">However, my constituency is not the industrial heartland of Britain, or one of the great metropolitan areas, as the Government see it. It is a local economy that is under unbearable strain. It is squeezed by the recession and unsupported by Government action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90615-0010.htm_para23"><a name="09061523000006">I want to discuss three main subjects: unemployment as it affects my constituency and the impact on it of the closure of jobcentres; the closure of post offices and its detrimental effect, along with the absence of broadband in many areas of my constituency, when people need access to services; and the closure of rural businesses, particularly rural pubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para0"><a name="09061523000007">I shall start with unemployment. In my constituency, the number of jobseeker&#146;s allowance claimants is up a staggering 187 per cent. in the past 12 months. Even from a low base, that is some increase. Men in North Dorset are the hardest hit, with an increase in unemployment of 211 per cent. in the past 12 months. In the first few months of this year, that figure is up some 60 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para1"><a name="09061523000008">There is also a worrying trend towards people claiming for longer. In April last year, only 25 people in my constituency had been claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance for between six and 12 months. The figure is now 120 and growing. Compared with many constituencies, it will appear small, but the rapid increase worries me. I am also worried about those who will go into the 12 months or longer category, without access to appropriate training for the skills that today&#146;s job market demands. We all know that those who reach that 12-month threshold without appropriate intervention risk staying economically inactive for much longer. There is a huge increase in men claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance and in people generally claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance for a long time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09061523000009">Another trend worries me, and that is that the number of young adults forced into unemployment has increased by 222 per cent. I make no apology for using statistics&#151;indeed, the Minister used them in his opening remarks.</p>

 I do not have those figures immediately to hand, but I will come back to the hon. Gentleman. The percentage is relatively low&#151;probably just over 2 per cent., but the trend and the effect of the increases on the community are worrying. All those people have lost their jobs, with little prospect of getting new ones in the short term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09061523000012">My constituency has a high proportion of retired people, but it is disheartening for those of working age, particularly those who are just starting out on their working lives, to struggle to find employment. To make matters worse, in the past 18 months, despite protests from me and others in the constituency, the Government have closed two of our three jobcentres. Those in Wimborne and Shaftesbury have been closed, leaving only one in the constituency, in Blandford. It is open only two days a week, by appointment. That means that those who are unemployed cannot just walk into a jobcentre but have to get on the telephone or use the internet to make initial contact. They are then sent not to the jobcentre in Blandford, but either to Yeovil, which is 20 miles away even from the closest point in my constituency, or to Poole, which is 25 miles away from those who live in the northern part of my constituency, for the initial interview. That is disheartening for anyone who loses a job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para4"><a name="09061523000013">It is unfair that my constituents do not get the opportunity to access vital Government services. In May 2007, I told the Government that the closure of the two jobcentres would hit my constituents hard when they needed a jobcentre the most. Having to travel long distances when there is little public transport puts an intolerable burden on an increasing number of people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09061523000014">An unfortunate consequence of the jobcentre closures is the withdrawal of essential assistance and advice. Local citizens advice bureaux have reported to me a ballooning number of people seeking their advice and assistance on matters that Jobcentre Plus should be tackling. It was disappointing that the Department for Work and Pensions turned down an offer from North Dorset citizens advice bureau to make its facilities available to Jobcentre Plus and host its employees free of charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para6"><a name="09061523000015">I want next to consider communications, post offices and the broadband connection. I know that the Minister knows a little about such things. The Government insisted&#151;perhaps it was the Minister himself who did so&#151;on eight post office closures in my constituency. That had a huge impact on the availability of services and on rural businesses, including vital village shops. There has been a drop in the footfall and therefore in the trade in those shops because of the closure of the post office counter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09061523000016">The Government have withdrawn important services&#151;simple things, such as the renewal of car tax, access to savings accounts and obtaining passport forms&#151;that residents in rural areas had much more difficulty in getting anyway. The Minister might say that the services are available online&#151;they are. However, many of my constituents are older and do not have access to or struggle to use the internet. In some parts of my constituency, broadband access is woefully slower than in towns and cities. In some areas, there is no broadband connection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09061523000017">Last month, South Tarrant Valley parish council contacted me with concerns about the inconsistency and deficiency of broadband coverage in the four villages for which it is responsible. According to the parish council, internet service providers have no plans to upgrade lines to the affected areas as there is insufficient commercial demand in less populated districts. The absence of high-speed broadband connections has far-reaching consequences for entrepreneurs and local businesses trying to operate in rural and semi-rural Dorset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09061523000018">Promises of universal broadband access were welcomed, but there are serious concerns. The Minister said earlier that from a European Union fund the entire United Kingdom would get &#163;12 million. That is a drop in the ocean given what is required to invest in necessary rural broadband services, which the Government claim they will deliver. Perhaps in his winding-up speech, the Minister will tell us what else the Government plan to do to ensure that all households have access to good internet connections. That affects not only access to Government services but businesses&#146; ability to carry on with their work from rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09061523000019">I have long campaigned for the post office to be more than the place where people send their mail or buy stamps. Post offices could be the hub for local people to access Government services&#151;a one-stop shop for local government and central Government, accessible to a huge proportion of the population. As well as providing layers of government in one place, it would increase the all-important footfall that the Government claim is too low to make rural post offices sustainable.</p>

In the past couple of weeks, I have received nearly 100 representations from constituents about the increased duty on alcohol and the impact on their local pubs. I am sure the House agrees that the village pub is an integral part of any rural community. Since 2005, the rural county of Dorset has lost some 36 pubs&#151;nine in my North Dorset constituency. That has inevitably had a detrimental effect on community spirit and rural life.</p>

The tax regime ought to work against those who consume excessive amounts of drinks with a high alcohol content on Friday and Saturday nights, not against the beer drinker. Binge drinking is obviously a problem in our cities and large towns, although Dorset police tell me that binge drinkers cause a nuisance in some towns in my constituency as well. However, the Government appear to be intent on penalising sensible drinkers, together with the less than sensible. I cannot stress enough how important local pubs are to rural and semi-rural life, not just economically but in terms of their effects on the community. The closure of our village pubs&#151;forced to close because people cannot afford to visit them as once they did&#151;is painful for local communities.

Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter), who articulated the problems of large rural constituencies extremely well. I have the same problem in my constituency, which, for the record, is approximately 1,200 square miles. It contains 47 villages and five towns, with quite a disparate community spread out between Thetford forest and the fenlands. Those who live in my constituency therefore feel that the Government&#146;s one-size-fits-all urban agenda of the past few years is just not for them. They feel that they are not listened to. However, also for the record, the results of the local elections in Norfolk last week spoke volumes about how people feel that the Conservative party in Norfolk represents and can articulate  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09061523000026">The number of JSA claimants in my constituency has increased by 92 per cent. in the Breckland area and by 82 per cent. in the King&#146;s Lynn and West Norfolk area. They are shocking figures. We have cited various figures this evening and asked the Government to look into what is happening. However, the truth is that the evidence shows not just that local people are disheartened, but that they are losing their jobs and cannot cope. The demand in rural areas for financial services such as debt advice far outstrips supply. For someone who has lost their job and cannot cope, that is a profound thing to deal with. In a large rural area, it is difficult for someone to access the services that they might get in an urban area. The Government need to consider that very carefully. I have had dealings with the Minister over the years, and he is a reasonable man, but does he accept that that combination is particularly worrying for people living in constituencies such as mine?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09061523000027">For many people in South-West Norfolk who have lost their jobs or whose jobs are under threat, the internet, which colleagues have already spoken about this evening, is a vital tool for accessing banking and financial services. However, in some rural areas broadband access is still well behind that in other parts of the country&#151;I stick my hand up and say that Norfolk is no exception. I ask the Government: what is being done to ensure that the countryside has adequate access to broadband? I am not sure that the assistance the Minister spoke about earlier is enough, either in how it is applied or how much money is being put in, to alleviate the problems in constituencies such as mine. I ask him to look at that carefully, and I would be very grateful if he came back to me about the issue in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09061523000028">It is vital that those living in rural areas should feel able to live and work in an area that is equal to other areas in terms of help and access to services. For too long, Norfolk has played second fiddle to other parts of the country. For too long, constituents of mine have felt like second-class citizens. That is a great shame. For too long, Norfolk, and in particular Thetford in my constituency, has been seen by many people in the House as a problem, rather than as the opportunity that it is and always will be, because of the people of Norfolk&#146;s dedication and their desire to get on, make a contribution and live in vibrant communities in the areas where they work. That desire has always been there and it always will be there, but the area needs a lot of help from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para21"><a name="09061523000031">We have also seen the closure of local jobcentres. How can closing the focal point for retraining and getting back into the work force help rural communities to survive? I am afraid that that speaks volumes about the Government&#146;s attitude towards constituents such as mine. We also have deprivation in Norfolk&#151;social, economic and geographical. We have vast amounts of fenland, which needs not only to be policed but to be looked after in terms of the Government&#146;s commitment. What advice would the Minister give to people in the 1,200 square miles that I represent? It is terribly important for me that I be able to return with a positive message, which I hope my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) can give me from the Opposition Front Bench, even if the Government cannot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09061523000032">I have received many letters from constituents who have lost their jobs and are desperate to retrain. However, they are prevented from taking up full-time courses for up to 18 months. They live in communities that do not have services, in areas that do not have adequate public transport systems. They want desperately to get out there and get a job, but every time they take one step forward, they take two steps back. That is killing our communities and killing a lot of people&#146;s will to get back into the work force, which we desperately need them to do if enterprise and initiative are again to be the backbone of our economic success. Does the Minister accept that many people in rural areas who have lost their jobs and who want to reskill are penalised twofold, owing to Government-imposed restrictions and the long distances to training centres, coupled with poor public transport?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="90615-0011.htm_para23"><a name="09061523000033">I want to talk briefly about small businesses, which are an enormously important source of employment in our communities. I have already mentioned Thetford, where small businesses have been hit particularly hard. We have a first-class manufacturing base and a need for apprenticeships. We also have a need for investment in Thetford. We have growth point status, so we are getting the houses, but we need the infrastructure that goes with them and&#151;dare I say it?&#151;the roads infrastructure. Let us not forget that Norfolk is the only county in England without a dual carriageway linking it to a national trunk road network. Although there have been good indications from various Ministers that such a scheme will be unlocked, Norfolk has for too long been unable to play its true part in the economic success of our nation. Every time we go forward, another barrier is put in the way to prevent us from making the contribution that most, if not all, of my constituents desperately want to make, for their own well-being and for that of the nation.</p>

The price of fuel in rural areas is disproportionate, because vehicle use in those areas is a necessity, not a luxury. People, such as pensioners, on fixed incomes and farmers are unable to cope. I regret to say that the Government have adopted a one-size-fits-all urban agenda, and it just does not work. In Norfolk, that agenda also applies to local government reorganisation. To suggest that what someone in the middle of Norwich needs is the same as what people in the fenlands need is a complete insult to the people in my constituency.  <br>

 I do not want to get diverted on to by-election issues, but I will say that it is no coincidence that the accounts of Norwich city council have not been written and agreed for many years, because of the way in which they have been put together. In my constituency, where we have two Conservative councils, we have proved, year in, year out that Conservative councils in Norfolk deliver for the people because they listen to the people and develop services for the people. It will be interesting to see how the people of Norwich take up that issue in the coming weeks leading up to the by-election.</p>

They are good third and fourth generation owner-managed companies that have invested in their business and spent every moment of every day trying to build up the well-being of their work force and produce products that are in many cases world-beating. They are run by dedicated people who are not profligate and who do not drive big cars or go on swanky holidays.</p>

The fact that they are also paying such large bonuses against the will of the Government and of the people is quite extraordinary. It saddens me to think that the Government are not confronting this issue and dealing with it head on. Small businesses and enterprises in constituencies such as mine are desperate for a hand up, not a handout. This is not a question of the state coming to the rescue.</p>

They take one step forward&#151;and then have to take two steps back. That will not get us out of the recession or help those people in the future. It is a very sad day when I have to say these things, but they are true. This saddens me and all my colleagues.

Minister expect the Government&#146;s decision to end transitional relief to have on firms in rural areas? That is a simple question. As I said earlier, I am very fond of the Minister, but I am not so sure that either he or the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the hon. Member for Wansdyke (Dan Norris) will be able to answer it. I do not believe that the Government have a coherent plan for the rural economy. I come back to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge) has just made about Norwich. It has been proved time and again that the Government do not need votes in rural areas to win elections. In my opinion, however, that should not influence the way in which they govern the country. I hope that the electorate will remind themselves of that point, come the general election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90615-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09061523000041">Many rural constituencies, including my own, have suffered jobcentre and post office closures. We have had a disproportionate amount of post office closures in my constituency, which is very sad. One or two of my constituents have taken it upon themselves to restart their post offices with the support of the community, but it has been extremely difficult. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset said, the post offices should become one-stop shops and the beacon of the local community, so that the local community can survive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90615-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09061523000042">My grandmother, who died just after Christmas at the age of 99, lived in my constituency. She would not have found it easy to go online to get her pension. That is an absolute, straightforward fact. She was a lovely woman, but she could not manage technology. So, when the local post office could not help her, what was she to do? That example from my own family is being echoed across the country, and it is a crying shame that, while post office closures are happening, the Government are sitting on their hands and saying, &#147;It will work. It can work.&#148; That is okay for people who are 18 to 21 or 25 to 30, but when people who are over 30 start wearing glasses and finding the digits difficult, these things are not so easy. People in that older age group just cannot manage, and retired people on fixed incomes are being disproportionately penalised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90615-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09061523000043">How does the Minister respond to my constituents who believe that, for the past decade, this Government have presided over the erosion of rural services, the true effects of which are now being felt as a result of the recession? The recession has hit them in the face. The Commission for Rural Communities has called on the Government to expand the financial services offered by the post office network, so that rural communities do not sink into financial exclusion, but I cannot see much action being taken by the Government to deal with that issue. The Conservative party has been calling for that action for some time. As I would say anyway: bring on the election, so that we can test the arguments with the electorate and allow a Conservative Government to come in and stand up for the rural economy as this Government have not done. I am sure that the Minister will agree that, at times like these, post offices are a vital resource for people living in rural areas.

for example. At least 50 per cent. of those living in my constituency have no access to the gas network and must therefore rely on heating oil, which is expensive. Every time I have spoken to a Minister, written to a Minister or put a question to a Minister across the Chamber to point out that those people have no alternative, I have been told, &#147;It&#146;s okay. We have a plan in place for people to have underground heating.&#148; The Government have all these new-fangled ideas for supplying something that people just cannot get. If there is no possibility of getting a mains gas service to a house in the first place, and if people live in a terraced house in the middle of nowhere with a postage-stamp back garden, for example, it will be impossible to lay half a mile of cabling to get them an alternative energy source.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the things that annoys people in rural areas is the cheaper rate offered by the utility companies for customers on a dual fuel tariff?

 I agree wholeheartedly with my hon. Friend. Many of my constituents ask why they cannot get those benefits. They simply cannot get them. It might well be that the infrastructure just does not exist across the country, but this goes back to my original point that there are two classes of citizen in this country: those in urban areas who have access to services, and those in rural areas who feel hard done by because they cannot get the services they desperately need.</p>

They are suffering from all the disruption, but not gaining access to the gas. For reasons that my hon.

 I am enormously grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes a valid point. On occasions, there is more gas in this place than we in Norfolk are able to secure! Households face a double blow: they face higher costs, while having no proper infrastructure for services. The local community is sometimes literally dying on its feet: young people cannot get jobs and business people cannot secure the loans they need, so people are moving away. It is a crying shame for a proud county such as Norfolk&#151;proud in what it does and proud in what it wants to do&#151;to be hampered in every which way it tries to move forward.

There are opportunists coming into the area from far and wide, who think that they can easily take something from a farmyard in a rural area because they will not be detected. They think that no one will catch up with them, but why? As a large, disparate county, we have a first-class police force that is centred mostly around urban centres and does not have the capacity to get into rural areas as quickly and effectively as it would wish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90615-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09061523000054">There have been many Government schemes to bring in what I would describe as alternative police officers. That is fine; I am very pleased that some towns in my constituency have benefited from such people doing their job. When it comes to crimes in rural areas, farms are already suffering because, for reasons I have already explained, they cannot manage within their budgets. When someone steals all their oil or takes a truck or other machinery, it has a disproportionately negative effect on what can be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90615-0012.htm_para7"><a name="09061523000055">This Government must understand and accept that policing requirements are quite different in rural areas from those in the centre of Norwich. On a Saturday night in the city centre, people duff each other up because they are drunk; the police can come to the rescue because they are only three or four minutes away. If someone calls a police officer to come to a farm in the middle of the fens on a Saturday night when there is an event going on in Norwich, it is awful to say it, but the police may not get there for some time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90615-0012.htm_para8"><a name="09061523000056">I see that the Minister has probably just been handed some information about rural crime in my constituency. Yes, relatively speaking, it is low; but if something has been stolen from people or their property has been violated, statistics matter not. What matters is effectiveness and how long it takes to get the problem dealt with. Time after time I hear stories about what happens. If it is not as bad in Norfolk as in other parts of the country, I am awfully sorry but that does not matter for a victim of crime. What matters is the attention people are given and how their problem is dealt with.

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90615-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09061530000003">You may be aware, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that the agricultural community in Cheshire and across the whole of the UK relies heavily on the dairy industry to remain healthy through very difficult times. The DFOB&#146;s Stapeley headquarters employs some 40 permanent staff, plus field-based staff outside the Stapeley offices. These staff have no representative body to speak of, and a number of them have contacted me personally to express their concerns about how long they are going to hold on to their jobs and how much information they are going to receive through the process. I hope that the Minister will take that into account when he goes back to the Secretary of State and explains the position of my constituents who are suffering as a result of the current recession.</p>

We hope that the position will be looked at further, but that is the current state of affairs and it is extremely worrying.</p>

 Because of the dairy in his constituency, my hon. Friend is well aware of the impact on its employees. At my last Beverley street surgery, I met a couple who, because of the recent devastating recession in the industry, are among the last remaining dairy farmers in the constituency. They are both at risk of losing a month&#146;s milk payment, while facing the additional risk of losing their investment in the company. This is an extremely frightening time, so it would be good to hear from the Minister what support the Government might be able to provide to dairy farmers to help them through it.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point. It is true that farmers who were part of a co-operative and invested in it lost their May payments for the supply of milk that they provided, and there is also concern about their future investment. Fortunately for many farmers in the Crewe and Nantwich area, they had managed to opt out of the co-operative before the state of affairs had worsened to the extent of receivership, but nevertheless many farmers who rely on a certain level of cash to keep themselves going now find themselves with a great black hole in their finances and very little support to see them through the crisis. Some of what we have heard from the Government today is welcome, but it is still a case of shifting sands. We need more concrete answers to give farmers who find themselves in such difficulty.</p>

As I have said, in Crewe and Nantwich many left when they saw that the writing was on the wall, and they did that in order to maintain a regular income from their milk. However, their investment in the co-operative has not been returned, and they are listed simply as unsecured creditors under the Insolvency Act 1986. I ask the Minister to look at the position as a matter of urgency. We understand that talks will resume on Wednesday in an attempt to find a solution. I believe that assistance may be available from organisations such as the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution, but it will be no substitute for the tens of thousands of pounds invested by farmers in DFOB. To many of them, that money represents their pension pots. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Christopher Fraser) raised the issue of pensioners earlier.</p>

Can he ask his Cabinet colleague in the Department for Work and Pensions to ensure that these hard-working people are assessed immediately for entitlements and retraining when that is required?</p>

Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) will know all too well, having kindly visited and spoken to dairy farmers in my constituency twice in the past 12 months, between 2001 and 2006, 48 dairy farms closed in the Crewe and Nantwich area. According to the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers, whose representatives I met last week, the number of dairy farmers in England and Wales fell from 28,000 in 1995 to 11,700 this year. That is a drastic fall. More recently, despite the uplift in milk prices in 2008, the average cost of production has reached 26.93p per litre, while the average price is 24.37p. Those figures speak for themselves. We can see how desperate the situation is for dairy farmers and the industry, and why the Government should act as soon as possible.</p>

I asked what three things a local farmer would say to Parliament if given the chance. The answer was, &#147;Give us a fair price, assist us with nitrate vulnerable zones by not gold-plating the legislation, and cull the badgers. I&#146;m surprised I haven&#146;t seen more suicides.&#148; DEFRA knows those issues, and knows them well. It is time for DEFRA to act.</p>

 I am grateful to have been called slightly earlier than I expected. It is a pleasure to participate in such an important debate.

That is not entirely their fault. Although there are far more Labour than Conservative Members, very few of them represent rural constituencies. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) is a regular Labour champion of rural affairs, but he is a pretty lonely voice. As for local government, following last week&#146;s election results there is not a single Labour-controlled rural shire authority. Indeed, many such authorities have no Labour representative. In a number of our constituencies, Labour representation has been all but blown away at local level: my constituency has only one Labour councillor. It is therefore not surprising that Labour representatives are not willing to put rural affairs at the top of their agenda.</p>

sector of the economy receives so little attention in this place. Part of the attention that it does receive, along with the focus of Government efforts to help the rural economy, is strongly driven by a perception that rural areas serve as the playground of the nation. However, although tourism is an increasingly important diversification for those who have engaged in more traditional primary activities in rural areas, it is not the be-all and end-all. It is not the only activity that Government should seek to encourage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="90615-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09061530000016">Many areas of active industry in the rural economy are now perceived by Government as there to provide entertainment for the masses. Forestry is an example. The second largest landowner&#151;after Her Majesty the Queen&#151;is the Forestry Commission, which under the current Government has been transformed from a primary producer of timber products whose purpose was to provide construction materials and other building products for the nation to, essentially, a playground. There has been an appalling failure to accept that responsibility for the nation&#146;s forests lies with the Government. The forests owned by the Government are seen as being there purely to divert the people. That is all very well in one sense: we should be encouraging access to our forests. However, if we do so at the expense of the industry itself, in a few decades&#146; time we will no longer have forests. Instead, we will have scrubland areas which will not be attractive places to visit, and which will not provide the biodiversity that is at the heart of the Government&#146;s argument for allowing forestry to regenerate naturally rather than being planted.</p>

 I think that the hon. Gentleman would generously acknowledge that in the Government&#146;s forestry policies the national forest is an exception. That project was started in the early &#146;90s under a Conservative Government, and it has been tremendously successful. It covers 200 square miles and straddles three counties and two regions, and it has been very helpful to economic development, environmental restoration and sustaining the communities that lie within it, many of which are rural. The Government have supported that project over a 12-year period, as the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party supported it at its inception.</p>

As other Members who represent constituencies with small towns and villages have said, many such settlements are at present experiencing the loss of some of their last public, and indeed private, services. Members have mentioned that jobcentres, pubs and shops are closing throughout the country as a direct result of the recession, but they are not closing only as a result of the recession; they are closing partly as a result of Government policy.</p>

and corner shops which, in many villages in my constituency and elsewhere, are the only retail outlets left. Such shops rely for their footfall on the many people who go there to buy tobacco. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents predicts that some 2,500 such shops will close. If that is the case, their closure will be a direct consequence not of the recession but of a Government measure. It is intended to achieve a desirable public health aim, but it will have the unintended consequence of depriving communities of their main source of purchasing other goods, as such shops are often also the convenience store where people can buy their food.</p>

Over the past year, I have been besieged&#151;that is not too strong a word&#151;by operators of small bed-and-breakfasts. Many former farmers or people whose houses have spare rooms choose to diversify their income by opening their home to visitors who love the beautiful scenery of south Shropshire. Bed-and-breakfasts are now subject to the same fire regulation inspection regime that applies to much larger commercial institutions such as hotels, yet the proprietors of bed-and-breakfasts typically do not have the available capital to meet the standards that might be imposed on them by fire officers. If they cannot meet the standard imposed on them, they have no option but to close. No appeal mechanism is available to these people, who might have been operating a bed-and-breakfast for 10 or 20 years. They cannot explain that, for instance, there have been no fires and that there is limited fire risk, yet regulation imposed by central Government tells them that such steps are necessary.</p>

Again, this affects people who have been encouraged to diversify their activities, such as farmers who have developed workshops out of redundant barns, or, especially in my area, people who have developed their garage premises into light industrial premises but find that there are not any light industrial users. There are now increasing numbers of empty premises. It is almost impossible to secure the granting of a change of use from the planning authorities despite the current housing crisis. As a result of the reduction in rate relief, owners must suffer significant tax on empty properties, and it would not surprise me if a number of them were to decide to make their premises uninhabitable in order to avoid the tax. That is, I think, an unintended consequence; I am sure the Government do not want properties that could be put to economic use to be pulled down, but that will, I fear, be the direct result of a Government measure.</p>

 First, may I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment to his new job? We have over the years come across each other from time to time in this House, and normally our encounters have been good-humoured, and I hope that continues. His predecessor the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy) has just left the Chamber, but I want to thank her as well. She managed finally to solve one of the most complex problems arising from the single farm payment. Almost the last thing that she did was sign off that problem, and as a result a farmer in my constituency has been promised the money under the single farm payment. I suspect that the right hon.

The processing plant in Blaydon has closed, leaving a considerable problem for the few remaining dairy farmers in the north-east of England. Most of them have now found contracts, but there is a long-term problem: because the processing plants for milk are now so distant from the north-east, longer to transport distances milk will lead to higher costs, which will increasingly affect the viability of the few remaining dairy farmers in that region.</p>

I appreciate that we will have a debate on agriculture on Thursday, but the recession has touched this industry as much as any other, and, of course, a recession in the dairy industry also affects the amount of beef that is available for consumption. That will mean that our degree of self-sufficiency in beef will decline even further than it already has&#151;from more than 100 per cent. in 1997 to only 80 per cent. currently. We have to import the rest, often from countries whose welfare standards are far less reliable than those of the United Kingdom.</p>

It is very difficult to pin down exactly what a rural community is. A rural community in my Northumberland constituency is very different from one in Suffolk or Surrey, or one in Sussex, where my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency is. Each has its own set of problems, and each requires individual attention and local determination in order to solve them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90615-0013.htm_para10"><a name="09061530000030">The housing issue provides an example of that. In rural Surrey, huge housing demand is what causes real problems, but in parts of Northumberland, particularly those rural areas which were formerly coalfield areas, local people want more properties to be built, because that makes their communities more sustainable. Such communities have declined because the coal industry left the area, and new houses and people, often coming from the towns, bring life back to them. We therefore want more properties in those areas, yet we live under the dread hand of the regional spatial strategy, which imposes things from above. For instance, in the part of Northumberland that I represent, we can build only 157 new houses over the next five years, which is ridiculous. According to the spatial strategy, we should all move into the city of Newcastle, and not live in the rural  <br>

 May I start by properly welcoming both new Ministers to the Department? The hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick) has a hard act to follow. The right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy) was in the Chamber a few minutes ago but, sadly, she has left her place. I wanted to commend her because despite the fact that, like the new Minister, she came into the Department with a self-confessed complete lack of knowledge of the issues she was facing, she applied herself willingly to a steep learning curve and in a short space of time persuaded the farming industry and the rest of the rural community that she was very much aware of their issues and very much on their side. Nevertheless, I wish the new Ministers well in their posts.</p>

Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert), the Minister made a great deal of the rural development programme for England. I must say, as an aside, that his words rang truer when he moved off his script and said what he really felt, rather than what he had been told to say. When he has had a chance to travel the length and breadth of England&#151;it is not his fault that he has not yet had the chance to do so&#151;to talk to farmers and to rural communities, he will not find much support for the way in which the regional development agencies have operated in the rural sphere. They have contributed far more sums of more than &#163;1 million than smaller sums of &#163;100,000 or less, which would be much more relevant to small businesses wishing to improve their productivity, to diversify and so on.</p>

At last week&#146;s cereals event&#151;I went the day after the Minister&#151;I went to the RDA stand, where an official told me, with some apology, about a farmer who had just been in wanting to see whether he could apply for a grant of about &#163;40,000 for a meat-cutting plant, only to be told that he was not eligible. That had nothing to do with the rights and wrongs of the scheme. I have no idea whether it was a good or bad scheme, but he was told that there was no scheme that suited his needs&#151;that is laughable, because that is precisely what the rural development programme for England was designed to produce. I hope that when the Minister has had the opportunity that I mentioned, he will look again how that programme is working.</p>

I intervened on him on the issue of poverty, which is a huge issue in rural areas, not least because it is less obvious there than in big urban areas, where often whole blocks of flats or areas of communities all live in poverty. In rural areas, because of the lower population density, one often finds only one or two people living in poverty and they may live next door to someone who is clearly quite affluent, so this is a much more hidden form of poverty, but it is there.

who winds up will address poverty issues and the spending plans of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. I was astonished to find that last year DEFRA actually cut spending on &#147;strong rural communities&#148; by 35 per cent. The Government have also failed to mention the real-terms cut in DEFRA&#146;s budget. It has been cut by &#163;200 million since last autumn&#146;s pre-Budget report, yet they have the nerve to criticise our proposals in their amendment to our motion.</p>

Of course I welcome the measures being taken by the receivers and by other milk buyers, and I am pleased that DEFRA officials have been involved in negotiations to try to find other buyers. However, it is very important that the banks, and indeed the merchant trade, take a generous approach to those farmers who have lost a month&#146;s milk cheque. Very few businesses in any sector of life could withstand losing one twelfth of their income unexpectedly, just like that, with no time to plan. If the Government had introduced the national loan guarantee scheme proposed by my Conservative colleagues, there would be some opportunity to assist. I am anxious to ensure that some of the smaller and more remote producers find outlets for their milk, because they are the ones who will find it hardest to survive.</p>

I was pleased that in the same week, Milk Link, another co-operative, reported increased profits&#151;that is good news. What happened at DFOB was about business management and control, rather than simply about the fact that it was a co-operative, although I have no doubt that there will be those who will try to paint this as an inevitable problem that one gets with co-operatives.</p>

In passing, I should point out that the hon.

They have spoken of its huge breadth, covering not only farming and the food industry, but manufacturing&#151;traditional craft manufacturing right through to high-tech manufacturing&#151;a lot of research, small businesses, telecommunications and so on.</p>

It would be completely wrong to suggest that losing one&#146;s job is not a crisis for any individual, but, as he said, whereas it is bad news when half a dozen jobs go when a business closes in a large urban area, when a business loses the same amount of jobs in rural area that can be a complete  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90615-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09061530000040">My hon. Friend also raised issues relating to the village pub&#151;and not only alcohol duty, on which we have our own proposals. Like my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Christopher Fraser) and others, he rightly referred to other issues relating to business rates. I know that a debate is taking place later on that matter, but I wish to mention something that, unusually, has been raised in my constituency. As a result of the recent rate revaluation, the business rates of someone from a village pub had rocketed up by &#163;4,000&#151;that is a lot of money for a small village pub. He could not understand the situation until we looked into it. He had been on a transitional process since the previous revaluation. The trouble is that the Government had designed a transitional process that had not got him to where he should have been at the previous revaluation, so he lost that relief and had to go to the new revaluation, which meant a substantial percentage increase in his rates.</p>

He motioned rural crime, but he did not mention&#151;so I shall do so now&#151;that violent crime has increased by some 20 per cent. in rural areas since the recession set in. A number of hon. Members have referred to housing, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs did in his opening remarks. Even Labour Members have said, in interventions, that a figure of only 10,000 planned homes in rural areas is wholly inadequate. I stress the need to address what has gone wrong. It is not, despite what the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale suggested, all the fault of the Conservative Governments who sold all the council houses. The problem was that the money raised stopped being recycled. Part of the big advantage of selling council houses was that that money would be recycled to build new social housing in those areas. It was the present Government who stopped that and confiscated the money to give to other local authorities.</p>

Government have poured into bus services, but let me quote from the Commission for Integrated Transport&#151;the Government&#146;s own body. It says:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090615/debtext/90615-0014.htm"/>


<a name="90615-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="09061530000052"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Rural bus provision has declined steadily over the past twenty years as bus operators focus on more lucrative urban markets. Combined with this has been a move away from local service provision&#151;the closure of post offices, shops and garages in particular&#151;resulting in poor access to many facilities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="90615-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09061530000049">That underlines the Government&#146;s failure to understand the importance of access to services. It is often very difficult for people in a rural community to gain access to services. The bus service is at best sporadic, and is completely absent in many areas. When schools, post offices, pubs, village shops, police stations and dispensaries in GPs&#146; surgeries close&#151;as many have in recent years&#151;it not only disfranchises the community, but makes it much harder to recover from any pressures put on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90615-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09061530000050">My hon. Friends the Members for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) and for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) also made pertinent points, especially on the issue of empty properties rate relief, which has hit a huge number of rural businesses and farms that have invested in property&#151;as the Government and all politicians encouraged them to do to benefit the local economy&#151;and have, with difficulty, persuaded the planners to agree, only to find that they cannot let those properties because of the recession and are stuck having to pay rates on them. I am sure that the Government did not intend the measure to hit such businesses, but that is the law of unintended consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90615-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09061530000051">There is no list of figures or litany of all the things that the Government have done that will persuade people who live in rural communities that all is well there. People who live in those areas and understand the realities cannot be convinced by listening to a Minister trotting them out. I would have hoped that the Minister would not have followed the practice of the Prime Minister, who seems to respond to any challenge by trotting out another litany of statistics, but the fact is that the Conservatives&#151;as displayed in the debate and in our motion&#151;know that there are real examples of difficulty. We have real knowledge of the problems of rural areas. I am proud to have been born and brought up in&#151;and now to represent&#151;a rural area. That is my history and I am passionately proud of it. We have not had a single speech from a Government Back Bencher in support of their amendment, and there can be no better testament to the veracity of our motion, which I commend to the House.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention. It is up to hon.

That is a serious problem, and the Government are greatly concerned about it, especially its impact in the north-east&#151;the area that the hon. Gentleman represents. I do not think I can add much more to what my hon. Friend the Minister of State has said, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured that the Government are taking this seriously. I will be involved in a series of meetings in the coming days and weeks to look specifically at the issues that have been raised. It is difficult to provide any further information at this point, because the situation is very fluid. It is hard to comment now other than to say that it is a tough challenge, but the Government will rise to it and find a way forward. I agree with those hon. Members who say that the problem has arisen is not because the organisation is a co-operative, but because of other factors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90615-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09061534000007">The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) raised concerns about milk prices, which my colleagues and I share. The hon. Gentleman might be interested to know what my officials have been able to tell me so far. The Competition Commission is now consulting publicly on draft undertakings to establish an ombudsman to arbitrate in disputes between retailers and suppliers, and to investigate complaints under the new grocery supply code of practice. The deadline for those responses was 28 May. If retailers do not sign up to the undertakings, the Competition Commission will recommend to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills that it take steps to establish the ombudsman instead. In that eventuality, DEFRA will be one of a number of Departments invited to comment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be pleased to hear that. Obviously, the Government would like any assessment to be based primarily on what would be in consumers&#146; best interests&#151;we must never forget that they are the important individuals in this matter&#151;but we cannot comment until the issues have formally come back to Government. I cannot risk prejudicing the consultation, but I thank the hon. Gentleman for his contribution.</p>

Although I appreciate that it is sometimes difficult for older people, in particular&#151;I was moved to hear about his grandmother&#146;s situation&#151;the truth is that telephones are often very helpful in rural communities in making first contact and in responding to the difficulties that are raised.

Obviously, I share those concerns, but although the NHS is a national system its services are delivered locally. Each primary care trust has to work out carefully what is needed to meet local need. I hope that she will make a point of coming to see me, too, to discuss her local concerns. I invite all right hon. and hon. Members to do the same if they have concerns about NHS delivery in their constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="90615-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09061534000011">I want to move on, if I may, to talk about some of the general points that were raised in today&#146;s debate. I think my hon. Friend the Minister of State was right, in his opening remarks, to point out the difficulties with average statistics. They sometimes hide significant needs. I know that from my constituency. Wansdyke had the lowest unemployment level in the UK about five years ago, yet I know that behind that prosperous headline lie real deprivation and poverty, albeit in small pockets. That is a genuinely despicable situation that one would not knowingly want or choose. I hope that people understand&#151;as I hope I do, given that I represent a semi-rural seat&#151;that poverty, wherever it exists, is clearly a bad and difficult thing but, in some ways, rural poverty brings additional burdens because of the isolation that people also experience. Help and assistance are not always easily available as people do not have the support of neighbours or friends that they might get in an urban area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="90615-0014.htm_para11"><a name="09061534000012">The important thing to stress is that wherever people live&#151;in rural or urban communities&#151;the problems that they face are pretty similar, despite the unique circumstances that arise in some rural communities. Most people want improved education, a better health service, affordable homes to buy and rent and a range of other important things, not least low crime figures. Although rural areas have many challenges, I do not accept that they are notably different from the rest of our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="90615-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09061534000013">I want to touch on some of the key points that came up in today&#146;s debate. The first is broadband. The Government are acutely aware of the vital importance of good communications for individuals and small businesses in rural areas. After all, a greater proportion of home workers can be found in rural areas than anywhere else. That is why in the Budget we committed ourselves to a universal broadband standard of 2 MB a second, wherever reasonably possible and wherever anyone lives, by 2012. More details will be given in the &#147;Digital  <br>

Britain&#148; report, which is due out soon. I know that right hon. and hon. Members will be keen to know about that in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="90615-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09061534000014">The Government are also mindful of new emerging technologies. We have jointly commissioned research to help to ensure that any benefits that might be forthcoming from new technology can be shared across all communities in the years ahead. That is vital. It is terribly important to the Government that the dynamism in rural communities is not lost as regards national wealth creation. It is vital that communications should be as good there as anywhere else. I hope that hon. Members will raise any questions about that with me in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90615-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09061534000015">Secondly, the Government recognise the great importance of the post office network while also recognising the need for taxpayers to spend their money wisely and efficiently, particularly as we face the consequences of the worldwide economic downturn. That is why we are providing a subsidy to the post office network of &#163;1.7 billion. I will say that again, as it is such a large sum: we are providing &#163;1,700 million to secure the future of the post office network, with &#163;150 million a year targeted at the 7,500 loss-making post offices, the vast majority of which are in rural communities. Of course, that action is in stark contrast to the proposals of the two main Opposition parties. The Conservative party would not subsidise loss-making post offices at all, but would allow them to go to the wall as it did when that party was previously in government, when some 8,000 post offices went to the wall. The Lib Dems take the line that they would not let any loss-making post offices close and would write a blank cheque. The sensible thing to do, I think, is to take the middle way and to recognise the importance of the taxpayer while also recognising the importance of rural post offices in their communities&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

Access is an important issue with Jobcentre Plus, but that will mean that more than 50 per cent. of people living in rural communities will live within 5 miles of their Jobcentre Plus centre.

<a name="90615-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="09061539000121"><ul><p class="tabletext">That this House expresses concern over the above-inflation rises in business rates since April 2009 and plans for the 2010 business rates revaluation; notes that all rate-paying businesses have already been hit by five per cent. above inflation rises and that the withdrawal of transitional relief has disproportionately hurt small businesses already struggling to cope with the recession; further notes that regulations relating to the business rate partial deferral scheme are yet to be placed before the House; observes that the additional burden of empty property rates further undermines struggling businesses; expresses disappointment at the failure in the Budget to help businesses and local authorities by making small business rate relief automatic as in Wales; believes that councils should have the power to levy local business revenue rate discounts and be rewarded for local regeneration and business rate growth; and further notes that the retrospective business rates being imposed on firms in ports, many involved in the car industry, will hit firms with a &#163;124 million increase in taxes, risking insolvency and job losses.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90615-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09061539000004">Today&#146;s debate is of real importance to businesses across Britain, because the problem relating to business rates and business rate rises is so acute. This country has been in recession since last year, and the impact on businesses and employment has been dramatic. In fact, the most recent figures from the Federation of Small Businesses show that, every day 120 small businesses close down . Above all, in the credit crunch even firms with perfectly good business models are going bust, not because they are loss-making but just because they cannot get the liquidity that is needed. We recognise the problems with cash flow, which is why we have been pressing Ministers to go for our bigger and bolder national loan guarantee scheme to help provide certainty for businesses that are lending credit to one another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90615-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09061539000005">Members would have thought that Ministers in the Department for Communities and Local Government who look after business rates would have taken particular care in their decisions that affect businesses, but they would have been wrong. In the past few months, when it comes to business rates, struggling businesses across Britain have seen Ministers press ahead with decision after decision that can only make their liquidity situation worse. First, at the end of last year, Ministers confirmed that all companies paying business rates would see a 5 per cent. inflation-busting rise. By the time it was due to hit businesses and our economy, economists were discussing whether deflation was a concern, and the Bank of England was embarking on its quantitative easing. However, Ministers refused to reconsider their decision. In fact, they even refused to prepare an impact statement that considered how such massive, inflation-busting rises would hurt businesses, employment and the economy.</p>

 Will the hon. Lady please tell the House how Ministers could have changed the formula, which her party introduced when in government, given that, on revaluation, it requires the yield to be maintained, with no discretion for the Government to take a different decision?</p>

 I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention. Much as I respect him, I think that people in businesses listening to that will find it a classic &#147;computer says no&#148; attitude to getting through this recession. We have heard about the do-nothing party; I think we have suddenly found which is the do-nothing party in this Chamber tonight.</p>

 I will make a little more progress, but I will give way shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90615-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09061539000010">Ministers are refusing to reconsider their decision, as we have heard. In fact, they soldiered on for months with their heads in the sand. That was bad enough for businesses that were trying to cope with the recession, but Ministers did not stop there: next down the track came the withdrawal of transitional relief. From what data there are, it is clear that some businesses were hit far more severely than people expected by the withdrawal of transitional relief, which had cushioned the impact of the 2005 rates revaluation for many businesses, but Ministers should have known about the impact that that would have. At a time when so many businesses were on their knees, Ministers again kicked away what could have been a final, extra year of transitional relief, and the impact has been huge. The FSB surveyed members in London and found that of those paying business rates nearly two thirds faced rises of 6 per cent. or more, and nearly one in 10 faced a rise of over 20 per cent. That masks the fact that a minority in that group faces much bigger rises. I shall come to that shortly.</p>

<p><a name="st_o263"><a name="09061539000011"><a name="90615-0015.htm_spnew6"><a name="09061539000138"><b>Mr. Clive Betts (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab):</b>
 Can the hon. Lady explain her party&#146;s policy on transitional relief? By definition, at some point that comes to an end. Is she saying that it should always last for five years, instead of four? Does she accept that, given the ability to defer part of the rate increase, 60 per cent. of the transitional relief, which ends in the fifth year, can be deferred to the next two years?</p>

<p><a name="st_o264"><a name="09061539000012"><a name="90615-0015.htm_spnew7"><a name="09061539000139"><b>Justine Greening:</b>
 It is interesting that the last time the revaluation took place, in 2000, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party chose to adopt a five-year transitional relief. The option to do that again was dismissed by his Government. I have asked the Government what they plan to do in the 2010 revaluation, and we still have no response from them. Part of the problem is bad information. I am happy to send to him parliamentary question after parliamentary question in which I have asked how many companies were affected by transitional relief, but received no answer.</p>

 I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman is talking to me as though I am already the Minister looking after this brief. We should look at those aspects to see what we can do to help business. He seems already to have gone into Opposition MP mode.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90615-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09061539000016">There is no doubt that for smaller, more marginal companies business rates are one of the largest parts of their cost base, and they are levied whether or not those companies are making profits. We know that more than other businesses small businesses are prone to be hit proportionally hardest by Government decisions on business rates. One would have thought that that mattered to Ministers, but it did not. Given that they were deciding to put through massive business rate hikes in the teeth of a recession, one would have thought that Ministers might take the time to understand the impact of business rates on more marginal businesses, but they did not. They made no effort to understand how their decision to raise business rates would hurt communities, hurt businesses and cost jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90615-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09061539000017">On the withdrawal of transitional relief, Ministers have known of the pressure of rates on many thousands of businesses since 2004. As I said earlier, in their own consultation paper they even identified the problem. The paper states that at the time, Ministers said that they had been warned that:</p>
<a name="90615-0015.htm_brev2"><a name="09061539000122"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There are some groups representing rate payers who expect significant rises in their rate bills and who are pressing for a five-year scheme&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90615-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09061539000018">Ministers ignored those concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90615-0015.htm_para11"><a name="09061539000019">Businesses are therefore concerned about business rates rising at the end of transitional relief. Those concerns were raised even before the recession, but even when the situation has got worse and we are in a recession, it does not seem to occur to Ministers to reassess their approach. Who is penalised for the Government&#146;s incompetence? Small businesses, which are worst hit because of their size. That often means that they are far more vulnerable to a recession and, as I said, to Ministers raising business rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90615-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09061539000020">Many of those small businesses are local shops, and often parades of shops, which provide employment and support communities. They include the newsagent, the laundrette and the corner shop. They are all fighting to stay in business and they are put under more pressure by Government decisions to hike up business rates. Surely the harshest aspect of the withdrawal of transitional relief was its impact on businesses that had played their role in regenerating their communities. They were doing exactly what the Government asked of them. They took risks and set up their businesses in areas that desperately needed better facilities and shops.</p>

 I am sure my hon. Friend agrees that small business and enterprise was the backbone of our economic success as a nation in the 1980s and 1990s, and will continue to be so in this new century. The fact remains that businesses, not Government, create jobs. It is the job of a Government to create the environment in which business can thrive. This Government have singularly failed to recognise the needs of businesses in the economy when the chips are down.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. The backbone of our economy has been our small businesses. We have been described as a nation of shopkeepers. There is a reason for that: our economy has been based on, and has thrived on, small businesses. Many of those businesses provide vital services to the community. A little anecdote, which Members may laugh at, says it all. I was at a meeting with some of my elderly constituents. One lady mentioned that a laundrette had shut down. She lived on the 14th floor of a tower block and did not have room for a washer in her flat. She would now have to take two buses to get to the laundrette.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90615-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09061539000027">Those are vital facilities for people. When I spoke to the owner of my laundrette on Danebury avenue in Roehampton, he told me his business rates would be more than his takings every month.

Their rateable value has gone up so they have lost their reliefs, especially in London, as we have heard from the Federation of Small Businesses. What has then happened to them?

Shops on the Old York road in central Wandsworth have had massive hikes. The newsagent Masumin&#146;s business rates last year were &#163;260 a month. This year they have shot up to &#163;1,006 a month. The motorcycle business just down the road saw bills rise from &#163;280 a month to &#163;914 a month. The florist&#146;s business rate bills went up from &#163;477 a month to &#163;715 a month. The Northcote road, another well-known Wandsworth community built around its shopping areas, is full of independent stores such as the Bolingbroke bookshop. Its rates have gone up from &#163;570 a month to &#163;875 a month.</p>

It took a chorus of voices, from the Opposition, the Federation of Small Businesses and local authorities, to puncture Ministers&#146; obliviousness to what was going on.</p>

Currently, they have to fill in a form to claim it, but only about half of eligible businesses do so and local authorities have to put resources into processing their request and doing outreach work to business communities to improve the take-up of the relief. We supported that Bill, along with the Federation of Small Businesses and many local authorities, which knew that they would save administration costs and be able to put them into helping businesses to develop. When it came to the debate, however, the Government opposed the Bill.</p>

 I could not agree more. We all hoped that the Budget would contain some genuine measures to help businesses immediately, and the fact that it did not, in spite of the assurances that the Minister provided on the day, was very disappointing&#151;more so for businesses than for MPs.</p>

Until the scheme is operational, businesses have to pay the full rise, and those that have already forfeited the right to pay in instalments cannot take part in the scheme at all. Businesses that have already struggled most with paying the higher rates and need most help to improve cash flow will have no access to the scheme. The logic is completely flawed.

parliamentary questions that their regulations will not even be in place until the end of July. So, how long after that will it take local authorities to issue business rate bills with deferred rises? The local authority representatives to whom I have spoken tell me that it is unlikely that they will be able to go through that process in anything less than five to six weeks, and that is the most optimistic timetable. They need time to write to businesses; businesses need time to decide what to do, to get financial advice, to fill in the relevant form and send it back to the local authority; and local authority and billing agencies need time to change the details on their billing system and then to reissue their bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90615-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09061539000047">By the time all that has taken place, we will almost certainly have passed the August payment date, so businesses will have already paid 50 per cent. of the rise and there will be no 60 per cent. left to defer. All that work, which we expect local authorities to do at the last minute, will take place in August, when most people are on annual leave. Again, the Minister might like to confirm our presumption that, as businesses gradually get around to claiming their deferrals, local authorities will end up with different businesses deferring different proportions, which will in turn lead to real complexity in billing, because the situation will depend on how quickly the business fills in the form and has it processed. Some will be able to claim 50 per cent. deferral, some 40 per cent., some 30 per cent. and so on. Ministers have met local authority representatives, so they must know that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90615-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09061539000048">Will Ministers therefore today finally say that they will bring forward their business rate deferral scheme regulations faster, so that they can really deliver on their 60 per cent. deferral promise? Will they promise all businesses that they will be able to defer 60 per cent. of their business rate rise? Even now, more than two months after the scheme was announced, we have very few details of how Ministers expect their scheme to work.</p>

On 1 June, in a parliamentary question, I asked what I thought was a pretty straightforward question of the then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. I asked what estimate her Department had made of the cost to central Government and to local authorities in implementing the business rate deferral scheme, but I did not get a straightforward answer. I got a load of gobbledegook, telling me that I would have to wait until the impact statement had been prepared and the regulations laid, and that I would then get to see the impact statement.

Surely, that money would be better spent on supporting businesses directly. Instead, it will be spent on dealing with another Government cock-up that undermines businesses throughout Britain.

The 2010 revaluation will be based on rateable values in April 2008&#151;the very time when values were at their peak. Given the bust that we are now in, do Ministers really think that taking rateable values from the peak of the boom will lead to a sensible, fair conclusion on business rates? Do they still plan to go ahead with the revaluation? It is costing the Valuation Office Agency alone &#163;51 million. Ministers may not have done an impact assessment for ending transitional relief, but have they made any assessment of where the worst 2010 revaluation rises will hit businesses and by how much?

The fact that the revaluation was carried out during an economic boom will not lead to more money being collected in rates.</p>

He should go and talk to some of the businesses across London that face huge rises. Ministers have to be careful.

that the revaluation is not intended to raise business rates, but if it is badly implemented, with no understanding of how it will work in practice, the danger is that it could do just that. It could put companies out of business, and then they will not pay business rates at all.

According to the information provided to businesses, they will be sent draft rateable values in October.

All the evidence from transitional relief is that no work will be done to understand the impact on businesses. Ministers will simply say, &#147;Here&#146;s your new rateable value&#151;do you like it or not?&#148; Lo and behold, companies seeing a benefit from the revaluation will say that it is fine and the many companies with an increase will have real concerns.

The inflation-busting rises, the early withdrawal of transitional relief, the pressing ahead with a 2010 revaluation that will raise bills further for many businesses and the carrying on with a retrospective port tax that puts more pressure on the car industry and our ports businesses are all happening because Ministers have been asleep on the job, oblivious to how their business rate hike would kill businesses.</p>

 As I said, I am more than happy to take away requests that have been made for that information, because it is important that we are able to show the help that has been available. Perhaps Conservative Members would like to make a guesstimate of how many businesses would have been helped by opposing all the measures that we tried to take.

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90615-0017.htm_para0"><a name="09061539000079">I think that the current business rates system is a fair way of ensuring that the burden of tax is fairly distributed across all businesses. As several of my right hon. and hon. Friends have said, before 1990, rates were set and collected locally. The problem that was seen with that approach was that many businesses felt that they had little or no certainty over their business rate bills: they complained that they might be paying different rates in different areas, and that they might be told of their liability only a few days before the start of the financial year. The system that came into effect in 1990, which was enshrined in legislation introduced in 1988 by the previous Administration, changed the way that business rates were collected, bringing greater certainty, not least because businesses know that between revaluations the multiplier will not change by more than inflation. Many of the issues that we are debating are an integral part of that system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90615-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09061539000080">In 1990, we saw the first business rates revaluation of property since 1973. Before that time, values had become hopelessly out of date; that is why the new system requires revaluations every five years. The point of that, for a business, is that rateable values and therefore rates bills are based on up-to-date information, so the yield from the rates is spread fairly across different ratepayers.</p>

 Does the Minister think that it might be worth considering the inflation measures that the Government use? They have a whole series of measures of inflation, and in this case we had spot inflation in September, which is what has caused the difficulty.</p>

 As the hon. Lady will know, there are different methods of calculating what the increases will be in pensions and other areas. As she knows, under existing legislation business rates are adjusted every April in line with the retail prices index for the previous September, but I should point out that in the Budget the Chancellor forecast that RPI inflation would fall to minus 3 per cent. by September 2009. The impact of uprating if RPI is negative will obviously be to reduce total business rates in cash terms in 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90615-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09061539000093">We must understand all the implications of linking to RPI. However, that is the point at which we can consider action that Government could take&#151;as we did&#151;in recognition of the spike in inflation that occurred in September. That is exactly why we introduced the deferral scheme, which will allow business rate payers in England to defer around &#163;600 million for 1.6 million properties and around 3 per cent. of the 5 per cent. increase in 2010-11 and 2011-12.</p>

As I said earlier, regular revaluations are an important part of the ratings system because they maintain fairness between all taxpayers. Rental values provide the basis of rateable value, so revaluation ensures that each business contributes, based on up-to-date information. The current rating list dates from 1 April 2005, based on the property market at 1 April 2003. The next revaluation will take place from April 2010, based on rental values at 1 April 2008. However, although the property market has changed since 1 April 2008, the important protection for business is that the revaluation is not intended to raise extra revenue because the overall national multiplier is set to ensure that the average business rate stays the same, allowing change only for inflation. I think that the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson), whose attention I am trying to get&#151;he is ignoring me; okay, fine&#151;asked about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90615-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09061539000095">Some rate bills rise and some fall after revaluation, but the average national bill changes only with the rate of inflation. That is how the revaluation would work.</p>

 It is kind of the Minister to allow me to intervene. Does she understand that the Valuation Office Agency legislation in 1998 led to desktop revaluations? The hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) made a good point. One of the major problems underlying retrospective revaluation for ports is that it is a desktop revaluation and, although all the ports have been encouraged to appeal, it will cause untold damage to business because that revaluation process is theoretical. When revaluation took place in Wales&#151;a pilot that was not followed through&#151;it was not budget neutral and more revaluation led to more people having their tax increased than those benefiting from a reduction.</p>

 No, not at all. Has she had an opportunity to assess the impact of the empty properties rate on businesses? Several companies in Sunderland face ruin as a result of it. I know that the Government have introduced a concession for properties with rateable values of less than &#163;15,000. However, for example, two business men came to my office last week who employ 80 people and have just been faced with a bill of &#163;130,000 on a property that is empty and unlettable. The business has been running for 50 years and they will have to close it unless some way can be found around the problem.</p>

 I can assure my hon. Friend that I will come to the issue of empty property rates.</p>

Member for North Cornwall made&#151;they were completed at the beginning of this month. We are looking at the results, and I hope to be able to say a little more in the next few weeks. However, we can expect those sectors and locations that have done well in recent years to see increases in bills, whereas those that have not fared as well are likely to see reductions. That addresses some of the points that the hon. Gentleman made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90615-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09061539000103">All the rateable values will be published at the end of September. At the same time, we will provide a business rates calculator to help ratepayers estimate their rates bills for 2010. That is something that we introduced in 2005, and it has been helpful to businesses that wish to plan ahead. Under the previous system&#151;this relates to my earlier point&#151;there was a problem, because people did not know what their rates were likely to be, sometimes until the last few weeks of the financial year. However, the excellent business rates calculator will help people to plan ahead. We introduced it because we know how important it is for businesses to be able to plan ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90615-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09061539000104">We will make even more improvements to the business rates calculator, so that by October business rate payers will be able to estimate their 2010 rates by using their 2010 rateable values. In addition, for those ratepayers who face increases in the 2010 revaluation, we will introduce transitional arrangements to phase in those increases. Again, although not resiling from the system that was introduced, we are looking at ways of helping people where specific problems have arisen, first, from the 5 per cent. increase and, secondly, from some of the revaluations, and as I have said, we will consult on those.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90615-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09061539000105">At the last revaluation, in 2005, we introduced a transitional arrangement scheme, which lasted for the first four years of the five-year rating list. The idea was to ensure that all ratepayers paid their normal rates bills for at least one year of the rating list. Those ratepayers affected will have had four years to plan for their 2009-10 rates bills. The hon. Member for Putney said that the Government had ignored the responses to the 2004 consultation paper. There were 66 responses, and although nine favoured a five-year scheme, 44 favoured a four-year scheme ending on 1 April 2009, so we did listen to the responses in 2004. We also listened, again,  <br>

to businesses when they faced increases, and that is why we introduced the deferral scheme. With respect to the ending of the transitional relief scheme, we listened to people, and that is why we introduced the transitional relief scheme for the increases for 2005 to 2009.</p>

Those regulations will cover the deferral of the 5 per cent. retail prices index increase and the deferral of increases faced by those businesses losing transitional relief from 1 April 2009.</p>

Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) and others have raised the question of empty property reliefs. I am sure that hon. Members will recognise that, previously, landlords had no incentive to find tenants for their empty properties. As a result, rents in UK cities ended up being higher than they might otherwise have been. That is why we removed many of the exemptions and reliefs for empty properties. To reintroduce such a relief would cost as much &#163;950 million a year, which would have to be found from other areas of taxation or through public spending cuts.</p>

 I do hope that my right hon. Friend will have a look at this, because this is a much more serious problem than the little note that she has just received from the Box makes out. The Pallion engineering company in my constituency is the last surviving shipyard on the Wear, and its rates are going up from &#163;55,000 a year to &#163;234,000. The Treasury will not get that &#163;234,000, however, because that rates bill will put the company out of business, along with the 200 people who work there. I appreciate that my right hon. Friend has not had much time to get to grips with these issues, but I do hope that she will talk to her opposite numbers in the Treasury about the folly of what is happening.</p>

 We have tried to listen to the concerns that have been expressed by property owners. That is why, for 2010, all empty properties with rateable values of up to &#163;15,000 will be exempt from rates.

 I thank the Minister for giving way; she has been exceptionally generous, and I am sure that the House will understand if her speech goes on a little longer because of all the interventions she has taken. The matter of empty property rates is a very serious one, especially for businesses that have no choice but to get out of their premises. In my constituency, for example, the Buncefield oil depot exploded in 2005, and some of the damaged buildings are still unsafe for people to go back to work in, yet the companies concerned are being charged the full rate for buildings that they cannot go back into. Surely that is a ludicrous anomaly in the legislation.</p>

automaticity is that, because a local authority does not necessarily know which businesses occupy multiple properties, the ratepayer is asked to apply to confirm that they meet the criteria for the relief. I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing was sympathetic to the points raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), but, under his proposal, it would be difficult to avoid placing a considerable burden on local authorities, which would need to establish whether a ratepayer was occupying more than one property. However, we are looking into what more we can do to improve the take-up of small business rates relief and we have already taken steps to amend legislation for 2009-10, so that all eligible businesses in new properties can receive rate relief from their first date of occupation.</p>

 I think that hon. Members of all parties would agree that we are living in unprecedented economic times and that many small businesses probably feel as if they are facing an onslaught from all sides. We have already heard that an accountancy firm has predicted that nearly 34,000 small businesses&#151;120 a day&#151;will close in 2009 and that difficulties paying their business rates may well be a factor for some of them. However, it may be that businesses have suffered from falling incomes, unaffordable rents, delayed payments from suppliers or trouble paying their tax liabilities. Their difficulties might be compounded by personal economic problems, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09061542000002">If Back Benchers get the opportunity to contribute to the debate&#151;if I carry on for as long as the two previous speakers, we will move straight into the concluding speeches&#151;I am sure we will hear about similar experiences from businesses all over the country. The motion at least provides us with an opportunity to raise constituency experiences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09061542000003">I find it slightly odd that the Conservatives&#146; motion is drafted so narrowly. It deals specifically with business rates, rather than with all the other issues that might interact to cause difficulty to businesses. What I also find rather bizarre is the similarity of the wording of this motion to that of a motion that was debated on a Conservative Opposition day on 25 March this year. That motion also referred to the above-inflation increases in the business rate, the ending of transitional rate relief, support for a move to automatic business rate relief, and the 2010 revaluation. It condemned the ending of empty property rate relief, and highlighted the issue of the ports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09061542000004">I think that there can be only two reasons for that. It is possible that the Conservatives&#146; current spokesperson was not in her post on the earlier occasion, and has either been doing her homework very assiduously or did not realise how similar this motion was to the earlier one. Alternatively, it may well be that the Conservatives have so little positive policy that they have to rotate it, so that it comes around every couple of months on their Opposition days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09061542000005">This is clearly a significant issue, but it would be more helpful if Conservative policy had moved on since that debate at the end of March. That leads me to wonder whether the Conservatives considered the issue to be the main factor affecting businesses, or whether they simply have nothing to say about anything else. I am not entirely sure of the answer to that question. Judging by the last Opposition day debate that I sat through&#151;on housing&#151;I suggest that the Conservatives simply have nothing to say.</p>

It is clear that the motion will not take the debate about local government finance any further forward. I think that, if anything, it will increase confusion rather than providing clarity. It is a critique of the Government&#146;s failure to address problems relating to business rates, but it also criticises measures that the Government have tried to take to address those problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09061542000007">For example, the Minister described the deferral scheme that the Government want to introduce. What the Government had not realised was that the problem had been caused by a double whammy: the very high increases in inflation combined with the end of the transitional scheme. I did not catch what the Conservatives said that they would do differently. They attacked the ending of empty property rate relief, but they did not say what they would do themselves.</p>

In some areas, the problem is not just that businesses are in accommodation that will be very expensive if the empty property rates continue. In my constituency, the problem is risk aversion. A massive regeneration scheme is taking place there, part of which involves new accommodation for businesses. What investors will take the risk if they think that a property will be left empty, and that that will cost them a huge amount?</p>

That is similar to the approach that the Conservatives have taken to council tax. It is clear that very few of the Conservative-run councils that have come forward would benefit from their council tax freeze proposal. The fact is that, at a time of huge economic pressures, every council will find it incredibly difficult to deliver. If the Conservatives had real confidence in local authorities, they would give them the discretion to consult their businesses, and I am sure that, in some areas there would be a possibility of the improvements that businesses want.</p>

Member for Putney (Justine Greening) committed her party to. The Leader of the Opposition continually calls on people to vote for change, but the evidence at present suggests that it would be a vote merely to change the labels on the same tin. There is no radical rethink. If we really want to understand what is going on in this regard, the name of the party gives the game away: the fact that they are called the &#147;Conservatives&#148; means that they generally want to change things back to the way they were before&#151;and therefore they do not want to revalue, nor to set business rates according to inflation, nor to change anything with regard to the way business rates work. We heard nothing about anything they would do differently. As I have said, their approach is intellectually incoherent. It is consistent only with the way they look at another aspect of local government finance: council tax. Their approach is that the system is broken and unaffordable, but the way to solve that is, apparently, not by revaluing, and we will therefore end up having a system of local taxation based on property values that are decades out of date. They should either say that the system of council tax is bust and that they will replace it with something else, or defend the council tax system and offer a revaluation. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for Putney asks from a sedentary position about my party&#146;s position. Our position is very clear. It involves changing the balance of funding so that more that is spent locally is raised locally. That will partly be achieved through localising business rates entirely and moving to a system of local taxation based on the ability to pay. We are very clear about that, and we are very happy to explain how we will achieve it. The Conservatives, however, have not said what they would do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09061542000023">The Government&#146;s response to the Opposition motion is equally inadequate. The exchange this evening echoes one outside the Chamber in which the Conservatives and Labour are trying to blow chunks out of each other&#146;s spending plans. Instead of having a debate about what the level of future funding should be and what difficult decisions need to be taken, we have two parties arguing at cross-purposes. While the Conservative motion is so narrowly drawn as to be highly limiting, the Government response is merely to produce as long a list as possible of all the things they have done or have said they might do at some point in the future. What we did not hear from the Minister is whether these measures and pronouncements have been effective. That is unsurprising as, to put it charitably, the results have been patchy. They praise themselves for righting wrongs that were their responsibility in the first place. They also praise themselves for extending the relief for empty properties, but fail to point out that they did so only in response to extreme pressure, and that at the end of the day that is only deferring pain for another year. Moreover, in terms of their proposals to defer payment for some of this year&#146;s inflation-busting 5 per cent. increases in business rates, they have not acknowledged that the whole process of trying to address this is still causing pain for businesses, which are having to make those payments as we speak. The Government motion says that their behaviour has provided &#147;certainty&#148; and &#147;fairness&#148;, but it is very difficult to see how either has been delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09061542000024">The Government praise themselves for policy proposals that have had a limited impact. They say that they</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09061542000025">I am not entirely sure what that has to do with business rates, but their performance in that regard is patchy even within Government Departments. Whereas the Department for Communities and Local Government has managed to hit 88 per cent. of payments, the Home Office figure is just 50 per cent. They therefore have a lot to do to improve their own record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para18"><a name="09061542000026">The amendment praises the regional development agencies for being at the cutting edge of supporting businesses. Again, that is nothing to do with business rates, and the reality is far from what is claimed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para19"><a name="09061542000027">The Minister will know from our discussions in the Committee considering the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill, that the South West of England development agency has unilaterally decided to cut more than &#163;50 million of projects, which are in place to support and create jobs in the region, including in my constituency. The RDA has done that without any consultation, yet the Government&#146;s amendment contains praise for some of the activities that are going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09061542000028">Many have reported that they think that the benefits of the enterprise finance guarantee scheme and the working capital scheme have been limited. Nine out of 10 of more than 2,000 entrepreneurs and business owners surveyed stated that the Government are not supporting small and medium-sized enterprises sufficiently, and the majority of respondents were not even aware of the schemes that were designed to support them. More than half of all SMEs have never heard of any of the schemes, and eligibility, red tape and issues relating to efficiency are creating an insurmountable barrier for many, yet the Government&#146;s amendment has the audacity to claim that the VAT cut has helped people. Once again, instead of permanent solutions to make the tax  <br>

system fairer and to support businesses, we are seeing a deferral of more pain later and billions of pounds being wasted on something that most businesses say has not benefited them or has actually cost them money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para21"><a name="09061542000029">If the Conservatives&#146; approach is to say as little as possible, the Labour approach is to produce as long a list as possible, irrespective of how effective any of the measures have been on the ground. I wonder whether there is a parallel with the First Secretary of State, Baron Mandelson of Foy in the County of Herefordshire and Hartlepool in the County of Durham, in that the longer and grander his title and the more Ministers serving beneath him, the more effective he thinks he is. Such an approach has also been taken in this Government amendment but it fools nobody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para22"><a name="09061542000030">This argument at cross-purposes has missed the fundamental point: local authorities are already doing a huge amount on the ground to support businesses, they understand what the problems are and they are best placed to tackle them. I could cite examples of how local authorities have been examining their procurement of services and instead of just setting an arbitrary figure of 10 days in which to pay their bills, which probably would not be hit, as is the case with the Departments, they are trying to create a level playing field for contracts that allows consortiums of local businesses to get together to make their bids. It is that kind of thing that will make the real difference, not press releases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para23"><a name="09061542000031">More should be done to push down the budgets of regional development agencies to make decisions on spending more accountable, and we should be freeing up councils to reinvest in housing. These are all things that would help not only to tackle this country&#146;s affordable housing crisis, but to support the economy and jobs. Both the Conservatives and Labour have failed to realise that what is needed is not tinkering around the edges or a long list of initiatives; but a fundamental change in the relationship between central and local government, which is essential if people&#146;s confidence in those institutions is to be restored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para24"><a name="09061542000032">Lots of politicians have been keen to jump on this particular bandwagon and to make the connection between MPs&#146; expenses and the need for constitutional reform, but people have not realised that if businesses&#146; and individuals&#146; trust in all levels of government is to be restored, there needs to be a clear statement of the terms of the relationship and work at the grass-roots level to rebuild that relationship. At the national level that might mean constitutional reform, but change needs to take place at the bottom too. That is not only about ensuring that there is proper participation and that decisions about how public money is spent are accountable, but about making a much clearer link between the local taxes that people and businesses pay and the services that they receive in return.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para25"><a name="09061542000033">That link does not exist at the moment. On average, council tax funds about 25 per cent. of the services that are provided locally, and although business rates are collected locally they remain centrally distributed despite the fact that most businesses think their taxes are directly paying for the services that they receive locally. Both aspects of taxation need to be fundamentally changed to make the relationship clearer and to ensure that there is a much stronger link between what is raised and spent locally. As I have said, that means moving away from a  <br>

regressive council tax system to one based on the ability to pay. Alongside that, business rates must also be localised. Only if those changes are taken together will that stronger link be made clear and will people be able to see what they are getting and how they are paying for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para26"><a name="09061542000034">The last thing that is needed are the temporary measures that the Government have announced&#151;deferring corporation tax increases, deferring empty property rates, deferring business rate increases and introducing temporary VAT cuts&#151;which provide no certainty and will do nothing to give people confidence. Instead we need permanent changes to make the system fairer and clearer to everyone, individuals and businesses alike. But neither Labour nor the Conservatives are prepared to face up to that fact, let alone engage in the debate. That is the biggest disappointment of all.</p>

 When I saw that the Opposition had raised the question of business rates, I thought we would be having a thoroughgoing, wide-ranging debate on the principles behind business rates and how we might do better. Instead, we had a niggardly and rather empty proposal criticising various aspects of the mechanics of the current system. I was surprised that the party that is now supposed to believe in localism did not go for something a bit more radical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para27"><a name="09061544000002">I am also disappointed that the Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination, with whom I agree on most issues, was not prepared to be more radical. I agree that we need constitutional reform in this country, and one of the most important aspects of that is to improve the balance of power and responsibilities between central and local government. We need to ensure that there are more powers and responsibilities at local level, and I commend to the House the report recently produced by the Communities and Local Government Committee, on the balance of power between central and local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="90615-0018.htm_para28"><a name="09061544000003">If we are to get the balance of power right and push out more responsibilities and powers locally, we have to ensure that we get the balance of funding right and give local councils more responsibility for raising the funding that pays for their services. I noticed that the words &#147;local income tax&#148; did not pass the lips of the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy). I wonder whether there is a shift in policy coming from the Liberal Democrats. The easiest way to transfer more powers for raising money to local government would be to localise the business rate and put it back to where it was before the poll tax led to the changes.</p>

The estimate  <br>

<notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2009 : Column 116</b><br>
is that the Government need to control about 30 per cent. of the money spent at local level to do that, not the 75 per cent. of money that they control now. Transferring business rates would actually give local authorities the right to raise about 50 per cent. of their own resources directly, and that would be a significant change, which I would commend. I know that the Lyons report looked at that, but did not recommend it. The report did recommend the supplementary business rate, and the Government have introduced that in principle, although they have not gone as far as Lyons wanted. I know that the Government are also looking at measures such as the community infrastructure levy, which will provide some powers at local level to raise the additional resources for councils to spend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90615-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09061544000005">There is a fundamental problem, however: not merely with the gearing of council services, because local authorities raise so little of the total money that they spend at local level&#151;only a quarter&#151;but with the disconnect between development, the costs that it brings and the extra resources that are provided for an area. This country differs from many others in the EU, such as Germany, which has a much bigger incentive to look positively at development because the benefits of the taxes generated by it come back to the community in which it takes place. That is a big issue that needs addressing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="90615-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09061544000006">My right hon. Friend dealt adequately with the other issues. Yes, 5 per cent. inflation looks like a large increase, but there is the possibility next year of a minus 3 per cent. figure for the retail prices index, which shows that the linkage is right. Over the years, businesses have had a good deal. Since the council tax was introduced, the amount that it contributes to local authority resources has risen from 21 to 26 per cent. At the same time, the amount contributed by the business rate has fallen from 28 to 20 per cent. Over the long term, council services, even with efficiency savings, are always likely to need more money spent on them year on year than RPI, because wages at local council level are likely to go up faster than RPI. If the business rate is held down at RPI, it is likely to contribute a smaller and smaller amount towards the payment of council services. That is why, over time, businesses have not done too badly.</p>

Revaluation is not a way of raising in total additional money for Government or anyone else. It is simply a way of ensuring that, in light of current circumstances, the amount that is going to be raised is properly raised and spread between the various businesses in the country. That is all that it does. Once a Government fall behind with revaluation, postpone it and put it off, that simply means that the next time they do it, the dislocation is even greater. I have to say to the Government that that is exactly the problem that we now have with council tax revaluation. It has been postponed and postponed, and we have got ourselves in a real mess.

the truth of the matter. They need the cash. How much cash? They need &#163;1,200, but it would mean a great deal to the many hundreds of thousands of very small businesses up and down the country if that could be given automatically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="90615-0019.htm_para12"><a name="09061544000019">Why is not given automatically? Simply, it depends on how the local authority treats the issue.

That makes no sense at all. The charities affected include the British Heart Foundation and Coventry&#146;s Ring and Ride project, both of which are being made to pay the tax. I think that the bailiffs are being sent in to the 140 companies that are unable to pay, so the full force and rigour of the law are being brought to bear for no better purpose that I can see than to expose the inadequacies of the BID company.</p>

In many respects, the city suffers from a relatively poor image, despite its many advantages. A select group of companies has been picked out for the privilege of paying &#163;400,000 a year, when the whole of Coventry is meant to benefit from the initiative.</p>

 I ask the new Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination to listen carefully to the points that I will make. In an intervention, I tried to raise a serious issue that has a massive effect on the business community in my constituency. It has to do with empty property rates, which have changed so that the exemption from them drops after six months. It is absolutely ludicrous, if not immoral, that businesses that have no choice&#151;none at all&#151;but to be outside their premises should be caught by the rates on empty properties. In my constituency, the main reason for that happening was the Buncefield disaster that took place in November 2005.</p>

Through no fault of their own, businesses were literally blown out of their premises. Some of the businesses have actually demolished their premises&#151;levelled them off&#151;so that no business rates are due. The sites are lying fallow. Nothing will be built on them until after the civil case  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90615-0019.htm_para23"><a name="09061544000032">The premises of businesses that do not have the money, or whose insurance companies have not paid out, are sitting there, derelict. 3Com is a good example; its premises are in the middle of my constituency, right next to Buncefield, and they are completely derelict. The company is liable, believe it or not, for business rates. The disaster took place in 2005; we are now entering the summer of 2009 and it is not the companies&#146; fault that they cannot return to their premises. It is not the fault of my local authority, which has done a fantastic job in helping businesses to get back into some of the premises. It is the fault of some of the insurance companies, which were, frankly, slow or belligerent in paying out. However, the biggest problem is that we still have two huge court cases going on&#151;one for compensation, and one a criminal prosecution. The businesses are stuck; they are in limbo; they cannot move back into their premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90615-0019.htm_para24"><a name="09061544000033">Obviously, some businesses are paying business rates, rent, and mortgages on new properties. The insurance companies have helped out with the new capital costs, but the businesses are liable to pay business rates on premises that are derelict, and they cannot move back into them. Some of them are not willing to move back into their premises simply because they have a duty of care to their employees, and they are not happy about moving back in until the Government have made decisions about the safety of premises that surround oil depots such as Buncefield&#151;the recommendations are yet to be made&#151;and until the two court cases are concluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90615-0019.htm_para25"><a name="09061544000034">Surely, in such a debate, the Minister could have said, when I intervened, that it was difficult to answer my question straight from the Dispatch Box. Instead of ignoring my intervention, she should have done me the courtesy of saying, &#147;I will write to you about the matter; it is a very specific issue.&#148; Instead, very unusually for the Minister&#151;I have worked with her before&#151;she completely ignored my intervention, which was on an issue that means a huge amount to my community and for business confidence in my constituency. Our enormous plight cannot be ignored. There is a recession going on, and there is a blight on my local business park. That is not our fault; it was the fault of the oil companies, from whom we are trying to get compensation. In the meantime, I would have thought that a little help from the Government would not have gone amiss.</p>

 We are addressing a serious issue this evening&#151;how businesses may get the best help possible through the recession, which has been sudden and in many instances relates to circumstances that changed rapidly last year. We should consider various types of help, a number of which have been mentioned. However, as hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90615-0019.htm_para27"><a name="09061544000037">If one chooses to make the focus of the debate so specific, it is essential to have some answers to the questions that arise from such statements so that the debate can be taken seriously. If one says that businesses have been hit by above-inflation increases, one presumably has to say that it would be a much better idea if businesses were not hit by above-inflation increases, in which case one must presumably refer to the original legislation on business rates passed by the then Conservative Government, which stated that a retail prices index indicator should be put in place to determine business rate increases each year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90615-0019.htm_para28"><a name="09061544000038">The question then arises whether the solution is to change or abolish that legislation. Should there be no increases in business rates, or smaller increases? Both of those would require the original legislation to be changed. If one goes for no increases, one must answer a further question. Each year that formula raises about &#163;1.3 billion in business rates, which goes towards the local government pot, so to speak. If that element is removed, one has to decide how the pot is to be replenished. Will the general taxpayer have to pay an additional grant towards the local government settlement, or if no one is to pay, will there be a cut of &#163;1.3 billion in local government spending? One ought to be straight about that, if that is what is proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90615-0019.htm_para29"><a name="09061544000039">I have attempted to find some answers, and not just for the purposes of the debate. I listened carefully to the presentation from the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening), but I got no answers from that at all. Indeed, there was obfuscation about the proposals. I read an impressive-looking document entitled &#147;Control shift&#151;returning power to local communities&#148;, the Conservative policy on local government. It is a long document, 23 pages in 10-point type. In it there is not a word about business rate construction, how business rates might work in the future, whether the RPI formula would be adhered to or whether changes would be made to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="90615-0019.htm_para30"><a name="09061544000040">There is not a word about revaluation or how it might be changed. Revaluation has taken place every five years since 1990 and each time transitional arrangements have been put in place. There is one line about discretionary power to levy business rate discounts, and the document states that that can be given to local authorities</p>
<a name="90615-0019.htm_brev4"><a name="09061544000072"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as long as they can fund them from other local income or avoided costs&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="90615-0019.htm_para31"><a name="09061544000041">that is, can they find the money from somewhere else, perhaps the council tax payer, or perhaps by cutting services? The document contains no answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="90615-0019.htm_para32"><a name="09061544000042">If it is decided not to change the legislation, deferring business rate increases is a logical step to take. Next year&#146;s RPI is likely to be negative, and businesses that know that will be able to decide whether they wish to smooth the increase out over a couple of years, take a greater discount now and a lesser discount later on, or go for no discount now and therefore receive a substantial decrease in their business rates for the following year. Businesses will make that logical move if they have the answers to the basic questions. If one does not know what is happening to the basic nature of business rates, and one appears to be unaware that the increase arrangements and transitional arrangements are enshrined in legislation and if one is unaware that revaluation is the basis on which one redistributes&#151;and not increases&#151;the pot, businesses will say other things. That is essentially what has happened tonight.</p>

 We have heard much about the challenges that many of us have seen in our surgeries when representatives of small business have chatted to us. I had a meeting with people from the Essex branch of the Federation of Small Businesses who told me about the challenges that their members face, with margins being squeezed, banks not supporting them and so on. They raised the issue of rates: rates seem to be rising above inflation, which brings challenges, and the organisation has expectations of how local councils can help its members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para2"><a name="09061544000046">There are three issues to do with local business rates. One that has been highlighted for me was the difficulty that small businesses have in paying them. The Local Government Association has warned that, as it is,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09061544000048">Businesses are being driven away. A business in Witham in my constituency is being charged &#163;200,000. It can move its whole operation to China, and is doing so&#151;with the loss of 100 jobs. With that &#163;200,000, it can have the whole businesses run elsewhere. That is a great shame; our towns are being gutted and businesses are being driven to close down. Councillor Margaret Eaton, the chair of the Local Government Association, said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09061544000049">I totally agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para6"><a name="09061544000050">What are the solutions? We heard one today from my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), who proposed his own private Member&#146;s Bill, the Small Business Rate Relief (Automatic Payment) Bill, which would have rendered the relief automatically payable to eligible businesses, as it is in Wales. In another example, Braintree district council has proposed spreading rate payments over 10 points in a 12-month period, and breaking it up into 10 per cent. pieces over 12 months is a good solution. There is also the flexible rates solution, whereby local councils have discretionary powers. That idea does not mean that they have to make up the money from elsewhere, and allowing for some flexibility on rates will help draw in new businesses.</p>

 The fact that this subject has been chosen by Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition for our allotted half day demonstrates how important to our economy we consider the business sector, particularly small businesses which can provide a path out of recession. No Labour Member has mentioned that business rates are a fixed cost, the pain of which has a bigger impact in a recession. We Conservatives believe that the Government&#146;s policies&#151;especially those on business rates&#151;are inflicting significant damage on the business sector.

Less than three months ago, we initiated a debate that focused on the key issues affecting entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises: the poor take-up of small business rates relief; empty property rates; the failure of the local authority business growth incentives scheme effectively to promote business growth; the need to allow local authorities devolved autonomy to apply local business rate discounts; and, most importantly, the rise of 5 per cent. in business rates and the end of the transitional rate relief scheme. My party has outlined detailed and fully costed proposals designed to assist businesses in the current climate, not least a national loan guarantee scheme, a cut in corporation tax and payroll taxes for small companies, and deferred VAT for small businesses.</p>

Indeed, the conceit that the Labour party was pro-business was never supported by any demonstrable evidence. For Labour, business has always been a milch cow to fund its hare-brained schemes, fiscal mismanagement, bureaucracy and debt boom.

The business community has lost what little faith and trust it had in this tired, discredited, washed-up Government, who have always governed in their own interests, not those of the people of this country. They cannot even get their spin right, as we saw today in the spat between the Chief Secretary and the surrogate Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families. The Government&#146;s public expenditure and taxation plans are incoherent and incredible, just at a time when business desires clarity and leadership.</p>

They have had 12 years to harness the talent, flair and genius of our wealth creators, but they have comprehensively failed, leaving the ambitions of thousands in tatters. Once again, as in 1979, it will fall to a Conservative Government to rescue our economy, restore our mercantile spirit and repair the calamity of Labour&#146;s dozen wasted years.</p>

only this Government have been helping businesses through the current economic recession, and only this Government are prepared to take action now. In her opening remarks, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination eloquently made the point that we fully recognise the impact of the current economic climate on businesses across the country. That is why we have taken real action now to help business through this economic downturn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para23"><a name="09061546000002">The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) took us through her contribution at breakneck speed. I appreciate why she did that, but it was sometimes difficult to keep up. I agreed with her critique of the Opposition motion, and I, too, noticed the striking similarity with the motion tabled on 25 March. I am sure that we all accept the importance of business rates, but I agree that the motion is narrow and ignores other issues about help for businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para24"><a name="09061546000003">I am afraid that that is as far as I can go in agreeing with the hon. Lady. I do not accept that our actions are tinkering at the edges, because I believe that they are giving real help to businesses now. I was disappointed that she mentioned our VAT cut, because despite the complaints from both Opposition parties, which did not believe that it would be effective, Office for National Statistics data show that the cut has been passed on to consumers in around two thirds of prices and has contributed to recent falls in inflation. In January, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the VAT cut had had the same effect as a 1 per cent. cut in interest rates, and in February Goldman Sachs said:</p>
<a name="90615-0020.htm_brev4"><a name="09061546000510"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The VAT cut appears to have had a clear positive impact.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para25"><a name="09061546000004">My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) made a thoughtful and knowledgeable contribution, and I particularly welcome his comments about revaluation, which put the record straight after the opening contribution by the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para26"><a name="09061546000005">The hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) made his contribution in his inimitable way, and he confined his remarks to small business rate relief. This Government introduced the scheme in the Local Government Act 2003, because we recognised the disproportionate burden that rates can have on small businesses. I am disappointed that the Opposition did not support that Bill on either Second or Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para27"><a name="09061546000006">The hon. Gentleman made a point about making small business rate relief automatic, which was suggested in a private Member&#146;s Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff). Such a scheme would present considerable challenges for local authorities, as they would themselves need to establish whether a ratepayer occupied more than one property. I cannot see how local authorities could do that if the ratepayer&#146;s property crossed local authority boundaries. There are difficulties with transferring that responsibility from businesses to local authorities, and we must consider whether it would be an administrative burden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para28"><a name="09061546000007">The hon. Member for Northampton, South also mentioned Wales, but the system is not totally automatic there. It is only partly automatic, and the scheme is different from ours. However, we are sympathetic to the aim of finding ways to support small businesses through the economic downturn, and we have been considering  <br>

what more we can do to improve the take-up of small business rate relief. We have already taken steps to amend legislation for 2009-10, so that all eligible businesses in new properties can receive rate relief from their first date of occupation. We are discussing with the Local Government Association the practical concerns&#151;they are genuine practical concerns&#151;to avoid an automatic scheme, which would award relief to businesses that are ineligible because they occupy multiple properties. I am happy to meet the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire to explain the position further. I believe that there is an outstanding meeting, at which he was due to meet my predecessor, and I am more than happy to take that up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para29"><a name="09061546000008">My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) spoke about a business improvement district project in his constituency. I do not have the details, but I am happy to discuss it with him further outside the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para30"><a name="09061546000009">I assure the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) that his concerns were certainly not ignored. There was a concern that not all Back Benchers would have the opportunity to speak, and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman had the opportunity to make his point. To respond to it, it is generally the case that property must be capable of beneficial occupation before it can be brought into the rating list and be liable for empty property rates. The issue is obviously so important that the hon. Gentleman is not even listening. There are some exceptions to what I outlined. When the property is close to being complete and building work has stopped, the general rule is that property not capable of beneficial occupation is not rateable. I am more than happy to meet the hon. Gentleman and discuss his concerns further. However, I repeat that the general principle is that, if the property is not capable of beneficial occupation, it is not rateable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para31"><a name="09061546000010">I am grateful for the considerable knowledge and expertise of my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) on local government finance. I was heartened by his exposing the holes in the highly selective Opposition argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para32"><a name="09061546000011">The hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) raised concerns about businesses&#146; ability to pay their business rates. That is precisely why we have introduced the help with cash flow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para33"><a name="09061546000012">Many hon. Members mentioned the deferral scheme. We recognise that businesses need help now to ease their cash flow when money is tight. That is why we introduced the deferral scheme for business rates. It is designed to smooth the effects of the inflation spike of 5 per cent. in September 2008, which would have meant an impact on businesses&#146; cash flow this year. In the Budget, the Chancellor forecast that RPI inflation would fall to minus 3 per cent. by September 2009. The impact of uprating if RPI is negative would be to reduce total business rates in cash terms in 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="90615-0020.htm_para34"><a name="09061546000013">The hon. Member for Putney asked how the full deferral of 60 per cent. could be delivered if the scheme is introduced halfway through the year. The deferral scheme will come into force at the end of July&#151;that was made clear when it was announced. The scheme will offer the full deferral of 60 per cent. of the increase due to inflation and transitional relief by adjusting the instalments of business rates that remain outstanding.</p>

Regular revaluations are an important part of the rating system as they maintain fairness between all ratepayers. Revaluation ensures that each business contributes, based on up-to-date information. As my right hon. Friend the Minister said, all rateable values will be published at the end of September. At the same time, we will provide the business rates calculator to help ratepayers estimate their rates bill for 2010. By October, ratepayers will be able to estimate their 2010 rates bill, using their actual 2010 rateable value. <i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

It will introduce a power for the suspension of driving instructors who pose a threat to members of the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90615-0021.htm_para11"><a name="0906162000009">The Bill will have expenditure implications for the public purse, which will relate to compensation payable to driving instructors who have been suspended but whose permission to give paid driving instruction is not subsequently revoked, or whose permission is reinstated on appeal. The level of expenditure is unlikely to be significant, as it is expected that very few cases will result in the awarding of compensation. However, approval for a money resolution is needed before the Committee can debate the issue fully. The hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife has previously explained to the House that he has a particular interest in the issue as a consequence of concerns raised by one of his constituents.</p>

Unfortunately, a small number do not. Hon. Members will be rightly anxious for adequate safeguards to cover circumstances in which persons are prevented from following their profession. To that end, I wish to reassure the House that the Bill provides for a satisfactory statutory compensation scheme for the reimbursement of losses suffered by a suspended instructor whose suspension is subsequently lifted, and who is permitted to resume giving paid instruction. That is why we need the money resolution, and on that basis I commend it to the House.</p>

I also thank my colleagues on the Tory Back Benches, and some on the Labour Benches, who, as the perennial awkward squad, can often be relied on to block any private Member&#146;s legislation, for seeing that this is what is termed a no-brainer as it involves realistic and sensible measures, and who therefore made sure we got to this stage today. We will be able to address the details in Committee on Wednesday, but the Bill closes an important loophole and means that a balance can be struck between the rights of approved driving instructors convicted of an offence and whether they can be considered a &#147;fit and proper&#148; person to be alone with a young learner, and our obligation to protect these young people.</p>

Consideration has been given to others such as school bus drivers, where the balance to be struck must be different. A person who has even just been arrested for an offence is to be immediately suspended. While I can see why the measure under discussion might have been taken a step further, given that we are not talking about vulnerable children or vulnerable adults with problems such as those we often encounter in care homes I think we have got the balance right. In cases where people are arrested as a result of investigations such as Operation Orr, the forensic examination of computers often takes many months, and in such cases the appeal would be much more expensive. I am very pleased that we have managed to reach this stage, and I look forward to debating the matter further in Committee on Wednesday.</p>

This issue arose from the case of Lesley Anne Steele in my constituency. She was sexually assaulted by a driving instructor, but the very next day after he was convicted he was out teaching another young girl to drive in the very same community. She came to me and we worked together to try to find out how this could possibly have happened.

Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie), Lesley Anne Steele, in coming forward in what must have been difficult circumstances, and thereby bringing this matter forward to where we have reached today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para1"><a name="0906162000022">For the purposes of any Act resulting from the Driving Instruction (Suspension and Exemption Powers) Bill, it is expedient to provide a power in uncommenced provisions in the Road Safety Act 2006 to charge a fee for the costs incurred as a result of the exemption arrangements that enable partially qualified driving instructors to provide instruction for payment. The Bill amends uncommenced provisions in the 2006 Act, in particular those affecting sections 124 and 129 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. Section 129 enables trainee driving instructors to apply for a licence that permits them to offer instruction for payment. The registrar of approved driving instructors, who is an employee of the Driving Standards Agency, may charge a fee in connection with such an application&#151;that fee currently stands at &#163;140 per licence granted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para2"><a name="0906162000023">The existing trainee licence scheme is quite rigid in terms of its entry requirements. Applicants must have passed the first two of the three approved driving instructor qualifying tests. However, the 2006 Act envisaged more flexible qualifying arrangements for trainee instructors. Trainee instructors will obtain practical experience of providing tuition through the granting of exemptions from the requirement to be registered, as provided for in the uncommenced provisions of the 2006 Act. Unfortunately, that Act does not provide for a fee to be charged in connection with these exemption arrangements. The DSA needs to be able to continue charging trainee driving instructors a fee in connection with applications to give paid instruction while working towards admittance to the register of qualified instructors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para3"><a name="0906162000024">If the DSA were unable to pass on to applicants its costs for processing those exemption requests, they would fall on the agency&#146;s other customers and I am sure that the House would agree that that would be unfair. Alternatively, the DSA would not commence the new provisions and would continue to rely on the existing trainee licence regime. That would deny trainee driving instructors the more flexible qualifying arrangements envisaged in the 2006 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para4"><a name="0906162000025">We shall be introducing an amendment to the Bill to provide for the charging of fees in connection with the exemption from this registration. It is intended to replace the fee-charging provision that supports the existing trainee licence scheme. It is for this reason that the Ways And Means resolution is being introduced and, on that basis, I commend the resolution to the House.</p>

 The vehicle scrappage scheme was launched on 18 May and is therefore less than a month old. In a press release today, after just 28 days, Lord Mandelson declared that the scheme was a success and had given the car-making industry the boost that it needed. It is slightly premature to issue such a press release after such a short time. The new car industry may consider the scheme a success, but it has actually failed in several areas and could be improved. I shall highlight some of the many ways in which that might be done.</p>

The two-month review must be a real review, in which stakeholders can provide information to the Government about what could be done better, and the Government can then react to that positively and incorporate it into the scheme. In other words, the two-month review must be a real review, open to full consultation.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has pre-empted part of what I was going to say. I also have a Copart division in my constituency, in Stewartby. I agree that when the compliance review takes place, consumers, members of the scrappage industry and other interested parties should have the opportunity to contribute to the review.</p>

There is also a focus on new car sales, instead of the entire motor trade. Of course, the scheme was introduced, practically the night before the Budget and released the next day, as an emergency measure to boost the flagging car industry. One cannot say that it has failed in that&#151;today&#146;s figures show sales of 60,000 cars in a month&#151;but other parts of the motor industry are as important.

&#163;2,000 support is for a motorist to acquire a new car or a new van by visiting a dealer. The dealers are generally tied to one manufacturer, as most new car dealers are. Obviously, documentation checks take place through the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency database. Manufacturers will invoice the Department for &#163;1,000 and provide match funding. Some manufacturers offer additional incentive finance, whereas others drive a hard bargain, with fewer incentives, particularly with the smaller new cars, which elderly people tend to go for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0906162000038">The consequence is that in the modern second-hand market there is no benefit for the for people who might wish to trade up rather than commit the larger net amount to an entirely new vehicle. Some consumers who do not normally make new purchases will also be unfamiliar with the credit risk arising from the expensive capital purchase. I believe that some people from lower-income groups and the elderly are disadvantaged as a result. Many people who have a 10-year-old car have a 10-year-old car because they cannot afford to trade up to a new car. The difference between the 10-year-old car and the new purchase is huge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0906162000039">A &#163;2,000 saving from &#163;8,000 or &#163;10,000 is not that much for a retired couple in their mid-70s to 80s who have had their car for a long time&#151;probably since just before they retired. They do not have much capital, so that reduction in price does not really help. If we had a way of helping such a couple to have access to second-hand cars that were more reliable&#151;after all, one of the reasons why the scheme was introduced is that 10-year-old cars are not as safe&#151;I could definitely see that as an improvement in the scheme. It would boost the automotive industry as a whole rather than just the new car sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0906162000040">We do not have a portable voucher such as the one in Germany and California, whereby people can take their voucher wherever they wish to buy their car. They have much greater access to the market and to what is available. That empowers the people who hold the vouchers. They are not then subjected to one particular dealer, or to one particular type of car or manufacturer. They have the buying power because they have a voucher in their hand. We know that that system has been incredibly successful in California and Germany. Perhaps we do not have a portable voucher scheme because our scheme was brought in so quickly and hurriedly due to the circumstances that we faced at the time. Does the Minister believe, now that we have had more time to reflect on the matter, that he will consider the portable voucher scheme in the review that will take place after two months?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0906162000041">I recognise that the strongest driving force behind the new scheme is car sales. My constituency is near Luton, where LDV is suffering its own problems and uncertainties, so I do not want to sound as though I am diminishing the importance of boosting new car sales. I am not. I believe, however, that the portable voucher, by enabling people to trade up, will provide a longer-term stimulus to the automotive industry and new car sales.</p>

solely through their local dealership, which will have arrangements with other scrappage dealers, that does not give the consumer power over where they can take their cars. They are tied in to the dealer&#151;not only by the finance available from the Department and the dealer, but on the scrappage side, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0906162000043">There are effects on the scrappage trade, too. We would be foolish to sit here and think that 60,000 new car sales and the scrapping of 60,000 cars this month, in addition to what already takes place, will not cause a spike in the scrappage trade that, in turn, will cause a downturn in prices. That is happening and as a result the scheme is suffering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0906162000044">The Department has not had time to make appropriate due-diligence checks on the organisations that will be intimately involved in delivering the scrappage element of the scheme. Copart in my constituency is a subsidiary of an American organisation and is one of the largest scrappage organisations in the UK where there are 1.5 million scrap vehicles every year. It would be good if the experts on this part of the scheme could be brought in for discussion, with due diligence being paid to how they deal with their scrappage and the effects that the scheme is having on their businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0906162000045">The scrap industry is suffering from cash-flow problems at present, as the price of scrap metal has fallen by 20 per cent. There was great anticipation of the scheme before it was launched and, although I have not had time to check today, I imagine that the fact that there have been more than 60,000 car sales this month means that the price of scrap has fallen even further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0906162000046">The capacity to deal with the volume of scrappage safely and in a sustainable way needs to be assessed. Nobody wants too few vehicles to be processed, but equally no one wants a car mountain. In the present state of the scheme, there is no strong commercial incentive for parties with large-scale capacity in vehicle scrappage to enter the trade chain. That is another good reason why the organisations to which I have referred should be brought into the review process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0906162000047">Another element is the EU&#146;s end-of-life vehicles directive, whose aim is to achieve a greening of the auto industry. The Department has said that the &#147;green side of things&#148; is secondary to the boost that the scrappage scheme will give the car industry, but I reject that. I am a member of the Energy and Climate Change Committee, and I believe that green considerations are equally important, as they have their own effect on the economy. The green side of the scrappage scheme needs to be given an importance equal to that of boosting the car industry, and we must make sure that people using the scheme are aware of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para22"><a name="0906162000048">The Department for Business, Innovatina and Skills says that it has urged car manufacturers to review their vehicle disposal arrangements to accommodate demand, but manufacturers and most dealers are locked into sole-source agreements with particular vehicle takeaway companies for the first stage in the vehicle disposal sequence. As a result, any difficulties that arise can be resolved only when there has been a contractual failure and there are vehicle takeaway problems. That is too late, because by then the companies will already have failed to meet the criteria laid down for them. Making sure that that aspect of the matter is given full consideration is another reason why it is important that we have a review at the end of two months. Compliance with the  <br>

EU&#146;s end-of-life vehicles directive may be harder to achieve if the scheme eventually achieves its target of 300,000 vehicles, with the bulk of vehicles being dealt with in a shorter space of time and causing the spikes in scrap management that I have described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para23"><a name="0906162000049">I shall summarise my argument in three minutes. We need to make the scheme fully successful during the 10 months, for the benefit of the economy. No one doubts or disputes that&#151;least of all me, given that my constituency is next door to Luton. As the scheme is constructed and operating, it may not deliver strong benefits for any part of the automotive industry over the longer period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para24"><a name="0906162000050">It is clearly important that the scheme delivers good results for new sales, as that is how part-funding from manufacturers is being leveraged. However, its design has built-in disincentives for consumers to achieve maximum personal choice, and an example of that is the lack of a portable voucher that I mentioned earlier. I hope that the Minister, when he responds to the debate will say something about portable vouchers: has the Department begun to look at them, and does it think that there is any point in making them available? Will they be part of what is assessed in the review?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para25"><a name="0906162000051">The requirement that arrangements for vehicle scrappage can be made only through dealerships also limits consumer flexibility, and distorts business volumes in the scrappage industry. The scheme&#146;s focus on new sales also disadvantages other parts of the total automotive economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para26"><a name="0906162000052">The Department has stated that the scrappage industry and green aspects are secondary&#151;an unfortunate and indefensible statement. The scrappage industry has already experienced some economic loss, and it would be wrong to raise environmental risks. Britain should take the opportunity of the compliance review that will be undertaken after the second month of the scheme to put in place new arrangements that open up consumer choice and spread the economic and green benefits across the whole of the automotive economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="90615-0022.htm_para27"><a name="0906162000053">Finally, it is worth considering whether there could be a longer-term scheme. The Government have recognised that the scrappage programme is important to stimulating the car industry. The present scheme may or may not end before a general election is called, but there may be scope for a longer-term arrangement, particularly one based on greater consumer choice and with clearer environmental credentials. So my main points are about: the portable voucher that people are given; the fact that environmental considerations are as important as the stimulation to the car industry; and consumers being given greater access, particularly in terms of the scrappage element of the scheme.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Nadine Dorries) on securing this timely debate. She made a stimulating contribution, giving many ideas concerning an interesting and, to date, successful scheme. Of course, the scrappage scheme was brought in because of a crisis in one of our most important industries. Manufacturing in general, and the automotive industry in particular, are of key importance to the United Kingdom&#146;s economy. However, in recent months the automotive industry has been one  <br>

of the sectors worst affected by the current global economic downturn, so let me begin by reaffirming the Government&#146;s absolute commitment to safeguarding the industry&#146;s future and providing support in these difficult times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para0"><a name="0906163000002">The scheme was brought in at the request of the motor industry, which pressed hard for a scrappage scheme; it was in answer to representations that the scheme was introduced. The Government responded because the automotive industry employs nearly 1 million people in manufacturing and retailing, and it contributes &#163;10 billion annually to the economy. It is a major contributor to research and development, and supports many highly skilled workers and a wide supply chain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0906163000003">In the United Kingdom, the sector has been under great pressure in recent months, but the Government are determined to ensure that it remains one of the central pillars of British manufacturing. The vehicle scrappage scheme, which, as the hon. Lady said, was announced in the Budget and introduced on 18 May, is one of the mechanisms that we are using to achieve that objective and stimulate demand. I emphasise that it is one of a number of different methods. It has its own particular purpose and remit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0906163000004">The decision to implement a scrappage scheme was taken after careful consideration of a wide range of evidence, including the lessons learned from other European schemes and evidence on the possible impact of such a scheme on other sectors of the economy. We have endeavoured to introduce the most effective scheme for the sector, while ensuring that we look after taxpayers&#146; interests properly and minimise the possible effects elsewhere in the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0906163000005">The Government have ensured that advice about support on offer specifically tailored to the needs of the automotive sector has been distributed to the UK automotive supply chain through the manufacturers. In addition to that support, which is available today, there are a number of other sources of support. The new automotive innovation and growth team&#151;a Government-facilitated, industry-led, independent group of experts&#151;published a report on 6 May. It rightly emphasised the scale and continuing importance of the automotive industry to the United Kingdom&#146;s manufacturing sector and wider economy. However, the NAIGT recognises that to secure that position for the long term the United Kingdom needs to become a leading global player in the development of low-carbon road transport. Its work is particularly timely in view of the announcement on 16 April of the Government&#146;s vision to develop ultra low-carbon transport over the next five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0906163000006">Let me touch on the legitimate points that the hon. Lady raised about the green aspect of the scrappage scheme. It is especially important to observe that the scrappage scheme is a particular proposal for a particular time. It was introduced in response to demands made by the motor industry, which requested a stimulant in the market at a particular time. It is for that reason that the Government decided to introduce a scheme that was time-limited and budget-limited. It has been extremely successful to date. As the hon. Lady said, some 60,000 vehicles have been sold under the scheme; that is about 10,000 or 12,000 vehicles a week. That is a direct stimulant to the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0906163000007">However, in order to observe the requirement for low-carbon transport, the Government have made it clear that the scheme will be time limited. Our calculations indicate that the scheme as a whole will be carbon-neutral, because there is evidence that newer cars use less fuel than older cars. Vehicles over 10 years old are being taken off the roads and replaced by vehicles new to the roads, which use lower amounts of fuel and emit less carbon into the atmosphere. They therefore make a positive green contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para6"><a name="0906163000008">It is important to realise that the scrappage scheme is only one of the schemes that the Government are introducing in the automotive sector. The automotive assistance programme is another device instigated by the Government to assist the industry. That has particular environmental aspects which require the manufacturers to take environmental steps in order to qualify for assistance. The Government recognise the importance of offering specific incentives in order to address the needs of the environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0906163000009">Let me deal with some of the specific issues raised by the hon. Lady. She referred to the compliance review. That is an audit of compliance with the scheme which will take place at the two-month point, as promised. It is not a review of the scheme. It looks at the way the scheme is working and how it is affecting the industry as a whole, to see whether the systems in place are working properly, not incorrectly or fraudulently.</p>

 If the compliance review looks at the way the scheme is working and finds areas in which it is failing, would the review take account of proposals to improve the scheme not just to meet the present criteria, but to an enhanced level for the remaining 10 months?</p>

 Proper compliance with the scheme is important. We need to ensure that the taxpayer is protected. I am keen to see the proper operation of the scheme. All the evidence so far indicates that it is successful. With 60,000 vehicles sold under the scheme since 18 May, there is no evidence that it is unsuccessful. All the evidence indicates the contrary, which is why the Secretary of State spoke in the terms that he did. In the interests of the taxpayer, we have to ensure proper compliance with the rules of the scheme.</p>

 I understand what my hon. Friend is saying&#151;that the compliance review must make sure that the rules are being followed, that nobody is cheating and that the right things are being done. I accept that the scheme has been a great success, but under different rules perhaps 70,000 cars would have been sold, instead of 60,000. Is there no mechanism whereby we can offer my hon. Friend constructive suggestions for making the scheme even more successful, so that he can consider changing the scheme?</p>

 In addition to the compliance review, I am always ready to hear ideas for improvement of the scheme. I add the caveat that the scheme is time limited and budget limited. It has been very successful thus far, and if it were even more successful, the budget might be used up even more quickly than at present. It is a budget-limited scheme; I just want to make that absolutely  <br>

clear. Representations may be made to me on the budget in due course, but the scheme is either time limited or budget limited, and the indications to date are that the budget will be used up within the time frame that was set when the scheme was announced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para8"><a name="0906163000014">On the issue of whether purchasers have been able to afford a new car, early indications show that the people who are using the scheme include the elderly. One group who are most likely to take advantage of the scheme are those who&#151;obviously&#151;have had a car for more than 10 years and who directly respond to the scheme&#146;s large incentives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para9"><a name="0906163000015">Of course, the incentives can amount to more than &#163;2,000. I remember hearing on the first day that the scheme was introduced, I think, advertisements for offers of &#163;3,000 and even more for particular vehicles. It appears that such offers have been very successful in encouraging cash buyers to purchase vehicles. The evidence does not indicate that elderly people are being deterred by the scrappage scheme; if anything, the initial evidence appears to be the contrary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para10"><a name="0906163000016">Before the scheme was introduced, the Government considered extending it to second-hand cars, but we excluded them because of the experience of other member states, which suggested that the inclusion of used cars would distort prices in the market. Having considered the situation, the Government decided that the available funds would be most effectively used in the new car market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para11"><a name="0906163000017">On the question of the car mountain and whether the number of vehicles going to scrappage will cause a difficulty in the scrappage market, I should say that consultation again took place and car scrappage operators gave assurances that there would be capacity in the market to handle the scrappage of all 300,000 cars. To date, we have had no indication that that is not the case, but I should be interested to hear representations from that area of the manufacturing market. There appears, however, to be overall satisfaction with the capacity of the scrappage system in the current market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="90615-0023.htm_para12"><a name="0906163000018">I actually have evidence myself of the scheme&#146;s success, because, strangely this week, having been newly appointed as the Minister responsible for the scheme, I received a letter from my local Toyota garage, which sold me my car some years ago. My vehicle is just over 10 years old and therefore eligible for the scrappage scheme, and in the letter&#146;s PS the garage told me:</p>

As I said earlier, the industry is important not only in the new car sector but in the used car sector and the retail sector. For all those reasons, it is very important that, at this very difficult time, we support the industry as much as we can.</p>
