 I thank my hon. Friend for that response, but what discussions has she had with Scottish Parliament Ministers about the Scottish repossessions working group and what, if any, progress it has made? What discussions has she had about whether the pre-court protocol that exists in England and Wales could be better utilised in Scotland as well?</p>

 The important point is that Scottish house owners should not have any less protection than house owners south of the border enjoy. The pre-court protocol in England and Wales has been successful in helping to stem the number of repossessions cases that pass through the court system. In addition, I am sure that my hon. Friend will welcome the new home owner mortgage support scheme introduced last month, which covers about 80 per cent. of all lending and will offer relief on mortgage interest payments for up to two years for those who suffer a substantial but temporary loss of income. I very much hope that the work of the repossessions working group in Scotland will lead to further protections so that the trauma of repossession can, as far as possible, be avoided.</p>

 I certainly welcome any such measures, and I can advise the hon. Gentleman that the consultation on sale and rent back concluded last week. We hope that there will be a move to bring the regulation of these schemes under the Financial Services Authority, and we are already ensuring that when mortgage lenders write to people who have got into arrears, they advise them of the potential pitfalls and problems of such schemes. It is also important that people who face repossession have the best possible advice when they get to court. In England and Wales, people are offered free advice at court. I know that some courts in Scotland have started along that route, but I very much hope that the number doing so can be increased so that a consistent level of advice and service is available to anyone facing the trauma of repossession at this time.</p>

 Largely as a result of this Government&#146;s reckless tax and spend approach, the Scottish block grant has, indeed, grown to twice the size of 10 years ago.

 Further to the Secretary of State&#146;s answer to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell), can he confirm that if that VAT cut, which has had so little impact, had been reversed, it could have brought Barnett consequentials for the Scottish Government of almost twice the sum that has been complained of as a cut by the Scottish Government?

 The hon. Gentleman is just wrong; the economic experts say very clearly that the VAT cut is working. A philosophical disagreement is involved here. Of course the Scottish Government are getting more money and their budget continues to increase, but the UK Government&#146;s view is that money should also be in the pockets and purses of Scottish consumers, so that they can spend and thus ensure that the Scottish economy is bolstered and that the recession is shallower and shorter than it would otherwise be. The VAT cut is, of course, one of a range of measures, another of which is the scrappage scheme for cars, which has been welcomed by the industry in Scotland. That is another important measure of a Labour Government who are taking decisive action to do what we can throughout this international recession.</p>

 I welcome the fact that the Parliament that the hon. Gentleman opposed continues to be a success. After his short term in the Scottish Parliament, I welcome him to the green Benches here in the Palace of Westminster. The fact is that Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales are stronger together and would be weaker apart. Together we have this unity and Members on both sides of the House&#151;except for four or five who sit opposite&#151;have a sense that our country has a remarkable history. We have achieved so much together and together we can get through this recession strongly, effectively and successfully and we can continue to be the brilliant, wonderful, successful nation that we all believe that we can be.</p>

 I will continue to do all I can to support the oil and gas industry in the North sea. I believe that the North sea has a big future not only with its continuing oil and gas industry, but as a world centre for carbon capture and storage. That is why the new investment is so essential. The field allowance has ensured that companies can continue to invest by removing the supplementary charge from up to &#163;75 million of their profits so that they qualify for the small field allowance. That is an important announcement, which will be welcome on both sides of the House.</p>

 Let us deal with the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s first point, about children and reading. Far more, and a far higher percentage of, children are able to read and write at 11 as a result of the decisions that we have taken as a Government. There are 30,000 children who now get personal tuition to be able to read, and another 30,000 who get personal tuition to be able to write. No Government have invested more in reading, literacy and counting for children, and we have doubled our expenditure on the education of every child over the past 10 years. Of course, there is a great deal more to do and, of course, we are worried about instances of children in care, where there has to be reform. But, we have doubled investment in education over 10 years. It could not have happened under a Liberal or Conservative Government.</p>

 It pains us all to have to look at the appalling failures that happened at Stafford hospital, but I hope that my hon.

 I met the nurses at the Christie hospital when I was in the north. I have also heard and answered questions in this House about it and written many letters to people, because I am worried about the situation, too. The fact is that we are not the regulatory authority and that many, many more people had finances in institutions regulated by the Icelandic authorities. The first responsibility is for the Icelandic authorities to pay up, which is why we are in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and other organisations about the rate at which Iceland can repay the losses that they are responsible for. However, we have also agreed that we will look at the particular case of the Christie and see what we can do to understand how we can meet its need.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="90506-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="09050661000671"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to regulate the recovery of the defaulted sovereign debt of developing countries; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09050661000161">This small Bill touches on some of the big issues of our times: the unbridled profiteering of some financial institutions; the pressing need for regulation of the excesses of those institutions; and the gulf between their massive wealth and the desperate poverty of millions of people in developing countries. The Bill aims to put some simple regulations in place to stem the worst of the abuses by the vulture funds that profiteer from the debts of some of the poorest people in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09050661000162">The economic crisis has already highlighted the flaws in the global financial system, which we all recognise is in need of reform. It has revealed widespread under-regulation of various financial market actors, including hedge funds and other investors. There is agreement across the House that regulation that is too &#147;light touch&#148; has not served us well, and that more controls are needed to ensure the standards of probity that we expect in the UK as a world centre for financial services. That includes the regulation of hedge funds, and just this week there have been proposals from Europe in that regard. This Bill, therefore, is being proposed against the background of the Government&#146;s commitment to act to regulate financial services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09050661000163">Another aspect of the background to the Bill is the Government&#146;s outstanding commitment to dealing with developing country debt, which is greatly undermined by the activities of the so-called vulture funds. The Bill is aimed directly at those companies and funds that buy up defaulted sovereign debt at highly discounted prices, then try to recover the full amount, plus costs and fees, through the courts&#151;often, unfortunately, through the UK courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09050661000164">The funds are often based in tax havens and are secretive, and it is the secrecy as well as the profiteering that this Bill seeks to address. One of the most notorious cases is that of Donegal International Ltd, which set its sights on Zambia. An excellent investigative report by the BBC&#146;s &#147;Newsnight&#148; programme revealed the full extent of the scandal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09050661000165">Zambia was provided with a loan to buy some tractors, but by the 1990s it was unable to pay the money back. The country was in the process of trying to find a settlement with the creditors for the debts, but the fund purchased the debt for the knockdown price of $3.3 million in 1999. It proceeded to pursue Zambia through the UK courts for the full amount of the debt, plus interest and fees, demanding an astonishing $55 million in total. The courts awarded a total of $15.5 million, more than five times what the fund had paid for the debt&#151;money that could have been used to train doctors, nurses and teachers, or to build hospitals. A big chunk of it, enough to pay for 30,000 primary school places,  ended up in the hands of a secretive, unaccountable private fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09050661000166">That is not an isolated case. A current example involves the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a company called FG Hemisphere, which has been awarded $100 million against an original claim of $44.1 million. In addition, Argentina is being pursued through the UK courts for $285 million. Such activity undermines UK and international efforts to reduce the unsustainable debts of developing countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09050661000167">Our Government have been at the forefront of driving through the cancellation of the debts of some of the poorest countries. We have contributed to the programme of debt reduction for 35 countries, 29 of them in Africa, providing a total of $51 billion in debt relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09050661000168">Debt relief and cancellation have allowed the release of funds for spending on social projects in the countries involved. Thousands of new schools and classrooms have been built as a result, and there has been investment in water systems, teachers, health care projects and many other programmes. Many of Zambia&#146;s creditors, including the UK, agreed to cancel their debts on the understanding that the funds would be used to reduce poverty among the very poor, and not to provide a huge and completely undeserved payday for the very rich.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09050661000169">Thanks to the Jubilee Debt Campaign and the &#147;Newsnight&#148; expos&#233;, some action was taken by the UK and other countries to reduce the risk of sovereign debts falling into the hands of vulture funds. Agreement was reached with the World Bank to help poor countries buy back their commercial debts at a discount. In addition, the board of the Africa Development Bank agreed to endorse the establishment of an independent legal support facility to advise countries on how best to tackle vulture fund activity. However, the global economic downturn has produced more debt problems in the developing world; hence the need for this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09050661000170">The Bill has four main provisions. First, it would stop the excessive profiteering by preventing financial institutions and companies from buying up developing countries&#146; debts at cut-rate prices, then suing the country&#146;s Government through the UK courts for the full original amount of the debt. The Bill would limit the maximum recovery amount to the sum paid by the financial institution, plus a simple rate of interest and charges specified in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09050661000171">Secondly, the Bill would introduce accountability. It makes provision for controls on recovery actions and introduces reporting requirements. The financial institutions&#151;the vultures&#151;would have to get permission from the UK courts before starting recovery proceedings in the UK for any amount of defaulted debt from a developing country. In addition, the vulture would have to ensure that a copy of the application went to the UK Government and to the UK representative of the developing country&#146;s Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09050661000172">Thirdly, the Bill would ensure greater transparency. It would shine a light on the vultures and require the financial institutions to disclose the beneficiaries of the recovery proceedings. It has been completely impossible to get information about this in the past. We have been unable to find out who has benefited from some of these huge undertakings involving recovery actions pursued through the UK courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09050661000173">Fourthly, the Bill would help to combat corruption. It contains anti-corruption measures that would require a vulture fund to declare any payments or gifts given by it or its colleagues to the developing country&#146;s Government.</p>

I would also like to thank the Jubilee Debt Campaign, which first brought this subject to light, and which has worked tirelessly to keep debt at the heart of the international debate on poverty and economic justice. I would also like to thank the Clerks in our Public Bill Office, who did a phenomenal job of drafting the Bill. Similar legislation is being introduced in the US Congress, and I hope that the special relationship that exists between our two countries will extend to dealing with this very unacceptable face of capitalism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09050661000175">Over the past months, we have all been appalled by some of the extraordinary greed of the financial sector&#151;Fred Goodwin&#146;s pension springs to mind, among other things&#151;but the impact of these vulture funds on developing countries is far worse than anything that we see here in the UK. About two thirds of Zambia&#146;s 12 million people live on less than $1 a day. They are truly the poor of this world. The amount of money that one single vulture fund tried to get from that country would have been enough to keep all those very poor people going for five days&#151;a full working week. That level of profiteering is well in excess of anything that we have seen in the UK, and it is wrong that this country, which has such a proud record on international aid and debt relief, should be used as a haven for secretive and exploitative funds operating without scrutiny or regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09050661000176">After I have presented the Bill today, we will be discussing in our debate on the Finance Bill the impact of the excesses of the banking system on our own economy.

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para25"><a name="09050661000185">This year&#146;s Finance Bill comes as the world economy is shrinking for the first time in peacetime since 1932. It is the first time ever that five of the biggest banks in the world have had to be rescued by their national Governments. That is the scale of the international challenge we are facing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para26"><a name="09050661000186">This Finance Bill provides for vital measures to support the economy this year and to help British families and businesses through the more difficult times. It also provides for help to support the long-term prosperity of Britain and to ensure that public finances are sustainable for the future. Those two objectives are fundamentally linked, but the main Opposition party, astonishingly, seems to oppose both of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90506-0004.htm_para27"><a name="09050661000187">If we do not take action now to get our economy moving and growing, it will cost us more in the long run. We need to take action now to support businesses and families to help them through the downturn. If we do not provide real help now, recession will last longer and run deeper, reducing the tax revenues we get from growing businesses. It will increase the amount we have to spend on unemployment and it will push our borrowing and our debt up higher and cost us all more in the long run. That is why the best way to get borrowing down in the future is to support growth in our economy now.</p>

<p><a name="st_o110"><a name="09050661000188"><a name="90506-0004.htm_spnew9"><a name="09050661000856"><b>Stewart Hosie (Dundee, East) (SNP):</b>
 I agree entirely, as I think that cutting budgets in the teeth of recession is very foolish and that fiscal stimulus is essential as monetary policy alone is not enough. Why, then, is the Chief Secretary cutting &#163;500 million from the Scottish budget next year, when everybody knows that the UK and the world economy will still be in recession? Why is her Government taking such a foolish measure, which runs against her own argument?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman knows that that is simply not the case. In fact, we are increasing the Scottish Executive&#146;s budget by more than &#163;2 billion over the next few years. We expect the Scottish Executive to make efficiency savings in 2010-11. Indeed, if the Scottish Executive set the same efficiency targets that Welsh, Northern Ireland and English departments have set&#151;of around 3 per cent., instead of the 2 per cent. set by the Scottish Executive&#151;the additional efficiency savings could be used to support the economy in Scotland as well as across the rest of the country.</p>

I repeat, however, that hon.

Of course it is also right to put money into public sector capital projects, and we are doing that as well, but the advantage of the VAT cut was that it was by far the fastest way of putting money into the economy to provide immediate support across the economy. Unfortunately, Conservative Members simply opposed the VAT cut, along with anything else involving additional investment or spending in the middle of a recession&#151;an economic policy that is not just bonkers but dangerous.</p>

We made a judgment, and the Chancellor made a judgment, about what time would be right, bearing in mind the scale and timing of the fiscal stimulus.

The measures that we are taking are supporting half a million jobs: half a million jobs that could be lost as a result of the approach the Conservatives have taken.

measures. My hon. Friend will know that some measures announced in last year&#146;s Budget that have been implemented this year also increase significantly child tax credit and lift children out of poverty. This year, as well as a limited increase in child tax credit, the particularly important issue is to ensure that parents can get back to work as rapidly as possible. We know that the big increase in child poverty in the 1980s was strongly linked to parents losing their jobs, and often to people never getting a job in the first place and then becoming parents having become long-term unemployed. That played a major part in that very substantial increase in child poverty. For those reasons, it is right to invest to help parents get back into work. The impact of the current recession on child poverty is uncertain. As my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has made clear, that makes it more difficult to make progress towards the 2010 target, but we are determined to continue to keep making progress and to work towards it even through these more difficult times.</p>

The Government have moved a little way with the field allowance in trying to encourage investment in very marginal fields. Why have they not gone further in recognising the banking crisis, the credit crunch problems and the cash-flow problems by examining the industry&#146;s request to bring forward tax relief early for new entrants who do not have income at the moment, in order to encourage them to invest? They are the lifeblood in respect of bringing that new oil and gas out of the ground, and without that there will not be the future revenues.</p>

The list includes the changes to tax relief on pensions for those on the very highest incomes and the national insurance changes.

As she is so interested in the Opposition&#146;s policies, let me tell her, for her information, that our priority will be cutting Labour&#146;s taxes on jobs&#151;the increase in national insurance contributions that will affect everybody who is earning more than &#163;20,000 a year.</p>

Last year, she told us that it was impossible to change the personal tax system and personal tax rates in-year, but when it became politically beneficial to do so, she found a way. She told us that the British economy was well placed to weather the global storms, that claimant count unemployment was at its lowest for 30 years and that the UK would be the fastest growing economy in the G7. It seems that hubris is capable of human to human transmission, at least in the closed confines of a political bunker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="90506-0006.htm_para11"><a name="09050661000279">The Chief Secretary also told the House last year that the Government were using the flexibility of the fiscal rules to borrow more in a sensible and sustainable way. What she did not say was that shortly after the Finance Bill became law, the Government would use the flexibility of the fiscal rules to abandon them altogether before they were comprehensively shattered by the growing crisis in the public finances that will be this Administration&#146;s legacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90506-0006.htm_para12"><a name="09050661000280">If we fast forward to this year, we may be making modest progress, because I do not think that I heard the Chief Secretary describing the &#163;175 billion that the Government will borrow this year and the &#163;173 billion  <br>

that they will borrow next year as sensible and sustainable. Last year it was the denial Budget&#151;no one would be worse off as a result of the abolition of the 10p tax rate&#151;and this year it is the distraction Budget, with a subliminal message that taxing the rich can resolve the gaping hole in the public finances as the Government desperately try to divert attention from the reality of the Chancellor&#146;s package. It is a reality of tax rises for the many not the few and of spending increases before an election to mask a programme of massive cuts afterwards. The Budget has a &#163;45 billion hidden tax bombshell aimed at the many and timed to go off after the general election that even this serially unelected Prime Minister will be forced to concede to the British people by this time next year. That is &#163;1,430 per family of extra annual taxes, and I confidently predict that he will not remind the public of that in the run-up to that election.</p>

This is a dishonest Budget that is all about protecting the jobs of the few on the Treasury Bench rather than the many in the British economy&#151;a crowd-pleasing, economy-damaging tax on the rich this side of an election, with a hidden tax bombshell targeted at the many timed to go off after an election.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman refers to public sector investment. As he will be aware, the level set out in the Budget is still twice that of public sector investment as a proportion of GDP in 1997, when we inherited it from his party.

 Let me deal first with the public sector investment. The right hon. Lady did not take the opportunity to confirm in her intervention that public sector investment as a percentage of GDP will halve. It will halve over the coming years&#151;I do not think that the Government have been shouting that from the rooftops. We believe that Crossrail is a good project. It fits very well with our agenda of improving rail infrastructure &#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> She sits there, chuntering about guaranteeing to support this project or that project. Do the Government have no conception of the scale of the hole that they have dug? Every single programme and project will have to be reassessed and re-evaluated. Each project will have to demonstrate its value for money and its effectiveness in an extraordinarily tight fiscal climate created by the disaster that the Government have visited on this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09050661000291">This year sees the continuation of the recent trend for the Budget to be increasingly disjoined from the Finance Bill that follows it. Annual taxes are announced years in advance, not for the purpose of providing greater forewarning and more stability and transparency in the system, but for pure political advantage. An early announcement by this Government does not mean greater certainty. Last November, the tax rate was to be 45p from 2011. By this April, it had become 50p from 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para2"><a name="09050661000292">This country&#146;s tax system is losing credibility and the process by which tax changes are made not in response to long-term economic challenges but in pursuit of short-term tactical political gain is causing immense damage to our international competitiveness. It all started with the pre-announcement of the abolition of the 10p rate and the reduction of the basic rate in the Prime Minister&#146;s last Budget as Chancellor in 2007. It accelerated with the disastrous pre-Budget report of October 2007, as we saw the first example of the now familiar phenomenon of the Prime Minister trying to head off a catastrophic loss of confidence in him on his own Benches. It continued with the 2008 Budget, with last year&#146;s pre-Budget report and now with this 2009 Budget.</p>

Will she clarify whether it is intended to be a permanent feature of the tax system or a temporary arrangement? The Chancellor said in his interview with the <i> Daily Mail </i>on 23 April&#151;it was a perfectly fair point&#151;that he would have to ask people on higher earnings</p>

Member for Kingston upon Hull, West and Hessle (Alan Johnson)? If the Chief Secretary cannot speak for them, would it be the policy of a Labour party led by her or by someone very close to her? If she cannot clarify that point now, perhaps the Financial Secretary can do so in the winding-up speech this evening. It is a very important point, which needs clarification.</p>

 Is not the logical conclusion that the range of measures to increase the top rate of tax means that the Government will eventually have to come back to the House early next year to reform capital gains tax, which is now very much out of kilter with the income tax rates? That is one reason why they will not collect the sort of money that they expect. People will avoid it and they will try to capitalise their incomes.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a good point. The Government have clearly already sought to close one of the most obvious loopholes to people who are subject to the higher rate of tax by restricting pension relief. Capital gains tax remains a potential loophole, however, and he might well be right that the Government, for all their silence on the issue now, will simply abandon any pretence of a low-tax competitive regime and will resort to higher tax rates in capital gains, too.</p>

The recession that is afflicting the economy will mercifully be behind us at some point, for the simple reason that the Prime Minister did not abolish boom and bust. The economic cycle, I am glad to say, survives and will eventually turn upwards, but the hole in our public finances will remain even if the economy bounces back in line with the most optimistic projections that we have heard. It is a structural deficit, which is the result of a Government recklessly living beyond their means since they started their 2001 general election campaign, repeatedly making promises to the electorate that the country could not afford. That is not even bribing people with their own money; it is bribing them with their children&#146;s and grandchildren&#146;s money.</p>

said before, I think the only cycle that the Prime Minister understands or is interested in is the political cycle, and our economy is being run with regard to the political cycle, not the economic cycle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09050661000301">The Chancellor, in his Budget, was therefore torn between a desire to hide from the electorate the scale of the adjustment that would be required until after one more election, and a desire to send a signal to the bond markets that would induce them to continue funding the Government&#146;s unprecedented borrowing requirement. So what we got was the usual fudge: optimistic growth projections that unravelled within minutes of the Budget and have been further undermined by the Office for National Statistics data published since, and tax increases for ordinary families now, but with much, much more to come after the election, starting with the tax on jobs that will hit everybody on &#163;20,000 a year or more in 2011, all under cover of the smoke generated by the 50p distraction tax &#147;on the rich&#148;, designed to fool the gullible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09050661000302">We also got a slashing of planned public expenditure growth. After allowing for the increased cost of servicing the huge pile of debt that this Government are building up, and of benefits for those joining the dole queue, there will be real-terms cuts equivalent to 2.3 per cent. in departmental expenditure totals. That is on top of the halving of capital expenditure budgets. It is an unprecedented scale of cuts in departmental expenditure. All this from a man who told us in 2005 that further efficiency savings were not possible, and that any reductions would necessarily involve cuts in front-line services. He was wrong then, and I suspect he would wish to argue now that he was wrong then. The fact is that a Government who said no further efficiency savings were possible subsequently claimed to have made &#163;26 billion-worth of efficiency savings, and to have identified a further &#163;15 billion-worth of efficiency savings. They have no credibility left on spending: no one believes a word they say any more.</p>

As a final insult from this Budget, if they go for a game of bingo at the end of the week to try to cheer themselves up, they see that &#163;105 million is being taken from bingo players.

 My hon. Friend is exactly right: it is a distraction Budget. What his constituents do not know, however, because understandably they have not sat and read the detail of the Budget Red Book, is that this is only the start. They will be hit by a further &#163;45 billion a year of taxes as the Chancellor struggles to close the gap that his disastrous policies and those of his predecessor have opened up. Even if we accept the highly optimistic assumptions about the pattern of tax receipts in the recovery, the Chancellor still acknowledges that it will be 2017 before the current Budget is back in balance, and 2032 before our debt is back under control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09050661000305">One clear victim of this Budget is the credibility of Treasury forecasting. The whole process is undermined if nobody, but nobody&#151;except the Chancellor&#151;believes the forecasts for growth and for tax revenues. The case for an independent office of budget responsibility was made by the Chancellor&#146;s Budget speech more effectively than any of its proponents could have hoped. No Chancellor in future should be able to build his Budget on foundations of sand&#151;to treat the Budget process as a political manoeuvre rather than an exercise in fiscal responsibility. We will attempt to insert into this Finance Bill provisions to ensure that before next year&#146;s Budget, a rigorous and independent approach to forecasting is established, ending the farce that we witnessed on Budget day, as the Budget growth projections unravelled before our very eyes, rendering the entire Budget Red Book almost immediately redundant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para10"><a name="09050661000306">I have some specific issues to raise on several clauses, but first I should like to set out three key themes linking our main criticism of the Bill: first, its failure to rise to the challenge of building the competitiveness of the UK as a place to do business in the recovery; secondly, its failure to support savers at a time when rebuilding the savings culture will be critical to Britain&#146;s future; and thirdly, its abject failure to balance the rights and responsibilities of taxpayers and the Revenue as it extends and expands Revenue powers. I shall elaborate on each.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09050661000307">Britain is in the depths of the worst recession since the second world war. Unemployment is rising at the fastest rate since records began and the public finances are set next year for a bigger deficit than that of any other G20 country. But even in these circumstances, this should have been a Finance Bill for the recovery. We do not know when it will come, but we need to be sending powerful signals to business about the tax landscape in the UK in the future, to ensure the investment and the jobs that Britain will need when Labour&#146;s recession is over.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09050661000308">Rebuilding Britain&#146;s competitiveness should be the key focus of this Bill&#151;and, of course, competitiveness requires a regime that ensures fiscal discipline in the future as the bedrock on which a strong economy can be built. It also means addressing the long-standing challenges that Britain faces in productivity, infrastructure and skills. It means modernising Britain&#146;s public services and its welfare system, but it also means ensuring a competitive tax system. That is not just about the quantity of tax, important as that is. Business understands that the disastrous fiscal position that the country faces means that there is no immediate prospect of moderating the overall tax burden, but powerful, revenue-neutral signals can still be sent, even at a time of intense fiscal pressure. The nature of the tax code, the certainty of its impact, the manner of its making and the clarity of its future direction all contribute to tax competitiveness.</p>

tax levels with the uncertainty, arbitrariness and unpredictability more usually associated with the tax regimes in developing economies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para14"><a name="09050661000310">Ten years ago, the Prime Minister set out his three principles for the UK&#146;s tax system: simplicity, fairness and competitiveness&#151;a long-term, strategic approach to business taxation. However, what we have had in the last few Budgets is the very opposite: a shambles of initiatives, often half-baked, often unworkable and often reversed during the legislative process or thereafter, some of them&#151;the 2007 pre-Budget report springs to mind&#151;literally put together on the back of a fag packet in response to immediate political pressures. We have seen the abolition of the 10p tax rate, the fiasco of the non-dom tax charge and the disaster of the capital gains tax taper relief abolition&#151;and the pattern continues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para15"><a name="09050661000311">If we cannot reduce the tax burden on business, we have to redouble our efforts to reduce the compliance burden to maintain Britain&#146;s global competitiveness. Sadly, the Bill is a missed opportunity, at a crucial moment in our economic history, to send those powerful positive signals. It will further erode Britain&#146;s standing as a stable, predictable and business-friendly jurisdiction in which to operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para16"><a name="09050661000312">I now turn to the second theme, pensions and savings. The economy that will rise from the ashes of this recession will differ in shape and structure from the pre-August 2007 economy. It will be built on equity, not debt. It will depend on our savings ratio, not our borrowing capacity. The Prime Minister appeared to understand that important shift. As recently as last month, he was hinting in radio interviews that he would do something for savers in the Budget. What we got was a limited, complex change to the individual savings account regime that the industry has condemned as burdensome and confusing, and some very ambiguous signals on pensions that will further undermine long-term saving; I will return to those in a moment, when I address some specific provisions of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para17"><a name="09050661000313">There was nothing in the Budget to match the Leader of the Opposition&#146;s bold proposal for this year&#146;s Budget. He proposed the abolition of income tax on savings income for basic-rate taxpayers, and an immediate increase in the pensioner tax-free allowance of &#163;2,000 a year&#151;all funded by advancing to the current year the introduction of the efficiency savings that, in the pre-Budget report, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury announced that she had identified, although apparently she could not bring herself to deliver them until after a general election. Let me be clear: it is not a fiscal tightening to take taxpayers&#146; money back out of the pocket of Government, and redistribute it to hard-pressed taxpayers with a high propensity to spend&#151;people, in particular pensioners, whose savings income has been very much squeezed, in some cases leaving them almost at the point of destitution. On that second count, the Bill fails miserably to rise to the challenge of shaping and building the new economy based on savings and equity, not mountains of excessive debt and easy credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90506-0007.htm_para18"><a name="09050661000314">Thirdly, the Finance Bill advances still further the Government&#146;s agenda of enhanced powers and increased discretion for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs.

In clause 91, it becomes an HMRC charter&#151;nothing much more than a mission statement prepared and delivered by HMRC, setting out its aspirations.

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. The view of some independent experts is that the new top rate of tax may raise significantly less than the Chancellor predicted, having used the static model that is used to produce the Red Book&#146;s projections. There was no taking account of behavioural impacts; it was assumed that the very high-rate taxpayers, who are probably very mobile in many cases, would simply leave their affairs as they were, and would not consider relocating away from the United Kingdom, so I share some of my hon.

the Government&#146;s response is to the concerns raised about the trust tax rate? In aligning the trust tax rate with the new, higher 50p rate, HMRC made the assumption that all beneficiaries of trusts are people who are likely to be subject to the top rate of income tax. That is simply not the case. Although it may have been a broadly reasonable assumption when the top rate of tax was 40 per cent., it is an unreasonable assumption when the top rate of tax affects only those people with an income of more than &#163;150,000.</p>

During the Bill&#146;s Committee stage, we shall attempt to force the Government again at least to consider and evaluate a smart alcohol taxation regime, focusing on the greatest burden associated with problem drinking, such as alcopops, high-strength beers and ciders, and using the proceeds to reduce duties&#151;<i> [Interruption]. </i>I appreciate that the hon.

That is an example of how proper consultation and debate between business and Government can deliver what this country needs both to make its tax regime competitive and effective and to allow us to maintain our prosperity in a globalising market economy.</p>

In future, Government should tell business well in advance&#151;at least at the pre-Budget report preceding a Finance Bill&#151;the outcome that they require of a measure. However, the Government should not be prescriptive about how the measure is delivered; they should sit down with business to establish the best, least damaging and most competitiveness-enhancing&#151;if I can say that&#151;way of achieving their objective.</p>

I have already acknowledged the Government&#146;s concern that the 50 per cent. rate of tax makes pension tax relief an obvious route for legal avoidance; that is why they have sought to limit the availability of tax relief to the highest earners. But why on earth did they not do that in the simple and obvious way&#151;albeit one that would also have breached the A-day commitments&#151;of changing the maximum contribution limits under the A-day regime?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90506-0009.htm_para2"><a name="09050661000357">How can it be fair or reasonable that, under the regime proposed by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, someone earning &#163;150,000 can get 40 per cent. relief on a &#163;100,000 pension contribution&#151;that is, &#163;40,000 of relief from the Exchequer&#151;but someone earning &#163;200,000, and contributing only &#163;20,000 to a pension fund, is limited to 20 per cent. relief? That perverse outcome risks sending a signal of instability and unreliability throughout the pension regime. It risks a disengagement of top earners from company pension schemes that also benefit tens or hundreds of thousands of lower-paid workers. I am not convinced that disengaging top executives from pension schemes that benefit the many is the best way to protect those schemes.</p>

Will the value of that contribution be added to gross salary for the purpose of calculating the &#163;150,000 threshold? Take as an example a senior civil servant on &#163;120,000&#151;actually, they might be a middle-ranking civil servant on that salary these days.

Does that not betray a certain mentality in Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs&#151;that the people to be looked after are those in the pay-as-you-earn system in 9 to 5 jobs? Does it not betray a woeful failure to understand the lives and lifestyles of the self employed, those who have irregular incomes and people whose incomes depend on the success of the small businesses that they run? Such people are typically advised to make annual or semi-annual contributions to their pension funds, but they will be excluded from making their usual contributions under the arrangements that the Financial Secretary has set out. This may be another case of HMRC having pulled the wool over Ministers&#146; eyes. Will the Financial Secretary consider the matter urgently and give an assurance tonight that he will ensure that those who have made regular contributions in the past&#151;even if they have not been as frequent as quarterly contributions&#151;will not be inadvertently caught by the anti-forestalling measures?</p>

It is not too late; substantial&#151;one might even say fundamental&#151;changes have been made in previous Finance Bills as a result of parliamentary pressure and belated attention to outside experts.

To do that, we need continuity, simplicity, fairness, transparency and certainty in our tax regime. The Bill does not achieve that, and this Labour lot cannot achieve it.

Finally, the pre-Budget report was replaced by the Budget itself. As Members have already made plain, some of the assumptions that underpinned the Budget did not even last for 24 hours. I question whether it is safe for the country, and therefore proper for this House, to continue a debate on the Budget that does not have a plan B ready to implement should the Government&#146;s trust in the debt market not be fulfilled.</p>

I raised the issue because on three occasions the Debt Management Office has had difficulties in placing a week&#146;s debt. Given that, as a country, we are attempting to float debt of an unprecedented size, it would be extraordinary if that did not affect long-term interest rates and therefore the long-term recovery that we so desperately want in our economy.

Then, some of our allies, particularly Canada, gave us huge sums of money, and others lent us huge sums; they all had surpluses and were keen to lend to us. But now, all of the Group of Eight countries are hoovering the markets to raise money to cover their debts. We are not the only country doing this, and lending to us may not be seen as the most favourable option by people who have money to lend. It is wrong to assume that because we have done this before in wartime, we will somehow be able to do it now. We have to take the view that several major economies are now in the same boat, and it seems reasonable to assume that over time it will get more difficult, not less difficult, to cover that debt.</p>

What would happen to sterling on the markets the next day? It would collapse, and then what would happen to the well-being and the living standards of our constituents? That is too terrible to contemplate. That is why I tabled an amendment, supported by the Liberal Democrats&#151;I assume, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that we will not get a chance to vote for it&#151;proposing that, given the paralysis on the part of those on the Treasury Bench and on the official Opposition Front Bench, this House should play some part in seriously discussing how we can bring our tax revenue and our expenditure into balance.</p>

They assume that by 2012-13 we will all be singing and dancing, and the economy will be back in growth again. Even in those circumstances&#151;again, let us hope that the assumptions are correct&#151;we expect to raise, as a proportion of GDP, a little less than 38 per cent. in tax, but we will still be spending 41 per cent. Today the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has suggested that those figures will not hold&#151;they will crumble&#151;and that in 2012 expenditure will be 48 per cent. of GDP. That means that in each week of that year we will try to offload on to the debt market shed-loads of debt the like of which we have never tried to get buyers for before. We can put our heads in the sand and pretend that we might get through with a bit of luck, or we could, as a House, decide that given the failure of those on the Treasury Bench and of the official Opposition, we should take some hand in planning how we are to try to achieve a greater balance between tax revenue and expenditure.</p>

If we started to discuss options rationally, not in a crisis where we have to slash and burn the night before the markets open the next day, we could seriously consider what this country does in supporting pensions. We could have a reform that says that we will put ourselves on track to abolish pensioner poverty.

 Absolutely, and of course that will be a start, but important though our budget is to taxpayers at the moment, it is small compared with the budget that we will be paying out mid-century&#151;&#163;90 billion, unless we make changes. We could just say in a rough and ready way that we are closing schemes, or we could have serious pension reform and consider that the only task of Government is to get a scheme that takes everybody out of poverty in old age providing that they have been decent citizens. We could then say to people, &#147;It is being closed, but nobody will be pushed into poverty as a result. What you add on top is your concern, not ours. We are not even going to lecture you about it, and we are certainly not going to bribe you to do it.&#148;</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to our deliberations this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="90506-0009.htm_para16"><a name="09050661000385">The Budget that gave rise to this Finance Bill was a total humiliation for the Prime Minister himself and for the Labour party generally. The reputation of the former has been destroyed for ever, and the reputation of the latter for at least a generation, and possibly irredeemably. Their self-imposed destruction does not concern me, as they are the architects of their own misfortune and eventual downfall, but what does concern me is the catastrophic impact that this Budget and this Bill will have on our country both financially and socially for many decades to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="90506-0009.htm_para17"><a name="09050661000386">The context of all our deliberations is debt. That point was made by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), and is made in the amendment that he, my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) and I tabled, and I shall turn to it repeatedly throughout my contribution. I wish to examine what the Government are going to do, and the suggestions being put forward by the other parties to try to tackle that huge burden. The scrappage scheme, the increased alcohol duty and the manifesto-shredding, aspiration-capping 50p income tax rate are all brought about by the need to address our huge public debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="90506-0009.htm_para18"><a name="09050661000387">The Government of this country are now borrowing &#163;480 million every day. We are borrowing &#163;20 million an hour. Our national debt increased by &#163;12 million during the time that the Chief Secretary took to make her speech opening this debate. I am afraid that it went up by another &#163;21 million while the Conservative spokesman was talking, which makes the rate charged by the Conservative shadow Foreign Secretary seem positively mean-spirited. I shall try to boil those numbers down to understandable levels, because people trade tens of billions as though it were small change. Our debt is clocking up another &#163;1 million every three minutes, and it is a serious and frightening problem. It will rise by &#163;175 billion this year, &#163;173 billion next year and &#163;140 billion the year after that. When the Prime Minister delivered his first Budget as Chancellor in 1997, almost exactly 12 years ago, total Government spending was &#163;322 billion. Now the debt increase alone for the next two years will be &#163;348 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="90506-0009.htm_para19"><a name="09050661000388">The Prime Minister used to boast about the golden rule of keeping total debt below 40 per cent. of GDP. Now, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, we will not get down to that proportion until I am 62 years old, and I am 38 at the moment. I was going to say that that would be the rest of my working life&#151;but by the time I get to that age we will had to respond by increasing the retirement age significantly. All those assumptions are desperately bleak, but they are, simultaneously, heroic in their optimism.</p>

The bank will lend even with quite bleak forecasts, but it will not continue to lend to someone who has given forecasts that turn out to be completely and utterly wrong, because that undermines the confidence of those doing the lending.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, because the predictions are both bleak and optimistic at the same time. The Chancellor tells us that the economy will grow by 3.5 per cent. in 2011 and the same in all subsequent years. He had better be right&#151;but I am afraid that the Government&#146;s track record of predicting economic growth is hardly encouraging.</p>

His predictions in 2007 were the least accurate forecast that this country has seen since the day before southern England was flattened by a terrible storm, when Michael Fish said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90506-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09050661000393">My fear is that the Chancellor has retro-fitted his entire Budget assumptions.

We have to hope the figures are more reliable than that. Whether or not that is included, we must hope that those predictions come true, but the omens are not auspicious.

 I am all in favour of reliable official data, which are the backdrop against which we have to make all our calculations. My fear about the Conservative policy, as I understand it, is that a Government are elected to deliver their policies. Advisers advise, Ministers decide, as a former Conservative Minister once said. I would not want to see an elected Chancellor hamstrung by officials. The hon. Gentleman may say that that is not a potential consequence of his policy, and I hope that it would not be, but if an elected politician were not able to do what he or she saw fit, even with the assent of the House, because of obstacles put in their way by a quango, that would cause me concern.</p>

 Absolutely. Let us not get too hung up on this issue, but I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. There are potential benefits and lessons that we could learn, although all political systems are different. The Treasury Secretary is not an elected politician in the United States&#151;indeed, nobody in the United States Cabinet is, apart from the President and the vice-president&#151;but I understand the hon.

The question then arises whether any other political parties have solutions and policies superior to those being put forward by the Government.

What the Conservatives said was predicated on the assumption that growth would be permanent. In the debate on the Finance Bill exactly a year ago, I warned the Conservatives of the folly of matching Labour&#146;s spending commitments. I said that simply, clearly and in black and white. I was ignored on that occasion, and told that it was an article of faith for the Conservatives to stick to the Labour party&#146;s spending commitments, but then, a few months ago, they came up with exactly the opposite policy, having heeded my warning.</p>

It is not good enough for either the SNP or the Conservative party to come up with a few little, piecemeal measures&#151;the scale of the problem is far more substantial.

 I am grateful to you, Madam Deputy Speaker. As I understand it, the Government have introduced the new tax measures&#151;the 50p top rate of income tax, the abolition of pension relief for high earners and a whole raft of other measures&#151;because of the catastrophic borrowing figures. I have been asked by MPs of all parties what we can do to make those figures less catastrophic. I do not wish to challenge anyone&#146;s authority, but that seems to me to be entirely central to the Bill. The right hon.

Can we afford to continue paying tax credits to people earning far higher than average wages? The Government obviously think that we can, otherwise that policy would change.

our tax system needs to incorporate greater fairness and greater incentives to work. Labour&#146;s recession cannot be used as an excuse to avoid helping low and middle-income earners to make work pay. One of the worst features of the Budget and the Finance Bill is the impact they will have on people on relatively modest incomes. That is why the starting threshold of about &#163;6,000 for income tax is too low&#151;it should be &#163;10,000 a year. We need to come up with ways of rebalancing the tax system that are more ambitious than those in the Budget, in order to give people on low and middle incomes greater opportunities to keep a higher proportion of their household income, and greater incentives to work.</p>

 I am not sure that we would get progressive politics from a Liberal Democrat party that seems intent on massively shrinking the state. Nevertheless, it is important to debate the size of the state, as we did in the Budget debate and as we are doing on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, and the kind of things that it provides using taxpayers&#146; money, and that it does not provide, and how it pays for those things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90506-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09050661000471">Let me draw on my own past by way of illustration. In my early 20s, I spent several years as a truck driver and a bus driver. Thanks to a strong trade union, the Amalgamated Transit Union, in which I was actively involved when I lived in Canada&#151;I continue to be a member of the Transport and General Workers Union and now Unite&#151;we were the second highest-paid bus drivers in the world. In the early 1980s, I was taking home &#163;10,000 a year. I saved a lot of that money, and I went to the Birmingham polytechnic, as it was then called, to study law. I had two years&#146; study at the polytechnic, followed by two years as what was then called an articled clerk. After I qualified, I was a moderately low-paid solicitor before working my way up into partnership. So it probably took me over 10 years to get back to the economic position that I would have been in had I continued as a bus driver throughout that time. But I did get ahead, so that is an anecdote about investing for the future. I think that that is what we and this Government are faced with. Frankly, if the Conservatives were to win the next general election, they would also be faced with the issue of what the state does for the people who live within its borders, first to invest for their futures, and secondly to assist individual residents in investing for their own futures.</p>

I think we have to be careful about the way in which we use and interpret that phrase. I have to say that I never understood or interpreted the Prime Minister, as he now is, to be saying that through the economic policies of a Labour Government in one country among hundreds, we could abolish the cyclical nature of capitalism. Whether or not one accepts Kondratiev&#146;s long waves of about 40 years or alternative models, it is clear that capitalism for the last 250 years, in its fairly modern incarnation, we might say, has always been cyclical.</p>

I think that this Government did a pretty good job of that. We did not have a boom and we avoided the two recessions in the early part of the previous century that were evident, for example, in the USA. We were not booming in the way China or India have been, with 10 per cent. growth.

They cannot do that by means of efficiency savings, which is another of the terms that we like to bandy around. I was astounded when the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge belaboured my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary with the question &#147;Why do you not bring the efficiency savings forward to this year?&#148; That is like saying &#147;Instead of buying a new car next year, why do you not buy one this year?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90506-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09050661000482">Efficiency savings are not like that, particularly in large organisations. I should have thought that the Conservatives would understand that, given that they are constantly trying to impress on the House how much they know about running organisations. They overlook the fact that some Labour Members have also had significant experience in the private sector and in large organisations. Efficiency savings almost always mean changing the ways in which in which individual human beings work, whether it involves different equipment, different work-flow patterns or anything else. Those things take time. It is not possible to say &#147;We will do them tomorrow, because it is convenient and we will save money.&#148; Life is not like that.</p>

Another contradiction&#151;of course, we also see it in the other parties; I learnt years ago that all of us, as human beings, have a great capacity to live with huge contradictions in our personal lives and political beliefs&#151;is that Conservative Back Benchers are standing up and asking for measures that would cost a Government money. Dealing with child poverty and increasing spending on international development are laudable activities, but they cost money.</p>

I think that that is a huge contradiction, which needs to be resolved in the Conservative party before it is fit to run the country.</p>

 The situation is even worse than that. Where the Conservatives are in opposition at council level, they also come up with all kinds of uncosted items requiring additional spending.

 I agree. I am somewhat surprised to agree with a Liberal Democrat about council spending. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that in May 2008, sadly, a Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition took control of the council in my natal city, Wolverhampton&#151;the city in which I live, and which I represent&#151;and what is it doing? It is cutting all kinds of things all over the place. It is making millions of pounds of cuts. When either the Liberal Democrats or the Conservatives were in opposition, however, they decried Labour for not spending more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para0"><a name="09050661000487">That is what happens when a Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition takes control: big cuts are made. I am talking about what happens at the micro level, of course. You will know about it, Madam Deputy Speaker, because you represent an area close to Wolverhampton. That is what happens, and it is what I think would happen if we had a Conservative majority Government after the next general election. What I am saying is not simply conjecture. It is to do with what has been said about the Budget, what has been said about the taxation measures in the Finance Bill, and what is being done in my home town.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09050661000488">I do, however, agree with a critique of this Finance Bill which has applied to many other Finance Bills. I say that as one who, as some Members know, has had the great pleasure of being a member of six Finance Bill Standing Committees over the years. It is true that we have experienced too many tax changes&#151;not just under the present Government, although they have probably accelerated the process&#151;and our tax regime is too complicated. Part of the reason for its being too complicated is the fact that the rich keep paying accountants to come up with loopholes that they can then exploit, quite legitimately&#151;if, to my mind, often immorally. Those loopholes have to be closed, and the more that are closed, the more complicated are the avoidance schemes that the well-paid accountants come up with. More complicated measures are then needed to close the additional loopholes. The cycle goes on, and the tax books and the tax legislation become thicker and thicker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09050661000489">I think that there is more than a grain of truth in the critique that there is too much chopping and changing and the regime is too complicated. I am saying that to my own Government. However, this year&#146;s Finance Bill confronts me with a measure that attempts to implement a difficult Budget which was introduced in extremely difficult times. The background to that is the fact that, as I understand it, the accumulated national debt of the United Kingdom doubled between 1992 and 1997, under the last Conservative Government, and under the present Government&#151;my Government&#151;the accumulated national debt will double over the next five years. We have paid off some of it, and the economic expansion took care of some of it, but we are now proposing to double it so that, in round terms, the accumulated national debt will reach an amount equivalent to 80 per cent. of gross domestic product.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09050661000490">There is no doubt that that is a huge increase. No Labour Member has any illusions on that score. We all know that it will be very difficult for our society and very difficult for our economy. However, I think that we also need some figures with which to compare it&#151;the figures for the accumulated national debts of our main competitor economies. I refer not simply to economic  <br>

competition, but to building the kind of societies in which I think many of us throughout the House would wish to live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09050661000491">When it entered the current world recession, Italy&#146;s accumulated national debt&#151;I must confess that I have been to Italy only once, for a long weekend in Milan, which was very enjoyable; I am not a Chiantishire type&#151;was more than 80 per cent. of GDP, while ours, in round terms, was in the low 40s. I put it in that way because, first, I do not know the exact figure, and secondly it is very difficult to obtain the exact figure. As Members will know, I believe that PFI contracts should be included in the national debt, and I think that there is consensus on the fact that our accumulated national debt was in the low 40s as a percentage of GDP if the Government&#146;s PFI liabilities were included. If we double a percentage in the low 40s, we reach 80 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09050661000492">Again, in round terms&#151;I speak from memory, and I stand to be corrected&#151;the accumulated national debts of both France and Germany were around 60 per cent. of GDP. It is more difficult for me to get a handle on the accumulated national debt of the United States, because it has 51 jurisdictions with tax-raising powers&#151;50 states and one federal Government in the district of Columbia&#151;but I estimate it at 60 per cent.-plus. There are many different ways of calculating the amount: it will depend on whether local government borrowing is included, for instance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09050661000493">The percentage in my beloved Canada was far lower, although that, too, is slightly difficult to get a handle on, because Canada has about 13 tax jurisdictions. The low figure is due to a liberal Government, not a conservative Government. They are engaging in deficit financing and fiscal expansion, albeit from a much better position in terms of accumulated national debt. The percentage in Japan was far higher. Someone may know the exact figure, but I believe it to have been about 90 per cent., if not more. It may even have been more than 100 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para7"><a name="09050661000494">So where is our country going to be in five years&#146; time if the Chancellor&#146;s figures pan out? I appreciate that that is a big &#147;if&#148;; people have said that, and I agree with them. We are trying to look five years down the road and no one has a crystal ball, because if they did they would make a fortune at the race track&#151;and I do not think the Chancellor of the Exchequer has done that. We expect to have about 80 per cent. of GDP in accumulated national debt. That is a big burden, but its order of magnitude is lower than the likely figures for all our G7 competitors except Canada. In comparative terms, therefore, I am somewhat less concerned than I might otherwise be about the accumulated national debt.</p>

 As always, what the hon. Gentleman is saying is very thoughtful. He is focusing on the national debt and comparisons with competitor countries, but does he not recognise that it is not simply the debt level that is important? The US dollar is a reserve currency, and that changes the dynamics, as does the fact that other countries have balance of trade surpluses. Is it not the case that there was a combination of circumstances in the UK that made going into this recession particularly difficult for us, such as our very high debt levels and massive balance of trade deficit, and the fact that sterling is not a reserve currency?</p>

 I am not as expert on the trade deficit as the hon. Gentleman; he takes a greater interest in finance matters than I do&#151;although, as he knows, I do take quite a bit of interest in them. The UK balance of trade deficit has been worrying under Governments of different political colours ever since I studied for an economics A-level in the early 1970s. The balance of payments has been less worrying, partly because of the&#151;arguably overblown, particularly in recent years&#151;finance sector in the UK, and also because of other invisibles such as those to do with my profession of law. He is right that the balance of payments was a factor to take into account going into this recession, but&#151;through choice, not fortune&#151;the UK is not part of Europe in respect of its currency, and there has been a fairly significant devaluation of sterling in the last nine months. That is, of course, partly a reflection on our economy, but partly not; it is also partly a result of whim and speculation, and sterling has recovered a little recently. There is a small safety valve in this, however, although it was vastly overdone by Governments in the &#146;70s and &#146;80s.</p>

 The balance of trade deficit for the last two years was &#163;46 billion and &#163;44 billion, so it was basically unchanged even without the devaluation. It is forecast to be &#163;49 billion next year, and the balance of trade deficit in goods is forecast to be in excess of &#163;90 billion, so although there is a safety valve, it might not be all that the hon. Gentleman is imagining it to be.</p>

 I will not go down this track much further, because if I did we would stray far from the Second Reading of the Finance Bill. I simply say, as an MP representing a west midlands constituency, that if our Government and society were able to do more for manufacturing, that would address some of the trade issues to which the hon. Gentleman refers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para8"><a name="09050661000499">I support Keynesian counter-cyclical spending&#151;and we are getting that big-time in this Budget and Finance Bill, with their tax measures&#151;because at the end of the day this issue is all about people&#146;s lives. I am not talking about the general well-being index; this is about jobs, homes, families and people&#146;s feelings of security. I have talked about different courses of action. Do I think that 24 years from now&#151;or when the hon. Member for Taunton is 62 years of age, as he said&#151;our society and our people&#146;s well-being will be better than they would have been if we had slashed Government spending, delayed the economic recovery and left people, particularly those who are most vulnerable, without the services they need? I referred to crystal balls earlier. I do not have a crystal ball, but we need to have a sense of history. With the notable exception of Germany, most western Governments did not pursue counter-cyclical spending in the dirty &#146;30s, and we know where that approach led. This is a gamble, but, particularly in terms of vulnerable people&#146;s lives, I think the Government are absolutely right to engage in counter-cyclical spending in order to maintain services, invest for the future and build for tomorrow. This Budget and this Finance Bill are good steps in that direction.</p>

 The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) made a very thoughtful speech, even if I did not agree with all, or indeed, much of it. The answer to the central point  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="6 May 2009">

<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>6 May 2009 : Column 225</b><br>
that he makes is that very high levels of deficit and, indeed, very high levels of public spending, are probably unsustainable in the long run. There is no way of getting around that, and those things have had to be addressed. That is the central issue that we are debating today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para9"><a name="09050661000501">Everyone is agreed that the country is in a huge financial and fiscal mess. The question is whether Labour should be entrusted to clean it up after the next election or whether the Conservatives will be. That is really what the Budget and the Finance Bill are all about, and they will be judged on that basis. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who is no longer in her place, suggested that no policy but the Government&#146;s could be followed. Her speech sounded more like that of an Opposition spokesman than that of a senior Minister; it was, as one Member put it, something of a rant. However, I shall briefly respond, in general terms, to some of the sense of her points about how the Conservatives should, as I hope they would, address the key issue: public expenditure control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09050661000502">My view, which I am confident is that of my party, is that we have to bring public expenditure back under control if Britain is to avoid relegation to second or third division status as a country. The reasons for that are obvious: we cannot hope to be a leading economy while we are saddled with such huge public debt and the cost of servicing it. While our deficit is so large we are vulnerable to the markets, which may demand a premium to service that debt. The relationship between the debt and the very large deficit is crucial. We cannot remain globally competitive with such high taxes and spending as a proportion of gross domestic product in the long run.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09050661000503">Restraining public expenditure will be tough&#151;some are already suggesting that it is too difficult&#151;but is has to be done, and it can and has been done. In the 1980s, I worked for more than four years on public expenditure control and saw how it was done. It will mean the same things this time as we had last time: a very tight envelope set by the Cabinet at the beginning of a spending round; a return to Star Chambers and, probably, to annual rounds; and a change in the mindset of Whitehall, which has been encouraged to abandon a valuable and difficult-to-construct culture of thrift&#151;sadly, that went with the attempt just a few years ago to get Departments to spend money and to castigate Departments that ended up failing to get rid of their annual quota.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09050661000504">Getting public expenditure under control will also require an enormous amount of determination and will from both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor&#151;whoever wins the next election. Are the Conservative leadership up to it? I believe that they are, and there is some evidence to support my view. First, last November, when the fashionable mantra, followed by the Government, was for a further large fiscal boost on top of the automatic stabilisers, the Leader of the Opposition stood out against it. He said what we all know in our hearts: that we cannot carry on racking up debts indefinitely. It was a courageous economic and political judgment that he made, and it looks now as if he will be proved right. I do not rule out in all circumstances the need for a fiscal stimulus, in addition to the stabilisers that are already working, but the right circumstances are not in place at the moment and the G20 was right to thwart the Prime Minister&#146;s attempt to obtain one at this time.</p>

He has described it as nothing less than a period of austerity. We did not hear any of that from the Treasury today. When the forces demanding more spending appear so remorseless, that takes considerable guts. We will do that&#151;indeed, we are already doing so&#151;because it is the right thing to do. It is the start of a crucial period in which the electorate will adapt to a more trustworthy and direct style of politics, and to the reality that public expenditure control will not be easy.</p>

We have said that we will get rid of ID cards and abandon big IT projects such as the NHS IT scheme. As the hon.

I have said that the Conservative leadership is up to the challenge and has been frank about it. Are the Labour Government up to it?</p>

He considers himself to be an economist, and he is certainly an intelligent man, but I have worried for a long time that some of his remarks on the economy suggest that he is a little detached from reality.

The Prime Minister, then Chancellor, was saying in effect that he was the man for the hour&#151;he was John Maynard Keynes, Harry Dexter White, FDR and Churchill rolled into one. In the same way as the allied powers set out to prepare the Bretton Woods system, so he had set out in 1997 to reconstruct the global economic architecture. There is no little hubris  <br>

The origins lie at the heart of new Labour and its rhetoric and at the translation of this rhetoric into a policy that, in a succession of big spending Budgets starting in 2000, has left the public finances in a parlous state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90506-0012.htm_para25"><a name="09050661000527">It should be recalled that new Labour won the public&#146;s confidence in 1997 by promising the country that it would honour Conservative spending plans. That was the origin of &#147;prudence with a purpose&#148;. Of course, it was in 2000 that Labour felt finally able to be released from those shackles. The then Chancellor initiated what I think&#151;although I might be contradicted by the Financial Secretary&#151;was the biggest sustained spending binge in peacetime. Public expenditure has risen by a little under 50 per cent. over that period.</p>

The Government are still, if the truth be told, in a state of denial about the scale of that needed squeeze and its origins. When, only a few days ago in the Treasury Committee, I asked the Chancellor whether he could confirm that the Red Book announces Labour plans to cut public expenditure in real terms, he seemed in a state of denial about it. He would not answer the question. But the Red Book does indeed confirm real-terms cuts in public expenditure over the planning period if Labour is elected. Still, the Red Book fails to provide the information directly; it requires quite a bit of addition to obtain the total managed expenditure line for the forward years, but it is in the Red Book.

Those empty bars represent a series of spending measures&#151;possibly&#151;or tax rises that are required to balance the cyclically adjusted current Budget, which the Government are not prepared to talk about or provide any flesh for.

That is quite simply because Labour ran a huge deficit through the boom phase of the cycle. That makes the bust far more painful than it need have been. That is the grim reality behind another statistic, hidden in the Red Book, about which there has already been quite a bit of debate this afternoon: nearly 80 per cent. of the deficit is structural, according to the Government&#146;s own figures. That is to say, on the Government&#146;s own estimate, as the economy recovers, only 20 per cent. of the deficit will be filled as spare capacity in the economy is taken up. The remainder will have to be accounted for by measures that the Government put in place, and which have turned out, over the cycle, to be unaffordable.</p>

 It is instructive to go back to the debate on the Finance Bill last year.

The Chancellor actually had to borrow &#163;90 billion. They forecast a national debt approaching &#163;600 billion. The forecast now is for &#163;1.6 trillion. They reported public finance initiative liabilities to 2030-32 of &#163;189 billion. That figure is now &#163;200 billion. They reported a colossal &#163;87 billion deficit in the trade in goods. That is now rising to a &#163;93 billion deficit in the trade in goods. Even with sterling weakened&#151;15 per cent. down against the euro and 25 per cent. down against the dollar since last summer&#151;the overall balance of trade deficit remains at &#163;44 billion, unchanged from the year before, and is forecast to rise by 10 per cent. to &#163;49.5 billion in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90506-0013.htm_para9"><a name="09050661000543">Those forecasts did not inform the Finance Bill. Since the pre-Budget report last winter, we have found out that the Government were out by &#163;12 billion on last year&#146;s borrowing, out by &#163;140 billion on the three-year borrowing forecast, and out by &#163;400 billion on the medium-term national debt forecast in five months. That is an extraordinary set of figures. It is clear that there is likely to be a glaring black hole in the public accounts, not least because the revenue yield, which is intended to fund, at least in part, some of the spending commitments in the Finance Bill, is based on growth forecasts believed by no one, except, perhaps, members of the Treasury ministerial team&#151;and I am not sure whether even the more sensible Ministers in the Treasury team take the prediction of 3.5 per cent. seriously.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern, which I raised with my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), that the Government, as the hon.

If the growth is not that great, a sensitivity analysis would show that tax revenues will drop. If tax revenues drop because the Government do not achieve their growth forecasts, they will have an even bigger black hole to deal with.</p>

 That is absolutely right, but even on a more vulgar analysis, a 1 per cent. shortfall in growth probably equates to close to &#163;15 billion in GDP, about 40 per cent. of which would be tax. The revenue yield could be massively down, on even a vulgar analysis of those figures.</p>

Notwithstanding the fact that only a few weeks ago, at the time of the Budget, the OECD and Ernst and Young said that there would still be negative growth in 2010, the Government, all of whose major forecasts have been smashed over the past 12 months, are still labouring under the pretence that growth will be 1.25 per cent. next year and 3.5 per cent. the year after that, which I find extraordinary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90506-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09050661000548">Since the OECD and the Ernst and Young forecasts, we have had the European Commission publication this week.

That would indicate a very long recovery&#151;a shaky recovery. It will not be smooth or steep.

The oil price could rise dramatically, so the time is right now, when there is relative stability, to introduce the mechanism and smooth out the price spikes when they occur. I was delighted when the Conservative Front-Bench team U-turned last year and adopted the fair fuel stabiliser proposal. I remind them of what I said then: I do not care whether it is called a fair fuel stabiliser, a fuel duty regulator or what a previous Labour Transport Minister called it; I want to build a coalition around a sensible mechanism to deliver fairness and stability.

I shall put that point into context, and explain why we need the fair taxation of alcohol, by referring to three drinks with exactly the same alcohol content: a half pint of beer at 4.93 per cent. volume incurs 23.06p in duty; a 125ml glass of wine at 11.2 per cent. volume incurs 26.75 in duty; and a modest 35ml measure of Scotch at 40 per cent. volume incurs 31.7p in duty.</p>

Does he support an approach that involves a minimum price for alcohol, given that in large parts of the country a man can have his weekly alcohol intake of 21 units for about &#163;2.30 if he buys chemical cider?

 Is the hon.

It is perfectly sensible and reasonable for America, for example, to run a larger fiscal stimulus, whereas in a country such as ours, where that injunction does not exist because we are centralised, the automatic stabilisers can do all the work.</p>

 Automatic stabilisers have an important role to play. Obviously the UK Government are not required to balance their books annually, whereas the Scottish Government have to because they operate within a fixed budget. The real answer is to grant the Scottish Government borrowing powers, while working within a framework that says that over the cycle&#151;and I mean properly over the cycle&#151;the books are balanced so that we do not end up going into a recession with half a trillion pounds-worth of debt.</p>

Over a long period, under Labour and Conservative Governments, our debt has tended to be about 40 per cent. of GDP, although we go through brief periods of growth and higher tax revenues. In the mid-1980s, Mrs. Thatcher&#146;s Government paid off some debt, and that happened again in the early years of the Labour Government of 1997, with Conservative spending plans plus the sale of the spectrum. Commentators briefly get excited about that and say that if we carry on we will eventually get rid of our debt completely, but that never quite happens&#151;in this case, the Government were determined to have more public spending. We now have a very large, ballooning public sector deficit, but that always happens in a recession. There are two very large figures, and when one goes up because people lose their jobs and businesses start to get into difficulty, the other goes down because tax revenue is less buoyant and the deficit opens up like a vast chasm. That tends to make people a little pessimistic.</p>

Much of today&#146;s debate could be determined by whether the debt is cyclical or structural. One&#146;s view on that depends on whether one thinks that in a few years we will see a resurgent City of London with banks making big profits and the housing market booming, or that the world is going to change and we will not rely on the City of London but suddenly find new ways to make a living in  <br>

the world. It would not surprise me if in six years&#146; time bankers were making big bonuses, profits were going up, and tax revenue was being generated. The problem is that because we are running a large deficit and do not know at what rate we will recover, we are more vulnerable to turbulence in the world economy. As the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) asked, what is plan B? If the recession is deeper and the recovery slower than expected and unemployment goes over 3 million, we could have a real problem in financing our deficit. We might have to pay a premium, there might have to be more quantitative easing and sterling might come under pressure.</p>

We will have to take tough decisions on the scale of the state and public spending, and indeed on tax.</p>

High tax rates might make a debating point, but the reality of the Government&#146;s policy of raising the higher tax rates, restricting allowances and restricting what people can do with pensions is that people will look for others ways to recompense themselves. They might forgo salary in the short term or look for other ways, such as capitalising their salary. That is why I said in my intervention on the shadow Chief Secretary that if the Government continue down this path, the next item to come up will be capital gains tax.</p>

 It is a very sad thing; 20 or 30 years ago our tax rates were so high that people spent an awful lot of time trying to avoid paying tax rather than running their businesses. If we are not careful, we will return to people finding sophisticated ways of avoiding tax. That will mean a more draconian tax system and people will not focus on getting a fair reward and on running businesses efficiently. As we have heard, including national insurance the highest tax rate is 61 per cent., which is very high.

 We have to have a fair system that affects everybody.

That must be the priority. I know that the hon. Gentleman is something of an old socialist&#151;dare I mention that in the Chamber these days?&#151;but the reality is that if higher tax rates are not collected, there is no point in having them.

We are going to have a problem maintaining employment. Many workers have said to me that they would like temporary measures, whereby people go on to short-time working. Indeed, there is a big debate about that in manufacturing. However, at a time when we hear trade unionists on the radio demanding more action from the Government, which is understandable, it seems daft that the Government should be putting up the cost of employment for those still in work and for the companies that employ them.

I have been trying to work out what it is that I do not like about this Bill, and I suppose it is that it is nakedly and lamentably political rather than economic in its objectives. That causes me considerable concern, but there may be some poetic justice about it. An old saying in politics has it that a Budget that is well received on the day it is announced will prove to be badly received thereafter, and one that is badly received on the day will be well received thereafter. This Budget breaks that rule spectacularly&#151;it was pretty badly received on the day it was announced, and it has unwound with spectacular speed every day since. It has got steadily more unpopular and discredited with every day that passes, so in that way at least the Chancellor of the Exchequer has rewritten the history books, and that is something.</p>

The proposal is a bit of naked red meat thrown to Labour Members on the Back Benches behind the Chancellor but, even on their own figures, it will make a pathetically small contribution to the scale of the debt and the other problems facing the Government. Other commentators outside the Conservative party, such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies, suggest that the net revenue might be pretty close to zero. I shall return to that later.</p>

higher national insurance contributions are to be delayed until well into the next Parliament&#151;and through the burden of debt that will be repaid by our children for heaven knows how many decades to come. That was profoundly deceitful, and a matter of considerable regret, but I do not think that the British people have fallen for it; they know better than that. This is what happens when people play politics with important matters.</p>

The difficult choices will be delayed until 2011: a funny old year, safely after the next general election. The real pain will not be felt this side of the ballot box, but, again, I think that people know that is going on. If we look at the net figures, including the measures in Budget 2009 and the other measures announced in Budget 2008, we see a net outflow from the Exchequer of &#163;21.26 billion in the financial year that has just begun, a net inflow of plus &#163;4.6 billion in 2010 and, miraculously, a net inflow of plus &#163;12 billion in 2011. The real pain is being delayed for reasons of political expediency. The deficit should be addressed now, not in two years&#146; time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90506-0014.htm_para22"><a name="09050661000606">That deficit is the underlying concern. It remains unaddressed, and it is out of control.

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90506-0014.htm_para25"><a name="09050661000609">The second option was to raise the basic rate of income tax by 15p in the pound. I accept that these proposals offer a single-club solution, but they give an idea of the scale of the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90506-0014.htm_para26"><a name="09050661000610">The final option was to cut Government spending by a tenth, which would be a very serious step indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90506-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09050661000618">In his last Budget statement as Chancellor, the present Prime Minister predicted public sector net borrowing of about 2 per cent. of GDP for the year we have just entered. This year&#146;s Budget revises that figure to about 12 per cent. What a dramatic change! The Chancellor forecast that the UK economy would shrink by 3.5 per cent. this year&#151;I have already alluded to that figure&#151;and that it would grow by 1.25 per cent. next year. The International Monetary Fund says that the figures will be 4.1 per cent. this year and a shrinkage of 0.4 per cent. next year. Even the Government&#146;s own figures undermine their Budget forecasts. Within two days, the Office for National Statistics had revealed a still larger reduction in economic activity for the first quarter of 2009.</p>

That terrifying figure is twice as high as what we thought was a sustainable level of public borrowing and public debt. In this year&#146;s Budget, public net debt was expected to be 39 per cent. of GDP this year but it is now put at 59 per cent., increasing to 79 per cent. by 2013-14. I know that that outcome puts Britain only in the middle of the advanced economies in terms of the percentage debt to GDP ratio&#151;an argument often used by the Government. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I will happily repeat it, as I have an unfortunate habit of speaking too fast. As I have already said, I know that this outcome would put Britain only in the middle of the advanced economies in terms of the percentage debt to GDP ratio, but the tragedy is that if we had not had the spending splurge of the last six, seven or eight years, we could have been in a much stronger position.</p>

 I have to say that my recollection is somewhat different.

I am afraid to say that I now know that we were vindicated; the decisions the Prime Minister announced at that time proved to be the beginning of the obituary of this new Labour Government.

There have been spectacular busts in the past, such as the South Sea bubble and the Wall street crash, although I accept that the current bust is probably more extreme than we could possibly have expected. The business of the sub-prime mortgages, the poor regulation of banks by both the British and the Americans, and the British over-indebtedness, which has played its own part in contributing to the world economic catastrophe, have combined to make what was always going to be a bust a much sharper bust than it might otherwise have been.</p>

It is easy to say &#147;I would like a better car; I would like a bigger house; I would like nicer clothes; I would like more holidays,&#148; but if I do not have the money to buy those things, I do not have them.

I do not want to damn the whole Bill; that would be quite wrong of me. There are clearly good things in the Budget as well.

The Federation of Small Businesses is particularly grateful for the opportunity to defer tax bills, with loss-making companies able to reclaim tax on profits made in the last three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90506-0015.htm_para22"><a name="09050661000645">There are good measures in the Bill, therefore, but some measures that I hoped would be included are missing. National non-domestic rates&#151;business rates, as they are colloquially called&#151;are a crucial issue. The Chancellor made a big concession before the Budget in terms of the increase due next year; it is to be phased in, which is very welcome. I hoped that the Budget would address the void rates issue, but it does not do so. I know of people in my constituency who put together a small property portfolio as a pension scheme for their old age. One of them has had to go bankrupt because every property in his portfolio is now empty. The portfolio was supposed to bring in a revenue stream in his old age; instead, it has just brought in void rates bills. Money was supposed to be coming in, but the properties ended up costing him money. As a result, he has gone into personal bankruptcy. The Government should also be taking a much more careful look at the implications of void rates, particularly for retail businesses, but also for manufacturing businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90506-0015.htm_para23"><a name="09050661000646">There is one measure that I particularly hoped would be in the Bill. It is only a small measure, but I attach some importance to it as I introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill on the subject: automatic rate relief for small businesses. A few years ago, the Government wisely introduced a small business scheme; it is fairly complicated, but the essence is that small businesses put in an application and then get back half their rates. About a month ago, I was persuaded by a very persuasive Minister to withdraw my Bill because it was very likely that the Budget would contain a similar measure. I was building up to making an attack on the Government&#151;perhaps a rather disconsolate and aggressive one&#151;about their failure to keep their promises, but in fact it is not entirely clear to me that they have finally decided not to keep their promise to me; we still have some measure of hope. Let me explain why I am so sad that this measure is not in the Finance Bill. For small businesses in particular, the odd &#163;100, &#163;500 or &#163;1,000 can make a huge difference to the prospects for survival. We sometimes forget that. For micro-businesses, which I hope will be the macro-businesses of the future, small sums matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90506-0015.htm_para24"><a name="09050661000647">I have received a number of words of encouragement from the Government in recent days. Although this measure is not in the Bill, as I hoped it would be, the Chancellor has kindly written to me. The letter is dated 27 April, and it says:</p>
<a name="90506-0015.htm_brev6"><a name="09050661000710"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I can confirm that the Government is keen to continue to improve the administration of small business rates relief to make it easy to claim and increase its take up. I have therefore asked my officials to work with CLG officials to see what can be done to improve the take up of the scheme and to report back to me.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90506-0015.htm_para25"><a name="09050661000648">What the Chancellor does not say in that letter, but which I happen to know is the case, is that the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is also closely involved, in the noble and impressive persona of Baroness Vadera. When she gets her teeth into a matter, she tends to make sure that things get done, so I am optimistic. I am not suggesting that the two very able and charming Ministers sitting on the Government Front Bench at present do not get things done, of course, but the baroness has a certain reputation in Government for outcomes. I was therefore particularly encouraged by a parliamentary answer I received very recently from the Minister for Local Government, who said:</p>
<a name="90506-0015.htm_brev7"><a name="09050661000711"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Department for Communities and Local Government has had a number of discussions with the Department for Business  <br>

Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and Treasury on making small business rate relief automatic.</p>
</ul><a name="90506-0015.htm_brev8"><a name="09050661000712"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Government are keen to explore ways in which we can promote, and improve the administration of, the existing small business rate relief scheme and increase its take up, including through automatic options. CLG officials will work with Treasury officials to see how the take up of the scheme can be improved.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 5 May 2009; Vol. 492, c. 140W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90506-0015.htm_para26"><a name="09050661000649">That goes a little further than the Chancellor&#146;s letter, and I am extremely encouraged by that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90506-0015.htm_para27"><a name="09050661000650">I understand some of the Treasury&#146;s objections, but I believe that I have answers to all them, and I also believe that automaticity, to use a rather ugly word, would be welcome throughout the small business community and the local government world, and would have nothing but positive consequences for this Government and the economic activity of the UK. I therefore hope that, although this measure is not in the Bill as I had hoped, we might hear more about it later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90506-0015.htm_para28"><a name="09050661000651">I have talked sufficiently about the problems of debt and delay in the Budget, but may I emphasise one point? The Government say they are taxing the rich and that that is only fair. Well, we can discuss what rate of taxation on the rich is fair, but it is very important to remember that, on the Government&#146;s own figures, less than half of the &#163;5 billion tax rises announced in the Budget are actually taxes on the rich; the majority of them are on the rest of us. Most of the tax rises that the Government are planning are on average earners; they include tax rises such as those on fuel and alcohol and, crucially, the increase in national insurance contributions announced in the pre-Budget report. The sad thing about the PBR is that the Government have got out of the habit of having debates on it. The PBR has become a surrogate Budget and contains Finance Bill-type measures. We had no debate on the increase in national insurance contributions announced in the PBR last year. There was a statement and Members could make one quick comment afterwards, but there was no debate, I believe for the second or third year running. I say to Ministers that if there is to be at least one more PBR before the election, I hope that this time we will have a debate on it, because the PBR contains important measures that should and could be scrutinised at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90506-0015.htm_para29"><a name="09050661000652">We also know that this Budget and Finance Bill enables reductions in capital spending&#151;again, they will take place after the election&#151;including a very large reduction in the capital budget of the health service. I find that interesting coming from a Government who have criticised the Conservatives for wishing to cut expenditure on sensitive areas of public services.</p>

It contains a rather complicated provision on individual savings accounts and something that I benefit from as someone who is now over 50, but it really is miniscule, footling stuff. Savers have been hit very hard by the consequences of the events of the past year or so; there have been very low interest rates and very low dividends. Of course, many savers are pensioners, who do not want to have to rely on pension credit for their welfare, well-being and survival; they want to have the dignity of relying on their own incomes. Thus, it would have been good to see the Government doing more, as they suggested they would, to help savers in this Budget. I wish to discuss the VAT scheme in a moment, but I should say that  <br>

helping savers is one very good example of a way in which that &#163;12.5 billion could have been better spent. We can discuss whether it was right to have a fiscal stimulus, but that was the wrong fiscal stimulus, and the money would have been better spent helping pensioners and savers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09050661000654">I do not think that, technically, the enterprise finance guarantee scheme is covered by the Finance Bill, so I shall simply say that I am looking forward to my Committee&#146;s study of the scheme&#151;I believe that we are taking evidence from the banks on 2 June&#151;and gently remind the Financial Secretary that I am waiting for an answer to a question that I asked in February. I have just tabled a reminder parliamentary question today, although I am sure that the lack of a reply was an oversight and was not deliberate, and I look forward to getting an answer about the take-up of the scheme. There are still issues relating to credit in the overall economy that this Bill could have perhaps done more to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09050661000655">Let us briefly consider the VAT reduction. I am clear about the fact that I would not have done it. Leaving to one side the argument about whether to have the fiscal stimulus, this was a bad way to spend &#163;12.5 billion. There are big questions about the timing of the ending of the VAT reduction&#151;in the middle of the week during the sales period just after Christmas is a ridiculous time to end it. I pressed the Chief Secretary on this point at the beginning of the debate, but I regret to say that she was not flexible. I was chastised by the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) for being hypocritical in some way&#151;I am sure that he did not use that word, because it would be unparliamentary for him to do so, but he said something of that kind. What I am saying is that it would have been much better if the VAT reduction money had been spent in other ways and that I would end the reduction much sooner and use the money saved in other ways. Realistically, the Government are not going to do that, for reasons of realpolitik, so I point out that if they were to give the reduction another three or four weeks&#151;the other alternative&#151;that would help the retail industry considerably. As I say, I would end the reduction now and spend the money differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09050661000656">My Committee heard evidence from the small business community about the great cost that the VAT reduction has imposed on it. The reduction has been a problem for small businesses, which have had to invest in new software packages and will have to do so again at the end of the year, when the rate goes back up again. The reduction has not benefited small businesses&#151;quite the opposite; it has been a problem. Many big retailers have also encountered problems with it. I am not talking about the Tescos of this world, which have computerised systems and can adapt easily. Such businesses are not the kind of businesses that need help from a VAT reduction; although such businesses are expanding rapidly into other markets, a large proportion of their products are still VAT exempt. It is not the Tescos of this world that we need to help, but the smaller businesses, and they have not been helped by the VAT reduction.</p>

comprehensive way than the Government have suggested; or on funding prompt payment by local authorities. The Government have a 10-day target on that, and I believe that my local authorities are meeting it. I am pleased about that, and I congratulate Worcestershire county council and Wychavon district council on what they are doing. I do not know what assessment the Government have made of the effectiveness of the target, but it is an expensive thing. I would also have spent the money to pay for the relaxation of void business rates, which should have been included in this Bill. I also might have used it to provide some sort of employment subsidy. I was very struck by the argument by a former Minister, Lord Digby Jones, that we should help when businesses, especially those with highly skilled workers, face a short-term drop in demand&#151;such as in manufacturing businesses in the west midlands in the automotive sector&#151;so that those workers are not lost to other less skilled jobs. With an employment subsidy, those businesses could keep the staff on. Baroness Thatcher&#146;s Government did that, so I would have thought that this Government could do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09050661000658">I mentioned the 50 per cent. tax increase. It is a political device, used as a political dividing line by the Prime Minister and Chancellor. We are rightly not committing to repealing it as an early priority, because our first priority must be the taxes on everyone&#151;the ordinary, hard-working families&#151;such as the national insurance contribution tax hike that is coming in 2011. That is the right policy. We have said that the 50 per cent. tax must take its place in the queue of tax reductions that we would like to make as a future Conservative Government, but that does not mean that we cannot damn that tax increase for the extraordinary damage that it is doing. The Government just do not understand the impact that it will have on the international community and mobile entrepreneurs.</p>

right things that it could and should have done. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has referred to the new age of austerity. We will hear a lot more of that in the next year or so, because it is what we now face as a result of the mistakes by this Government&#151;not the problems created by the US sub-prime markets. The Government are not being straight with voters about how they will sort out the problem, but the voters have seen through that.

 Much&#151;indeed, almost all&#151;of the comment in the press at the time of the Budget, and much of this debate, has been about the assumptions and forecasts it contained. I wish to respond to some of that comment and I start from the premise that forecasting is more an art than a science. I know that econometrics is the place to be at the moment, and many different mathematical formulae are used, but the reality is that art plays a much larger part than science.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09050684000002">That is particularly the case at present, because we live in a period of exceptional uncertainty. If I may comment on a point that was made earlier, we are no longer in a period characterised by the chairman of the Federal Reserve as the &#147;great moderation&#148;. We all remember those times&#151;they lasted for quite a long period&#151;when the so-called fluctuations in the trade cycle were reduced and when it was thought that economic management of the economy was more effective than it is. All that was cast aside completely in 2007, when we had the unprecedented external shock from the sub-prime fiasco in the USA. The first thing that we must be clear about is that the recession that this Budget reflects is international in both scale and origin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09050684000003">My first question on the Budget projections is how far into the future is it reasonable for a Budget to forecast. Indeed, the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) commented that Budget books occasionally give long-term public expenditure projections. Without wishing to hurt the feelings of all the economists who crunch the numbers in the Treasury, I submit that some of the projections that go more than two or three years into the future are almost worthless. Indeed, I shall go on to talk about whether it is appropriate to forecast two years ahead. Although that was done in the Budget&#151;and it has received a lot of criticism&#151;very few of all the other forecasters, including the IMF, forecast for that period.</p>

 It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman should say that. I want to come on to the forecasts made in the Budget. I submit that they are reasonable in current circumstances. That is what I am trying to challenge in this debate.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman says that the forecasts are reasonable considering the times. However, it was two hours after the Chancellor sat down that the IMF disagreed with the growth forecasts for this year, saying that they would not be minus 3.5 per cent., as the Government claimed, but minus 4.1 per cent. That was just two hours later, not six months later.</p>

 I am very pleased that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned the IMF, because that is the comparison that I want to make. That was a godsend to the media, who were out to trash the Budget. The fact that the IMF published the figures on the same day meant that the automatic assumption of most of the media comment was that the IMF figures were right and the Treasury figures were wrong. The reality is that the Treasury has a much better record of forecasting the British economy than the IMF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para14"><a name="09050684000008">Let me come to the specific points made by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood). The Budget book suggests that there is a recession of 3.5 per cent. in the current year. The average of all recent forecasts suggests a negative of 3.7 per cent. The representative of the Scottish National party, the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie), said earlier that the OECD had today suggested 3.7 per cent. The IMF is at 4.1 per cent. If we take the average as reasonably accurate in the circumstances&#151;I accept that forecasts for this year can be taken to be reasonably accurate&#151;the Treasury is closer to the reality.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making a reasonable stab at arguing that arithmetic averages are likely to pray in favour of the Treasury&#146;s position. However, surely he must recognise that only two days after the Chancellor made his predictions for this year, the Office for National Statistics published its figures for the first three months of this year, which showed that the Treasury&#146;s projections were out by more than 25 per cent. The economy failed by 1.9 per cent. as opposed to the 1.5 per cent. that the Chancellor had identified two days before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para15"><a name="09050684000011">The Budget projection for 2010 of 11/4 per cent. growth was widely ridiculed in the media and compared with the IMF projection of, I believe, negative 0.3 or 0.4 per cent.; according to the IMF, we will still be in recession. If we take the average of all recent forecasts, growth does return to the economy; it is something like 0.3 or 0.4 per cent, which is a good deal closer to what the Treasury is suggesting, although of course still significantly less. That is one reason why the epithet &#147;optimistic&#148; has been used, which was very much at the centre of our debate in the Treasury Committee.</p>

As the Budget figures suggest, the Treasury selects 31/2 per cent. I would raise questions about how accurate any such forecasts could be, but let me say why I think that, although the Treasury is veering towards the optimistic side, it may not be an unreasonable forecast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para17"><a name="09050684000013">The first reason is that in previous recessions, such as those of the early &#146;80s or the early &#146;90s, when the recession bottomed out there was spare capacity in the economy, which made it possible for recovery to occur relatively quickly and at an above-trend growth rate. The Treasury has therefore assumed that we will have a relatively faster bounce-back from the end of the recession. Secondly, we have an extraordinary stimulus in the economy&#151;not just the automatic stabilisers, not just the activities of the Bank of England, but a significant depreciation in the value of sterling, which should open opportunities to re-phase our economy to export more into the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para18"><a name="09050684000014">Perhaps the most important reason, and the one that is being challenged in alternative forecasts, is the assumption in the Budget that agreements made at the G20&#151;international action to stimulate economies across the world&#151;will be honoured. I do not know whether that will happen, but I think it is reasonable to assume that other economies will take similar action. They have all announced that they will, and therefore one can assume that, although those Budget projections are on the optimistic side, they are based on fairly good economic analysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para19"><a name="09050684000015">I shall now discuss the ONS announcement of a contraction of 1.9 per cent. in GDP in the first quarter. The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne), who I know takes a great interest in these matters, will know that those figures were very much initial figures, based on only 50 per cent. of the evidence that will become available. When we asked the Treasury&#146;s economic guru about those figures, he said not only that he expected them to change going forward, as they often do, but that he saw no reason to re-evaluate the projections for this year, and I would accept that at this stage we should not do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para20"><a name="09050684000016">Therefore, my first point&#151;I have laboured the point because of all the press and other comment that there has been&#151;is that, in my view and I think in that of most independent forecasters and economic commentators, the Budget projections are within the realms of possibility. The idea that they should all be entirely rubbished really must be challenged, and that is what I have sought to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para21"><a name="09050684000017">Let me come on to the public finances. It is amazing that everyone on the Opposition Benches who has commented today has cast into doubt whether we have an honest appraisal of the problem that we will face with our public finances. This Budget is honest about that. Opposition Members have quoted the figures. When you tell us how terrible the situation is, you do not use alternative figures; you use the Budget figures to do so.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that question. I was going to raise the issue with the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff). The director of the NIESR came before the Treasury Committee. He remains one of the few economists in favour of a second fiscal stimulus. He and his organisation believe that even given the additional public expenditure implications of a second fiscal stimulus, it is the correct thing to do. I have no doubt that the figures in the report from which you quote are accurate, as far as a forecast can be, but you should be aware that if we followed that economist&#146;s policy prescription, the figures would be even higher.</p>

 I apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker; when I begin to enjoy myself, I get somewhat carried away. I hope that I will remember to phrase my speech in the correct manner.

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90506-0016.htm_para22"><a name="09050684000022">Members have said that the structural element of the deficit is about four fifths of the total deficit. I do not think that anyone has queried that. We have not really debated in the Chamber today&#151;and I suspect that we will not do so before the general election&#151;what proposals we will bring forward to address that structural part of the deficit. We heard earlier from my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who suggested a number of proposals; I will come back to them. A lot of the hardy annuals from both main Opposition parties have suggested that we could look at scrapping identity cards. I have opposed, and will continue to oppose, identity cards for all sorts of reasons, but I would not go so far as to say that there is a significant amount of money to be saved&#151;not an amount that will make a substantial difference to the problem of the deficit. That is part of the problem with some of the suggestions made, mostly, dare I say, by members of Her Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition.

 The hon.

 In the next few months, when the Opposition have had a chance to look carefully at all the implications of the Red Book and come forward with a series of proposals, people will take them and the criticisms that they make more seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90506-0017.htm_para0"><a name="09050684000027">One of the issues raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead has been reflected in comments from the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) and has found favour in some parts of the Opposition. I refer to the question of whether action should be taken on public sector pensions and, by implication, on public sector pay. My suspicion is that nothing concrete will be forthcoming from either of the major Opposition parties, because they will not want that to be part of any election campaign that may come this year or next.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90506-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09050684000028">Comments were made earlier about how we fund the deficit. As I mentioned in an intervention, a number of members of the Treasury Committee visited the Debt Management Office today. From what we saw and from the discussion that we had with the senior officials there, it was clear that for various reasons there is an appetite out there in the marketplace for Government debt. Whether that is because there is a flight to safety in risk-free products such as gilts, or because of the need of the pension industry for long-dated gilts, there does not seem to be a single serious forecaster or economic commentator who suggests that although the demands of the Debt Management Office to raise money on behalf of the Government are substantial, there is not a willingness out there in the marketplace to deliver that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90506-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09050684000029">Finally in relation to the public finances, we have heard repeatedly from the Opposition that we are building up a 79 or 80 per cent. ratio of debt to GDP. As the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire commented, that places us somewhere in the middle of international comparisons. Although that should be taken extremely seriously, we are not some outlier, as has been suggested by some Opposition parties. We are around the average of economies that could be considered both our competitors and our comparators.</p>

 I know the hon. Gentleman is not stupid. I sat with him on the Treasury Committee, and he knows full well that the device that the Prime Minister used when Chancellor was to put as much debt as he could off balance sheet. If one uses equity accounting or consolidation accounting with the banks alone that have been bought by the Government, that is an extra &#163;2 trillion of debt that should be added to the Government accounts. That excludes the &#163;1 trillion of public sector pension liabilities. Debt today could be as high as &#163;4 trillion or more. The hon. Gentleman must acknowledge that there is a huge amount of money held off balance sheet, as well as on balance sheet, by the Government.</p>

 I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman&#146;s consistency, because that theme runs through his period as a Treasury Committee member and his questions on the Floor of the House. However, his argument is accepted neither by the Government nor, I suspect, by most independent economists, and I return to my earlier point that the Budget is honest in its presentation of our public expenditure problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90506-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09050684000032">I must move on, because I want to comment briefly on several specifics of the Budget. I cannot understand why people find the 50p tax rate so difficult to accept. It seems entirely reasonable and fair that those who have benefited most from the good times make some contribution during the difficulties that we now experience. As I understand it, that view is shared by the public, and the 50p tax rate reflects it. However, I, like others, have some concerns about the proposal in the Budget and, most of all, about the uncertainty surrounding the yield from the tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90506-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09050684000033">We were told on the Treasury Committee that only 31 to 32 per cent. of the potential yield will probably be realised. The Government have taken some steps, as was mentioned earlier, to do something about income being moved into pension schemes, and I recognise that that will increase the likely yield of the 50p rate. However, as the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) has said extensively, there are still major opportunities for people to shift income into capital to reduce their tax burden, so one suspects and hopes that the Government will return to those measures to ensure that the people who can afford it, and who have done so well in the past, make a sensible contribution.</p>

<p><a name="st_o340"><a name="09050684000034"><a name="90506-0017.htm_spnew5"><a name="09050684000168"><b>Mr. Stewart Jackson (Peterborough) (Con):</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He has been very generous, and I know that, as a member of the Treasury Committee, he takes a great interest in these affairs. Surely, however, he will concede the argument of the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers)&#151;that the tax rise is essentially a political strategy, that it will not deliver fiscal rewards and that, if someone earns about &#163;112,000 a year, they will effectively pay a marginal tax rate of 61.5 per cent., making it the third highest rate in Europe. In a recession, when we seek to bring in wealth creators, that cannot be good for the UK&#146;s economy.</p>

 I certainly share the concerns about increased complexity and, albeit in a different way, the likely yield of the change in taxation. However, I hope that, at the pre-Budget report later this year or, if there is another Budget, at the next Budget before the general election, the Government will consider carefully whether the 50p tax rate has raised the amounts that we would wish to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90506-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09050684000036">I shall make two other brief points before I finish. I was surprised that the hon.

 I welcome the scheme, because there is a great feeling outside the House that the Government have done much for the financial sector, but that we have rather forgotten about manufacturing. It was therefore important to lay down a marker, demonstrating that we are helping manufacturing. We could have taken a narrow, nationalistic view, because it is already evident that the schemes that have been introduced in Germany, France and other European countries have benefited the British car industry, 85 per cent. of whose production is exported to Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90506-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09050684000040">However, it was right and proper that we brought forward a scheme. There are some problems of dead-weight costs and there is the issue of whether British manufacturing will benefit. But if we look carefully at the benefit that the scheme will deliver to the retail and component parts of the motor industry, we see that the scheme is well worthy of support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90506-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09050684000041">My biggest regret about the Budget relates to our commitment to halve child poverty by 2010 and eliminate it by 2020. That faced a setback in the Budget&#151;and, it has to be said, in the pre-Budget report; in neither were there substantial measures to address the issue. I regret that, although one has to accept, realistically, that the financial circumstances have changed significantly. I hope that the Government will not forget about their child poverty commitments, which have great public support. Everyone recognises the need to assist the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. Recognising the legislation and maintaining the commitment will do more good and be presented more positively for the Government than almost any of the measures in the Budget.</p>

There are some veterans in the Chamber who have often spoken in debates on previous Finance Bills, but we could argue that this is one of the most important such Bills.

We hear from our constituents and businesses that the money is not getting through because the banks are not able to lend as the Government promised that they would. The recession is lasting much longer because they are not giving us the leadership that we expect.</p>

In health, there is a cut of &#163;2.3 million; in education, there is a total cut of about &#163;1 billion. Today we had an interesting debate in Westminster Hall on funding for further education with the fiasco that is surrounding the Learning and Skills Council and the fact that there is now a shortfall of &#163;2.7 billion.</p>

The Minister for Schools and Learners, who turned up late to the Westminster Hall debate, eventually made it and acknowledged that letters from the Learning and Skills Council went out without his authority. His office knew about them, but the consequence is that schools in my constituency have been promised less funding than before. They will have more pupils coming through the gates in September, but they do not have the ability to pay for them.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very important point. The words &#147;boom and bust&#148; are not mentioned many times by Labour Members. In fact, we no longer hear the language of fiscal rules, golden rules and so forth. It would have meant much to the nation if the Prime Minister had said, &#147;Yes, I apologise for my part in what has happened.&#148; Instead, as my hon. Friend points out, blame has been put on the Americans and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and it has been suggested that what happened over there spilled over here. But it was not the Americans who allowed mortgages of 125 per cent. in the UK, and it certainly was not the Americans who, when the Bank of England became independent, handed over responsibility for certain rules to the Financial Services Authority. The FSA then relaxed those rules, allowing banks to lend and get into debt on a scale that we are now beginning to regret.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="90506-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09050684000063">I return to my intervention on the Chief Secretary about the cut in VAT from 17.5 per cent. to 15 per cent. I do not want to get into the whys and wherefores, and I have already stressed that it was an unwise move. My concern is about when it returns to 17.5 per cent. at midnight on 31 December. I do not know where Labour Front Benchers spend their new year&#146;s eve, but if they spend it indoors they will not be aware of the nightmare that the change will cause as every bar, pub, restaurant and so on across the country has to reconcile things when Big Ben strikes midnight. I plead with Ministers to consider that in Committee and ensure that the change back up to 17.5 per cent. is debated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="90506-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09050684000064">I have suggested Sunday 3 January as a possible date for the change, or 31 January, which would allow the sales to benefit. One consequence of an increase in VAT is a sudden rush to buy things before it goes up. I stress that the reason why the cut was unwise in the first place is that many small and medium-sized businesses, which could have benefited from more support from the Government, were already offering discounts of 10, 15 or 20 per cent., so a 2.5 per cent. drop was neither here nor there.</p>

 My hon. Friend is being very generous. Would not even the most basic analysis by an A-level economics student have told the Chancellor that the cut in VAT was a waste of time, because in a recession people will seek to pay down debt? Even if they were spending on white goods or luxury goods, they would be spending on foreign goods, which are imported into this country, which would have little long-term impact. The Government could have spent the money on other things last November, such as the 9,000 empty housing association units, which could have helped people on the housing waiting list to get off it. Surely the money has been completely wasted by the Government.</p>

 My hon. Friend again makes a valid point. To benefit from the temporary change in VAT, people would have to buy products that were so expensive many of them may not even have been made in the UK. That is a lesson that the Government have learnt, so it will be interesting to see what changes to VAT they propose next. I suspect that VAT may not stop at 17.5 per cent. but head a bit further north, considering the signs of the times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="90506-0018.htm_para0"><a name="09050684000071">I would like to talk about how the Bill affects the tourism industry, which is the portfolio that I follow. I make no apologies for raising the issue. Tourism is Britain&#146;s fifth biggest industry and it is important to the UK. We are the sixth most visited place in the world. In an economic downturn, tourism is the one industry that is faring well and that could actually make more money. Unfortunately, it is doing well in spite of the Government, rather than because of them. In the lead-up to the Olympics, which is our one chance really to promote British tourism, the tourism budget is being cut, which is a scandal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="90506-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09050684000072">I would like to react on record to the comments made by Michael Savage, who is a DJ and political commentator in the United States. In reaction to being denied entry to this country, he told his audience of 10 million people not to visit the UK. That is an absolute scandal. Let me tell his listeners: ignore the DJ and come to the UK. Enjoy the holiday, enjoy our exchange rate and understand that he is talking out of his backside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="90506-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09050684000073">Tourism is called the hidden giant of the economy&#151;it is the fifth biggest industry, and it seems to be hidden from Parliament as well.

I understand that the Minister hosted an event at the Treasury not too long ago, and if I can catch his eye&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ]</i> There we go. I hope that he will acknowledge the importance of tourism and the fact that Governments of all colours could do more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="90506-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09050684000074">I would like to underline several points about taxation in the Bill. The taxation of bingo is dealt with in clause 20. What input did the Department for Culture, Media and Sport have into the change in policy? VAT has gone, for which the industry has been calling for some time, as have we. There was a system of double taxation that was unique to bingo. The industry was hit by gross profits tax and VAT, but when the industry gets what it wants and VAT suddenly disappears, it is hit by  <br>

an increase in gross profits tax, from 15 to 22 per cent. The Government have given with one hand and taken away with the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90506-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09050684000075">The consequence of that is an increase in taxation of about 46 per cent. That may be a cunning way to make money, but the Government do not fully understand the consequences that it will have for our communities. Some 8.5 million people play bingo every year. Many of them are old ladies, and for many the bingo night is their one night out in the week. One third of all bingo companies&#146; locations are now under threat and many are closing every month. If we take bingo away from the community, we deny those people their ability to get out of the house, meet people and do something that they love doing. The consequence of raising money on the one hand is a detrimental impact on the community on the other.</p>

 Is the effect not wider than that? Many bingo clubs feature live music as part of their entertainment. If clubs are hit by the new tax, musicians will have fewer venues in which to perform live.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes a valid point. Bingo halls are more than just places where the numbers on balls are read out&#151;they are pivotally important community attributes. There are 17,000 people employed in the bingo industry, and I fear that the proposals will lead to a net decrease in the amount of tax that the Government take. Moreover, there has been no consultation with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which should be advising on the best way to treat the bingo community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="90506-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09050684000078">I strongly recommend that members of the Government Front Bench do not visit any bingo halls in the near future. They will not be offered the prestigious job of reading out the numbers: instead, they will probably have the numbered balls thrown at them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90506-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09050684000079">Just as bingo is important for our communities, so are the UK&#146;s traditional pubs. They have been ignored by the Government for some time, despite huge campaigns to save them. Ministers will be aware that about 40 pubs close every week, changing the fabric of our communities and of British life, which is very important from the perspective of tourism.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. We have heard nothing from the Government that will help our traditional pubs, even though the consequences of their closure are much greater than one might imagine. When a pub closes, people either go to our town centres&#151;where the vibrancy of what goes on already poses a challenge in many places&#151;or they purchase their alcohol in supermarkets. When the Government first took office, a pint of beer in a pub cost just twice what it cost in the supermarket. It now costs seven times as much, thanks to the increase in duties imposed by the Government. That does not help our pub industry at all.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making many compelling points in connection with his tourism portfolio, but does he share my concern that the number of violent incidents and admissions to hospital has increased significantly since the Licensing Act 2003 came into force? The emphasis is much more on vertical drinking establishments than on the traditional family pubs that have been penalised by the Government&#146;s tax policies more or less since 1997.</p>

 I could not agree with my hon. Friend more. Traditional pubs foster responsible drinking because they take pride in what they offer and the atmosphere that they create. We want more of that, but the fact that 40 pubs are closing every week means that people are changing their style of drinking. That is not good for society, and the Government have failed to address it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90506-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09050684000084">My hon. Friend also mentioned duties. The Budget imposes a 2 per cent. flat-rate increase in the tax paid on all alcohols, on top of the 8 per cent. increase applied in December 2008. The Government are thereby penalising all drinkers, including those who drink responsibly. In contrast, we have suggested that the target should be people engaging in irresponsible and binge drinking.</p>

 I am treasurer of the all-party save the pub group. Although licensees could do without the proposed penny on a pint of beer, which is what we are really talking about, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the two key drivers in eroding pubs&#146; viability are the extraordinarily low prices charged for alcohol in supermarkets, and social change? We can do something about the former, but nothing about the latter.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman invites me to say something about the consequences for society of the changes in where people choose to drink. He also gives me licence to remark that the pubcos themselves could do more to provide the same deals as the supermarkets, because they are sold beer at the same discounts as the supermarkets. The supermarkets pass on those discounts&#151;sometimes reducing the cost even further in the form of loss leaders&#151;but the pubcos are not doing that, and many landlords are forced to sell beer at too high a price. Although there is much work for the Government to do on this, there is some work that the Conservatives would like to see the industry doing, too.</p>

 There is another point in the argument about pub closures that my hon. Friend has not touched on: the closures have a disproportionate effect on rural areas such as the East Riding and parts of Dorset and Hampshire. Often, the pub is the only community centre in a village and, whereas a city could lose six pubs a day without noticing it, the closure of rural pubs has a devastating effect on many communities.</p>

 Again, I could not agree more with my right hon. Friend. I hope that the Government are listening to this, because the high-profile campaign on pub closures is falling on deaf ears at the moment. They need to wake up to this problem. Once a pub disappears and is sold and converted into flats or something else, it is gone for good.

 I should like to encourage my hon. Friend in his exposition to the Government of the importance of pubs in our communities. I urge him not to forget that, following the post office closure programme, many rural areas, including some villages in Shropshire, have suffered, and the pub remains the last focus for community life in villages, other than perhaps the church. The pubs have now taken on the village store, and the post office that was in the village store, so it is not just the drinkers in the community who are affected by their closure; it is the community itself.</p>

 My hon. Friend puts his finger exactly on the bunker mentality involved in the Treasury introducing tax cuts and changes to our taxation regimes without understanding their impact on our communities. If we change taxation law relating to pubs, of if we change the policy relating to post offices and bingo clubs, we change the fabric of our communities. The Government are failing to recognise that. That is evident not only from the clauses that we are debating today but from the fact that other Departments have either not been consulted about these measures or have not been able to have any input into the Bill.</p>

We have been hit by the same global economic storm as everyone else, but Britain has fared so much worse than other countries, thanks to decisions taken by the Prime Minister over the 10 years that he was Chancellor. Most notable was the decision to remove key regulatory powers from the Bank of England when it became independent in 1997 that would have prevented the escalation of debt that allowed British banks to become so over-exposed during the economic downturn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90506-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09050684000092">Instead of admitting fault, coming to the House and saying, &#147;Yes, we made some mistakes and we are now going to try to solve them&#148;, the Prime Minister has tried over and over again to blame the United States. The only time he stopped doing that was, conveniently, during the G20 summit, when we had some guests who would probably have been a little bit upset to hear that old, incorrect argument being used so often. He should come to the Dispatch Box, put his hands up and tell us what his role has been over the past 10 years. Instead, we limp on with a weak and feeble Government and a weak and feeble leader, support for whom is dwindling in the nation and in his own party. We must now wait until the general election when the country can finally be put out of its misery. Until then, we face a wasted year, and a wasted opportunity to move things forward on the scale that Britain expects.</p>

In reality, the Government are fumbling around with the jump-leads. No initiatives have been put forward that will rebuild Britain&#146;s competitiveness, improve its productivity, infrastructure and skills base, or strengthen our society by investing in our employment and welfare system. Of course, it is thanks to a decade of Labour that there is so little in the Bill to match the urgency of the economic challenge we face.</p>

She sought to conjure up a smokescreen from thin air to camouflage the Government&#146;s disastrous conduct of the economy, while at the same time seeking to paint a fantasy picture of Conservative plans. Her speech betrayed the whole approach of this beleaguered Government: &#147;When you are lying at the bottom of a hole that you have dug for yourself, you bear your teeth, start gnashing and try to claw your way out of a dugout.&#148; In the way the right hon.

What the meant for me was the end of aspiration under new Labour. There were no signals that Britain is a competitive place in which to do business, that individuals find Britain an attractive place in which to build their careers or that the Government understand how this economy can compete.</p>

 Does my hon.

Does he agree that because the Government decided to pander to the gallery, what they did was punish success, thus announcing the end of new Labour?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point. There is no evidence in what we have heard from Labour Members today or in the Budget debate that there is any longer any real understanding on the Labour Benches of what drives an economy, what makes it work or how much it relies, especially in a trading nation such as ours, on the entrepreneurial spirit. We must encourage business men to come to this country, given the increasingly global environment in which we live. We cannot simply assume that things will happen because we have a talented pool of people who have been educated here. Education is now an international business. Many people from this country can be educated in other countries&#151;increasingly they are doing so in the United States&#151;if that is where they feel that their future lies.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the 50p tax increase is emblematic of a party whose record shows that it was never really committed to the entrepreneurial spirit or to free enterprise? The whole edifice of new Labour was based on year-on-year increases in public expenditure irrespective of reform, a housing boom, and a Faustian pact with the City that there would be continuing tax revenues with light-touch regulation. Is it not the case that all three of those pillars have crumbled, and that as a result we are now in a disastrous fiscal position?</p>

 I think that my hon. Friend is being a little unfair on the Labour party in opposition. I think that the Labour party, or at least its leadership&#151;the present Prime Minister and his predecessor&#151;recognised that if it was to secure power, it would have to develop a broad consensus of opinion and establish a wide church of support. That included attracting the middle classes&#151;the aspirational people, both those in work and those entering the work force. It was clear that they must be encouraged to vote Labour, which meant that a Labour Government must adopt a policy involving stability and certainty in tax rates, rather than a penal policy reverting to the old class wars of preceding decades.</p>

 What the hon. Gentleman needs to consider is what happens to the admittedly small number of people who are responsible for generating the jobs that employ those at the bottom end of the spectrum. If the tax rate in this country is perceived to be entering a period of prolonged excess by international standards&#151;we have been led to believe that the new top marginal rate will place us third in a list of 83 of the most world&#146;s most developed countries&#151;this country will not be perceived as an attractive place in which to generate business, which allows the employment of people living here and attracts other people. That is the fundamental issue which seems to be so absent from the debate conducted by Labour Members, and that is where I think the Government are making such a terrible mistake.</p>

 I share many of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s reservations about marginal tax rates, but my difficulty is in understanding how it is possible to advance two arguments simultaneously: the argument that the 50p rate will drive entrepreneurs away and be bad for the economy, and the argument that it will raise little additional revenue. If the latter is the case, it would surely not be difficult to abolish the rate with immediate effect. If the former is the case, surely the need to abolish it is all the more urgent. In any event, I see no reason why, consistent with the case that the hon. Gentleman is making, any Government would not abolish the 50p rate on their first day in office.</p>

 I think that timing comes into play. Such action cannot be taken overnight. If the present Government are re-elected, they will have an opportunity to reconsider the 50p rate in their next Finance Bill, at a time when the impact on the perception of entrepreneurs may well be clearer because it will be known whether people have left the country in droves. Timing is all-important in this context.</p>

The Chancellor claimed to the Treasury Committee that his forecasts were realistic; I think that that was the word that he used. Much of this debate has already been given over to discussion of how realistic these forecasts were, and I have to say that I find that claim truly astonishing given the Treasury&#146;s track record in forecasting both GDP and public borrowing.</p>

In each of the four Budgets and pre-Budget reports that I reviewed as part of that Committee&#146;s work, the then Chancellor had to appear before the Committee to try to defend his forecasts and explain why they were not so unreasonable in the circumstances compared with the forecasts he had made on his previous visit to the Committee. On each occasion, that was a very hollow claim. It was clear that the Treasury models were not giving rise to accurate forecasts for either GDP  <br>

growth or, more particularly, public borrowing. That has been exposed not merely within months, weeks or days, but even within hours, of the Chancellor sitting down following his Budget speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09050684000111">The Chancellor said that in the current year GDP growth would be negative 3.5 per cent., but barely an hour later the International Monetary Fund estimated it would be negative 4.1 per cent. A week later, the European Union estimated that it would be negative 3.8 per cent., and this week we have had reports from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research that its estimate is negative 4.3 per cent. Two days after the Chancellor sat down, the first estimate of first-quarter GDP growth came out from the Office for National Statistics. The underlying assumption in the Chancellor&#146;s forecasts had been that the figure for the first quarter was negative 1.5 per cent., but the ONS estimate was negative 1.9 per cent. That is a 27 per cent. difference. It is barely credible that the Treasury did not have some sight of the underlying information available to the ONS in preparing its forecasts, and that suggests either a lack of understanding about the data in the economy at the time or an astonishing lack of competence. I hope for the sake of any incoming Government that the Treasury is not so incompetent that it can make such a significant error within such a short period and have such a lack of understanding.</p>

 I am grateful for that intervention, as it takes me nicely on to the issue of the magnitude of the problem. The NIESR says that there is a real possibility that GDP will fall more this year than in 1931, stating:</p>
<a name="90506-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="09050684000144"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The pace of decline to date shows a remarkable resemblance to that of the depression of the early 1930s.&#148;</p>

As we all know, however, there is very little recognition on the part of the Prime Minister and his Treasury team that we are in such a situation, even though it is evident to all independent commentators that that is the case.

That is based on the highly optimistic, rather than realistic, forecasts that the Chancellor set out in his Budget speech. The variance between the 5.5 per cent. cited in the Red Book and what the NIESR says is more than 50 per cent.

the Chancellor has forecast. If it does grow as he has forecast, some estimates have identified that there will be a black hole of more than &#163;40 billion&#151;I believe that the figure is &#163;45 billion&#151;in the Government&#146;s finances.

As the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) bravely said, there is a significant question mark over this Government&#146;s ability to fund the debt with which they have saddled this country. The credit rating agencies have put the UK&#146;s triple A rating under review. All the Government&#146;s borrowing forecasts are predicated on the assumption that that rating will remain. Should it be reduced to a double A rating, for example, that would, in itself, have a significant impact on the cost of funding existing Government debt and would raise significantly the cost of the future Government debt that we need to raise in order to meet these enormous borrowing figures. I urge the Financial Secretary to give some indication as to the thought process that the Government have gone through and the cost involved should that unfortunate reduction in rating arise&#151;of course, none of us wishes that to happen.</p>

action to try to revive the economy, that we have seen in our political lifetimes. It is astonishing that the Government have not been prepared to stand up and debate in this House why the quantitative easing measures that they have proposed, and are implementing through the Bank of England, are the right approach to take. Those measures are referred to, as it were, in parenthesis alongside other debates about the economy, but we have not had a significant debate on quantitative easing, and that is highly surprising.

The reasoned amendment highlights the inconsistency of the Government&#146;s approach to pensions, as evidenced by the measures in the Bill. The Government took a relatively mature approach to the self-evident looming pension crisis. The introduction of the new regime on A-day only three years ago was detailed and considered. It followed detailed and prolonged industry consultation over the previous 18 months by Lord Turner, who has now been promoted&#151;if that is the right word&#151;to chair the FSA. The Turner review was a reaction to a demographic challenge and medical improvements. The problems in the pension industry had been compounded by the impact of the previous Chancellor&#146;s assault on pensions in 1997, and the consequent collapse in savings, which all contributed to the time bomb in pension provision in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para6"><a name="09050684000122">The Turner proposals were adopted more or less wholesale by the Government as a start in encouraging greater self-responsibility for pension provision, but the measures in the Bill demonstrate a significant reverse in that approach.

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09050684000126">The language that the Treasury used is extremely revealing, talking as it does of fairness between schemes. One consequence of the measure to restrict income tax relief for higher-rate taxpayers is to focus attention on the increasing disparity between final salary and defined contribution schemes. There are, of course, fewer beneficiaries of final salary schemes than there were when the Government took office. The figures that I have do not go back quite that far, but in 2000, 18,100 defined benefit schemes were open to subscription. By 2007, that had declined to a mere 2,370 schemes still open for members. The number of members in those defined benefit schemes declined over that period from 8.6 million to 6.2 million, meaning that nearly 2.5 million fewer people were on defined benefit or final salary schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para9"><a name="09050684000127">Almost all that decline came from the private sector. At the end of 2007, there were only 1.3 million members of private sector defined benefit schemes, whereas in the public sector there are still 4.9 million members in final salary schemes. A further 1.8 million are still in schemes that continue but have been closed to new members. The vast majority of those closed schemes are, of course, in the private sector, with some 1.4 million people still in final salary schemes that are now closed to new members. That illustrates the scale of the decline in pensions presided over by this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para10"><a name="09050684000128">I labour this point because the capping measures for high-income earners and the forestalling measures that were referred to earlier in the debate will merely accelerate the trend away from final salary schemes. That will apply mostly in the private sector, leaving the public sector final salary schemes increasingly exposed to public scrutiny and criticism, which I expect has not even occurred to those on the Government Benches. That will expose the increasing lack of fairness. Those who are still entitled to final salary pensions will be protected not only from the mortality risk but from the investment risk, whereas those who are in defined contribution schemes will continue to have to bear both risks in the pensions that are ultimately paid out to them. Decreasing mortality means lower returns for defined contribution schemes, because providers have to assume that we will all live longer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para11"><a name="09050684000129">By taxing contributions at 20 per cent. on the way into schemes&#151;the defined contribution schemes of the vast majority, as contributors to such schemes by definition have to pay in a much higher proportion of their salaries than those on final salary schemes, particularly in the public sector&#151;as well as income received from pensions on the way out, there will be an increasing disparity with those who remain in final salary schemes who are high earners. We are talking about a relatively small number of people who will be affected, but the fairness issue applies across the final salary scheme membership. This measure will require considerable debate within and between Government and Opposition to ensure that there is fairness in the way in which that provision applies to those who are fortunate enough to be in final salary schemes.</p>

present at a meeting yesterday of the British Retail Consortium, held in Portcullis House, at which I was also present. It was quite clear that she was seeking to give the impression to the retailers present that the proposals for the termination in the cut in VAT were not set in stone. At that meeting, and again in the House, she referred to the fact that HMRC is prepared to engage in active discussions with retailers to seek to mitigate any problems that arise. That reverses the intention of the provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para13"><a name="09050684000131">The provisions are designed to provide the sort of certainty that my hon.

Members have said. The Chief Secretary has just thrown that into confusion by suggesting that HMRC would be flexible in its interpretation. I am not sure whether that extends to being flexible in its interpretation of when the month of December ends, as many retailers have a month-end that is not coterminous with the calendar month end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para14"><a name="09050684000132">As has been said, on 31 December many retailers will be in the height of the early days of their post-Christmas sale, as such sales now tend to start not on 1 January but on Boxing day or even before that. A great deal of price-changing will therefore be going on in the run-up to the change proposed by the Chancellor. That is entirely characteristic of this Government, who have sought to introduce a measure without thinking it through properly, and without consulting in advance those people who are likely to be most affected&#151;a measure that will have the consequence of creating, as the Government did when they first introduced the VAT cut, a considerable added burden of work and expense for the retailers whom they think they are benefiting.</p>

Retailers typically change their prices over a weekend. Major companies can do it all on a computer programme. Small retailers have to go round sticking all the prices on the goods themselves. That is a very labour-intensive process. It is costly for the retailer. They have to do it, typically, at night or on a Sunday, so they are paying overtime. That is not an easy thing to do in the middle of a very busy trading week. If I sound slightly anxious about that, it is because, having been a retailer, I know something about it.</p>

many others&#151;thankfully, a smaller number&#151;will not be able to take advantage of it, because although the scheme is estimated by the Government to apply to some 14,000 businesses, it will apply only to those which have lines of credit insurance in place on 1 April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para18"><a name="09050684000136">I am sure that Members will have received representations from businesses trading in their constituencies from whom credit insurance was removed prior to 1 April, as I have done. Some of them are quite significant companies. I am thinking of one that is a supplier to a major high street chain. That chain had its credit insurance lines pulled in the first quarter of this year, which means that hardly any of its principal suppliers are able to supply goods to it. It is still trading, somehow, but the arbitrary 1 April cut-off date means that a number of businesses that are trading adequately will find it increasingly difficult to continue trading if they are not able to get goods on the shelf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para19"><a name="09050684000137">I accept that the Government do not want to put themselves in the position of assessor of credit risk; that is a job for the banks and the credit insurers. However, the Government ought to have listened to some of the voices that said, way back at the beginning of this year or the end of last year, that such a measure was vital to keep businesses trading. Indeed, in January the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform publicly stressed his concern about what he called the &#147;immense financial distress&#148; placed on companies as a result of the loss of such cover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para20"><a name="09050684000138">It seems regrettable that despite all the discussions that took place in the first quarter of this year and at the back end of last year, the Government did not think to introduce the measure then. Perhaps that is because it is somewhat close to the national guarantee scheme proposed by Conservative Members, and the Government did not want to be seen to be taking up yet another of our ideas. To emphasise my point, I will quote Jane Milne, business director at the British Retail Consortium, who was present at the meeting yesterday. She described the scheme as</p>
<a name="90506-0019.htm_brev2"><a name="09050684000146"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;much needed but...too little too late. Matching the trade credit insurance that private insurers are willing to provide is vital to helping fundamentally sound businesses weather the recession. But the unannounced detail confirms this safety net will be denied to companies whose cover was cut before 1 April, meaning the plight of many is being ignored.</p>
</ul><a name="90506-0019.htm_brev3"><a name="09050684000147"><ul><p class="tabletext">For retailers to survive and keep people in work they need to keep shelves stocked with the goods customers want. Insurers began removing cover as the downturn started to bite this time last year. The Government&#146;s scheme should apply from then&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09050684000139">that is, from 1 April 2008, rather than 2009. Again, I hope that the matter can be taken up in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para22"><a name="09050684000140">To conclude, there are measures missing from the Finance Bill that would help to address some of the vital shortcomings in the Government&#146;s approach to tackling the economy that I identified at the beginning of my remarks. There are hardly any measures in the Bill to encourage entrepreneurial incentive. There is a modest measure for increased capital allowances, but that really applies only to existing businesses, not to those that are growing significantly, although it might help in some isolated cases. There is very little help in the Bill for small businesses, the lifeblood of our economy, from which all big businesses emerge.</p>

That is because they see the approach that the Government are taking, which is not to encourage entrepreneurial activity in this country. That is a great worry for this country, as is the question of how we will be able to weather the recession and retain a strong level of employment in years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para24"><a name="09050684000142">Secondly in my concluding remarks, there are very few measures in the Bill to encourage savings, and they are complex. Why was the welcome increase in the individual savings account limit staggered over two six-month periods? It defies any kind of sensible logic. I hope that that, too, will be pressed in Committee.

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90506-0019.htm_para25"><a name="09050684000143">Thirdly and finally, the Bill betrays a lack of competence at the heart of Government in handling the economy. We have seen what has happened to the public finances over the past 12 months. That tells a story in itself. There is a complete absence of vision on the Government&#146;s part as to how they will be able to drive the economy out of the mess that they have driven it into. If they are incapable of vision to get the economy going again, they should go themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="90506-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09050692000005">That is what I would address, but first let us look at the situation in the Government&#146;s terms. They have invited us to support a Finance Bill based on two worrying propositions&#151;first that they should spend that much, which I do not think they should, and secondly, that they should raise so little, given the amount of spending that they wish to do. In their own terms, if they wish to do all that spending and, unlike me, think that every pound of that is providing value and is much sought after by taxpayers, they should be prepared to be honest with the House and say, &#147;That&#146;s the bill, and we need to raise more in taxes, not next year, the year after or when there may be another Government in place. We need to be honest with the public and raise some more money in taxes this year to meet all those spending bills.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="90506-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09050692000006">So why, then, do the Government not do that? Obviously, because there is a general election coming up and they know as well as any other elected politician that increasing taxes is very unpopular. As their cover story, they claim that their spending is reflationary, and that it will be good news for jobs and for the economy if this year&#151;by coincidence, a pre-election year&#151;they spend so much more than they raise in taxes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="90506-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09050692000007">The economic effects of forcing savings from people are similar to the economic effects of taking taxes from them. If the Government are serious about borrowing all that money from individuals or from companies in the United Kingdom private sector, it has more or less the same effect as if that sum were taken off in tax, because for every pound that they borrow from the UK private sector for this so-called reflationary spending, the private sector has &#163;1 less, so it cannot provide the jobs or buy the goods that it would otherwise use that money to do. It is, instead, providing it to the Government. In their own terms, their argument for under-financing their huge expenditure by such a big margin is unlikely to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="90506-0020.htm_para6"><a name="09050692000008">That is not the only thing that the Government have done in their desperate and belated attempt to turn around the massive recession that their policies, allied to problems throughout the world, have undoubtedly created for Britain. I am strongly of the view that it was policies made in Britain that made the banking crisis so bad here, and that the manic and deliberately perverse monetary policy that the Government and the authorities followed first created a bubble, then created a crash, and is now desperately trying to find a way to reflate and inflate from the crash site rather late in the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="90506-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09050692000009">Monetary policy is an extremely powerful weapon, however, so the heavy lifting to try to turn the economy around will be done not by the Budget, because it will not be nearly as reflationary as the Government suggest, but by having interest rates at almost zero and by gradually nursing the banking system back to strength. I am not a gloom-monger who says that we are going into a 10-year depression and never going to come out of it; monetary policy is very powerful. The reason why we are in crash mode is that the monetary authorities got their monetary policy completely wrong by being far too tight in 2007 and at the beginning of 2008. They are now trying to produce a much looser monetary policy, which started last autumn, and in due course that will definitely have a beneficial impact. It will start to lift some of the gloom, slow the rate of decline and in due course, if other things do not get in the way, turn things around from their current very bad position.</p>

We all live in this country, we want it to do well, we wish to see more of our constituents with jobs and more businesses to flourish, and we wish monetary policy well. We are more worried about the impact of the Budget, because its tax measures will undermine competitiveness, enterprise and job creation at the margin&#151;or in some cases more than at the margin&#151;and that is not what the Government should be doing with a taxing Budget at this stage in a violent and unpleasant cycle.</p>

Friends therefore say that either taxes need to be higher or expenditure needs to be lower to secure a tighter Budget. They should bear in mind the fact that the Government are trying to load the dice in favour of their getting away with it for a few months, but that their Budget has a time horizon that stretches only until the next election. It is apparently set within the framework of wanting to get the next three or four years right, but nobody really believes the forecasts, and if we look carefully at the tax measures, we see that they take the form of a Tory tax trap. They are political taxes; they do not seriously try to fill the big void in the public accounts, even after the following election. They are in the Budget for illustration, and probably for spite. They are not there to deal with the colossal black hole in the figures.</p>

 I entirely agree, and I said that I would argue that I do not like some tax measures in the Budget, because they will make enterprise, jobs recovery and prosperity more elusive rather than easier to reach. Why, then, are the Government not more worried about the question posed&#151;that the gap is too big and that that will be revealed by their not being able to borrow all the money? There are two reasons. The Government think that they will get away with it for a few months, because they have instructed the Bank of England to buy up to &#163;150 billion of their own debt&#151;debt that they are issuing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90506-0020.htm_para11"><a name="09050692000015">It all means that if the full proposed quantitative easing plan is implemented, the Treasury and the Bank of England will be pretty relaxed about borrowing for the foreseeable future; they will not borrow anything net at all from other people, but will print the money or give it to themselves. They have another reason to be more confident than we might expect: their regulators are also instructing all the commercial banks to buy piles and piles of gilts, just to make sure. In the middle of this dreadful banking crisis and nasty credit crunch, the regulators have decided&#151;now, of all times&#151;to say that the banks need more cash for the amount of business that they are doing. If only they had thought of that rather good idea in 2005 or 2006, we would not have had to go through the whole grisly business of the crunch; there would not have been the &#147;run on the Rock&#148; or the uncertainties about some of the bigger banks. However, to implement the idea now&#151;when the banking system is much weaker and extremely cautious, and the worry is that it will not finance enough transactions in the economy to get things going again&#151;is rather perverse, to put it mildly.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is making a powerful point. Does he agree that at the time, voices such as that of the Governor of the Bank of England were making themselves heard? The Governor made it clear that he felt that debt levels were getting out of control and that the banks needed to act. The problem was that the tripartite arrangement set up by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor did not allow that action to take place. No mechanism was in place to enforce such measures.</p>

 That is exactly right. The tripartite mechanism was a dreadful failure, and it is the background to the Budget and these measures. The Government need to raise so much revenue now because the banking system went wrong; the banking system went wrong through a combination of foolish judgments by bankers&#151;that is clearly true, as I am sure my hon. Friend will agree&#151;and a catastrophic failure by the regulators, who were paid big salaries to sort out exactly that kind of problem. They were unable to control cash and capital in a way that smoothed the cycle. They were violently &#147;pro-cyclical&#148;, as the technical people now say; they reinforced the damage of the cycle by being far too easy on the banks in the good times and extremely tough on them in the bad times.</p>

However, the banks do not have to be instructed today to put so much extra cash into gilts, when we need them to lend a bit more and see business over the worst of the crisis. We now know, I trust, that the Government and the Bank of England are standing behind the banks. People have no reason to take their deposits out because they know that the lender of last resort is there. The Government stand behind the banks, so there is no need for the dramatic requirement for so much more in gilts.  <br>

We must assume that the only reason for what is happening is that the Government and the Bank of England think that it would be handy to have another enforced buyer in the market at a time when so much gilt-edged security is being issued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90506-0020.htm_para13"><a name="09050692000019">Some of the pension regulations achieve something similar from the now-rather-mature pension funds, thanks to the fact that the Government&#146;s taxation on pension funds has led to most private sector schemes being closed. When a scheme moves from being active and growing to being closed, the regulators normally say that the scheme must hold much more in fixed income, rather than in growing assets or claims on such assets. That also serves the Government&#146;s book rather well. Paradoxically, the effective wrecking of private sector pension funds in the past 11 or 12 years, through higher taxes and regulation, is now creating a demand for the very borrowing that the Government need to see themselves through to the election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90506-0020.htm_para14"><a name="09050692000020">Let me turn specifically to the tax measures in the Budget. The Government belong to the school of thought that says, &#147;Make us a bit more chaste&#151;but not yet,&#148; and takes the view that we can raise more revenue by putting rates up. I have already dealt with the first folly. We need to start to control spending much more immediately because of the longer-term strain on the accounts, but we also need to challenge the assumption that putting rates up in such conditions, or even in the conditions that will prevail in a year or so, will necessarily raise more revenue. The Treasury should be asked to do rather more work on what happens when there are increases and decreases in the rates on entrepreneurs and on people who earn significant salaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="90506-0020.htm_para15"><a name="09050692000021">I remember that the Labour party was full of grief when a Conservative Government dared, in two stages, to lower the top rate of tax on earned income from 83 per cent. to 40 per cent. Labour said that the Conservatives were letting the rich off scot-free, that it was a disgrace, and that they were helping their rich friends. The net result of that big change was to make us competitive again in a world where, when we had those very penal rates, people thought that we were a complete joke and not a place to come and do business. As a result of those changes, two important things happened. First, the rich paid a lot more tax. I think that that is rather good news. I would like the rich to pay a lot more tax, but the way to achieve that is to impose realistic, not penal, tax rates on them. Secondly, and even better from the Labour point of view, the rich paid a bigger proportion of tax. Not only did the economy start to grow faster, but the rich had to pay more.</p>

 There is a third lesson in what my right hon. Friend is talking about.

By setting very low rates on income and corporate profits, they issued a huge invitation. Many Irish people who had gone abroad to seek their living because they did not like the high tax rates decided to go back to their home country, and many businesses decided that Ireland was the right place to set up business within the European Union as a whole. Because the Irish had the courage to set those low rates, there was an explosion in tax revenues, which meant that they could spend more on public services, and an explosion in jobs and profitability.</p>

They are saying that it is right to raise the marginal tax rate from 40 per cent. to 50 per cent. on higher-earning people, to change the tax arrangements on personal allowances in an adverse way, and to tamper with the pension reliefs which were put in place some time ago and which people thought indicated a stable framework for long-term saving. Pensions are, by definition, very long-term investment and savings projects, and it is very disruptive to make such changes.

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="90506-0020.htm_para20"><a name="09050692000028">It is true that the figures that I have mentioned conceal two different trends. First, competitive rates mean that there are more rich people in the country, so in that sense there is a little trick in my figures. However, it is also the case that the rich people who are already in the country are more motivated to get richer. They make that extra commitment, work those extra hours and set up that new business, because they think it more worth while taking a risk with their money. They put their money to work rather more successfully and often, so, as my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) rightly reminded us, more activity is generated. I should like the Treasury to explore its rationale with us a little more.</p>

said in its immediate report after the Budget. It used the words &#147;considerable uncertainties&#148; about the yield from the tax rise. The Budget is already unravelling from the Committee&#146;s point of view, and surely the Government must address in this debate what it says.</p>

 That is absolutely right. The Treasury Committee has come to a very sensible view and asked the right sort of questions. Private forecasters are now saying that such a tax increase could actually reduce the amount of revenue by driving some rich people out of the country altogether, and making others work less hard or put less money at risk.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman said that this was a &#147;tax trap&#148;. I do not understand this concept of a trap. The Government come up with tax policies and the principal Opposition party has to decide whether it believes in those policies. If this is a trap, every single tax policy put forward by the Government is a trap. Surely, to follow the logic of his argument, this is a straightforward opportunity to vote on a point of principle. If he believes that the rise is such a disincentive for people to become wealthier, be entrepreneurial and work harder, surely this is an opportunity to vote against the Government. I do not understand why it is a trap.</p>

We don&#146;t actually think it&#146;s going to raise very much revenue.&#148; Perhaps they did not believe it would raise any at all. They saw it as a win-win situation for Labour. If the Conservatives voted it down, Labour would spend the next year going around the country saying, &#147;The only thing the Tories care about is rich people and their marginal tax rate.&#148; If the Tories voted for it, Labour would go around the country saying to people who might otherwise vote Tory, &#147;Look, the Tories are useless. They don&#146;t even stand up for your kind of proposals, and they aren&#146;t really the party of enterprise after all.&#148;</p>

It has pitted an important part of the business community against the Labour Government, because the business community is not impressed by their reneging on the clear promise that I remember them making at the last general election that they would make no changes to the overall rates of income tax at any level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90506-0020.htm_para24"><a name="09050693000003">The change has also pitted Labour MP against Labour MP. We know that the Blairite faction is extremely unhappy with it. The Blairites thought that the fact that the previous Prime Minister had accepted the Conservative settlement on tax prior to 1997 was a very important part of winning over floating voters in middle Britain whom Labour needed to win over to form a Government again. They believe that it is disruptive and a clear tearing-up of that element of the new Labour settlement that the Government have now decided to go from 40p in the pound to 50p. Indeed, at the margin it is rather higher than that if we take into account the changes to allowances, pensions, national insurance and so forth. Far from being a trap for the Conservatives, it has been another factor in the growing civil war between Blairites and the supporters of the Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para0"><a name="09050693000004">There will be those on the left for whom the change does not go far enough. They think that this crisis is a good opportunity to increase the rate to 60p, 70p or 80p&#151;the rates they were used to in previous periods of government. However, there are others on the Labour Benches who understand that in a globalised and footloose world economy&#151;whether we like it or not, we have to live with it&#151;it is all too easy for people with money, talent, capital or high incomes to say, &#147;I won&#146;t base my activity here any more, I&#146;ll base it somewhere else&#151;I&#146;ll go to Dublin, the Bahamas or Asia,&#148; because the Governments in those jurisdictions really want talented people and new businesses. There are jurisdictions that wish to give a home to businesses that might otherwise have been located in London or Britain. That is the danger that we now face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para1"><a name="09050693000005">In other respects, the Government claim to believe that putting a tax up means having less of something. For example, they are busily increasing the tax on gas-guzzling cars because they want fewer of them. They are also increasing the tax on drink, because they want people to drink less. Probably only the ministerial drinks cupboard will be well stocked at the new duty rates, because public spending is still in free flow, whereas other people are expected to reign back, which we are told is good for their health. The Government believe that increasing duty on tobacco means that people will smoke less and that fewer cigarettes will be sold.</p>

 I am paying careful attention to my right hon. Friend&#146;s argument. I wonder whether he would like to think back to the introduction of the single market and to what happened to the UK, with wine and tobacco coming into this country through smuggling, and whether, despite the drop in the value of the pound, the change in duty may be yet another way of increasing smuggling.</p>

 It could well be. As hon. Members will know, the drinks industry in particular is extremely unhappy about the change. At a time when the industry is struggling to maintain licensed premises and its general business, the Government are being far from helpful in their tax policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para2"><a name="09050693000008">My point is about the consequences of tax changes. In all the areas that I have mentioned, the Government quite rightly say that if they increase tax on something, there will be less of it, so why do they not think that the same applies to working hard? If we increase the tax on working hard, will there not be less of it? Will people not either do less or go somewhere else to work hard where the Government do not take so much money? The Government&#146;s proposed increases in taxes on doing things, such as drinking, smoking and so on, and on larger vehicles are in conflict with their wider statement about their wish to have a reflationary Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para3"><a name="09050693000009">If the Budget were genuinely about reflation, surely it would be best to lower taxes on things made in Britain that people might buy. We would not increase the costs of owning an expensive vehicle if we wanted to sell more expensive vehicles nor would we increase the taxes on drink if we wanted more people to work or even just survive in jobs in the drinks, entertainment or hospitality industry. There are contradictions at the heart of the Government&#146;s policy.</p>

 Another point that my right hon. Friend might want to address is the fact that the increases are regressive, because they hurt the poorest people in society, who spend a larger proportion of their wealth on things such as drinking, smoking and driving. A second point is that such increases do not really change behaviour, which is what the Government are trying to do, but are just an extra means for the Government to try to fill the black hole in their public balance sheet.</p>

<p><a name="st_o406"><a name="09050693000011"><a name="90506-0021.htm_spnew3"><a name="09050693000041"><b>Mr. Redwood:</b>
 That is absolutely right. Just as there is a contradiction between the Government&#146;s tax policy on the one hand and their so-called reflationary policy on the other, because some of their taxes will clobber jobs and business, so there is a conflict between their reasonable wish that people on lower incomes should have a better deal and the tax policies that they are pursuing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para4"><a name="09050693000012">The most regressive tax in the Budget is the fuel escalator. A lot of people on modest incomes need to use a car. They need to buy fuel, but often they cannot afford to buy the more fuel-efficient vehicles that better-off people can afford. The Government are deliberately targeting people on low incomes to pay more tax as some kind of penalty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para5"><a name="09050693000013">At a meeting earlier today, I heard about some of the plans for the water industry that I think may have the Government&#146;s approval. The implication was that we will have to pay more for our water because the Government want to raise revenue by selling off licences for extraction. We await the legislation enabling them to do that on a big scale, but they are doing it already on quite a big scale to pay the costs of the Environment Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para6"><a name="09050693000014">If that is a serious proposition, it is an even clearer example of what I and my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree have just described&#151;that those on the lowest incomes will face the biggest proportional increase in the price of a basic requirement that the Government believe should be rationed by price.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para7"><a name="09050693000015">The most obvious example of that involves motorists in London. Only extremely rich people are now able to drive regularly during the day in central London. Motorists have to pay &#163;8 a day out of their taxed income to use the road, as well as meeting all the fuel duty, vehicle excise duty and other costs incurred in running a car. In addition, fuel use in London is especially high because the regimes of the Government and the previous Mayor have made travelling around London freely extremely difficult, which increased the amount of fuel burned and therefore the cost for Londoners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para8"><a name="09050693000016">There is a strange conflict in this Labour Budget&#151;the party that wishes to be the party of the people is actually clobbering the people, and the poorer people are the more they get clobbered by specific taxes on things that they have to buy. The other dilemma is that a Budget that wishes to be reflationary contains a series of tax proposals that are anti-enterprise and anti-business, and which target specific sectors of the business community especially severely.</p>

want to inspect and audit us, and they assume that everyone is doing wrong until they can prove otherwise. I am afraid that the Bill is another example of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para10"><a name="09050693000018">The tendency is not confined to the Home Office and the hapless Home Secretary. What I have described is also being done by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his junior Ministers. The Bill has some tough clauses strengthening the powers of Revenue and Customs to intrude on lives and business and individual records, even when they have no reason to suspect that the people involved are criminals. The proposals will give people a very nasty feeling: they will make the relationship between state and citizen that much more unpleasant and put everyone on edge. They will also create extra cost and harassment of a kind that is very unpleasant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para11"><a name="09050693000019">I believe that the Government, in their own interests, should revisit the proposals before the Bill is finalised. Opposition Members have drawn attention to the problem. We do not like the proposals, and think that many of our law-abiding constituents will find them very irksome and unpleasant. Above all, however, the proposals that I have described do damage to the Government, because they reinforce the view that the state is all-bossy and wishes to be all-knowing. The Government seem not to trust anyone at all, but to believe that every taxpayer will be up to no good unless they take extremely draconian control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para12"><a name="09050693000020">I suspect that the Government&#146;s approach is the result of two things. First, it is the result of politics, because some Labour Members believe&#151;quite wrongly&#151;that all successful people are tax fiddlers who must be hounded out and purged. Secondly, it is the result of the Government&#146;s theory that they will one day find the crock of gold containing all the billions that the rich have been hiding all these years. The fact that they have not got to grips with the cash before means that it will be an easy, soft option for filling the hole in the accounts.</p>

I am sure that the intelligent Ministers realise that there is no such crock of gold&#151;if there were, Governments over the generations would have found it by now. It does not exist: to get out of the colossal deficit that is the centrepiece of and background to the Budget the Government either have to impose a lot more tax on everyone, or exert much better control over public spending.</p>

It is 433 pages long, with 61 schedules and 126 clauses. This becomes a burden in itself. How can business people, who are worried by the recession, trying to preserve the jobs of their work force and desperately trying to sell a bit more product and raise the quality of their service, be expected to get their heads round 433 pages of changes to tax law, some of which are extremely complicated? If they do not do so, however, the Government will say, &#147;There you are. These people aren&#146;t serious. They are not good directors and managers of businesses. They did not understand page 417 and they should have done.&#148; They will then use the new draconian powers to call people in for questioning, or worse. It is not fair to impose so much on people when they are desperately worried about the state of the markets and the state of their companies.</p>

in recession for ever; I think that, at some point, easier money works. However, I do think that this will be a very deep and long recession by post-war standards; it looks as though it is going to be the longest and deepest by quite a long way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para16"><a name="09050693000024">In my experience, the Treasury always gets the figures wrong both ways: it always underestimates the amount of revenue that will come in when the economy is growing a bit faster than it expects, and it always overestimates the amount of revenue that will come in when the economy underperforms. I fear that its models are not revealing just how big a drop in revenue there will be. There must, for example, have been a catastrophic drop in stamp duty, because there are so few housing transactions and because house prices are now 20 per cent. or more below the peak levels. There will also have been a very big drop in corporation tax. We know that some of the largest profit-makers of yesteryear were the banks, and that the biggest bank&#151;now a state-owned entity&#151;has managed to lose &#163;24 billion instead of making billions. Corporation tax revenue must be well down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para17"><a name="09050693000025">We also need to factor in a big reduction in dividend tax revenue. The banks accounted for a high proportion of dividends being paid; I think that they paid about a quarter of all the dividends on the all-share index in 2007. Some will now be paying little or no dividend, while others will find themselves in straitened circumstances, so there will be nothing like as much dividend income coming in from one of the big sectors. I suspect that some of the other cyclical sectors will also suffer big reductions in pay-outs and, therefore, in tax revenue.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is right; there might be a reduction in dividends from banks, which is why manufacturing industry could be important. There is a story running on Sky at the moment that there are problems with Tata and the negotiations over Jaguar Land Rover. That will certainly be important for the west midlands and for much of British industry. Perhaps we ought to have a statement on that.</p>

 That is a very helpful idea. Jaguar is another example of the conflicting attitudes in the Budget document, which contains tax increases that will hit people who buy those cars. Perhaps that will put some people off buying them. Perhaps that is a good thing; perhaps that is what the Government want. But why, then, should we consider subsidising a car maker to make vehicles that the Treasury is trying to prevent people in Britain from buying by taxing them off the road? That is another muddle that shows the conflict in the Budget between its reflationary intention to get people back to work and to retain jobs in companies such as Jaguar, and its spiteful intention to change behaviour and to increase revenues through tax increases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para18"><a name="09050693000028">My advice to the Government is that this should be a Budget about reflation, and this is therefore not the right Finance Bill before us today. In order to have a successful and well-based reflation, they need to be kinder to businesses, individuals, enterprise and jobs than they have been in these tax measures. Many of the proposed increases will make that recovery more difficult, and could drive people abroad and result in things happening that they do not wish to happen. They will also increase the amount of subsidy that they will have to pump into some of the companies that will suffer as a result of their tax measures.</p>

Treasury Ministers and I will strongly disagree on how to do that: I would reduce spending, while they would increase taxes. The Government need to tell us this evening how they would fill this black hole if they were to stay in government, because it is quite obvious from this Finance Bill that they have not put in place the range of taxes and the right tax breaks necessary to do so. To make it a little more difficult for them&#151;it is a very difficult problem, because they have created an enormously complex problem for themselves&#151;I would say that simply putting tax rates up will not necessarily be the way to fill the hole, even if they wish to carry on spending at this rate, because they are reaching the point at which revenues could be reduced because of a disincentive effect.</p>

Friend has just made some very powerful points. Is he conscious of the fact that the Treasury Committee report, which came out only a short time ago as the minutes are dated Tuesday 6 May, does not appear to tackle the true level of our Budget problems, as the amounts specified appear to be largely geared to what the Government said, which at least the three of us are quite convinced are hugely less than they should be?</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend. In providing the background to my comments I stated why I believed this to be the wrong Finance Bill as it does not tackle the magnitude of the problem. It is not just about the gap between the revenues and the spending of this year and next year, which is the main background to the Bill, because as my hon.

Pensions have to be included, as do the debt obligations and risks of the banks, the private finance initiative and public-private partnerships, Network Rail and the mortgage banks. Indeed, the lot has to be included if we are to have honest and accurate treatment, and if a finance director of a large company fails to do that, he goes to prison. It is quite simple. I know that they operate under different rules, but the markets out there are adjusting and they do not believe the figures that the Government are providing them with, so we are not seeing the beneficial impact on market responses that the Government want. I think that the Government would have more credibility and instil more confidence&#151;something we desperately need&#151;if they came up with a more honest set of figures that we could all use and view as broadly right.</p>

Friend&#146;s first question is &#147;Yes, he is absolutely right&#148;, while the answer to his second question is &#147;No, there is no chance of getting the message through to the Government&#148;. That task proved too much for the Chief Secretary, who I believe has been the worst Chief Secretary on record because she has not for one minute during her time in the Treasury succeeded in controlling public expenditure. I wonder how she dares to draw her salary, frankly, as she makes no attempt to control public spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para21"><a name="09050693000035">What I think we need in this Finance Bill&#151;and I hope my right hon. and hon. Friends will seek to achieve it as the Bill makes progress in Committee&#151;is this. We need a Finance Bill that says to the Revenue and Customs not &#147;Toughen your powers&#148;, but &#147;Understand that these are very difficult times&#148;, as businesses have other priorities. While crooks should not be allowed, there is a need to be understanding and to work sensibly with business; otherwise, more jobs will be lost and more orders will be cancelled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para22"><a name="09050693000036">I think we need the Finance Bill to be amended to say that we are going to try to optimise tax revenues by having competitive tax rates on business and incomes, not by plucking them out of the air for other reasons. We need to recognise that our corporation tax level is no longer competitive and that the Government now wish to set uncompetitive income tax rates. I think that we should try to tease out and clarify the Government&#146;s thinking on what they are trying to do with their increased taxes on drinks, cars, fuel and so forth. Are they trying to tax the poor? That seems to be what they are doing. Are they trying to reduce activity in those areas? That seems to be what they are doing. How does it square with what we were told was meant to be a reflationary Finance Bill?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para23"><a name="09050693000037">We need a lot of change in this Bill. I think that it is not a good Finance Bill for our current economic circumstances. The Government believe that they can get away with the borrowing in the short term, but if they were a decent Government&#151;if they were interested in the long-term success, strength and stability of this country&#151;they would realise that the gap between spending and revenue is simply too big.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para26"><a name="09050698000004">I begin with that foundation because it is the Government&#146;s balance sheet that gives me&#151;and, I think, the markets out there&#151;the greatest concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para27"><a name="09050698000005">I want to say a little about borrowing and debt. When the Prime Minister became Chancellor, he made great play of two important rules: the golden rule and the sustainable investment rule. The first said &#147;We must keep the debt-to-GDP ratio at about 40 per cent., which is an important benchmark.&#148; The second said &#147;We must not invest and then borrow more; investment and borrowing must balance over the economic cycle.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para28"><a name="09050698000006">The Government and the former Chancellor, now Prime Minister, set great store by those rules for a long time. As we have heard today, the Prime Minister talked a huge amount about ending boom and bust. In fact, he thought, like Canute, that he alone could hold back the tide of the economic cycle, and end boom and bust. When history is written, however, it will show that the Prime Minister whom we have today led the biggest boom and the biggest bust that we shall have seen for nearly a century. It was only a year ago that we saw public-sector net debt at 2 per cent. of GDP. Twelve months later, we pick up the Red Book and note that the budget deficit will be around 12 per cent. of GDP. That is a 10 per cent. leap, and represents a huge change in what the Government were saying a mere 12 months ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90506-0021.htm_para29"><a name="09050698000007">To make matters worse, in 1998 the Prime Minister said:</p>

We see that in 2013-14 the debt-to-GDP ratio in borrowing&#151;on-balance-sheet borrowing, that is&#151;will be 79 or 80 per cent. The Government keep repeating that that is within the realm of what we see in other G20 countries, but none of us are fooled. I have spent the first four years since entering Parliament trying to dig a little deeper. One of the things that scared me when Enron collapsed was the thought that occurred to me: &#147;Gee, I wonder how much the Chancellor&#148;&#151;the Chancellor of the day&#151;&#147;has put off balance sheet.&#148; After I began digging, about two and a half years ago I wrote a paper for the Centre for Policy Studies called &#147;Simply Red.&#148; That paper showed that for every &#163;1 that the Chancellor was putting on balance sheet, he was putting &#163;2 off balance sheet.</p>

 I do not want to interrupt my hon. Friend&#146;s flow, but I wish to ask what his view is of the reports from the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission, both of which recommended that all of these off-balance-sheet items should go on balance sheet.

 I am sure my hon. Friend is aware of the ONS statistics&#151;many of us have been studying them&#151;that demonstrate that there are matters that can be included and matters that can be excluded. Does he not, however, agree that in terms of public sector pensions it would be a brave Chancellor or Prime Minister who would get up and say, &#147;I&#146;m going to regard those as off balance sheet&#151;and, by the way, we are not going to pay them after all&#148;? The cost of public sector pensions amounts to &#163;1 trillion.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very important point, which has to do with the health of the country&#146;s finances. This is another case of, &#147;Do as I say, not as I do.&#148; The then Chancellor, who is now Prime Minister, always said that corporations must put their figures on balance sheet and we must see what are the real state of companies, but for some reason the Government were an exception to that. Regardless of whether the sums are on balance sheet or off balance sheet, it is important that somewhere in the Red Book, even if only in the footnotes, we see the true state of the public finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="90506-0022.htm_para1"><a name="09050698000013">We see in the Red Book that we will finally get some sort of a balanced Budget in 2018; that is when the public finances will begin to become balanced again. However, we must fast forward even further to 2023&#151;I have an 11-year-old son, and he will be 25 in 2023&#151;before we will finally achieve the Prime Minister&#146;s golden rule of 40 per cent. of GDP. That is completely unacceptable. This Budget and Finance Bill do nothing to try to accelerate our journey along that path.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="90506-0022.htm_para2"><a name="09050698000014">My second point is on growth. The growth figures seem to have been underestimated all the way through&#151;the economy shrinking by 3.5 per cent., rising to growth of 1.5 per cent. next year, and then a fantastical growth rate of 3.5 per cent. the year after that. Have the Government conducted any sensitivity analysis of those figures, however? What happens if the growth figure for next year is not negative 3.5 per cent. but, let us say, negative 4.2 per cent.? What happens if growth is not 1.5 per cent. next year, but is only 0.25 per cent. or flat? What happens if we do not achieve that magical, mythical 3.5 per cent. growth in two years&#146; time? What will happen is that we will have a larger black hole, and how will the Government set about fixing that?</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a very important point. The Government issued a Treasury paper some time ago suggesting that miraculously the trend rate of growth had increased from 2.5 per cent. per annum to 2.75 per cent. per annum. I have tried to adjust this for the straitened circumstances in which we find ourselves, where there is less migration in, less financial sector activity and a huge debt overhang that will have a big impact on the country&#146;s economy, and I concluded that the trend rate of growth could now be about 1.5 per cent. That is the context in which one must examine these rather bizarre forecasts.</p>

Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love), who is no longer in his place, challenged Conservative Members to come up with the areas in which we would make savings, and during this debate we have put forward at least three ideas: the very expensive national health service computer scheme, which is costing tens of billions of pounds; the identity cards scheme, which the Government are still pursuing despite its not being welcomed by anyone in this country; and the expensive quangos that the Government have set up over the past decade. He has asked us what else there is, but as I have pointed out, every few billion pounds adds up to a hell of a lot of billion pounds.</p>

The hon.

Member for  West Dunbartonshire (John McFall), in which Danny Blanchflower, who is a very respected member of the Monetary Policy Committee, pointed out that come June another 600,000 people will enter the unemployment rolls, because as our children finish school and graduate college they will find that there is no job for them. Thus, the unemployment figure will bounce up pretty quickly from 2 million or 2.1 million to 2.6 million, 2.7 million or 2.8 million. The economy moves slowly, so even if we were to believe any of the statistics, projections and facts presented by the Government, we will find that in 12 months&#146; time, when the next 600,000 young men and women graduate from school and college, we will have a huge unemployment problem that far exceeds having 3 million unemployed. This was the view of a member of the MPC&#151;it was not my view&#151;who said that the figure might not simply be 3 million or 3.1 million, but could reach a staggering 4 million by the end of next year.</p>

That is because many high tax earners, especially those who work in the financial services sector&#151;not in manufacturing, because that sector has shrunk to below 15 per cent. of GDP, perhaps even as low as 13 per cent.&#151;are mobile and they will leave. It is a competitive world and people will move where tax rates are more competitive. With one move, the Chancellor has said to those people&#151;to entrepreneurs and those who want to build up their businesses&#151;that he is taking away the welcome mat from UK plc.

whacking the industry with a 46 per cent. tax hike, will he at least agree to consider measures that the Conservatives have suggested to support bingo halls? For months, we have been proposing a modest increase in the permitted stakes for category B3 machines alongside a proportionate increase in the number of machines allowed in each establishment. Would that not give a real help to an industry that is finding life particularly challenging?</p>

Does the Minister fear that our proposal of a fair fuel stabiliser, as proposed early in the debate by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, would be a more appropriate way to address this issue? It would make life easier for consumers and also for the Treasury, because it would lead to greater predictability of what it receives over a cycle and help it to manage its Budget going forward.</p>

The Budget was more political than economic; it was a Budget of tax, borrowing and spend and has failed to put UK plc on a course that would balance the books and put us on the road to recovery.</p>

 It is indeed an honour and a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) in his expert exposition, and demolition, of both the Budget and this Finance Bill. If one conclusion has emerged from the debate this afternoon&#151;I have listened to many of the contributions, despite not being able to be in the Chamber, for which I apologise&#151;it is that every contribution has revealed a remarkable level of expertise. I commend the Members who have contributed.</p>

The Government have fallen into the trap that opened up in the South Sea bubble, or before the great crash of &#146;29. When we say that this is the worst recession since the second world war, I would point out that what immediately preceded the second world war was the great depression, so in essence we are comparing 1929 and 2009. I do not think that the Government have grasped that, and the scale of the problem that they face, given the proposals in the Bill.</p>

Or perhaps No. 10 and the Treasury are surrounded by an impregnable wall of arrogance, and nothing anyone says about the problems that our country faces can get through to them.</p>

The Budget was written hastily, as a response to the G20. It was meant to be a financial triumph. It has turned into a mish-mash of proposals that were a reaction to what happened at the G20 meeting and in the events leading up to it. The Finance Bill was produced very rapidly&#151;uncharacteristically rapidly&#151;thereafter.</p>

It was a dereliction of duty on the part of the Government to have put in place the forms of examination that they did.</p>

Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) pointed out, the Finance Bill should be setting us on the path to competitiveness for when we move out of the recession. We should also be building in improvements in productivity. Sadly, without those two bases, we will not even begin to be able to recover our position in the world&#151;the position to which Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Government of the &#146;80s restored us after the calamitous &#146;70s. The challenge that any incoming Government will face is to get us back up the competitiveness and productivity tables, so that we can deliver a better lifestyle for our people.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that those who will pay the highest price for the Labour Government&#146;s failures with the economy are those who depend on public services? Whoever is in power will see a limitation in funds in coming years.

 I agree with the general thrust of my hon. Friend&#146;s comments. It is absolutely crucial that the principal public services be maintained.

It is appalling that for the past 10 years, the Finance Bill has had to come in two documents, as I think that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) pointed out. Each year, every accountant, company director and finance department has to plough through the implications of an inch of new law. That is no way to create a competitive economy. We should go back to a simplified system. The Government should not micro-manage, giving a little bit here and a little bit there as they decide which way a company should go. It is up to the business to make decisions about its direction. The tax system should support those decisions, not hinder them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="90506-0023.htm_para1"><a name="09050698000051">The same argument applies to issues of productivity. Instead of being able to invest in systems that help our people to become more productive, the British economy is becoming ever less productive because of the expansion of the public sector overall. Sadly, unless and until we can change that whole approach to productivity, and take the dead weight of the public sector off the backs of those people who are delivering our wealth, we will not be able to deliver better living standards for our people.</p>

 My hon. Friend will understand that as an economy advances it becomes more complex, which is further complicated by the global nature of trade; that means that when Government pull policy levers, the results are less and less predictable. Will she invite the Minister, specifically in relation to the Finance Bill and the changes that it introduces, to consider whether those reactions to policy levers are likely to be as speedy as economic models currently used by the Treasury assume, or whether they will bring with them large deadweight costs, and what measurement the Government have made of those?</p>

Nobody, as far as I am aware, has referred to this: the ghost of Barbara Castle must be walking with her head in her hands through these halls, horrified at the damage that has been done to her occupational pension schemes.</p>

We talk about the disincentive effect on those who are genuine wealth creators, and I totally agree on that point. What we have failed to recognise, if I may gently point it out, is that that also impacts on head teachers and doctors&#151;the sort of people on whom we rely for our public services. They have no option of moving money offshore. They will be disincentivised from trying to deliver better education and better health.</p>

 I am grateful to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, but the scheme does interact with vehicle excise duty, which is in the Bill. We need to consider the impact of the two on the environment, because part of the purpose of the scrappage scheme and the vehicle excise duty changes is to try to reduce this country&#146;s carbon footprint. Reading the Bill, it seems to me that, owing to the law of unintended consequences, the scrappage scheme and the vehicle excise duty changes have the potential to make a greater carbon impact, because there will be disincentives to buying new cars and getting rid of old ones.

alcohol and tobacco markets significantly, because of smuggling. Obviously, there has been a reduction in the value of the pound, and it could be argued that some of that is counter-cyclical, so the attraction of smuggling will not be as great. However, there is already some evidence that the pound&#146;s value is changing, and these matters are very price sensitive. A long-standing friend, who was a very wise person and ran businesses throughout Europe, would say that, if the price differential was 6 per cent., nobody would cross borders, but that when it became 6.5 per cent. they would all cross borders. We will therefore see whether tobacco and alcohol smuggling rises up the political agenda&#151;again as an issue of unintended consequences.</p>

 Yes, indeed. The plain fact is that the application of tax and spend is different in each country, and countries claim in some fashion that that indicates national sovereign power. What they completely fail to tell you&#151;I do not mean you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I mean people in general&#151;is that actually the amount of manoeuvring room within the parameters that give rise to the differentials is still based on the same criteria, so we still come back to the requirements laid down in the Maastricht criteria. It is hardly surprising that I found myself voting against them and doing my utmost to undermine the arrangements that were put in place by John Major&#146;s Government.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is letting the Government off the hook.

Gentleman would be better off listening to his own Front Benchers, who seek to apportion at least a large proportion of the blame to the Prime Minister rather than give him the cover of saying that this was all the fault of people in Brussels and nothing to do with the Labour Government at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="90506-0023.htm_para19"><a name="09050699000019">However, I do have a little uncertainty&#151;I hesitate to use the word &#147;criticism&#148; of such a distinguished body of people as my own Front-Bench team. I wish that they would be a little more explicit about the extent of the debt that we have been talking about. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham said earlier&#151;I have a lot of sympathy with this&#151;that the figures can add up to as much as &#163;4.2 trillion. I have figures from the ONS, confirmed by the Library, that show that there is absolutely no argument about the fact that there is a minimum figure of &#163;2.2 trillion. They show also that if we include public sector pensions, which I do not believe any Government could refuse to underwrite, and private finance initiative projects, nuclear decommissioning, the banks and one or two other things, all of which are full commitments, the figure is a minimum of &#163;3.2 trillion, which is 200 per cent. of GDP. That is truly frightening, but it is also true. That is where the problem lies.</p>

Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) has produced an extremely interesting paper on climate change. I cannot recall the figures precisely, but the figures that we have been given and those that the ONS has given have not included the ones that my right hon. Friend gives on climate change, which run to more than &#163;1 billion. If we add all that up, it becomes clear that we are in need of a Finance Bill that will measure up to the requirements that are being imposed on the British people and by which, I am afraid to say, they are being gravely damaged.</p>

I should say&#151;we all know this&#151;that vast sums of money have also been ploughed into the administration of the health service. You represent a constituency that is not very far from mine, Madam Deputy Speaker.

 That is very kind of you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The point that I was making is that the amount of money that is going to be raised by the Finance Bill to pay for public services includes, to a great extent, money that is needed to remedy the problems in the health service that we are experiencing in Stafford hospital. Last night, I attended a meeting with about 300 people.</p>

<p><a name="st_o446"><a name="09050699000024"><a name="90506-0024.htm_spnew1"><a name="09050699000041"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b>
 Order. Important as what happened at Stafford hospital is, I now need the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments to relate to the content of this Finance Bill.</p>

 I could not agree more, Madam Deputy Speaker. I would simply say that ensuring the sorts of things that need to be adequately covered to deal with the debt problem that I have identified, however specific it may be, will require a proper degree of taxation that is fair and reasonable, but which does not undermine the commercial requirements of the companies that will be called upon to generate the necessary income and pay for the public expenditure to which I have referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para0"><a name="09050699000026">There are many aspects of the Finance Bill that it is important to consider. There are individual matters in the Bill that will take up a great deal of time. Because the Government have a built-in majority, those measures will be passed almost without exception, but given the scale of the debt that has to be covered they will contribute nothing to the well-being of this country. Therefore, this Government will continue to churn out legislation, to over-regulate and to place impositions on the enterprise society, which needs encouragement, not inhibition and obstruction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para1"><a name="09050699000027">Not only is the Government&#146;s failure even to carry through their manifesto promise on tax yet another example of how the Prime Minister and the Government are continuously losing authority and of how everything that he touches turns to dust, but it shows the range of their broken promises, some of which are in the Bill, which are a continuing indictment of the way in which this Government have conducted themselves. I firmly believe that the Finance Bill will be the final nail in this Government&#146;s coffin, that their hope of conning the British people into believing that, somehow or other, the vast debt that has been accumulated will be covered by the Bill or by any other measures is an illusion, and that they will stand condemned by the electorate when we get to the general election next year.</p>

A few years ago, I was on the Front-Bench Treasury team and he was a distinguished member of the Finance Bill Committee. He may recall that we discussed whether it was sensible to have targeted attacks on certain types of drinks, or to deal with alcohol in general. In his important contributions to the deliberations of that Committee he emphasised that we should not legislate in favour of one alcoholic drink over another beverage.

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para2"><a name="090506102000002">Those thoughts take me back to the time when my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham worked as a research assistant for me. He was still at the London School of Economics, and he worked extremely hard without remuneration. We were under the great, happy glow of the prime ministership of Baroness Thatcher. It was wonderful when my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) referred to the great baroness earlier. On Monday we celebrated the fact that it was 30 years since Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o449"><a name="090506102000003"><a name="90506-0024.htm_spnew4"><a name="090506102000068"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b>
 Order. There seems to be an outbreak of reminiscing. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can make his contribution, which I look forward to hearing, in the context of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_o450"><a name="090506102000004"><a name="90506-0024.htm_spnew5"><a name="090506102000069"><b>Mr. Chope:</b>
 Exactly, Madam Deputy Speaker, you anticipate my every word. Thirty years ago, Margaret Thatcher took action to get our country back on its economic feet. This Finance Bill stems from a Budget that does not add up, and as a result it will be some 30 years from now before we are able to get back to where we should be, having got rid of this enormous overload of debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para3"><a name="090506102000005">The figures are mind boggling. They show that the Government will borrow &#163;175 billion this year, and &#163;1.4 trillion&#151;a figure with 12 noughts at the end&#151;over the next four years. In last year&#146;s Budget, public net debt was expected to be 39 per cent. of GDP this year, but it is now estimate at 59 per cent. and likely to increase to 79 per cent. by 2013-14.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para4"><a name="090506102000006">Those debts are unaffordable. The question raised by this Finance Bill is whether the imbalance between expenditure and income should be met by further taxes on the people, or by reductions in Government expenditure. I have no doubt that the Government have got the balance in the Bill wrong. They are delaying the expenditure reductions and saving some of the taxation proposals for a rainy day, so that in the run-up to the general election they will not be so apparent as they would otherwise be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para5"><a name="090506102000007">I believe that this Finance Bill is so fundamental that we should have had a general election, so that it could be brought in by a new incoming Government. That is what has happened in Iceland: the Government there made a horlicks of the Icelandic economy&#151;probably not as great as the horlicks that this Government have made of our economy&#151;but at least they had the guts to go to the people and have a general election. That is exactly what should be happening here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para6"><a name="090506102000008">There is a big gap between income and expenditure. One of the more important documents that I have seen over recent days is an article in last Thursday&#146;s <i> Financial Times</i> written by my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis). I am not going to refer to the whole article, but his conclusion is apposite to what we are discussing today. He said:</p>

They know that these issues will determine whether we slip unhappily into a miserable future in the economic second division, or find a route back to the vibrant and competitive economy we once were. They do not believe this government has the courage to tell them the truth. They are waiting for one that will.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para7"><a name="090506102000009">That sums up very succinctly the situation that we are in at the moment. When people ask us what we would do to reduce public expenditure if we were in government, it is only fair that we should be able to give them answers. Earlier in that same article, my right hon. Friend did just that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para8"><a name="090506102000010">Ultimately, the way to reduce public expenditure is to create a climate in which the affordability of public expenditure can be questioned. In last week&#146;s press, we saw a commentary from a former Labour party adviser suggesting that 20 per cent. cuts in public expenditure should not be unthinkable. If we could create a climate in which people thought along those lines, we really would be able to make an impact on public expenditure and thereby reduce the taxation burden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para9"><a name="090506102000011">Ireland is another country that has had a bit of a tough time in this economic downturn. There, they are reducing civil service pay by 10 per cent., and I think that Members of Parliament in the Irish Republic have also voluntarily taken a 10 per cent. reduction in pay. That might be saying the unsayable, or thinking the unthinkable, but that is exactly the kind of thing that is going on in the private sector at the moment. I have visited firms in my constituency where the workers are unable to work the hours that they used to, because they are on short-term working or losing their jobs altogether, and where the basic rates of pay and salaries are being reduced. Meanwhile, we have a burgeoning public sector and the Government are saying very little about how they are going to make the public sector affordable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para10"><a name="090506102000012">A lot of the proposals dealing with tax in the Finance Bill will create unaffordable tax burdens on the British people. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham referred to fuel duty and vehicle excise duty. Before the Budget I had hosts of letters&#151;as I am sure many hon. Members did&#151;saying that there had already been an increase in fuel duty in April and that the Government must surely recognise that that was an additional burden on the hard-pressed motoring public, for whom vehicle use was a necessity rather than a luxury. What did we get in return? This so-called listening Government have announced a further increase in fuel duty on 1 May, followed by a further one in September&#151;or is it October?&#151;another one in April, and so on. It is totally unacceptable that the Government should fleece the motorist in an attempt to find a solution to the imbalance that they have created for themselves in the economy between public expenditure and income. Increasing fuel duty does not correct that imbalance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para11"><a name="090506102000013">I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench will give us the opportunity to vote on some of these issues through amendments to the Bill in due course. The Government are proposing to burden the aviation industry a bit more, and to burden local taxpayers by increasing by a large margin the tax on waste products going into landfill. All those taxes have consequences&#151;burdens on ordinary hard-working families.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman clearly speaks with great passion about these issues. He wants measures in the Finance Bill to cut taxes, or at least not to increase them, and I think I am right in saying that he wishes to bring down markedly the very large Government deficit. He has also said that he is favour of cutting Government expenditure, so by how much would he cut it?</p>

 I have personally never been in charge of the Treasury, but I was for a time the leader of Wandsworth council, which was in a sense a little, local Government. When faced with a similar situation in about 1981, when there was a financial and economic crisis, our council found that resources coming in from the Government were going down and it saw affordability issues in respect of local taxation from households and businesses. In those days, of course, we had business rates that were a great burden on entrepreneurs. What happened then was that we as a council reduced our expenditure by some 20 per cent. in one year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para12"><a name="090506102000016">Last night, as it so happens, I attended a reception at Wandsworth council to celebrate its 31st year under Conservative control, and it still has the lowest council tax in the country.

 I would like the hon. Gentleman to engage with a bit more focus on this particular point. A number of Conservative contributors to this debate have said that they believe that the Government are taxing too much and that they are very concerned about the size of the budget deficit. That seems to lead to the conclusion that there would have to be significant spending reductions. What those reductions would be, however, is rather hard to discern. Is the hon. Gentleman really saying that at the next general election the Conservatives will propose to cut public spending by 20 per cent.? If so, that is something in the region of &#163;130 billion less annual public spending than the Government are proposing.</p>

 I cannot predict what reductions in public expenditure will be needed by the time we have an incoming Conservative Government, but one thing I do know is that the longer that is delayed, the more drastic the measures will have to be. That is why I think we should have had a general election now; then we would have had a Government with the courage to face up to the necessity to control public expenditure now rather than at some time in the future. The hon. Gentleman may think that I am ducking his question, but I am being quite open in saying that we have to start talking in public about reductions in public expenditure of that sort of order if we are to be able to match our deeds to the climate of austerity that may be required.</p>

 I would like to congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his honesty. If we heard the same honesty from the Opposition Front-Bench team, that would be highly commendable. The hon. Gentleman is known for his views, and we know precisely what sort of cuts in public expenditure he wants a Tory Government to undertake. The cuts that he talks about are undoubtedly those that such a Tory Government would carry out.</p>

<p><a name="st_o458"><a name="090506102000022"><a name="90506-0024.htm_spnew13"><a name="090506102000077"><b>Mr. Chope:</b>
 I was not here for the earlier part of the debate, but I imagine that the hon. Gentleman asked his own Front-Bench team whether they would do what was necessary in order to balance the books. I do not know what answer he got. The issue at the moment, however, is that if we do not reduce public expenditure, the burden on hard-working families will be even greater. That is a point that I made earlier in the year, when I introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill on employment opportunities. As I said then, the minimum wage is currently &#163;5.73 per hour. That equates to an annual income of &#163;11,918 for a 40-hour week, but results in a tax and national insurance bill for &#163;1,887 a year, leaving take-home pay at only &#163;4.82 an hour. In other words, &#163;1 an hour has been taken away from what the Government have said is the minimum needed to live on. The issue here is affordability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para13"><a name="090506102000023">I shall not refer to all the tables in the Red Book, but one of them deals with allowances, which are, I believe, the subject of clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill. According to that table, in 1996-97&#151;the last year of the Major Government&#151;the personal allowance for an individual was &#163;3,765. This year it will be &#163;6,475. The Government are saying that they have been able to increase the proportion of their earnings people can keep for themselves by some 75 per cent., but the problem is that meanwhile they are bragging about having increased public expenditure by 100 per cent.&#151;doubling it&#151;in the same period, thereby denying people the opportunity to have more money in their pockets to spend as they wish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para14"><a name="090506102000024">The position is bad enough for people on relatively low incomes, given that the personal allowance now applies at some &#163;5,400 less than what would be the minimum wage for someone working a 40-hour week. However, that problem is small compared with the problem further up the income scale, where people move from the basic to the higher tax rate. Back in 1996-97 the basic rate limit was &#163;25,500. In the current year it will be &#163;37,400. That is not an increase of 75 per cent., as with the personal allowance, but an increase of only about 40 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para15"><a name="090506102000025">People who might be described as being on middle incomes are being savaged by increases in what are, in many cases, stealth taxes. The Government do not go up front and say, &#147;The reason why you are paying so much more in tax is that we have refused to index your allowances in line with inflation&#148;&#151;let alone earnings. The burden on what might be described as the most productive part of the economy is becoming unbearable, unsustainable and unaffordable. We have reached a point at which people are saying, &#147;Why bother to work?&#148; because so much of their extra income will be taken in tax.</p>

our captains of industry and key professionals and entrepreneurs, but I shall not concentrate on that question. A much larger number of people will be adversely affected, as is strongly reflected in my constituency. I am thinking of those who might be described as ordinary hard-working families, who say that they cannot afford this Labour Government and want a general election now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para17"><a name="090506102000027">I hope that we shall have an opportunity to table amendments to clause 2, which deals with the income tax basic rate limit for 2009-10, and, obviously, to clause 3, which is related. As for clause 4, it appears to me that the Government think it would be reasonable in 2010-11 for someone earning &#163;100,002 to pay back &#163;1 of the last &#163;2 in reduced personal allowance. In addition, they would have to pay 40p in the pound for each of those &#163;2, so that would be another 80p gone. There would be nothing left for them. Some Labour Members may welcome that, but that is the politics of envy. This takes us back to the very high marginal tax rates that the Conservative Government of 1979 had to deal with so quickly when they first came into office. I hope that an incoming Conservative Government in the future will do exactly the same, but I respect the fact that a judgment must be made; until we know when the election will be and we then see the books, we cannot make a decision on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para18"><a name="090506102000028">It is great to be able to participate in an open-ended debate, as our speeches in this House are often restricted because of the Government&#146;s inability to face up to the fact that democracy involves debate and the exchange of views across the Chamber. Discussion of the Finance Bill is the only occasion when Back Benchers are able to have such a debate, and I am pleased to be able to participate in it. I hope that my Front-Bench colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham, will not feel inhibited about the length of time that he can take to respond to the debate, and I also hope that the Minister will respond to all the points that have been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="90506-0024.htm_para19"><a name="090506102000029">I expected my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) to refer to clause 56, which deals with MEPs&#146; pay, allowances and pensions under the European Parliament statute. The clause takes us back to other Government broken promises, such as the fact that they promised a referendum but did not give one, and that they promised not to increase the higher rate of tax but are doing just that. It also takes us back to the fact that the people who promote the Lisbon treaty want to move towards having a country called Europe. Fortunately, there is not a country called Europe at present, and as a result, although the salaries of MEPs will be paid by something called the European Community, the explanatory notes on clause 56 state that we do not have a double tax treaty with the European Community because it is not a country, so we have to legislate specifically for this. It is not a territory, and that is why clause 56 is in the Bill. I hope that in due course my hon. Friend the Member for Stone will have a chance to look into the constitutional implications of that.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope), who correctly said that I used to work for him when I was at the London School of Economics. The hon.

Friend also reminded me of my first outing on a Finance Bill, in 2002, and the first long debate on the Bill was about alcohol duty. I did not realise that alcopops were the flavour of the month at Christchurch Conservative club, and Britain&#146;s high commissioner to South Africa, who was a Treasury Minister at the time, explained that the drink that we all knew as WKD was actually known by young people as &#147;wicked&#148;&#151;it was an educational process for us all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para1"><a name="090506102000036">I thought that my hon. Friend&#146;s forensic scrutiny of the Bill was a bid to join the Public Bill Committee, and if he wishes to participate, I am sure that we will find a place on it for him.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and my hon. Friends the Members for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), for Poole (Mr. Syms), for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne), for Braintree (Mr. Newmark), for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), for Stone (Mr. Cash) and for Christchurch all made excellent speeches, and that is an impressive list of Back Benchers.</p>

the views of a number of economic forecasters&#151;the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and a range of others. He was perhaps the only person, apart from the Chief Secretary and the Financial Secretary, who was wholehearted in his support of the Budget tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para4"><a name="090506102000039">One of the themes that recurred was kicked off by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead&#151;the scale of public debt and the fact that the Chancellor announced in his Budget last month that borrowing for this year would be &#163;175 billion and for next year would be &#163;173 billion. It is right that in a Finance Bill debate, in which we debate measures relating to the national debt and public finances, we discuss the size of the national debt and what can be done to bring it under control. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead talked about the need for proper spending controls and the need to establish some control over Government spending. He referred to the lack of discipline in the Government&#146;s finances and remarked that the only discipline imposed on the Government is the gilt markets&#146; decision about whether not to fund the Government&#146;s borrowing. Although the Government intend to borrow, in terms of national debt, &#163;175 billion this year, their funding requirement is way in excess of &#163;200 billion. It is worth remembering that today the Treasury Committee produced its report on the Budget and was critical of the Government and the lack of any fiscal discipline and rules in place. It said, in its recommendations:</p>
<a name="90506-0025.htm_brev0"><a name="090506102000064"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We do not see how the Temporary Operating Rule acts as any kind of constraint at all on the current fiscal decisions made by the Chancellor, and we struggle to imagine any course of action he might have taken in this year&#146;s Budget that would have been inconsistent with it...It is clear to us that the only real financial discipline that is currently imposed on the Chancellor is the opinion of the gilt market on the sustainability of the public finances.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para5"><a name="090506102000040">Several hon. Members expressed concern about how the Government&#146;s funding requirement would be met. The hon. Member for Edmonton, who met the Debt Management Office this morning, was convinced that the funding requirement would be met, but we already know that the DMO has changed its method of placing Government debt to try to maximise the chance of success in funding the debt. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham explained that, given the quantitative easing programme embarked on by the Bank of England and its appetite for buying up gilts&#151;and the reforms to the liquidity rules that the FSA has announced recently&#151;that will provide another source of demand for debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para6"><a name="090506102000041">It is clear from the speeches in this debate, from both sides of the House&#151;including the hon. Members for Taunton (Mr. Browne) and for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) as well as Labour and Conservative Back Benchers&#151;that the scale of debt and the time it will take to get it under control overshadows not only this Bill, but many Finance Bills to come. It will provide a real challenge to future Governments to get that level of debt under control.</p>

 Will my hon. Friend touch on the matters that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), my hon.

us believe that the percentage of debt is infinitely greater, because the greater the debt the greater the taxes, and the greater the reduction in public expenditure that will be needed. It is seminal to this debate, so could not my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) give at least a nod in our direction?</p>

<p><a name="st_o461"><a name="090506102000043"><a name="90506-0025.htm_spnew2"><a name="090506102000080"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reminding me of that very powerful point that he and others made during the debate. Clearly one of the areas in which there is huge uncertainty is the scale of the Government debt, both on and off balance sheet, and my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree has put together a paper to try to establish that. We have set out proposals for an office for budget responsibility, and one of its first tasks would be to quantify the true extent of Government indebtedness, so that we would know exactly where we were starting from, were we to form the next Government. We would then know the scale of the problem and could educate people about the challenges that we will face in tackling that debt. My hon. Friend the Member for Stone can be reassured that his thoughts have not fallen on deaf ears on these Benches. They may well have done so on the Government Benches, as the Government have always sought to deny the scale of the problem, but we have heard his message loud and clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para7"><a name="090506102000044">Two other themes emerged from the debate. The first is the failure of the Budget and the Bill to lay the foundations for the future. In a recession, a Budget should plot a clear path out of the economic crisis and prepare the economy for recovery. It should build the foundations for growth, a better climate for business and a better climate for savings and investment. That was the challenge that the Chancellor was set and the challenge that he failed last month. That failure in the Budget continues through into the Bill, which is a sign that the Government have run out of money, run out of ideas and run out of road. If we are to aid Britain&#146;s recovery, we need to make Britain a better place to do business, to retain businesses that are already here and to make Britain a prime location for inward investment. If we are to aid Britain&#146;s recovery, we need to tackle those problems so that the economy is built on sure foundations and not on shifting sands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para8"><a name="090506102000045">The Budget gave the Government the opportunity to do all that by rebuilding savings and investments. The question that businesses will ask is whether Britain is a better place to do business as a consequence of the Finance Bill. Let me give some examples of where I think the Bill lets down businesses. Although there has been a broad welcome of the introduction of the dividend exemption, there are concerns that the cap in worldwide interest is complex and costly to implement. I am afraid to say that even these reforms do not appear to be stopping the flow of companies moving their headquarters out of the UK to more competitive tax jurisdictions. Only last week, Informa, a UK listed company, moved its tax domicile out of the UK to Switzerland because it believed that its taxes would go up as a consequence of the reforms announced in the Finance Bill. Clearly, there is more work to be done to build on those reforms if we are to ensure that we have a competitive economy for the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para9"><a name="090506102000046">Another attack on Britain&#146;s competitive position in the Bill is clause 92, which requires senior financial officers to sign off that they maintain appropriate accounting systems. Many on the Labour Benches will  <br>

see that as superficially attractive, but it has been sprung on business without any consultation and on what would appear to be a ministerial whim. It is a bit of red meat to satisfy Labour&#146;s union paymasters, but there is a lesson from the States attached to it. We should pay heed in the aftermath of Enron to the changes that the US imposed on accounting systems and controls. They imposed huge new costs on business with few benefits, and as a consequence businesses left the US and came to Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para10"><a name="090506102000047">I believe that the provisions in the Finance Bill are yet another barrier to inward investment&#151;the knee-jerk reaction that puts businesses off being based in the UK. Although Labour MPs might cheer these provisions, it is sadly their constituents who will pay the price. Such moves undermine the attractiveness of the UK as a place to do business and create an impression of an unpredictable, uncertain tax regime where rules can change overnight on a ministerial whim. Being competitive is about more than just rates; it is about certainty and predictability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para11"><a name="090506102000048">The concerns that were expressed by my hon. Friend the shadow Chief Secretary about striking the right balance between the taxpayer and the tax collector impact on our competitiveness as businesses weigh up the benefits of different regime. Yes, the right regime of deterrents and penalties needs to be in place, but taxpayers need safeguards to ensure that those deterrents and penalties will not be used arbitrarily or unfairly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para12"><a name="090506102000049">What about the Government&#146;s attitude to small companies&#151;the vital engines for economic growth and the backbone of businesses in our constituencies? The Government increased the small companies rate of corporation tax from 0 per cent. to 19 per cent. and it is scheduled to rise to 22 per cent. In this Bill, the rate is held at 21 per cent. Businesses are asking whether it is still the Government&#146;s intention to increase the small companies rate to 22 per cent., and perhaps the Financial Secretary will answer that question when he winds up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o513"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para13"><a name="090506102000050">The message to businesses from the Budget and the Finance Bill is clear. The Government have done nothing to improve competitiveness, nothing to make their lives easier and nothing to encourage them to expand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o514"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para14"><a name="090506102000051">The Budget and the Finance Bill were also an opportunity for the Government to boost savings and savers. Radical reforms to the savings regime would help to build solid foundations for a sustainable economic recovery.</p>

 My hon. Friend has again referred to savings. What have the Government done for those millions of elderly people, many of whom are retired, who rely on their savings to lead a reasonable quality of life? Is it fair to have a bank rate of 0.5 per cent. for people who have been responsible and prudent, who have saved throughout their working life and who are making a contribution to the banks and other saving institutions to enable them to lend? Is it not time that this party&#151;Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition&#151;did something about it and announced what we are going to do?</p>

their point about savings and a number of our hon. Friends have talked about the plight of savers. Of course, the Opposition have put forward practical measures to help savers. That is why my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) and the shadow Chancellor propose that there should be real help now for savers in this Budget. That is why we have proposed increasing the personal allowance for older people by &#163;2,000 and scrapping the basic rate of tax on savings income for basic rate taxpayers. It would have helped those very people whom my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) was referring to, who are struggling to make ends meet because of low returns on their savings. And it would do more; it would send a clear message to people thinking about saving that there is value in saving for their future&#151;a message about taking responsibility and preparing their lives for economic uncertainty. It would help recreate a savings culture in the UK after a decade of neglect by this Government, who seemed to see the low savings rate as a badge of honour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para15"><a name="090506102000054">If the Government had welcomed our measures, it would have been a welcome boost for savings. But of course, unable to do the right thing, the Government resort to a gimmick. They have decided to increase the ISA limits for the over-50s this year to &#163;10,200. That means that ISA providers will have to change their systems, introduce new procedures for checking people&#146;s age and introduce special marketing materials and application forms for the over-50s&#151;all for one year only, because next year the Government will increase the ISA limit for everyone. Who on earth in Government came up with this hare-brained scheme to target the increase in ISAs on a small group of people, simply in search of a cheap headline on Budget day? That is one of the measures in the Budget that I think will actually put people off saving for their future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para16"><a name="090506102000055">The Government did understand at one point that a simple, straightforward and flexible regime for pensions would actually encourage people to save. That was in the reforms set out in the Finance Act 2004. It set clear limits on how much people could put into their pensions and gave increased flexibility; it reflected the reality of people&#146;s lives. Every Finance Bill since 2006 has unpicked those reforms, making the regime for pensions more restrictive and complex. Every time a change is made, it sends a clear message to savers that they cannot rely on the certainty of the tax system when making plans for retirement. If people cannot trust the stability of the tax system, why should they lock up money for the long term?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o517"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para17"><a name="090506102000056">So the Government have ducked the challenge on savings, too. They have ignored the opportunity they had in this Budget to rebuild the savings culture in this country.</p>

against the Bill tonight, so I do not wish to detain them too much longer before we give them the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o519"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para19"><a name="090506102000060">This Finance Bill is a Bill from a Government who are reaching the end of their life. They are retreating from the centre ground of politics back into the bunker. They are more interested in appeasing their core supporters than in building the foundations of a new economy by encouraging businesses. They lack the courage to do the right thing, so they resort to doing the easy things&#151;ducking the hard choices, leaving those decisions until after the next general election. The Bill is another sign of the collapse of this Government. We need a change to get Britain moving, and only a change of Government will cause that to happen.</p>

 We have had an interesting debate and I look forward very much to more lively debates with some of those who have contributed, in the House next week and upstairs in the coming weeks. But the backdrop, of course, to this year&#146;s Finance Bill is the worst crisis in the world economy since the 1930s. The world economy is forecast to shrink this year for the first time since the second world war. But the economy in the UK has benefited from a great deal of support over recent months&#151;the lowest interest rates we have ever had, additional support now from quantitative easing, and the stimulus introduced in the pre-Budget report, including the VAT cut, which, the evidence is now showing clearly, is having the effect that we hoped. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Of course I recognise that it is difficult for the Conservative party to eat humble pie and recognise that, as on so many things, they got their response on the VAT cut wrong, as they undoubtedly did. Speaking of humble pie, I just make the point that we have not heard much humility from the Conservative party in this debate. Nevertheless, evidence of the VAT reduction&#146;s effectiveness in supporting the economy is becoming clear, and is accumulating steadily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o520"><a name="90506-0025.htm_para20"><a name="090506105000002">My right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury quoted from a Centre for Economics and Business Research report in her excellent speech opening the debate. I have the report with me; it was written by Doug McWilliams, who used to be described as an adviser to the Conservative party. I do not know whether he still is, or whether he has been sacked for expressing his views. His note is entitled &#147;Credit where credit&#146;s due&#151;the VAT cut is working&#148;. He looks at the evidence, such as the figures on retail sales, and makes a compelling case. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I accept that it is difficult for the Conservative party to recognise the evidence as it gathers, but that is fine; the evidence will continue to accumulate in the coming months, and perhaps in the end even Conservative Members will recognise that they were wrong about the support that we have provided to the economy, as they are about so many other things. The hon. Members for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), and for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), asked&#151;</p>

 I will in just a moment. Let me first comment on the point about the date on which VAT will go back up to its original rate. We have heard Conservative Members start to ask, &#147;Couldn&#146;t we have this rate a bit longer?&#148; and I can understand that.  <br>

Implicitly, if not explicitly, that reflects the benefits of the VAT reduction. It is important that we increase the rate again, as we said that we would. It will go up again on 31 December, because the conversation that we have had with the British Retail Consortium and others has made it clear that certainty is the key. Given the very long period in which to prepare, a change on 31 December can indeed be delivered.</p>

<p><a name="st_o469"><a name="090506105000005"><a name="90506-0025.htm_spnew9"><a name="090506105000552"><b>Rob Marris:</b>
 I certainly agree that the VAT cut was a good idea and has worked. However, may I urge my right hon. Friend to look again at the ending date to which he referred, which has changed in the Bill from 1 December to 31 December? The Government may have talked to the British Retail Consortium, but if one talks to the pub industry, for example, which is very important in my constituency, one realises that many establishments in that industry will be open at midnight on new year&#146;s eve. Will my right hon. Friend assure me that the Government will at least have another look at that date?</p>

 I say to my hon. Friend, however, that the key is certainty. Whenever the change were to happen, there would be some businesses that would be open overnight. Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs will need to work with businesses and give advice about how to apportion revenue between the &#147;before&#148; and &#147;after&#148; periods. The key is certainty, and giving businesses ample time to prepare for the change.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The Bill underpins our commitment to the short-term support that people and businesses need to help them through the current difficulties, while laying longer-term foundations, so that we can make the most of the new opportunities that will emerge when the upturn comes. The Bill is about fairness, opportunity, and supporting businesses so that we can invest and grow our way out of the recession.</p>

Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), made a number of interesting points, and I want to deal with some of them in the time that I have. He asked a question about the tax rate on trusts. Rates were aligned in 2004 to prevent avoidance of the higher rate by routeing income through a trust. The trust rate will be increased in line with the higher rate, so we are not opening up opportunity for trusts to be used for avoidance. Those for whom the lower rate is appropriate can reclaim tax; many do so already. In the case of self-assessment, that will happen automatically. If, as was suggested, the trust is for a vulnerable beneficiary or a  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o522"><a name="90506-0026.htm_para1"><a name="090506105000012">On bingo, which came up in the debate, we have increased the rate of bingo duty, but withdrawn VAT on participation fees. The overall consequence of that is to reduce the rate of tax on bingo from 24 or 25 per cent. to 22 per cent. I am sure that change will assist those in the bingo industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o523"><a name="90506-0026.htm_para2"><a name="090506105000013">The shadow Chief Secretary welcomed the announcement in the Budget and in the Bill on foreign profits taxation, and I am grateful to him for that. He made the point that there had been a good consultation exercise, and I thank him for that as well. I hope he will have a word with the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban), who took a slightly different position in his winding-up speech. I agree that we have made an important announcement that will increase and improve the competitiveness of the UK.</p>

 I am happy to acknowledge the proper consultation that went on in relation to the foreign profits taxation, but can the Financial Secretary tell us why there was no consultation at all on clause 92?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may be referring to the requirement on accounting officers to confirm that their businesses have appropriate systems in place for assessment of tax. No doubt we will have some debate on that in Committee. The great majority of people will think that it is appropriate that companies give that assurance as a measure to help address the problems of avoidance, which were mentioned in the debate and which have been of concern elsewhere. It is an appropriate measure to ensure that companies are paying the tax that is due.</p>

I can confirm that civil servants on sufficiently high salaries will be affected by those changes. We were asked in the debate whether we would acknowledge the position of those who make regular but less frequent pension contributions&#151;less frequently than quarterly. I refer Members to my statement to the House on Budget day, in which I confirmed that we would examine that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o525"><a name="90506-0026.htm_para4"><a name="090506105000017">The shadow Chief Secretary asked whether we would use plea bargaining with tax avoiders. The Bill sets out the criteria for exemption from HMRC publishing people&#146;s names in the event that they deliberately evade taxes, which is a full disclosure, either unprompted or prompted, within a time frame specified by HMRC.</p>

Gentleman was right&#151;just last week we secured state aid approval for the venture capital trust scheme, but I caution him about looking at the prospect for relaxing some of the restrictions put in place in 2007. We will need to ensure that we continue to comply with state aid rules.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s refusal to commit his party to support for the Crossrail scheme. There is very strong support among businesses and, I thought, across the House for the Crossrail project. His unwillingness to commit to that will have caused widespread concern.</p>

I particularly enjoyed the bit where the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) felt that he had to leap to his feet to defend his party leader from the criticisms that the hon.

He is absolutely right to underline the need to plan for efficiency savings. We have announced that we will introduce &#163;5 billion of efficiency savings from next year, and they will be very carefully planned, as opposed to the slash-and-burn approach that we have seen from the Opposition. It is absurd for the Conservatives to demand &#163;5 billion in spending cuts this year without any attempt at all to identify where those savings would fall or what their effects would be.</p>

They failed to point out that a person on an average income of &#163;25,000 will pay 0.5 per cent. on the &#163;5,000 over &#163;20,000, equalling &#163;25 a year.

Would you confirm that the usual practice is to constitute the Committee stage of a Bill to reflect those who participated on Second Reading? If that is right, should not the Committee of Selection ensure that there is a majority of Opposition spokesmen and speakers on the Committee on the Finance Bill?</p>

 I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for awarding me this debate on housing investment in Stoke-on-Trent. I am also pleased to see the Minister in his place at this late hour and look forward very much to hearing his reply to my remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o544"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para3"><a name="090506110000008">Key to this debate is ensuring that the Government understand the importance of housing investment for the people and the city of Stoke-on-Trent. Its importance goes much further than just housing needs, great though they are. Housing investment is fundamental to the entire regeneration of the city and is also integral to wider Government efforts to stimulate growth in the west midlands. If we do not deliver in Stoke-on-Trent, we do not deliver in the region as a whole. I know that my hon. Friend understands that argument, because of discussions that we have had previously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o545"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para4"><a name="090506110000009">I also know that my hon. Friend understands that unless we ensure that housing investment is dealt with in the wider regeneration context, the homes that we build will not be fit for purpose. Homes must be placed in vibrant and sustainable communities where there is access to jobs, transport and amenities&#151;in short, in places where people can and do want to live. The people of Stoke-on-Trent are the best people in the whole country and they deserve the very best housing policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o546"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para5"><a name="090506110000010">It was in that context that my hon. Friends the Members for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello) and for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) and I recently met the Homes and Communities Agency, which has a key strategic role to play. From the meetings that we have had with its chief executive, we believe that the new agency now has an opportunity to get the right action plan for Stoke-on-Trent. Indeed, I would like to share with the House the agency&#146;s stated list of priorities. The agency will</p>
<a name="90506-0027.htm_brev4"><a name="090506110000053"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;align housing and regeneration resources to support growth, place-making and housing renewal, and form partnerships and joint ventures to help unlock investment in areas, including economic development, transport, education and health, to create sustainable communities that meet the needs of local people&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o547"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para6"><a name="090506110000011">I want us in Stoke-on-Trent to make that the core of housing investment policy. In doing so, it is vital that all the agencies involved, including Advantage West Midlands, work in partnership with us and with Stoke-on-Trent council to ensure that investment is co-ordinated, complementary and community led. Each agency has its own priorities, but the agencies must also recognise their mutual interests and the benefits of working together to pursue them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o548"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para7"><a name="090506110000012">That means that, first of all, we need Government action on the west midlands regional spatial strategy, which is a cause for concern and under review at present. The worst-case scenario for Stoke-on-Trent would be if a green light were to be given for building new houses on greenfield sites outside the heartland inner-city urban areas. I believe that that would undermine the careful and measured proposals from RENEW that would ensure that investment went to the areas characterised by market failure.</p>
<br>

<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>6 May 2009 : Column 319</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o549"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para8"><a name="090506110000013">Similarly, it would also be detrimental if the regional development agencies to which I have just referred were to prioritise the big, transformational projects at the expense of the smaller-scale initiatives such as the one in Burslem. I therefore want the Minister to give a clear message to the Cabinet and to the Minister with responsibility for the region that we need Advantage West Midlands to work with us on the housing investment priorities in Stoke-on-Trent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o550"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para9"><a name="090506110000014">I want to touch briefly on the importance of environmental and educational investment, and on how that fits in with the housing agenda. I am pressing Stoke-on-Trent council to submit an ambitious expression of interest in the community energy saving programme under the remit of the Department of Energy and Climate Change. If that is successful, it will lead to improved insulation and energy-saving measures in hundreds of homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o551"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para10"><a name="090506110000015">There is also a huge opportunity to get a Building Research Establishment centre of excellence located in Stoke-on-Trent, and I want that to be maximised. The centre would conduct much-needed research into improving the energy efficiency of existing homes, and would present a real opportunity to establish Stoke-on-Trent as a centre of excellence in the field. In turn, that would link in with the environmental, housing and jobs agendas, thus fulfilling the need to pursue the holistic approach to regeneration that I believe is crucial. I would appreciate any assurances that the Minister can give me tonight that the Government will work with the RDA and all other partners, including the European Commission, to make sure that the centre can go ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o552"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para11"><a name="090506110000016">I am also pressing for the Building Colleges For The Future programme to be taken forward on sites in both Shelton and Burslem, because we need apprenticeships that will produce construction workers with the skills and training to deliver new and improved housing. That would also foster the integration of the homes, work and skills that is so vital to the creation of vibrant communities. I really hope that the Minister, who perhaps has a greater say in these matters than anyone else, will be able to take forward that wider strategic framework for regeneration when he considers decisions over specific housing issues in Stoke-on-Trent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o553"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para12"><a name="090506110000017">I have only a short time available this evening, so I hope that the Minister will forgive me for not going into detail about the huge investment that has already been made under the decent homes standard and which has brought many council properties up to an acceptable level. I am very appreciative of the help that the Government have given through subsidising council rent increases this year, and I am also grateful for the &#163;66.4 million that they have given for housing investment in Stoke-on-Trent for the period 2009-11. However, the fact is that that is just not enough: more is needed, and I hope that the Minister will be able to do even more for Stoke-on-Trent when he comes to make his decisions this week or next.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o554"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para13"><a name="090506110000018">Why should the Minister do more for our area? At present, there are 9,105 people on the council house waiting list. Many are there as a result of tenure issues, but every case on the list tells a human story. We have just had the debate about the Finance Bill, and the Government have to tackle housing issues. More than 23 per cent. of private sector homes have a category 1  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="6 May 2009">

<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>6 May 2009 : Column 320</b><br>
hazard, and more than 60 per cent. of those are considered non-decent, so if ever there was a case for investment in housing in Stoke-on-Trent, this is it. There are something like 5,700 empty homes in the city, of which 3,500 have been empty for more than six months. I know that the Government have a strong record on dealing with empty homes, but we need to get that record directed and channelled into what is being done on the ground in Stoke-on-Trent. My colleague, Councillor Dave Conway, has done a lot to highlight this issue, and I understand that discussions are taking place about some kind of pilot project that could help us to reduce the number of empty homes by 1,500. I hope that the Minister will be able to look favourably on that, and find a way of helping Stoke-on-Trent to go about doing that work. Perhaps I should add that, as an honorary vice-president of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, I believe that environmental health can always assist the work that needs to be done on the ground in Stoke-on-Trent to a much greater extent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o555"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para14"><a name="090506110000019">Of course we have high levels of deprivation and worklessness, and a lack of choice in housing. We have two and three-bedroomed houses, but there is a particular lack of four-bedroomed family houses and houses that are suitable for the elderly. There is also a great need for investment for people with a disability. I have recently had meetings with the Royal British Legion, which feels that there is insufficient support for what is being done on disability adaptations. These issues all need to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o556"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para15"><a name="090506110000020">There are three things that the Minister could do to help. The first would be to agree the private finance initiative round 5 bid for Stoke-on-Trent. Research has identified that 16 per cent. of the housing stock for older people is not sustainable, and that a further 32 per cent. of the stock requires significant investment in order to be considered sustainable in the medium to long term. There is a pressing need for 1,000 extra care units to meet the needs of an ageing community, and it is for that reason that there is a bid on the Minister&#146;s desk for about &#163;120 million to meet this need. This would provide 500 units of extra care housing, and I understand that three sites are being considered to provide a spread of services for older people, but the programme is dependent on the successful approval of the PFI bid. I ask the Minister to give that application the go-ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o557"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para16"><a name="090506110000021">Secondly, the PFI round 6 bid is equally important. I am sorry to give the House all these technicalities. This multi-million pound bid, submitted by Stoke-on-Trent council, has been drawn up to address the wider context of the regeneration of the city, which I touched on earlier. If approved, the bid will focus investment on six housing estates on the periphery of Stoke-on-Trent. These are Chell Heath, Fegg Hayes and Norton in my own constituency, and Abbey Hulton, Bentilee, and Blurton and Meir across the rest of the city and in the constituencies of my hon. Friends who are supporting this debate tonight. These estates are characterised by very high levels of deprivation, and they need much more investment in open space. They also have very limited social and retail facilities. I am frequently asked for help to get parks, football pitches and all kinds of social facilities established in them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o558"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para17"><a name="090506110000022">If the bid gets the approval of the Minister and the Homes and Communities Agency, it will enable us to tackle worklessness and to create community empowerment.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="6 May 2009">

<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>6 May 2009 : Column 321</b><br>
It would also give us an opportunity to get enhanced design and quality on these estates on the edges of the city. Stoke-on-Trent is not a city with one centre. It is a bit like the Welsh valleys; it is a city with about six towns and many communities within it. The bid would place particular emphasis on more extra care and bungalow accommodation for the elderly. It is essential that, if the Minister does just one thing tonight, it is to give me an indication that when he comes to sign off these bids&#151;I understand that there could be double the number of applications&#151;he will approve that one bid for Stoke-on-Trent. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Members may well laugh, but it is so important that we get this investment in Stoke-on-Trent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o559"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para18"><a name="090506110000023">Thirdly, we have the housing market renewal programme. It has been well established that in Stoke-on-Trent it was slow to get off the ground. Now that it has got off the ground, it has a huge task in front of it. It was therefore decided that a bid would be submitted to the Government for a 10 per cent. extra allowance for housing market renewal. That would be in the order of &#163;7 million for the next two years. With all the problems we faced with credit and the recession just before the Budget, I understand why the Government chose not to go ahead and agree the additional bids submitted, but there remains an opportunity for some of them to be approved now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o560"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para19"><a name="090506110000024">I would like to put in this bid for Middleport, which is adjacent to Burslem, the mother town of the Potteries, in the wider context of regeneration. We have already had a huge amount to help us start the regeneration programme, but we urgently need to provide more new homes in Burslem town centre. We need to diversify new build by providing more family housing, and we greatly need more development and housing gap funding for semi-derelict sites. We would also like to be able to go ahead with more live/work homes, which have been absolutely transformational in Burslem, particularly in encouraging young people to set up small businesses and live and work in the same place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o561"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para20"><a name="090506110000025">I believe that all those issues are fundamental to getting housing investment right. I have not touched on the need for more council housing, because that goes without saying. I understand that there are opportunities for Stoke-on-Trent to bid for the new money and I hope that the Minister will encourage that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o562"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para21"><a name="090506110000026">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise and flag up these concerns with the Minister. I hope that my debate is timely; that it has come about before he has made any final decisions; and that it will have had a chance to influence him. Above all else, I hope that he will accept my invitation to come to Stoke-on-Trent, to Burslem and to Middleport, and perhaps to celebrate with us what I hope will be agreement by the Government to this much-needed investment.</p>

 I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley) on securing this important and timely debate. She has been a tenacious champion of more and better housing not just in her own constituency, but in the wider areas of Stoke-on-Trent and the rest of the west midlands. I have had several meetings with my hon. Friend on these matters, and I  <br>

am sure that she will recall one such notable meeting that coincided with a fire alarm and subsequent evacuation of the entire building. I do not think that she had anything to do with that; the case was never proven! She has, however, had quite an impact on the Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o563"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para22"><a name="090506110000028">I have been to Stoke-on-Trent several times to examine for myself the issues of housing and regeneration in the area. I greatly enjoyed my time at Weston Heights in the Colville area, having been invited there by another tenacious champion for housing in Stoke, my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello). Weston Heights is a landmark regeneration scheme in the city, demonstrating great partnership working, led by RENEW, North Staffordshire, which has produced something like &#163;55 million worth of investment, providing 300 modern, good-quality houses for the people of Colville and beyond. This development very vividly shows what can be achieved in Stoke-on-Trent. I look forward similarly to visiting the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North very soon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o564"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para23"><a name="090506110000029">I have mentioned partnership working, and in a well-reasoned and passionate argument, my hon.  Friend also mentioned the importance of such working  between RENEW, North Staffordshire, the Homes and Communities Agency, Advantage West Midlands and Stoke-on-Trent city council in producing co-ordinated and complementary outcomes at both regional and local level, which are also led by the community. She is absolutely right about that, as the relationship between the regional Homes and Communities Agency, the regional development agency and the local authority is the vital key to securing what she referred to as the triumvirate of housing, jobs and skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o565"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para24"><a name="090506110000030">I congratulate my hon. Friend on her recent appointment to the West Midlands Committee. I urge her to use her powers of argument and her membership of that powerful Committee to ensure that the approach that she has advocated tonight is adopted by the various agencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o566"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para25"><a name="090506110000031">My hon. Friend mentioned the west midlands regional spatial strategy. As she said, the RSS is currently under review. I understand that the examination-in-public stage began only a couple of days ago. In those circumstances, and given the quasi-judicial role of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in the process, I hope my hon. Friend will forgive me for not commenting in detail on her points about the RSS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o567"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para26"><a name="090506110000032">One of the central elements in my hon. Friend&#146;s speech was the importance of housing market renewal areas in rejuvenating communities, and the important role that RENEW North Staffordshire has played in realising her vision for her area. We have made allocations since 2004 totalling &#163;167.5 million for RENEW to create a stronger, more stable housing market, and to provide a better future for communities hit by low demand for property and poor-quality housing. In the current financial year, 2009-10, that represents an allocation of &#163;34.2 million, which, as my hon. Friend said, represents 90 per cent. of the indicative allocation announced in February 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o568"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para27"><a name="090506110000033">I am keen for RENEW, and indeed all housing market renewal areas, to use the significant local market intelligence that they have acquired over the past few years to help to address the challenging economic conditions that we currently face. It is important for the Government to provide significant investment to give communities real  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="6 May 2009">

<notus-date day="6" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>6 May 2009 : Column 323</b><br>
help now. It is also important for that investment to provide direct benefits for people living in housing market renewal areas, and for real and tangible outputs in terms of delivery to ease the current economic conditions now. We, along with the Homes and Communities Agency, want the pathfinders to lead the response to conditions in their areas. We look to them to use their intelligence, to shape local markets, to underpin current activity, and to lead the drive towards effective recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o569"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para28"><a name="090506110000034">It is in that context that, in 2009-10 and 2010-11, all pathfinders will receive the 90 per cent. level of funding as a base allocation. When pathfinders demonstrate an active response to market conditions, achieve expenditure and make impacts, we will offer further resources up to the original 100 per cent. budget. In RENEW&#146;s case that would mean that an additional &#163;3.8 million could be made available this year, which would help my hon. Friend&#146;s area. I am keen to allow that to go ahead to provide real help for RENEW&#146;s areas of investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o570"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para29"><a name="090506110000035">Arrangements for accessing the additional funds are currently being worked out by the Homes and Communities Agency and by me, and the HCA will notify pathfinders of the outcome in due course. Meanwhile, I am due to meet chairs and chief executives of pathfinders in the next week, when I shall want to set out further our wish for clear and achievable criteria on the basis of which the additional money could be obtained by pathfinders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o571"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para30"><a name="090506110000036">I hope that that clear expression of my intention reassures my hon. Friend that money would be available if direct and tangible benefits were provided by RENEW. In the meantime, the &#163;34.2 million already awarded for 2009-10 will enable RENEW to undertake the refurbishment of 700 homes, the acquisition of 220 homes, the demolition of 300 homes that have reached the end of their useful life, and the construction of 150 new homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o572"><a name="90506-0027.htm_para31"><a name="090506110000037">Although RENEW North Staffordshire is an important vehicle for the achievement of regeneration and growth, it is not the only vehicle. The provision of new homes in Stoke-on-Trent, particularly affordable homes, is something that this Government hold dear. That is why, last year and this year, we have already contracted&#151;through the national affordable housing programme, the national clearing house scheme and HomeBuy Direct&#151;for more than &#163;27 million in Stoke to deliver an additional 400 affordable homes for social rent and low-cost home ownership, with more in the pipeline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o573"><a name="90506-0028.htm_para0"><a name="090506110000038">My hon. Friend will be well aware of our commitment to delivering affordable homes both despite and because of the current difficult economic conditions. Let me give her an example in her constituency. A major housing development in Greenhead street, Middleport, stalled recently owing to the prevailing economic conditions. We were already involved with the development through the Homes and Communities Agency in the west midlands, providing &#163;2.7 million of gap funding to support the delivery of 320 new homes. We were made aware of the problems in delivering homes on this development, and held discussions with key partners and the developers with a view to helping them during these difficult times, and with the twin aims of keeping people in work and making sure that the homes we need get built. This resulted in a further &#163;2.5 million being provided to the registered social landlord partner, Countryside, through the national affordable housing programme, to support  <br>

the delivery of much-needed affordable homes. This timely intervention has enabled the development to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o574"><a name="90506-0028.htm_para1"><a name="090506110000039">This example demonstrates that investment to revive stalled housing schemes can play a decisive role in housing delivery and regeneration. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will welcome the Chancellor&#146;s Budget announcement that a further &#163;400 million will be made available to ensure that stalled developments will go ahead. We estimate this will create or safeguard 30,000 jobs in the construction industry and ensure the delivery of an extra 10,000 homes, and I hope my hon. Friend will ensure that Stoke plays a part in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o575"><a name="90506-0028.htm_para2"><a name="090506110000040">Despite the difficult economic conditions, we remain committed to the delivery of affordable housing, and our aspiration is nationally to reach 70,000 homes a year by 2010-11, including 45,000 homes for social rent. To help us deliver this target, we want to give all local authorities, including Stoke-on-Trent, the opportunity to play a bigger role in the delivery of affordable housing where this can be done cost-effectively, and we also want to allow councils to bid for social housing grant from the Homes and Communities Agency should they wish to do so. My hon. Friend mentioned the important role that local authorities can play in the delivery of housing, and I agree. We have just consulted on new freedoms for councils which could remove some of the old barriers and disincentives that councils face in building new homes. Specifically, we have consulted on whether councils should keep all the rental income from the new homes they build, and whether they should keep the full capital receipts if those homes went on to be sold under any future right to buy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o576"><a name="90506-0028.htm_para3"><a name="090506110000041">I have already mentioned the Budget. My hon. Friend will be aware that an extra &#163;100 million was made available in the Budget to allow local councils to build good-quality, energy-efficient homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o577"><a name="90506-0028.htm_para4"><a name="090506110000042">In the meantime, over the last two years we have also supported Stoke-on-Trent city council&#146;s delivery of housing, to the tune of almost &#163;21 million to the regional housing pot. This comprised about &#163;14.5 million for the regeneration of existing housing stock in addition to the previously mentioned allocations to RENEW, and more than &#163;6 million to bring the council&#146;s housing stock up to the decent homes standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o578"><a name="90506-0028.htm_para5"><a name="090506110000043">Stoke-on-Trent city council advises my Department that all of its homes will be decent by 2010, and to help them and other authorities achieve this, as part of the recent fiscal stimulus package we announced the bringing forward of expenditure through the major repairs allowance to sustain and accelerate the decent homes programme. I am pleased to report that Stoke-on-Trent successfully bid to bring forward expenditure worth almost &#163;3 million from 2010-11 into 2009-10, one of only three local authorities to do so in the west midlands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o579"><a name="90506-0028.htm_para6"><a name="090506110000044">I am also delighted to report to the House that in the past two years we have fully met Stoke-on-Trent&#146;s bids for disabled facilities grant. Let me remind Members that this is a small but vital grant that enables assistance to be given to some of the most vulnerable people in our community, thereby enabling them to remain in their own homes. For Stoke-on-Trent, this amounted to &#163;1.8 million over the two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o580"><a name="90506-0028.htm_para7"><a name="090506110000045">I know that my hon. Friend is very concerned about rounds 5 and 6 of the housing private finance initiative. She mentioned that Stoke-on-Trent city council submitted  <br>

an expression of interest for a comprehensive housing-led regeneration scheme, and that it is eagerly awaiting a decision on this. I am afraid I cannot give her the news on that tonight. However, I can say that we received a large number of high-quality expressions of interest in this initiative from various other parts of the country. We are currently considering the Homes and Communities Agency recommendations, and an announcement on the outcome will be made shortly. I shall certainly ensure that my hon. Friend is made aware of any news.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o581"><a name="90506-0028.htm_para8"><a name="090506110000046">I congratulate my hon. Friend again on securing this debate.

on-Trent. This demonstration has been matched by significant and, indeed, unprecedented investment in housing and regeneration by this Government for her area. In difficult economic times, this investment will continue to provide real help now for people and businesses in Stoke, and to ensure that the city has the housing stock that she knows that it wants and deserves. I look forward to visiting her constituency soon, to see for myself the plans that she has for Stoke-on-Trent. Again, I thank her for the opportunity to debate this important issue, and I look forward to seeing her soon.</p>
