 No; I do not accept that. The Government strongly support the credit union movement across Great Britain. There are 532 credit unions, which have two thirds of a million members and somewhere in the region of &#163;500 million-worth of assets. I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman would welcome the extra resources that the Budget has provided to make additional loans available to vulnerable people at very affordable prices. By 2011, an additional 85,000 people will be able to be helped as a result of the actions announced in the Budget last week. That is good news for people who need affordable credit; the credit unions play a tremendously important role in keeping such people away from doorstep lenders and loan sharks. Credit unions should be supported, and that is what the Government are doing.</p>

The Bank has operational independence for doing that; although, obviously, I had to authorise the operations in the first place, the Bank decides when and where to intervene.

few months some 2,000 businesses have been offered some &#163;240 million of additional lending. Other measures are in place. Banks need to be reasonable with their customers and balance the need to ensure that they do not repeat the mistakes made over the past few years&#151;when credit was given with too few questions asked and not enough security&#151;with avoiding the situation in which conditions are so restrictive that the schemes do not actually work.

 Although the base rate is only 0.5 per cent., the real cost of borrowing for business is much higher.

That has had severe consequences for borrowing in not just our country but others. The question is what we do in the face of that.

 My hon. Friend is right. Part of this country&#146;s problem in the 1980s and 1990s was high inflation, which meant that the Bank of England had to raise interest rates to 16 and 17 per cent. In addition, many of the problems then were home grown. As my hon. Friend says, the difference now is that the effective rate at which we borrow is a lot lower then it was in the 1980s and 1990s. However, I come back to the same point, which is that we and other countries, faced with a worldwide problem, have a choice either to stand back and do nothing, as the Conservatives seem to advocate, or to take action. When one hears the Leader of the Opposition, as he did on Sunday, criticise the fact that our spending is increasing by &#163;20 billion a year and imply that he would cut it, and when one realises that much of that spending is on unemployment benefit and other support for people, one really does wonder about the Conservative party&#146;s approach.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman should perhaps have paid a little more attention to what I said a moment ago: the increase in personal allowances in income tax&#151;that is, in the tax-free proportion of people&#146;s income&#151;gives every basic rate taxpayer a tax cut of &#163;145 from this year.</p>

Could they be reminded that it is ordinary, hard-working people, who pay money to watch their films, who put them where they are? We should give those celebrities the message that if they cannot support services for those hard-working people, such as the national health service, when the country is going through a bit of a problem, good riddance to them, and we should say, &#147;Don&#146;t come back.&#148;</p>

Will the Financial Secretary to the Treasury confirm that that equates to &#163;1,450 a year extra tax per family?

 The Government recognise the importance of saving in providing people with independence throughout their lives, security if things go wrong, and comfort in retirement. Budget 2009 announced that from April 2010, the annual individual savings account investment limit will rise to &#163;10,200, up to &#163;5,100 of which can be held in cash. Those new limits will apply from October 2009 for people aged 50 and over. The Government also announced an extra &#163;100 a year for the child trust funds of disabled children, with &#163;200 per year for severely disabled children. In addition, the saving gateway will be introduced nationally in 2010 to encourage saving among people of working age who are on low incomes.</p>

I recommend to him the Moneymadeclear website, which offers free, impartial advice on a range of savings products that have rates significantly in excess of the current Bank of England base rate.

 The hon. Lady is quite right that we always need to be mindful of the harm that inflation can cause, which is why we set the Bank of England an inflation target of 2 per cent., which I confirmed again last week in the Budget. The Bank of England has been operationally independent of the Government for more than 10 years, and that has been widely supported and accepted. However, the Bank has a responsibility to meet that target, both in setting out how much it will put into the economy through quantitative easing and in its interest rate policy. The key is to make sure that we keep inflation low. At present, as the hon. Lady would accept, the objective is to make sure that we get credit flowing through the system, particularly for businesses but also for individuals. The Bank of England has that responsibility, so that is the answer to her question. That regime has worked, and it will continue to work in future.</p>

we ensure that our forecasts are based on the information that we have. If hon. Members look at the IMF and its forecasting over the past three months, they will see that it has downrated its forecasting three times since last October, which demonstrates the uncertainty in the system. However, I believe that because of the action that we are taking, because of the fact that we have low interest rates, because inflation will be coming down this year, and because of the action that most other countries are taking to look after and support their economies, that will have an effect, which is why I remain confident that we will see growth return towards the end of this year.</p>

 Frankly, I do not think the Chancellor is in any position to lecture anyone else about downgrading their forecasts after last week. Is not the truth this&#151;that the dishonest Budget has completely unravelled in the space of just a week? We have seen the IMF produce those growth forecasts, which were wholly different from the ones given an hour earlier to the House of Commons. We have the CBI saying that there is no credible or rigorous plan to deal with the deficit. We have the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointing to the black hole, and yesterday a former member of the Cabinet, beside whom the Chancellor sat at the Cabinet table, said that his tax plans were a breach of a manifesto promise that is damaging not just to the Labour party, but to the economy.

 No. The big difference between us is on the action that the Government should take, faced with a downturn of the magnitude that we see today and the problems that we and every other country are facing at present. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s solution is to stand back and let nature take its course. That is a price that I am not prepared to pay. I have set out in the Budget measures to help not only individuals, especially those who may be facing unemployment and need help to get back into work quickly, but businesses in this country. We also ensured over the past few years that we went into the downturn in a position where the Bank could reduce interest rates, unlike in the past, when interest rates had to be increased. The action that we have taken to help the economy now and the action that I set out to get borrowing down again is realistic and sensible, given the situation that we face. The question that the hon. Gentleman will have to answer sooner rather than later is, if he is critical of all that, what exactly is he proposing in relation to public spending? What exactly is he proposing to do to help people and businesses in this country? At present that is absolutely opaque.</p>

The wider point that I was making is an important one: that across Europe, countries are being affected in the same way as we are because of the banking crisis that has spread into the wider economy. Whether in Poland, France, Germany, this country, Asia or America, the question is the same: what do Governments do in the face of this? Do they stand back and hope for the best, or do they do something to support their economies so as to support families and businesses? That is the right thing to do, and Poland recognises that as well.</p>

the Chancellor has stated that he wants to reduce the burdens on business. Bearing that in mind, does he agree that now is definitely not the time to be pushing ahead with the Equality Bill, which will pile extra costs and regulations on businesses of all sizes, and will he join the Business Secretary in pushing to have the Bill abandoned?</p>

In March alone, more than 355,000 people got &#163;35 a week extra as a result of the measures that we have taken. That marks a difference between Labour Members and the Conservatives: we are prepared to help people, because all the experience shows that if people are left on their own, without help, as we saw in the 1980s and 1990s, that can have disastrous social and economic consequences.</p>

<a name="ordayhd_0"><a name="90428-0004.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="09042838000419"><h5 align="left">3.34 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o100"><a name="09042838000151"><a name="90428-0004.htm_spmin0"><a name="09042838000543"><b>The Minister for the Armed Forces (Mr. Bob Ainsworth):</b>
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the report on the strategic review of reserves, which I am publishing today and which has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para0"><a name="09042838000152">I know that the House will join me in paying tribute to Britain&#146;s reserves. They make an important contribution to current operations, serving with dedication and commitment alongside our regular forces. As I speak, more than 2,000 reservists are on operations in Afghanistan and Iraq on tasks ranging from fighting on the front line to force protection and medical support. That is 8 per cent. of our forces deployed. Reservists have served with distinction in all the conflicts that our forces have faced in recent times, from the Balkans to Sierra Leone. Some 18,000 have been deployed to operational theatres since 2003. Since then, 15 have made the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives on our behalf. When I visit operational theatres, I never fail to be impressed by the men and women of our reserve forces who give up their time to serve their country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para1"><a name="09042838000153">However, it is not only the armed forces that benefit from our reserves. Society does too. Individual reservists learn and develop leadership, problem-solving and confidence-building skills that make them more capable employees and citizens. They also make a crucial contribution in the United Kingdom, helping out in emergencies from foot and mouth to flooding to providing cover during the firefighters&#146; strike.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09042838000154">The demands faced by our reservists have changed considerably, and we are using them more than we have before in peacetime. We need them to do more than simply prepare to defend the UK in the event of major conflict. We require them to augment our regular forces on expeditionary operations, yet the structures, training and organisation of our reserve forces have not changed to match that requirement and now need to be overhauled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09042838000155">We owe it to our reservists, their employers and their families to ensure that they are supported to face the challenges of today and the future, not of the past. People wrongly say that this is about tackling stretch by using the reserves to plug gaps in the regular forces. That is not the case. It is, in fact, about optimising the contribution of all elements of defence today and in the future. The reserves are an integral part of that, and are themselves overwhelmingly keen to play a relevant role in current operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09042838000156">That is why last year my right hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne) commissioned a strategic review of reserves. As a result, for the first time in recent years, the reserves have been the subject of a review in their own right. The review was conducted by a small team led by Major-General Nicholas Cottam, which consulted openly throughout defence and beyond. It listened carefully to the views of the reserves community, including the reserve forces and cadets associations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09042838000157">General Cottam&#146;s comprehensive review addressed all strategic aspects of reserve service. I am today placing copies of it in the Library of the House and on the Ministry of Defence website. As one would expect from such a careful analysis conducted over several months, it is very detailed. We have therefore produced a summary  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="28 Apr 2009">

<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 702</b><br>
of the review, which will also be placed in the Library today. General Cottam confirms that the summary report accurately reflects his review. It also indicates how we shall take forward this important work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09042838000158">General Cottam&#146;s work offered seven strategic recommendations. I am pleased to announce that we are accepting all of them. They flow into more than 80 detailed recommendations. General Cottam was not asked to produce an implementation plan, as his review was properly designed to be strategic. Consequently, some of his detailed recommendations will require considerable further scoping work, taking into account resources and priorities across defence. That will make for difficult choices, but the review provides the solid foundation on which they can be made. I am, however, pleased to announce that around half the recommendations will be implemented immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09042838000159">The review has redefined the &#147;purpose&#148; of the UK&#146;s reserves, and notes that they provide defence with a cost-effective way of retaining certain specialised skills. Precisely those niche capabilities and that depth of personnel prove so invaluable in our current operations. The review also acknowledges that reservists may remain vital for supporting national resilience and it recognises the very important role that they play in connecting the armed forces with the nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09042838000160">A key tenet of the review is bringing greater clarity to reservists about what we expect of them and what they can expect in return. That has been captured in the &#147;Proposition&#148;, which sets out for the first time what reserve service offers. Specifically, it states that we must ensure that</p>
<a name="90428-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="09042838000401"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we continue to offer the challenge and reward which attracts people to volunteer, while giving a firm undertaking to provide them with effective training and the best possible support throughout their service, including when mobilised and recuperating.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09042838000161">Part of that challenge is the opportunity to lead and command, which is why General Cottam&#146;s detailed recommendations include proposals for officer recruitment and education. If we deliver the &#147;Proposition&#148;&#151;I am determined that we will&#151;the outcome should be a better trained, better organised reserve, better able to deliver its tasks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09042838000162">I should like to give the House a few examples of what we are doing now to help achieve that outcome. We shall develop better and more flexible terms and conditions of service, which will allow a range of different forms of reserve service as well as easier movement between the regular and the reserve services by removing complexity and administrative barriers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09042838000163">Reservist training will be refocused, with a greater emphasis on preparation to support current operations. Initial training will be restructured so that new recruits receive sufficient military skills to participate in their units&#146; collective training within six months of joining, and are fully trained and eligible for mobilisation in three years. Routine training will also be reviewed and sufficient man training days allocated to ensure that annual military competency standards can be achieved by all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09042838000164">The Territorial Army will be better integrated with the regular Army to ensure that, combined, they are best structured to support current and future operations. That will include stopping reservist tasks that are no longer needed, thereby bringing efficiencies and enabling  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="28 Apr 2009">

manpower to be used for higher priorities. Some tasks of that nature have been identified during separate work as part of the Department&#146;s annual planning round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09042838000165">As mentioned in the review, certain elements of 2 (National Communications) Signal Brigade are identified as no longer having a clear operational role. That is partly because they hold capabilities that are no longer current, and partly because their tasks can be achieved elsewhere in defence, not least because of improvements in wider national resilience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09042838000166">In addition, some TA signals units operate communications equipment that is now obsolete, and those posts will be removed. They include Headquarters 12 Signals Group and 33, 34 and 35 Signals Regiments&#151;it is logical to reallocate those resources to higher defence priorities. That decision has not been taken lightly and we are very aware of the exceptional contribution made by the Royal Signals within the TA. However, we must focus resources where we need them most. Where possible, those affected by the decision will be offered other opportunities in the TA, and we will conduct further work to determine the most effective configuration for the TA Royal Signals. As I said, those decisions were taken separately from the reserves review, but they are entirely consistent with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09042838000167">We shall also rationalise and improve the way that we approach the civil contingency reaction force and the part that it plays in wider national resilience tasks. That will make it more effective and less burdensome to the units involved. We shall also be working closely with the Department for International Development to determine how best to employ niche reservist skills in support of stabilisation operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09042838000168">We need to rationalise the reserve estate. Some of it is underused, out of date and in poor repair; some of it is simply unacceptable for modern military use. In some places, sites sit near to one another, while elsewhere the reserve has no footprint at all. I am therefore setting in train work to deliver a modern, better managed and fit-for-purpose volunteer estate. This important work will take time and I am determined that it be done properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09042838000169">Employers play a vital role in delivering and supporting our reserves. They bear the gap while an employee is training and an even greater one when reservists are away from the workplace on deployed operations. We are very fortunate that so many of our employers are so accommodating of the demands that go with a reservist commitment. They recognise the additional skills and qualities that individual reservists can bring to any organisation, but we want to work better with employers. We shall continue to provide assistance and support to them through our employer support organisation, Supporting Britain&#146;s Reservists and Employers, which is commonly known as SaBRE. In addition, we shall give greater direction to the reserve forces and cadets associations, to ensure that their excellent work in support of the reserves is more coherent and co-ordinated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para18"><a name="09042838000170">The review that we publish today is important for our armed forces and for Britain&#146;s reserves. It makes it clear that the two are not separate; rather, that the reserves provide an integral part of our military force structure. The review provides a firm basis from which we can  <br>

work further to develop and improve our reserve forces and how we support them. I believe that this is an exciting opportunity for our reservists. The review&#146;s outcome is a comprehensive piece of work that has been welcomed by the single service chiefs. The review is a blueprint to ensure that our reserve forces have a clear and bright future to match their illustrious past, and I commend it to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o101"><a name="09042838000171"><a name="90428-0004.htm_spnew0"><a name="09042838000544"><b>Dr. Liam Fox (Woodspring) (Con):</b>
 The whole House can and will take pride in the achievements of our reserve forces. We pay tribute to the sacrifices that they have made for the security of our country. Like many hon. Members, I have met our reserves in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I have never failed to be impressed by their professionalism and courage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para19"><a name="09042838000172">I am slightly surprised that the Minister failed to acknowledge the important role of the 234 TA troops currently serving on the green line in Cyprus, as part of Operation Tosca, although I am sure that that was an oversight. This is the first time that Op Tosca has been fully resourced by the TA, which deserves congratulations on the work that it has done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para20"><a name="09042838000173">The main focus of the Minister&#146;s statement was the TA. Very little&#151;in fact, I think nothing at all&#151;was said about the Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines Reserve or the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. How will the report impact on those forces? I am sure that the members of those reserve forces serving in Iraq or Afghanistan will be surprised, to say the least, that they seem to have been omitted today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para21"><a name="09042838000174">We welcome the genuine attempt to improve and expedite basic training for both soldiers and officers, but could the Minister tell us what assessment the Government have made of the attractiveness to potential recruits and, more importantly, employers of condensing basic training into six months? It also surprised me a little that there was no mention in the Minister&#146;s statement of the welfare issues affecting our reservists and their families. Perhaps he can tell the House in his response what measures in the report&#146;s recommendations will improve the welfare of our reserve forces and their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para22"><a name="09042838000175">I am sure that the Minister would agree that it is a major disincentive when regulars take a disproportionate number of places at the top of TA units. Will he assure the House that, when reservists can carry out a role, they should do so, and that, when appropriately qualified, reservists will have priority?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para23"><a name="09042838000176">The Minister said at the beginning of his statement that the reserve forces make a crucial contribution in emergencies. Surely it would be more accurate to say that they have made such a contribution, because the Government are effectively abandoning their own plans, set out in 2002, for the civil contingency reaction force. Who is going to carry out that role, if not the TA? The assumption seems to be that the blue light services and the regular services will assume that responsibility, but the regular Army is already overstretched and is increasingly being concentrated into super-garrisons. So, let me get this right: with a potential flu pandemic at our door, the Government are abandoning their own civil contingency reaction force and, instead of using the widespread footprint of the TA across the country, they intend to depend more on the regular Army, which they are concentrating in fewer and fewer geographical locations. Are they kidding us?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para24"><a name="09042838000177">No one can argue with the need to rationalise the reserve estate, but the Minister says that detailed work needs to be done first, and that it could take some time. Hmm. Will he then tell us why the Government have a figure of &#163;75 million in the MOD budget for financial year 2011-12 as a contribution made by the reserve estate? How did they arrive at that figure? Has some work already been done, or has that number simply been borrowed from the fantasy figure library that the Chancellor has been putting to such good effect recently? I have a further point about money. In the discussions that the Minister has had with the Department for International Development on using reservists in support of stabilisation operations, has he discussed transferring any elements of DFID&#146;s funding for that purpose? If so, how much?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para25"><a name="09042838000178">In 1997, the establishment figure for the TA was 59,000. Today, the figure is 58,500, even though the current strength is only 28,920. Following the Minister&#146;s statement today, what will the establishment figure be? Given that the TA has been funded to only 83 per cent. of its capacity in recent years, what will that figure be today? Simply put: how much is the TA being cut by, and how much money will it get?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para26"><a name="09042838000179">Despite General Cottam&#146;s excellent work, changes to the shape of our armed forces should be made within the context of a strategic defence review&#151;which is hugely overdue&#151;and not in this piecemeal fashion. I am afraid that this statement is short on detail and indicative of a Government who lack direction. If the Minister really wants to abolish obsolete bodies and make them disappear, I am sure that the voters will be only too happy to help.</p>

 It is traditional to thank the hon. Gentleman for his response. He is right about Op Tosca; I am sorry that I did not mention it. He is, however, totally wrong about my omitting other reservists. I mentioned the reserve throughout. Obviously, I concentrated on the TA because the measures that have been taken in the spending round apply to the TA. He should not be surprised that I majored on that issue and did not try to hide it from the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para27"><a name="09042838000181">The hon. Gentleman asked about the establishment. There are no plans to take any further cuts in the establishment. Indeed, the report proposes increases in the establishment of the other services&#151;the naval and air reserves. However, the figures for the deletions that are being made in the Signals Regiments amount to around 2,000 individuals. Of course, that would come off the establishment&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) is right: there will be more than that in terms of posts, but in terms of individuals in place, about 2,000 people will be affected.</p>

I have not had the opportunity that the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) may have had to read the whole report; I have not seen it at all, but I shall study it carefully and I may have further observations to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para31"><a name="09042838000186">I agree with the points that have been made, and I am sure will be made by those on both sides of the House, about how our admiration for our reserves increases by the day. From my experience in the last year in which I was Secretary of State for Defence, I know that increasingly, on every operational visit that I made, it became impossible to tell the difference between the regular members and the reserves of any of the three services. That is the highest compliment that I can pay reservists and, indeed, it was the compliment paid to them by regular members of all three services in my presence on many occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para32"><a name="09042838000187">The strategic review&#146;s strength was that it was wanted by the reservists; the loudest voices of welcome for it came from reservists themselves. That strength was augmented by the way in which General Cottam conducted the review in a transparent and inclusive fashion. I just wish to ask my right hon. Friend two questions. First, can we continue that inclusiveness and transparency by developing an implementation group, as we did in the Department on other occasions to ensure that those who were consulted were included in implementation? The second is a plea on behalf of the south-west of Scotland, which gives a lot of people to the services, but has very little footprint of the reserves in its communities. Can we have some please?</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend for that; indeed, he established this review in the first place, so he understands better than anyone the need for it. As he rightly says, the members of the reserves are extremely impressive and highly capable people who have a real desire to serve in today&#146;s operations. What we are really seeking to do is to catch up with the movement that has been effectively made on the ground by putting in place, through this review, the systems that are necessary to serve them in doing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="90428-0004.htm_para33"><a name="09042838000189">My right hon. Friend raises two specific points. I can tell him that an implementation group is set up to look at the individual recommendations, and I assure him that I will see to it&#151;I am sure that those involved will want to do this in any case&#151;that it will be as inclusive as possible in how it goes about its work of deciding which of those recommendations should be taken forward and in what way.</p>

 I, too, wish to put on record my respect and admiration for the reserves, who are undoubtedly a valuable part of our armed forces.

He tells us that there are seven strategic recommendations and 80 detailed ones. I notice that he was on his feet for 14 minutes and I should have thought that he could at least have told us what the seven strategic recommendations are in that time. Can he guarantee that we will get a further chance to ask questions when we have had sight of them? We have no idea of the extent of the changes that are being considered, or whether they will cost more or less.

I have tried to be as open as I can and I have engaged with the all-party group on reserve forces.

If we make the reserve as relevant, capable and deployable as we can, and if we put the work into understanding that capability, the potential is that the reserve will grow, because we will understand the risks that are associated with giving any particular issue over to a reserve capability. That will develop over time, and I hope that the reserve will at least give options to planners in providing capability.</p>

 I am very concerned about the announcement made by my right hon. Friend as regards the Crown Gate Territorial Army training centre in Runcorn. It is a modern purpose-built facility and is the home of 80 Squadron, part of 33 Signal Regiment, which he has announced will be disbanded forthwith. It is also the home of the Army cadets and the Navy cadets. As he will be aware, Runcorn is very important for recruitment to the armed services in the north-west. I am extremely anxious that we maintain the reservist footprint in the town. Will he give me some assurances about the future of that centre in my constituency?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that question and I am not surprised that he is concerned. The decision that we have taken is not about the facilities in his constituency, but about the capability provided by the Signal Regiment that is only a part of, and only one user of, those facilities. As I have said, it uses equipment that is now obsolete. I am happy to meet my hon. Friend to see whether we can find ways of continuing to use the facilities&#151;if they are as good as he says, we should certainly do so.

opportunities, as well as the training that is needed to exploit those opportunities, who will be surprised if we struggle to attract the volunteers that we need? I think that the right hon.

We are trying to ensure that we shift resources so that we better cover the geographical area of the country by remodelling the estate&#151;that is central to the changes that we are making today.

 The Minister cannot expect the House to be impressed by his suggestion a few moments ago that the reserves might actually grow in strength, on a day when he has just announced a further 2,000 cuts in their manpower. He will not deny that since this Government came into power, the reserves have virtually halved from 62,000 to 33,000. If, for perhaps sensible reasons, it is necessary to terminate the three Signals Regiments, would it not be fair to the reservists, when they are being used to a degree that is unprecedented in our history, for the 2,000 manpower that is being saved from the Signals Regiments to be allocated elsewhere in the TA?</p>

 Where individuals are affected by the changes to the Signals Regiment, which I think the right hon. and learned Gentleman recognises are necessary, we will seek to use them and absorb them in the reserve. That will not be possible in every circumstance. Those people may not want to do other jobs, but where they do we shall do our level best to continue to use their enthusiasm. The point I was making about potential growth is that, better managed and better understood, the risk of allowing some capability to be rested entirely within the reserve will be reduced. Over time, there will be potential for the reserve to be used in areas where people have not dared to use it in the past and, therefore, the reserve might grow.</p>

General Cottam and I have already discussed the matter and we agree that, in deciding who is the best person for a job, we should take account of the unit&#146;s being a reservist unit, and the fact that the commander is a reservist will often be part of that assessment. As I said, sometimes the chain of command will decide for good reason that, at a particular point in time, it is appropriate that a regular officer commands a unit. However, we do not want to damage the career path&#151;the ability to bring capable individuals into the officer corps&#151;and we will do that if we take that too far.</p>

 I welcome the statement and look forward to reading General Cottam&#146;s comprehensive review of the strategic aspects of the reserve forces, but I have one question. In his statement, my right hon. Friend mentioned flexible terms of engagement or employment. Will he confirm that he may use such language? Will he explain how those terms will benefit medical reservists, who are essential to our deployed forces?</p>

<p><a name="st_o136"><a name="09042838000230"><a name="90428-0005.htm_spnew31"><a name="09042838000579"><b>Mr. Ainsworth:</b>
 To be frank, I am not sure what impact they will have on medical reservists. I shall come back to my hon. Friend on that point. However, there are considerable barriers to flexibility in the terms and conditions of employment in the reserves. For instance, it is detrimental to an individual, on leaving the regular service, to go straight into the reserve. Is that sensible? Such people have all the skills and are capable soldiers, sailors or airmen, but the effect of the current terms and conditions is to discourage them from transferring straight into the reserve. I do not think that that is sensible, and nor did General Cottam.</p>

He said, &#147;People wrongly say that this is about tackling stretch by using the reserve to plug gaps in the regular forces.&#148; Although we understand that he has to put a brave face on the decisions that he is having to take today, will he at least be realistic? Where would we be without the medics, the helicopter pilots and even the infantry reservists, and the professional Army had to try to manage current operations on its own? The reserves are filling gaps, and reducing reserve and TA forces further means that fewer gaps will be filled when we need to fill them.</p>

That was the purpose of the reserves for a period in our history, but that is not what they want to do or what they have been doing for some time. We will not attract the individuals we want to attract if we do not make them relevant to current operations. Yes of course we want to use the reserve, and it is appropriate that we do so.</p>

 The review team looked at the National Audit Office findings, and there is comment on that. Of course there is potential in some areas to make savings, if not on the properties themselves, then on the overheads for things that are underutilised. However, there is a need for investment, so we have to try to see to it that the reconfiguration gets due priority in our planning rounds in future. We also have to see to it that reserves get the funds that they need, so that they can have the estate that they need, so that they can get the training that they need to be effective.</p>

 Throughout the review, training plays a central role. Providing training that is better placed geographically; integrating training with regular training, where appropriate, so that reserves can train alongside regulars; and reservist units and sub-units being able to use regular training capacity and facilities, and take up that capacity effectively, are all issues covered by the review. One of the things that we will need to talk to employers and reservists about is our growing need to try to attract people into the reserves to provide niche capabilities. Generally speaking, people want to go into the reserves to do something different; they do not want to do what they do in their day job. In stabilisation operations, we will sometimes need them to do what they have an expertise in. They and their employers will need to be consulted about that.</p>

The assumption was that the personnel from the closed TA centre would commute to the new TA centre. That never happened, and the new unit was immediately under-strength. Given that the Minister has repeatedly reassured the all-party group on reserve forces that cost was not the driver for the review, will he simply confirm to the House that the &#163;75 million that will be saved, as a result of selling off that estate, will be reinvested in the TA, not the regular Army?</p>

 This debate should not be about statistics but about people. I am sure that statistics will be bandied around, but we are talking about real people who are worried if they have lost their job and worried about how to support their children, and workers worrying if they might be next. The welfare state is here precisely to support people at times such as this. We have strengthened the safety net so that we pay people&#146;s mortgages if they cannot get back into work, we pay their pensions if their company goes bust and&#151;thanks to tax credits, which the Conservatives have said they want to dismantle&#151;we are paying more than 300,000 people an extra &#163;35 a week to soften the blow of losing overtime or work.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s leader told GMTV that he wanted to dismantle it, and the hon. Gentleman has made it absolutely clear that his party wants to look at cutting tax credits. The fact that 300,000 people are getting an extra &#163;35 a week is softening the blow, and that would not happen under the Conservatives.</p>

The choice before us is between a Government who are investing &#163;5 billion extra to get people back in to work and an Opposition who cannot say that they support that help, because they are committed to cutting spending now. I predict that they will want to run away from that during the debate, but that is the consequence of their policy, and they cannot run away from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90428-0007.htm_para4"><a name="09042838000290">Labour&#146;s policy is to invest now to protect jobs now and to get people back into work as quickly as possible. We estimate that because of our actions half a million jobs will be protected. People who would otherwise be out of work are still in work because of our actions. In contrast, the answer of the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) would be to cut spending now, and that would mean helping the unemployed less. That is the choice&#151;a Labour Government who believe that we are in this together and will only come out of it together, or Opposition Members, who believe that someone who loses their job is on their own and should not be helped by the Government of the day.</p>

 Some of my constituents have asked me to put this question to the Secretary of State this afternoon. They do not doubt that the Government&#146;s measures are about helping people to get back to work, but those measures do not wash with them, because work is part of their DNA. They are scrambling for any job that they can get, but there are now simply not enough jobs for those who genuinely want to work. Their wives work a small amount, and they are now faced with their national insurance-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance running out. Should they tell their wives not to work, so that they can claim benefits, or should they tell their wives to continue working while they scramble for work, and lose their homes because they simply do not have enough money to pay the mortgage? What advice would the Secretary of State give my constituents?</p>

 Clearly, we want to help people get back into work as quickly as possible, and the tax credits policy is intended precisely to help women in that situation so that they can have extra work. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) mutters from the Opposition Front Bench, but these are exactly the JSA rules that his party introduced in 1996. The difference between now and then is that, on top of that, there are tax credits to help people who want to work more, so I have answered my right hon. Friend&#146;s question precisely.</p>

In a banking crisis, we have to get lending going again, support the banks and strengthen confidence. The Tories, of course, would do the opposite. They would take money out of the economy at precisely the time when it needs to be in the economy. They would cut borrowing and would therefore be unable to stand behind the banks, savers, businesses and homeowners in the way we are. Their policy would risk the vicious spiral that the Japanese economy entered in the 1990s. That would be the consequence of their policy, and they cannot run away from it.</p>

problems. Does my right hon. Friend agree with what was said in the discussion that I had with my local jobcentre manager last week&#151;that, unlike in the previous recession, we now have an active labour market intervention strategy? Will he accept my thanks that there is now a much broader suite of measures that can be used to try to help people who do not have a job to get back into employment? For example, they can be helped to go into business for themselves, look for other employment or enhance their skills. Does he accept that that strategy is very different from what happened in the previous recession?</p>

 That is absolutely right. I am sure that my hon. Friend will accept that that costs money, and it was precisely because the Conservative party did not put in extra money in the &#146;80s that the active labour market was relaxed. The link between claiming and looking for work was eventually completely abandoned, and studies suggest that that meant that unemployment was 4 per cent. higher than it needed to be. That is the consequence of the Opposition&#146;s policy, and they cannot run away from it. They are ideologically against the extra spending, so unemployment and the recession would last longer and cost more, precisely as they did in the past.</p>

They must be the first Opposition to say at a time of rising unemployment that the Government should be spending less, not more. Of course, it is reasonable for the Opposition to say, as they did at the weekend, that they want to spend less. That is a reasonable policy, but they cannot in the next breath say that they want to spend more. They cannot say in the run-up to the Budget that we should be cutting spending, and then when the Government announce extra money for the unemployed say, &#147;Oh, well, we&#146;d have done that too.&#148; It simply does not add up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90428-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09042838000301">We have set out our position on spending clearly in this Budget, and we have been clear about the consequences of our decisions and of asking those who earn more to pay more. The Opposition have made their overall position clear. They would not support the &#163;5 billion that we have invested in unemployed people, and they have said that they want spending restraint now. But they have yet to admit the consequences of that choice, so I shall spell it out for them. We are investing around &#163;3 billion extra in Jobcentre Plus and our private and voluntary providers. That was our choice. The right hon. Lady&#146;s choice to oppose that would mean people getting less help to find a job, less time with job advisers and less help with job search.</p>

 The problem with the right hon. Lady&#146;s argument is that she opposes even the efficiency savings that we have made in the past few years. We have saved &#163;2 billion a year through extra efficiency savings. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon.

We will continue to save on IT, telephony and estates. We have reduced jobs in back offices and put them in the front line, where they are most needed. The right hon.

In the 1980s Tory recession, the number of young people unemployed for more than six months went from 150,000 to 600,000, and it took 10 years to return to the pre-recession level. In the 1990s, it rose to more than 400,000 and took seven years to fall back. The costs were enormous: the cost to the economy and the taxpayer of the benefits bill, and the cost to society of drug abuse and crime. Yet, we know that the true cost was in the wasted potential of talented young people&#151;the Conservative party threw them on the scrap heap&#151;and that the consequences of making the wrong decisions in a recession are not theoretical.

Could there not be targeted intervention on day one, for example, to help young people who have no skills or poor literacy, rather than a wait of a year?</p>

 I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question because it gives me the chance to put right a misunderstanding. We do not wait for a year; we give help to people even when the redundancy is announced. We give them help from day one. We do exactly what he says: we fast-track people on to the flexible new deal, and then at six months we provide the extra support in terms of giving people help to set up a company or providing the golden hello of up to &#163;2,500. The extra guarantee is that we will say to everybody that within a year they will be offered a job or a training place. Already, more than 80 per cent. of people get back into work within a year, but this is a new guarantee that everybody will be offered a job or a training place&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> We are not wasting a year: we offer people help and training from day one. We have access to the advisory discretionary fund from day one, and we help them with CVs from day one. We refer them to jobs clubs early in their&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It does work, because it gets people back into work more quickly than in previous recessions, but in addition we are introducing a guarantee that within a year everybody will be offered a job or training place, and that has been widely welcomed outside the House as well as within it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90428-0008.htm_para11"><a name="09042838000362">It is extraordinary that the Conservatives still have not said that they would match our spending on unemployment. I paid close attention to the Conservatives&#146; party conference at the weekend and they were able to commit to spending extra money on certain things. They say that they want an age of austerity. It is a strange sort of austerity when they will not commit to spending a single penny more on the unemployed, but will commit to spending billions of pounds on those in jobs earning over &#163;150,000 a year. It is a strange sort of austerity when they cannot commit to help young people at all, but they can promise a tax giveaway of &#163;200,000 to the 3,000 richest estates in the country. The Conservatives&#146; priority is clear&#151;no more money for the unemployed, but &#163;200,000 for the 3,000 richest estates.</p>

 The Secretary of State cannot defend his policies or his Government&#146;s record, so he is making up some policies, attributing them to us and then attacking them. I do not recognise the statement that he has just made about people on incomes of more than &#163;150,000 a year. We have explicitly said that while we think that the Government&#146;s proposals will be damaging to the economy we cannot make any commitment to rolling them back. So what is he talking about?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s leader said that it was in the queue to be reversed. The only commitment that we know will be in the Conservatives&#146; manifesto is the cut in inheritance tax for the 3,000 richest estates in the country. Again, that is their policy and one that they cannot run away from. That is not an age of austerity: it is just not fair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="90428-0008.htm_para12"><a name="09042838000365">There is a choice between the parties. My party would put more money into helping people who become unemployed to shorten the recession and reduce the cost, but the Conservatives are ideologically opposed to such spending. They would not help people now and that would repeat the mistakes of the past and make the recession longer. That is the choice before the House today.</p>

 Before I respond on this issue, I wish to declare to the House that my husband works for an asset management company, part of whose business is the management of pension funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para0"><a name="09042838000367">We have just heard an extraordinary speech from the Secretary of State. This is supposed to be a debate about this Government&#146;s Budget. Did we hear a detailed defence of the Budget? No. The Secretary of State started by saying that he did not want this debate to be about statistics. Well, we all know why he did not want it to be about statistics. The statistics in the Budget make very bad reading for Labour Members. He then created some fantasy statistics, which he claimed to be Conservative party policy. In fact, he spent virtually all his speech talking about what he claimed was Conservative party policy rather than defending the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para1"><a name="09042838000368">Let us be clear: last week the Chancellor of the Exchequer delivered Britain&#146;s bad news budget. We face the worst recession since the second world war. Unemployment is rising at the fastest rate ever and, thanks to Labour&#146;s economic incompetence, our national debt will double again to &#163;1.4 trillion, which means that every child born in Britain today will face a debt of &#163;22,500. At the same time, that child&#146;s parents will be struggling to cope with the hidden tax hikes that will cost every family more than &#163;1,400 but were not even announced in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para2"><a name="09042838000369">In the next two years, this Labour Government will borrow more than all previous Governments in history put together. That is only according to the Chancellor&#146;s own figures. Of course, as we know, within a matter of hours after the Chancellor&#146;s Budget his forecasts were shown to be a fantasy. That means that the reality for families in this country could end up being far worse. Over-optimistic forecasts by the Treasury mean that Labour&#146;s debt mountain could grow even higher.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para3"><a name="09042838000370">The gross domestic product figures for the first quarter of 2009 have already proved the Chancellor wrong. The economy shrank by 1.9 per cent., which was worse than predicted by the Chancellor in his Budget. Instead of standing up and taking responsibility for the mess that Labour has put this country into, the Chancellor and the Secretary of State, today, have been giving us fantasy figures, refusing to recognise the Government&#146;s responsibility for the state of the economy and failing to come up with any credible answers about what needs to be done to fix our broken economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para4"><a name="09042838000371">We were in a similar position six months ago, last November, when the Chancellor gave his pre-Budget report. Back then, he said that the economy would shrink by 1.5 per cent. in 2009. The Budget prediction is now a 3.5 per cent. fall. Less than an hour after the Chancellor sat down from his Budget, the IMF forecast that growth would fall by 4.1 per cent. If the Government cannot face up to the true nature of the problems that we face, there is no way that they can draw up a credible plan for recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para5"><a name="09042838000372">Let us take as an example the handling of the unemployment crisis, about which the Secretary of State has boasted so much this afternoon. The pre-Budget report predicted that the unemployment claimant count would reach 1.41 million by the end of 2009. Last week&#146;s unemployment figures showed that the claimant  <br>

count had already passed the Chancellor&#146;s prediction. It was higher in March than the Chancellor predicted that it would be in December.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para6"><a name="09042838000373">The new predictions in last week&#146;s Budget paint an even more worrying picture. Claimant unemployment will pass 2 million by the end of this year and reach 2.44 million by the end of 2010, 1 million higher than the Government predicted six months ago. On current figures, that means that the Government are now predicting that unemployment will rise to more than 3 million. Sadly, it is the unemployed who will pay the price for Labour&#146;s failure to face up to reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para7"><a name="09042838000374">I consider it welcome that extra support is being given for the unemployed in the Budget and the Red Book, but, unfortunately, because the Government could not be honest about the scale of the problem earlier, many people will have to wait until January to receive that extra help. The Government and the Secretary of State keep using the phrase &#147;Real help now&#148;, but &#147;now&#148; is many months away for most people. The help that comes next January will come two years after unemployment first began to rise.</p>

 Just to correct the right hon. Lady, it will actually start from the autumn. The guarantee starts from January. This is a massive improvement in policy and it clearly takes a bit of time to put in place. We need to get bids from local councils, but even doing that is quick. The help that we said in the pre-Budget report that we would provide is already here, as is the help that we announced in January. It all came in on time. The right hon. Lady can complain about it not coming in quickly enough&#151;it would not come in at all under her party.</p>

 The Secretary of State says that it is all right, because it will take six months, rather than nine months, for help to come in. That is still rather different from saying that there is real help now. Virtually every announcement that the Government have made about the help that they are giving to businesses, home owners and unemployed people has taken months to bring in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para8"><a name="09042838000377">The Secretary of State made some statements in his speech about our considering the impact that this situation has on people. He is absolutely right. When we are debating in this House, we must never forget that while we might talk about the figures, behind those figures lie shattered lives for many people. It is crueller, however, to say to people that they will get help now and then to delay that help. If the home owner mortgage support scheme had come into place when the Government announced it, 28,000 homes might not have been repossessed. That is the impact on people&#146;s lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para9"><a name="09042838000378">If the Secretary of State had not been so complacent earlier about rising unemployment, perhaps we would have seen that help coming through earlier. If he had been honest with himself about the level of worklessness, perhaps he would not have had to make plans last November to cut the new deal across half the country this summer. Indeed, if the Government had taken action when unemployment started to rise more than a year ago&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I will talk about job centres, as the Secretary of State did. The point that I am making, which I shall continue to make, is very simple. The Government continued to close jobcentres when unemployment started to rise. If the Secretary of State  <br>

 The right hon. Lady always gets her facts wrong on this, and she is wrong again. The six-month offer means that people have almost exactly the same help as they have from the new deal for young people already&#151;they are getting that from April. The flexible new deal will be a further improvement for people after one year. The fundamental thing is that the right hon. Lady says she supports that money. Does that mean she is changing her party&#146;s position on the fiscal stimulus in the PBR, which the Conservatives opposed? She has a choice: she can either oppose the fiscal stimulus or not have the extra spending. Which is it?</p>

 The Secretary of State really needs to stop running with that fantasy story, which cuts no ice with anybody. I notice that he did not actually respond to me on the issue of jobcentres&#151;the point I was making when he intervened. In the House last November, he declared a moratorium on Jobcentre Plus closures, yet instead of that moratorium being effective from last November, three further jobcentres&#151;in Brixton, Orpington and Feltham&#151;have closed. The last of them closed only at the beginning of this month. Members may be interested to know how much unemployment has risen in the areas where those three jobcentres closed this year: 40 per cent. in Streatham in the last year, 70 per cent. in Feltham and 90 per cent. in Orpington.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09042838000381">In part of his speech, the Secretary of State made quite something of the help that was being given and how people were being helped more quickly by the Government&#146;s decisions. In that case, why did more than 35,000 people wait for 17 days or more in December for their claim for jobseeker&#146;s allowance&#151;for some money to come through from the Government?</p>

 What I am happy to tell the right hon. Gentleman is that when we come into government, we shall ensure that there is extra money available to help the unemployed, because we shall put through the welfare reform proposals that the Secretary of State has tried to copy but has been extremely timid about. They would mean that money can be used to pay for programmes to get people into work at a rather quicker rate than he would do under his welfare reform proposals. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> From a sedentary position, the Secretary of State says, &#147;Oh, well you&#146;re going to be spending more.&#148; He is well aware that there is a fundamental difference between our welfare reform proposals and his proposals. He does not like to talk about it, which is why I said he was timid: the switch in the DWP budget that enables us to pay for programmes to help get people into work from the benefits that can be saved will be made across the whole country, whereas under his proposals it would be done merely across half the country, which would mean that half the country will not actually benefit from his welfare reform proposals. In one part of his speech, he said that our policies would abandon people to a lifetime on benefits. In that case why has he copied them?</p>

 The right hon. Lady is all over the place on this. She knows perfectly well that those were Government proposals that the Conservatives decided to try to copy. She cannot say that she will spend more on welfare reform and more on unemployment and that, magically, the money will somehow come from the City. She may have noticed that it is quite hard to raise money from the City at the moment. It is absolutely impossible for her to say that she will raise welfare&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The point is that if we want to save money on the welfare bill, we have to spend more up front. There is no way the right hon. Lady can increase money for welfare reform and for unemployment&#151;it is simply not possible for her to make that promise.</p>

 I am beginning to think that I have been sitting through a different debate from the Secretary of State. I do not think the City was mentioned by anybody on the Conservative Benches. Let us get one thing absolutely straight. The Secretary of State said we were talking about his welfare reform proposals that we had copied. I suggest he looks at the 2001 Conservative party manifesto, where he will see that the &#147;Britain Works&#148; section includes precisely that sort of welfare reform proposal. I know the proposals were in that manifesto, because they were my proposals as shadow Secretary of State for Education and Employment at the time. I am only sorry that it has taken the Labour Government so long, despite the best efforts of the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) in their early days, to accept the need for welfare reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para11"><a name="09042838000386">Let me examine in detail the extra help announced in the Budget for the unemployed. There is an additional &#163;1.7 billion to support Jobcentre Plus and the flexible new deal. The Secretary of State did not set this out in great detail in his speech, so when the Chief Secretary winds up the debate, I hope she will tell us how much of that money will go to Jobcentre Plus and how much will be spent on the flexible new deal. Given the figures in the Budget, we conclude that the money will support the increased number of unemployed people, rather than giving extra support to jobseekers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para12"><a name="09042838000387">There is also a need to look at long-term youth unemployment and those who find themselves unemployed in the early stages of their lives.

 I want to clarify the right hon. Lady&#146;s position. She says that she welcomes the additional funding in the Budget to help the unemployed. Between the pre-Budget report and the Budget, we have been providing an additional &#163;5 billion to support the unemployed, the majority of which comes from additional short-term borrowing to support the economy.

The Red Book makes it absolutely clear that the guaranteed jobs or training will be available to 18 to 24-year-olds who have been on jobseeker&#146;s allowance for more than one year. Their number stands at 6,700, out of a claimant count of 1.46 million. In other words, the Government&#146;s plans would help less than 1 per cent. of jobseekers. I notice that the Secretary of State is not rising to say that I am wrong about those figures.</p>

 As my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) points out, the Government cannot make up their mind on whether we have no policies or lots of policies that they do not like. I remind the Secretary of State that one of our policies that he does like is our policy for welfare reform, which he has copied, albeit not to the extent that I would like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90428-0009.htm_para19"><a name="09042858000011">As the right hon. Gentleman has challenged me on the figure of 6,700, let us look at the position on young long-term unemployed people. According to the Red Book definition, the help is for 18 to 24-year-olds who have been unemployed for a year or more and claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance, of whom there are 6,700. If the Secretary of State is saying that the money is not there to help 6,700, he must be predicting that the number of young long-term unemployed people will increase significantly in the next few months. That is a rather different position from the one taken by the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, who gave evidence to the Work and Pensions Committee last December saying that despite the most virulent stories of doom and gloom from some, there were no projections that the pool of longer-term unemployed would grow at the same rate as unemployment.</p>

As was pointed out by my hon.

The Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills is doing his best to make the problems worse: as a result of the Government&#146;s failure to meet their target on university places, up to an additional 30,000 young people could be turned down for a place.</p>

 Absolutely. The way in which the Government have failed to accept the problems that young people are facing as a result of their policies is a betrayal of young people. The issue is not just about further education colleges and university places; between August 2008 and this January, there were 4,000 fewer apprenticeship starts for 18 to 24-year-olds than in the same period in the previous year. <i> [Interruption.] </i>From a sedentary position, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions keeps muttering about more spending. I remind him that we are talking about his Government&#146;s promises, and his Government&#146;s delivery on his Government&#146;s policies. There are fewer university places, FE colleges are having their expansion plans cut, and there have been fewer apprenticeship starts. How does that help young people who are looking to make their way in the world?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90428-0010.htm_para0"><a name="09042858000015">Other aspects of the Government&#146;s &#147;Budget for jobs&#148; deserve to be looked at in greater detail. On the Government&#146;s pledge of 250,000 new jobs, 50,000 of those would come about by providing the social care sector with a &#163;1,500 recruitment subsidy. Hon. Members may feel that that sounds familiar; indeed it does. It sounds rather like the golden hello announced back in January. The difference, of course, is that the golden hello had a &#163;2,500 subsidy for recruitment, so far from the subsidy being better, it has actually been cut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="90428-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09042858000016">I hope that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury will explain in rather more detail how the new proposals for long-term unemployed young people will work in relation to the flexible new deal. What the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has announced sounds similar to the flexible new deal that will be brought in later this year in parts of the country. We need to know how the programmes will interact. We face the prospect of the Government paying to create jobs, paying to guarantee young people those jobs, and paying welfare-to-work providers to get young people into the jobs that the Government have paid to create and to guarantee for young people. We need to ensure that we do not make the same mistakes that Labour has been making for the past 12 years by throwing money at the issue without giving real thought to how it will help people out there on the ground, and make a difference to their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="90428-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09042858000017">I want to mention briefly other aspects of the Budget. Increasing the funds available for the social fund will certainly help people during the recession. I am pleased that that measure has been brought forward, but I note that what the Government give with one hand, they take away with the other: they are raiding &#163;145 million from housing benefit next year. Giving tenants incentives to be more flexible in their choice of accommodation was the whole basis of the local housing allowance. It was intended to promote personal responsibility, but the Government have U-turned on it, and claimants will no longer be able to keep the surplus if the fixed LHA rate is higher than their rent. That means that the impact of the Budget will be to cut money from some of Britain&#146;s poorest households.</p>

they needed to invest an extra &#163;4.3 billion in benefits and tax credits if they were to meet their 2010 target. The Budget delivered &#163;120 million. The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb), who speaks for the Liberal Democrats on such issues, has already referred to the point about the cost of a pint of milk. The Child Poverty Action Group made it clear that the impact of the extra support given in the Budget amounts to less than the cost of a pint of milk a week. The Budget still leaves 600,000 children in poverty&#151;600,000 children whom Labour had promised to help.</p>

 Had we been on the Government Benches, the situation that we would have been dealing with, in relation to the finances of this country, would have been rather different. The reason why the Chancellor of the Exchequer found it so difficult to do anything about the matter when he stood at the Dispatch Box was that 12 years of a Labour Government has led us to the deepest recession since the second world war and to the largest Government borrowing over two years seen in peacetime history. The hon. Member for Northavon should note that what we are talking about is the reason why the Labour Government were unable to provide that help in the Budget.</p>

Pensioners and savers are the innocent victims of the recession. That is why we called on the Government to introduce tax changes that would deliver help and support for basic-rate taxpayers and pensioners. Sadly, however, the Government do not understand the value of saving, as all that they have ever done is spend, spend. The savings ratio has been slashed to a almost five times lower than what it was in 1997; more than 12.8 million jobs have no pension provision&#151;800,000 more than last year, and 2.4 million more than 1997. I accept that there were measures such as the increased individual savings account limits and the rise in the capital disregard for pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit in the Budget last year, but our proposals for the Budget and the change in savings would have put about &#163;3 billion a year back into the pockets of pensioners and savers. The announcements in the Budget are worth only &#163;90 million a year to savers and pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="90428-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09042858000026">I want to refer briefly to the tax rise on pensions. I am afraid that the Budget was more about politics than about presenting a plan for economic recovery. There is a sense of d&#233;j  vu. One of Gordon Brown&#146;s first acts as Chancellor was to raid &#163;100 billion from pension funds, and now as Prime Minister, his latest tax hike in relation to the higher-rate relief on pension contributions will take a further &#163;3 billion a year out of pensions. Those changes are not being implemented from 2011, as the Government would have people believe&#151;some new rules on higher-rate tax relief for earnings above &#163;150,000 came into effect the day after the Budget. Not only do they taper higher-rate tax relief for those earning over &#163;150,000 but they tax employer contributions. Savings, of course, will be taxed when people begin to draw their pensions. Those proposals break the basic covenant between savers and the Government, enshrined in the Turner report on pensions, that responsible savers will be rewarded for locking up income in pensions savings for their retirement. Instead of being rewarded, however, they will be taxed several times over. The changes will add more complications to an over-complicated system, too. Any claims that the Government want to simplify pension savings and their administration have been completely undermined by what the Chancellor did in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90428-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09042858000027">The Chancellor said that the measure was about fairness, but the money raised in taxes from the pensions of high earners will not go towards improving pensions for those on low incomes. It will simply help to plug the black hole in finances created by Labour. In the words of Dr. Ros Altmann, who said in her response to the Budget:</p>
<a name="90428-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="09042858000246"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Instead of encouraging people to save while the economy was doing well, Government policy encouraged spending and borrowing as if there was no tomorrow. But there is a tomorrow. And for those approaching retirement, it is looking distinctly bleak.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90428-0010.htm_para7"><a name="09042858000028">Let us be clear: we do not believe that increasing taxes on pensions is the right thing to do. We do not support it, but we are not going to be dragged into playing Labour&#146;s games. There are a number of new tax rises with which we do not agree, but this one will have to take its place in the queue. Our priority is that of all of Gordon Brown&#146;s tax rises, the most important ones&#151;</p>

The most unfair of those is the national insurance increase for millions of people earning &#163;20,000 or more&#151;a tax on jobs. At the very time that Britain will be trying to recover from recession, when millions of unemployed want to get back into work, Labour wants to raise a tax on jobs. We will ignore the dog-whistle politics that was presented in last week&#146;s Budget, and focus on avoiding Labour&#146;s tax cuts for the many, not the few.</p>

It brought total fiscal support through discretionary action in the Budget, the pre-Budget report and the automatic stabilisers to 4 per cent. of GDP, on top of the other action to boost the flow of credit and cut interest rates. Goodness knows where the economy might be heading now if the Government had instead followed Conservative strictures, and had not acted promptly to adopt a Keynesian response to the crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90428-0010.htm_para12"><a name="09042858000036">Conservatives seem to forget that the purpose of extra public borrowing is to make up for the collapse in private spending brought about by the global financial crisis. By helping families who are in danger of losing their homes and their livelihoods, and by helping firms that cannot spend because their banks will no longer lend, Government can stop economic casualties turning into social catastrophes. Without such Government action and borrowing, millions more jobs, and tens of thousands more businesses, would be in jeopardy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90428-0010.htm_para13"><a name="09042858000037">Borrowing is rising because of the impact on UK public finances of the world economic crisis, not the so-called public spending extravagance beloved of the leader of the Conservative party and his right wing media allies. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that the global financial crisis is costing the Exchequer around &#163;90 billion per year, owing to lost tax revenues and higher social security costs. The fiscal stimulus since last year&#146;s Budget accounts for only about &#163;26 billion of the nearly &#163;400 billion increase in Government debt to 2012, or roughly one fifteenth of that total.</p>

They have failed to learn the grim lesson of the 1930s that cutting Government spending during a recession only makes the economic situation worse, causing total spending in the economy to fall even further, resulting in more redundancies, higher social security spending and even higher Government borrowing and debt.

 Tackling the threat of slump, which means combining vigorous fiscal and monetary policy with unconventional measures to restore the flow of credit, is vital to recovery. But, of course, once we have warded off the threat of recession or depression there is no escaping our responsibility to bring the public finances back into shape in the medium term, as the Chancellor has made clear. That must mean reshaping the subsequent trajectory of Government spending and taxation, which means cuts in some past plans, deferring other ambitions and raising some taxes on a fair basis. But today&#146;s problems must come first.</p>

There is reluctance on the Conservative Benches to admit that this recession is different from every other post-war recession, both in its origins and in its scale. [Hon. Members: &#147;It is worse.&#148;] Indeed, and it is much more serious because of the global financial crisis that the Conservatives refuse to acknowledge. There is a refusal to accept that we are passing through extraordinary times that demand an extraordinary response, with action on a scale unprecedented in the post-war period.</p>

His most recent warning is that, without strong fiscal action, precisely of the kind that the Chancellor announced last week, today&#146;s downturn could fall further and last longer than any recent recession, causing UK unemployment to soar towards 4 million next year, potentially condemning a generation of Britain&#146;s young workers to years on the dole.</p>

They have given headline-grabbing examples such as regional assembly abolition and senior public servant pay restraint, but those savings would barely register on the spending Richter scale.

Would they bring in charges for public services, such as visits to the doctor, or lift the ceiling on student fees in universities and colleges? Would they scrap teaching assistants in schools?

So, let us look at their record in office for a few clues. The first Budget of Margaret Thatcher&#146;s Administration saw Geoffrey Howe almost double VAT from 8 to 15 per cent. to pay for income tax cuts. The first Budget of John Major&#146;s Government saw Norman Lamont raise VAT again, to 17.5 per cent. to pay for the poll tax. Can the shadow Chancellor deny that he is considering raising VAT to 20 per cent. if they win next time to cut Government debt and pay for the cuts in inheritance and income taxes that he has promised? Can he rule out dropping zero rating for food, fares and children&#146;s clothing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09042858000059">The Tories have cultivated the image of &#147;compassionate Conservatism&#148;. We heard that phrase first from George Bush, and we know how destructive his policies were. At Davos, the Conservative leader promised &#147;capitalism with a conscience&#148;, but it would be with a guilty conscience. Two days before the Budget, a <i> Financial Times</i> editorial noted that tightening fiscal policy now might deepen the recession and worsen the subsequent fiscal outcome&#151;what it termed &#147;futile masochism&#148;. Yet, what does the Leader of the Opposition want? He wants exactly such spending restraint. And when does he want it? Now. That is what he said in his reply to the Budget. By driving the economy into depression, the Cameron cuts would shrink tax revenues and swell social security bills. The outcome would be the opposite of what he has promised, meaning even higher Government borrowing, yet more national debt and mass misery for millions sacrificed on the altar of right-wing Tory dogma.</p>

concentrated in certain areas. This lunchtime I had a meeting with construction industry representatives, and they think that 500,000 of their employees will be out of work by the end of this year. That will bear particularly heavily on young people. I&#151;like colleagues from all parts of the House, I am sure&#151;was recently in discussions with local universities, and, in the wake of the milk round, many estimate that, this year, one in two of their graduates will not have jobs to go to. A lot of pain will be concentrated among them, as well as among less well educated young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09042858000064">It is fair to say that the Budget contained a series of measures that, in themselves, were perfectly desirable and sensible, such as attempts to stimulate the economy and, therefore, employment in different ways. The problem with many of the specific measures, however, was their extremely small impact. I shall touch on two measures. There is the proposal for investment allowances, which are eminently sensible, a response to requests from the business community and welcome in themselves. There was also a useful advance on trade credit insurance, but the problem is that it comes very late in the day&#151;three months after the French introduced a similar scheme&#151;and trade insurers now tell us that they will not implement the top-ups under the scheme. They are not satisfied with the data&#151;the annual accounts of companies&#151;that are available to them, so there is continued credit restriction in that field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09042858000065">The problem with the Budget, faced with rising unemployment and the need to do something about it, can be summed up by what the Government did on social housing. With a bit of a fanfare, they announced &#163;100 million for council housing, but, when we break that down, it means 600 to 700 houses throughout Britain, or two per constituency. One might say that that argument is unfair, because the announcement comes on top of the pre-Budget report, which, if fully implemented, would probably give us 6,000 to 7,000 houses throughout Britain; however, given the scale of the problem, the contraction of the construction industry and the 1.7 million people on home waiting lists, we are talking about small drops in large oceans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09042858000066">We recognise the financial constraints that the Government are operating under, and that if resources were to be channelled into job creation schemes, it would have to be done by stopping something else. We have therefore argued that the Government should stop the cut in value added tax. We understand why they did it&#151;they were in a panic in the autumn and had to do something quickly&#151;but it soon became apparent that it was not working. It was not feeding through into employment&#151;a lot of it was ending up absorbed in retail margins. Now, we can reflect on that evidence, stop the cut and redirect that funding into focused programmes. Social housing would be the most important area, and it could be done quickly because the institutions are already available. Amplifying the home insulation programme would provide environmental benefits, as well as jobs and the creation of an asset.</p>

 As I said, we are suggesting cancelling the VAT cut to provide funding for social investment. There is also an argument for maintaining the flow of public investment through the cycle; that is a separate issue, and we can go on to discuss its implications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09042858000069">What is absolutely crucial is what is happening in the banking system. The banking system is the elephant in the room. The measures that the Government introduced are of a minuscule proportion by comparison with the scale of lending decisions by the now semi-nationalised banks. Just to remind ourselves&#151;I have often said this in the past&#151;the semi-nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland has a balance sheet one and a half times bigger than the British economy. It follows that any of its lending decisions far outweigh the fiscal stimulus, or whatever the Government call it, that originated in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para13"><a name="09042858000070">Two worrying aspects of the controversy regarding the banking system arose during Treasury questions today. First, there is a complete lack of clarity about the potential losses resulting from Government intervention in the banking system. We fully supported that intervention, which had to happen. We do not agree with some of the more recent developments, such as the asset protection scheme, but the intervention last October to put fresh capital into the banks was absolutely essential. However, we are now getting wildly different estimates of the potential losses. The Government have said&#151;it was confirmed in Treasury questions&#151;that the estimate was at the top end, in the order of 3 per cent. of GDP, or about &#163;50 billion. The IMF, even with its qualified and reduced numbers, is talking about &#163;130 billion; &#163;85 billion is a large margin of error, by any estimate. We need some thoughtful figures from the Treasury about what the implications of that would be. Who would bear those losses? How much would accrue to the Treasury? How much would it affect its debt and deficit estimates in the years ahead? There is an enormous black hole over and above the deficits and debts that have already been predicted, and we need to think about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09042858000071">The second, more immediate worry is the Government&#146;s decision&#151;apparently&#151;to proceed with the rapid sale of Northern Rock. The Chancellor said in Treasury questions that he was not in any hurry, but if that is so, why is Credit Suisse going round the City trying to market it? The Government are clearly planning a sale of the bank. I have no objection in principle to its re-privatisation&#151;we argued from the outset that it was a temporary nationalisation&#151;but to sell it now, in depressed asset markets, is absolutely criminal. It means that the taxpayer will get a very poor return, and there will be very large and unnecessary losses. All the experience that we have learned from other countries that have been through this process, such as Sweden and Israel, is that if Governments show patience and sell off their good banking institutions at the end of a crisis, they can realise many of the losses that they have incurred on the taxpayer&#146;s behalf. The Government must not rush ahead with this sale. Quite apart from the financial aspects, Northern Rock, after a somewhat uncertain start when it thought that its job was simply to run down its books, is now lending&#151;it is one of the few banks that seems willing to do so in otherwise depressed markets. It seems beyond comprehension that they should be considering selling it off when it is doing something useful. I hope that the Chief Secretary will be able to elaborate on what the Chancellor said, because the hints that are coming out are very worrying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para15"><a name="09042858000072">Let me move on to the core issue, which is the scale of the deficit&#151;the 30 per cent. of GDP borrowing requirement and the 10 per cent.-plus of GDP budget deficit going forward. That is bad enough in itself, but we know from the numbers that have emerged that it is unlikely to be reduced in any foreseeable time scale unless we make heroic assumptions about the rate of economic growth. I have debated with the Chief Secretary in the media and elsewhere how implausible some of us think these assumptions are. I think that her view&#151;I do not know if it is the Government&#146;s&#151;is that there will be a bounce-back in the economy in much the same way as happened in the last two recessions under the Conservative Government. However, there is a fundamental difference, because in those two recessions, unlike the present one, the banking system was not burnt out. We are now dealing with wrecked financial institutions, which means that we cannot assume that the economy will return, as it would normally, to that kind of growth rate.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is painting a gloomy picture, but there are rays of sunshine, are there not? In the insurance industry, for example, he will have seen that Aviva, the parent company of Norwich Union, is boasting that people trust its products and have stuck with them; indeed, savings have increased, and its figures look good at this point. We can be miserable and say that we do not know how things will improve, but that is happening in certain places. Because of good management and good structures, even a Footsie company such as Aviva can survive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09042858000075">There are some positive things in the public sector figures; following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s theme, I will be positive, as perhaps I have been too negative. One very positive statistic, which the Government have not made enough of, is that this year the share of taxation in GDP has fallen to the lowest level for half a century. I do not know whether the Government are aware of this, but they have achieved something that Mrs. Thatcher would have given her right arm for. They have cut the tax burden on the economy to an extraordinarily low level: that may not have been planned for, but it is a real achievement. However, there are two stings in the tail. First, while the tax burden in the economy has been dramatically cut, expenditure has not. Whereas the tax burden is at the lowest level since 1960, when Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister, expenditure as a share of the economy is now 48 per cent., as opposed to 35 per cent. for tax. That is the highest level since the Falklands war, when we previously had a peak in this respect. Clearly, we will have a symbolic breakthrough when we hit 50 per cent. of GDP as expenditure in the next year or so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09042858000076">The other major explanation for this is that it has not been done in a planned way, and it has happened simply because of the collapse in Government revenue. However, I would say in the Government&#146;s defence that this is a long-standing problem; it did not just happen over the past 10 years. We have an economy that has, over the past quarter of a century, become seriously over-dependent on income from the City of London and from the housing market. Over the past five years, when some of  <br>

us have been warning about the vulnerability of the British economy, the Government relied on those two sources alone for half of all the increase in their revenue. Of course, they have now evaporated.</p>

<p><a name="st_o271"><a name="09042858000077"><a name="90428-0011.htm_spnew7"><a name="09042858000290"><b>Mr. Frank Field:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman says that the level of expenditure is at about 48 per cent. Did he see table C7 in the Red Book, which shows that even when the Government hope that the economy will be all singing and dancing again, they only get tax revenue back up to just over 38 per cent., so the structural imbalance that he is talking about is projected forward by the Government?</p>

<p><a name="st_o272"><a name="09042858000078"><a name="90428-0011.htm_spnew8"><a name="09042858000291"><b>Dr. Cable:</b>
 Indeed, and depending on one&#146;s point of view, that is a source of celebration or of enormous anxiety. I believe that it is a source of anxiety, given the difficulties of funding it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09042858000079">The other reason why this problem is not just a short-term one&#151;it is easy to blame the Government for being complacent, but it goes back much further&#151;is clear from the numbers emerging from the Budget and the Red Book. The underlying weakness of the public finances has been clear for many years. If we go back to the beginning of the 1990s, the net worth of the British Government&#146;s stock of assets was about 80 per cent. of GDP. It then fell to about 20 per cent. in 1997, as the Government essentially kept the deficit down through asset sales. According to the Government&#146;s new projections, the British state will go into negative net worth in two years. In simple, common-sense terms, that means that if all aspects of the British Government were put on the market&#151;all their land, property and equipment&#151;they would have to pay somebody to take them away. That suggests the seriousness of the problem that we face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para19"><a name="09042858000080">The implications of that are serious. Harsh choices will have to be made about both taxation and public spending. We have taken the view that the burden of those hard choices will have to fall on public expenditure. I shall develop that point in a few moments, but in both cases the choices will be very difficult. There will be tax increase proposals, some of which, such as the fuel duty increase, we will not oppose given the extremity of the situation. In such cases, measures need to be taken to protect people who are particularly vulnerable. That is why we will again propose a rural exemption based on the EU rules, to help people in remote rural areas who will be damaged by the situation. None the less, we will not oppose the principle of such increases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09042858000081">The big tax controversy that has emerged in the debate is the 50 per cent. tax rate. Perhaps I should say that I am exceptionally well qualified to talk about that, having argued both sides of the case in recent years. Having had that experience, I am reasonably well equipped with the arguments. I and my colleagues have no objection in principle to high rates of taxation on very wealthy people to fund a more equitable society. That seems absolutely right. The problem is that such things will stick only if the many tax loopholes are dealt with.</p>

the two were equalised. There is now a yawning gap between the two, and anybody in the City approaching their bosses for a discussion on bonuses will immediately ask, &#147;What&#146;s the point of my paying 50 per cent tax on my marginal income when I can convert it into stock and pay 18 per cent. on any capital gains that accrue as a result of the recovery of the stock market?&#148; That is obvious, and they probably do not even need an army of tax accountants to help them do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90428-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09042858000083">I understand, although I was not there, that in the Treasury Committee this morning, Treasury officials conceded that as a result of such continuing tax loopholes, the Government would be able to collect only something in the order of 30 per cent. of the potential revenue from the income tax increase. Even their own estimates take no account whatever of the decline in indirect taxation that will be the result of the change. Our view is that the Government have missed a major opportunity to have a much more broadly based, but more equitable, tax system. They could indeed have a higher tax take from high-income groups, but with an optimum maximum tax rate of probably about 40 per cent, provided that they closed all the loopholes associated with it, whether on pension tax relief or capital gains tax. In that way, they would raise substantially more revenue, which could be used to lift people on low incomes out of income tax altogether. That is our broad approach to the problem.</p>

 In many ways, that is consistent with what I have said about the need to lift people out of income tax. National insurance on employees is a form of income tax, and we can debate whether we should operate through income tax itself or through national insurance. We certainly want any revenue raised from high-income groups to be used to reduce the tax burden. We have argued that that should be done through income tax, and no doubt the hon. Gentleman would argue that it should be done by reducing national insurance contributions for people on low pay.</p>

There have been exchanges at the Dispatch Box about the &#163;5 billion a year additional efficiency savings, and I ask the obvious question why, if the Government knew that there were inefficiencies and that money could be saved, they have tolerated them. If they are genuine efficiency savings, why are they necessary? They are not efficiency savings&#151;we know that they are just a camouflage for real cuts, 60 per cent. of which, incidentally, will be in the national health service. That is clearly part of the plan.</p>

I should perhaps own up to the fact that I was at the launch of the reform document that he referred to critically. I disagreed with many of the specific proposals in it, but it did a valuable service in getting us away from all the waffle about the need for more austerity and general reductions in spending, and saying, &#147;Well, if you&#146;re going to make cuts, these are some of the things that you should be looking at.&#148; Perhaps, having considered cuts to a lot of the things that he mentioned, we should not pursue them, but it was right for the report to point out the areas on which we need to focus.</p>

 The approach that I suggest is rather superior. It is so easy to hide behind generalised waste. Throughout my fairly long political life, Opposition parties in local government and national Government have campaigned on cutting waste, which is difficult. Perhaps the hon.

In the past, we have said that there needs to be an advance in the discussion of Government budgets and fiscal policy, comparable to that which made the Bank of England independent. For 20 years, Governments in this country and elsewhere struggled with inflation and having an inflation anchor. The concept of independent central banks has been implemented and will be important in the UK as the economy recovers and we get back to inflation. We have nothing comparable for fiscal policy apart from the rules, which have been widely disregarded. Part of the answer, as the Liberal Democrats argued five years ago, is an Ofsted-type system, which has oversight of fiscal rules and their implementation. The Conservatives have devised a variant of that, which is interesting in its slightly different way. However, the House is missing in all that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90428-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09042858000103">It is striking that we will move from the debate to weeks of intensive discussion of tax proposals in infinite detail, but, apart from the Public Accounts Committee, which the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) chairs, there is no systematic discussion in the House of public spending, unless it happens retrospectively. We must introduce a process whereby hon. Members hold a mature debate on the subject and preferably approve or disapprove public expenditure. That is currently missing. It is partly a question of debating points and identifying the items, but we must all recognise that we have a responsibility here to start focusing on that debate, which is currently non-existent.</p>

Countries such as China, America, France, India, Brazil and many more were represented. Were those representatives there to talk about Labour&#146;s recession, or did they accept the case for dealing with the global downturn, which means working together and not splitting hairs in the way in which we have done again in today&#146;s debate?</p>

It is no comfort to the British people during this global downturn to look at Germany, Ireland and Iceland, which were being held up as beacons of economic progress, the latter particularly in Scotland.

What happened? There were 3 million unemployed and the county of Lanarkshire, including Ravenscraig, Gartcosh and Caterpillar tractors, was devastated. Small firm after small firm seeking to serve what were once great engineering and shipbuilding industries found that their talents, ability and commitment were regarded as a price worth paying.

However, it is time for the energy companies&#151;the electricity and gas suppliers&#151;to respond to the Government&#146;s concerns and the actions that we have taken to remove fuel poverty.

 It is always a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Coatbridge and various other bits of Lanarkshire that I do not remember (Mr. Clarke). I would say to him that no one denies that we are facing a worldwide recession; the debate is about why we are uniquely badly placed to meet it. The Chancellor tells us that we will get through the crisis. Of course the British people will get through it; we need to ask when we will arrive at the calmer waters that we all want to reach, given the &#163;45 billion black hole in our budget. Even the Institute for Fiscal Studies, with all the expertise that it can bring to this subject, finds it difficult to understand where 50 per cent. of the resources to fill that black hole will come from. It refers to measures &#147;yet to be announced&#148;, and we would have liked to hear the Secretary of State announcing the measures to plug that black hole here today.</p>

Those on the Treasury Bench have made some promises that I welcome. I welcome the promised &#163;5 billion of efficiency savings for next year, if they can be achieved. I welcome the goal of &#163;9 billion of back-office efficiencies by 2014. That is a laudable aim. I welcome the &#163;16 billion promised in asset sales by the Government by 2015. That is to be encouraged, but can it be achieved? The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) asked why, if efficiency savings were so clear and so likely to be achieved, it took so long to identify them. The National Audit Office has proved again and again that only about a quarter of the efficiency savings claimed by the Government can actually be validated.</p>

There are five times more consultants per employee in the public sector than there are in the private sector. That is &#163;10,000 for each civil servant who has a consultant. Do we need them all? Do we need the vast variation in the cost of office accommodation? I have asked before why the Treasury is the most expensive Department in terms of office accommodation. Why can we redeploy only 24,000 civil servants from central London? Could we not get rid of more assets? It is true that the Government got rid of &#163;1.5 billion of assets last year, but they acquired many more. Funnily enough, among those few things that I have been talking about for the past minute or so, I have identified &#163;5 billion worth of savings, none of which would have any impact whatever on front-line services.</p>

Will the non-executive directors that we have been hearing about be able to stop wasteful spending when they see it? Will the public value programme have real targets, expressed in pound signs, and will it go far enough and fast enough? Those are a few questions for Ministers. If those detailed questions on efficiency savings and other matters cannot be answered in clear terms, we might be talking about a sticking plaster to deal with the black hole, rather than a real attempt to fill it.</p>

As my right hon. Friend said, that is &#163;22,000 for every baby now being born. My sister-in-law came in when we were having a family lunch last weekend and said, &#147;Great news!

There has been a complete lack of accountability, with &#163;500 million perhaps wasted.

 Members of the PAC are very proud of the fact that it is not partisan and that 90 per cent. of our recommendations are accepted by the Government, but the hit rate on delivery is not so great. As the whole Budget process has been mentioned, may I say that it is fantastically weak? When the President of the United States proposes a budget, Congress disposes. Our Budget process is one of the weakest in the world, so last year I proposed having a proper Budget committee. As the hon.

The Finance Bill will now go into Committee, where hundreds of amendments will be tabled but not one passed, where there will be no proper debate and where an average of a few seconds&#146; consideration will be given to each amendment.

This debate will not be reported; all of tomorrow&#146;s papers will be talking about swine flu. If that takes off, will anybody want to ask our opinion about it?

right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) spoke powerfully to that end. The Tories have been wrong to advocate letting a brutal self-corrective capitalism play itself out, while keeping a very tight lid on any increase in the national debt incurred by remedial Government action. Having said that, the manner in which the Government have chosen to develop their strategy has been ill-advised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90428-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09042858000154">As we all know, the Government&#146;s approach has been geared to splurging eye-watering sums on bailing out the banks&#151;a staggering &#163;1.2 trillion has been committed so far&#151;in the hope that the banks would correspondingly expand their lending to businesses and home owners. In fact, the banks have been doing the opposite, by continuing to contract their lending. The relevant money supply measure of this lending&#151;M4&#151;fell from 16 per cent. in September 2007, when the crisis began, to the latest figure of just 3.5 per cent. in February.</p>

I can assume only that it was because the whole power structure of neo-liberal finance capitalism is built precisely on this close nexus between the banks and the state. The trouble is that the concentration on preserving the current power structure as the first priority has led to the whole of the rest of the economy and society being exposed by the failure of this policy. What the Government should have done&#151;and should still do now&#151;is focus their fiscal stimulus, which I strongly support, directly on businesses and home owners, and not through the intermediation of the banks. A much more stable, less costly and more rewarding Budget would thus become possible.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is making a very good point about the paucity of economic modelling that assumes a very traditional relationship between low interest rates and a resultant level of credit and borrowing. What he perhaps might take on board is that that modelling no longer applies, because it is clear that although the stimulus that he described was designed to encourage greater lending, because of the perversity of some of the lenders its effect has been much less than predicted.</p>

 There are many reasons why the banks are not lending as much as the Government would like, one of which is that they have been given something of a conflict between lending to businesses and, at the same time, building up their balance sheets. The lowering of our interest rate&#151;at the start of the crisis it was 4.5 per cent., which was one of the highest figures in the western world, and it is now 0.5 per cent.&#151;was necessary, but I accept that there have been some perverse effects of the layering of different policies. I wish to develop this argument a bit further. As Paul Krugman, the American winner of the Nobel prize for economics last October, has said, the credit crunch is so drastic and the consequences so cataclysmic that it can be rapidly overcome only by taking temporary control of the banks. To be fair to the Government, they have already partly done that. The key point is that with the strength of the state  <br>

behind the banks, there would be no need for them to put their own interests first by consolidating their balance sheets as their first priority.</p>

The effect of that on the public finances would be dramatic. Instead of expending &#163;1.2 trillion on propping up the banks, the Government could take them over at a fraction of the cost. The Government have spent &#163;45 billion propping up the Royal Bank of Scotland, but they could have purchased it for &#163;4 billion, which was its stock market value in January this year. Lloyds, which was valued at &#163;35 billion a year ago, could have been bought on the stock market for just &#163;6 billion last October. All of the major banks could have been taken over at a fraction of the cost.</p>

But given that the Government are the owners, they should either sell off or junk assets that are next to worthless and then redirect the rest into lending in the wider economy that so desperately needs it. I know that that is a drastic approach, but in such times we must adopt such policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90428-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09042858000162">That policy would transform the Budget prospects. The deficit a year ago was just &#163;38 billion. By the time of the pre-Budget report in November, it had soared to &#163;118 billion. It is now &#163;175 billion, and unlikely to fall before reaching &#163;200 billion. The interest charge on this debt was given in the Budget as currently &#163;28 billion a year and the Chancellor expects it to rise to &#163;43 billion a year. If the banks had not been bailed out so profligately and instead lending on a far greater scale had been pumped directly into the economy, thus sharply reducing the costs of business rundowns and rapidly rising unemployment, the rise in the national debt would be far more modest, and the rise in debt interest correspondingly far less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90428-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09042858000163">It is reasonable to estimate that on that basis the national debt this year might have been reduced by between &#163;70 billion and &#163;100 billion, and the interest on that debt might have come down to below &#163;15 billion a year. That would dramatically change the Budget&#146;s bleak projections that investment spending must halve in the three years from 2011-12 and that total spending must be frozen over that period, with actual falls&#151;as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) said&#151;in real terms of more than 2 per cent. a year once fast-rising debt interest charges and sharply increasing unemployment costs are taken into account. The only way in which that could be avoided is by a review of policy along the lines that I have set out.</p>

As a means of encouraging his &#147;new age of austerity&#148;&#151;his words, not mine&#151;and to deal with the &#163;175 billion hole in the public accounts, he proposed publishing details of all public sector salaries over &#163;150,000 online. What a stunning idea. I am not sure that it would raise more than &#163;0.0001 billion, but it is such a good idea that we should not confine it to the public sector. In the interests of getting everyone to do more for less, perhaps the earnings of bankers, managers, traders, lawyers and all the financial-industrial executives should all be published online if they earn more than &#163;150,000. Why stop at pay, which is so small a part of their remuneration? On the say-so of the Leader of the Opposition we should also publish their bonuses, incentive schemes, fringe benefits and stock options. When I heard that suggestion, I could not help thinking, &#147;Well, Dave, I really think you&#146;ve started something.&#148;</p>

What a corker of an idea.&#148; We should apply that across the economy, including the private sector.

Tax could be increased for the 0.5 per cent. of the population that earns more than &#163;150,000 to a rate of 60 per cent., which would raise a further &#163;6.2 billion. For the 1 per cent. who earn more than &#163;100,000, the rate could be 50 per cent. That would leave 99 per cent. of the population entirely unaffected. Higher rate tax reliefs could be removed in other sectors and not just in pensions. Capital gains tax could be modestly restored to parity with income tax, which is exactly where Nigel Lawson left it. Non-domiciled tax exiles could be brought within the tax net from which they should never have been allowed to escape in the first place.

point out that the Government have to deal with the issue of toxic debt? They cannot just write it off in the modern global banking system. I would have thought&#151;I have spent some time thinking about this&#151;that it would have been much better if the right hon. Gentleman had advocated a structure similar to the Resolution Trust Corporation that was set up in the &#146;80s to deal with the savings and loans banks in the States. In the end, the corporation returned to the taxpayer a net profit from similar toxic debts. A similar system was set up in Sweden, and, again, there was a small net profit to the taxpayer. In my view, that would be a much better way of getting confidence back into the banks so that they could clean up their balance sheets and get their credit ratings up so that the credit could start flowing again.</p>

The biggest increase in employment in my borough has been caused by Jobcentre Plus hiring people to deal with those who are now unemployed.

I fought a by-election in Newcastle upon Tyne, in the Tyne Bridge constituency, in 1985. We had youth training schemes&#151;the YTS&#151;and the enterprise allowance scheme. My younger brother took up the opportunity offered by the enterprise allowance scheme very early on, and he is now running a very successful business, as he has done since the 1980s. The job clubs were introduced and there were a wide range of measures to help young people and other people who had lost their jobs.

 I am very happy to go along with the hon. Lady in one regard. At one stage, Mrs. Thatcher did reduce unemployment in this country by the simple device of transferring very many hundreds of thousands of people on to invalidity benefit, particularly in areas such as mine, which was then an active mining area.</p>

 It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman talks about the alleged transfer of people to invalidity benefit in the &#146;80s while ignoring what is going on now. There are as many people on invalidity benefit now as there were then, and it is to the shame of the Government that they have still done nothing about it. One of the first things they did when they came in was to abandon the rigorous system we had set up to ensure that only people who were genuinely unable to work should receive that benefit.</p>

 I want to comment on what the hon. Lady said about YTS and the other schemes of the mid-&#146;80s. All the evaluations of such schemes have shown that they were virtually worthless. Why? Because the people on them never got a job. There were never any jobs so widespread cynicism developed about the schemes. Ergo, to answer that point, the Labour Government decided that after a year people would have either a training place or a job.</p>

 Most Labour Members thought the Budget a fair and reasonable attempt by the Chancellor to tackle the worst impact of the recession on families and businesses. It identified and supported, where possible, areas for growth in the economy to help us come out of a recession born of the international credit crunch. It really is absurd and ridiculous for Opposition Members to suggest that the global economic downturn can be attributed to the policies of the Labour Government.</p>

Unfortunately, unemployment in my constituency is now rising. Therefore, during this recession, it is important that we do not adopt the old Tory policies of the past two recessions, which amounted to doing nothing and writing off not one but probably two generations of families. The Tories did nothing for people who lost their jobs and little for young people in school either. They also took no action to tackle the deindustrialisation of the economy that took place in the 1980s and, to some extent, the 1990s. Critically, that meant that they did not identify and support future growth areas, and they also simultaneously disinvested in education and skills.</p>

The key sectors identified are care, green industries, and hospitality and tourism. They are important for not only our future economy, but the future of our public services.</p>

The measure is very much about creating jobs in and for our local communities. The local projects will cover such things as arts, the environment and social care. Critically, the jobs will also support the social enterprise sector. I will be urging Durham county council, my local authority, to put forward an expression of interest for some of the money by the May deadline. Parts of County Durham have been particularly affected by the economic downturn, so I hope that some of the money comes our way.</p>

I will be arguing that some of that additional support should come to the north-east in general, and County Durham in particular. The critical aspect of the Government&#146;s actions is that they are intervening to support job creation in the parts of the economy that particularly need it and the places in the county hit hardest by the recession.</p>

If we are not to lose further ground to our competitors, it is essential that, even in these difficult times, money is found to invest in renewable energy projects and low-carbon developments, such as electric cars. I especially welcome the &#163;405 million to support low-carbon industries and advanced green manufacturing that will help to make the UK a world leader. I also welcome support through the renewables obligation for offshore wind investments that reach financial close between now and 2011. It is expected that that will support &#163;9 billion of investment and power up to 2.8 million homes. I welcome the new funding mechanism to support up to four carbon capture and storage demonstration projects and the &#163;90 million to fund detailed preparatory studies. Several north-east Members have been arguing for additional investment in CCS for some time, so we are especially pleased by the inclusion of additional money for that in the Budget.</p>

Of all my sources of anger at the last Conservative Government&#151;there are many, but I will not go into detail because some of them have been outlined&#151;the one about which I feel most strongly is the way in which investment in skills and training ebbed away in each successive year of that Conservative Administration, thus sucking opportunities and young people&#146;s potential out of our communities and leaving generations without any prospect of employment and with no belief in themselves. It is essential that the Government keep investing in the development of skills in our communities.</p>

It is a source of great sadness to me that, in my constituency, many opportunities to build affordable and rented properties were not taken by the Liberal Democrat council during the years of growth. The council simply let the market rip, with too many apartments being built, and now we lack good family housing and a real mix of tenures. The Government must put that right by enforcing planning policy statement 3 in any future house building initiatives. We must learn lessons so that money is used wisely from now on to plan for a sustainable future, to invest in low-carbon industries and to ensure that housing is delivered for everyone and not just those who can afford the latest market offering.</p>

I was taken to the 75th floor, where a presentation was made to me about the bank&#146;s global ambitions and how it hoped to expand and perhaps invest in Northern Ireland. The fact that that bank has now disappeared shows the extent of the change that has happened.</p>

Now, their concerns are much more focused on whether they will have a job or keep their home. Various parts of our economy have been devastated, especially the construction industry. We in Northern Ireland know all about that, because the construction industry plays a massive role in our economy, particularly in the private house building sector, which has been utterly devastated. The extent of the downturn and its rapidity have staggered everyone and made people extremely frightened and anxious about where we are headed. We have heard all the talk about unprecedented times and the worst borrowing figures since the second world war. Given the eye-watering amounts that have been mentioned in connection with the banking crisis and so on, for most people these truly are uncharted waters, so they are extremely worried.</p>

The Budget will be regarded historically as very much a holding Budget before the real decisions are taken after next year&#146;s election. The fact is we have to deal with the present position; we cannot go over the history of how we arrived here&#151;whether it is entirely a global phenomenon, or more of a domestic creation. I think that there is a little bit of truth in both analyses. The accusation can be made that, since coming to power, the Government have increased public spending based on additional receipts, but gained too little in terms of our public services and structural foundations. However, we have to address the here and now and how we get through the next period.</p>

We should compare that with what is happening in the Irish Republic, which is having to try to cut its way out of recession. Of course, we know that one of the reasons it is in that position is that as part of the eurozone it has a lot less capacity than the United Kingdom, in terms of the currency being devalued, and in terms of borrowing and so on.

 While the hon. Gentleman is making a comparison with the approaches taken in different countries, he might consider the following point. There are two ways of approaching the crisis. The first is to inject a fiscal stimulus into the economy, as he put it. However, to make a difference of about 1 per cent. in unemployment, one needs to inject a stimulus of about &#163;39 billion, according to most academic studies. Frankly, the Government simply do not have enough money to do that effectively. The Keynesian route, advocated by the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) in a very eloquent speech, is simply not possible. The alternative route is retrenchment. The Government are not really going for that in a meaningful way. We are falling between two stools, which is likely to have a very limited effect.</p>

 I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution, and I understand what he is saying; effectively, his point is that if we want to make a real difference, we have to go much further. I remember a previous debate in the House in which the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), made the point that the Americans&#146; fiscal stimulus was on a much greater scale, and that it would require something of that magnitude to make a difference. Nevertheless, I believe that it is better to try to inject some kind of fiscal stimulus in the current situation than to go the other way. The approach adopted in the Irish Republic illustrates how painful the alternative is.</p>

We have taken measures to try to do that, such as freezing the small business rates in real terms as of 1 April this year, and introducing the small business rate relief scheme from April next year. We are also bringing forward procurement spend for major capital infrastructure projects in Northern Ireland. We are ensuring that as much of that as possible is spent as quickly as possible. We are introducing the speedier payment of Government invoices, so that money goes out to businesses and firms that are trading with the Government as quickly as possible.

In Northern Ireland, we have 11 Departments running a Province of 1.7 million people.

What delivers the best value for money?&#148; As regards the duplication of Departments&#151;on that issue alone, before we get down to the issue of cutting the number of Assembly Members and other areas of expenditure that could be looked at&#151;we calculate that we could save the people of Northern Ireland, and the Northern Ireland budget, between &#163;40 and &#163;50 million per annum.

There was a lot of discussion in earlier parts of the debate on the Budget resolutions on the question of cuts versus efficiencies. There has been a lot of argument about what is a cut, and what is an efficiency. When it comes down to it, it depends on which side of the House one is on, whose cut or efficiency one is talking about, and how it is categorised. I think that all of us agree that efficiencies should be implemented where possible, and where money can be released for front-line services. I do not think that there is any doubt that we should be as efficient as we can be in the delivery of Government and public services.</p>

When devolution was set up, the Province was given repeated commitments from the Prime Minister and the then Chancellor that all efficiency savings made over the comprehensive spending review period would be retained by the Executive to allow devolution to bed in. It was on that basis that the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to match the efficiency savings targets for Whitehall Departments. It is therefore deeply regrettable that in the Budget, some &#163;122 million-worth of so-called efficiency savings were announced. That was at the lower end of expectations.</p>

However, I seek an assurance from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury that those additional allocations will continue beyond 2010-11, instead of being subject to the same form of smash-and-grab seen after the 2007 CSR.

We are not against efficiency savings: we are prepared to make whatever efficiency savings can be made, but we must deliver those savings to front-line services. Taking that money back to Whitehall is a raid on the Northern Ireland block and the Northern Ireland budget.</p>

The increase in the child tax credit from 2010 will offer a real benefit to people, and I welcome the improvements to statutory redundancy arrangements. As for local business, I have outlined some of the measures that we have taken in Northern Ireland to help business, and there will be automatic rate relief for businesses in the Province. Parties in Northern Ireland agree that there is still a strong case for a reduction in corporation tax in Northern Ireland in recognition of our unique circumstances, given the land border with the Irish Republic. I accept, however, that the measure to help firms with cash-flow problems will help businesses to survive the downturn, while the enhanced capital allowance for 2009-10 will encourage firms to prepare for recovery.</p>

It is important to encourage Northern Ireland firms to apply to that fund, and hopefully they will be considered fairly for support. As I said, people will look back at this year&#146;s Budget as a holding Budget, with the significant decisions that will affect the national and local situation in the Province being made in the Budget that follows the next election.</p>

 I fully agree with the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds) about the significance of the Budget. I certainly felt a chill in my spine last week as the Chancellor announced the figures.

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90428-0015.htm_para24"><a name="09042860000002">We have to contemplate the implications of that scale of borrowing for future Budget exercises and for future public expenditure&#151;the Chancellor has already indicated some of the adjustments that would be required and the squeezes in public expenditure in years to come. Equally, there are implications for projected revenue. Other hon. Members, particularly the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), have spoken about the serious gap between projected revenue over the next few years and projected expenditure, and people have questions about the projections in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90428-0015.htm_para25"><a name="09042860000003">We can ask questions about the implications of that scale of borrowing and how we manage it down in years to come, but we must also ask ourselves what the implications for all of us and the future of the economy would be if the Government had not resorted to that scale of borrowing and had not sought to manage the range of interventions with which they have had to deal. In all our assessments of the Budget, we must be mindful of all the issues that are in play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90428-0015.htm_para26"><a name="09042860000004">Over the past couple of years, as the hon. Member for Belfast, North said, there has been a transformation in the assumptions, presumptions and projections for the Budget and the economy. We have seen a virtual meltdown in parts of the banking sector, both nationally and internationally. People&#146;s confidence in financial services has been fundamentally shaken. It is not just public expenditure that has been affected; private investments and pensions have also been deeply affected. That has changed the order of what people expect from politics and from Government, not least in the Budget debate. People want to hear politicians, business and banking leaders tell them as it is&#151;good, bad or uncertain. We need more of that in this debate. I have heard it in some parts of the debates to which I have been able to listen, but inevitably a degree of partisanship has crept in.</p>

As an MP for Northern Ireland, whenever I refer to issues in our past that are still current, I get a bit fed up of hearing a lot of English MPs say, &#147;Oh, forget about that&#151;that was 10,15 or 20 years ago. Don&#146;t dwell on the past.&#148; I have heard an awful lot about the past, however, and the record of previous Governments in the Budget debate, but we very much need to look at the present and the future. Similarly, the Opposition have strayed beyond their legitimate role of talking down the Government&#146;s performance to talking down the economy. People should not be so irresponsible as to short-sell the economy with an eye to their own immediate, partisan profit, but there have been undertones of that in what we have heard from some Opposition Members.</p>

are. Equally, I recognise that in other respects, the Chancellor has been pretty direct. We must all recognise the enormity of what we are facing&#151;not just what the Government are facing, but what we as a Parliament are facing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para0"><a name="09042860000008">In the course of the debate a number of Members have raised issues about the degree of parliamentary scrutiny or oversight of some of these matters, which we as a Parliament need to consider. In respect of the current intervention in banking, the bail-out and the high degree of public ownership of a number of banks, we cannot credibly leave it to the Treasury Committee, on top of all the other huge structural issues that it is dealing with in relation to the Budget and other matters, adequately to discharge the legitimate interest of the House in how those matters are handled. We need a special dedicated Committee to deal with that.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that many business throughout the UK feel themselves short-changed by the banks that have been bailed out? A great deal of pressure is put on business because the banks will not lend them money, even though the businesses are fundamentally sound?</p>

<p><a name="st_o341"><a name="09042860000010"><a name="90428-0016.htm_spnew2"><a name="09042860000029"><b>Mark Durkan:</b>
 I fully accept the point that the hon. Gentleman makes. Indeed, I made a similar point in an intervention in the debate last week. Some of the banks in Northern Ireland&#151;I previously named the Ulster bank, for instance&#151;are, according to some of the business customers that I have been talking to, are engaged in bondage banking practices. They are trapping and binding people with ever higher rates and charging them very high re-arrangement fees for that purpose. It is not only the Ulster bank that is doing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09042860000011">Banks are operating in the current situation not just to try to extract more money from some businesses but, I believe, to price some businesses off their books and to force firms that are otherwise sound and that are good medium to long-term investments into liquidating and possibly aborting their sound business prospects. We have heard that from all parties in all corners of the House when they refer to banks in their areas and how they are treating businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09042860000012">That is why we cannot rely on Treasury Ministers to receive the monthly reports that are meant to come via the lending panel. That is no credible scrutiny or oversight. It is no credible way of guaranteeing that the commitments made by the banks, we are told, towards business lending and other lending areas will be honoured in practice. A bank in Northern Ireland has large banners up with the message, &#147;Lending isn&#146;t ending&#148;, but that is not the message that customers get when they speak to the bank.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09042860000013">We need to examine our procedures as a Parliament in respect of the special and hopefully temporary intervention in the banks, which will obviously take some time to manage. There are aspects of the Budgetary process that the House should consider. Because of the scale of the issues with which the Government are contending, they could use parliamentary scrutiny to assist in the better proofing and control of expenditure. In his contribution the hon. Member for Belfast, North referred to the Chancellor&#146;s projection of efficiency savings later in the Budget cycle, and he spoke of the implications of those for Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09042860000014">The fact that the Chancellor is able to project those efficiency savings right down to the impact that they will have on the Northern Ireland block in a couple of years is interesting, but should be set against the fact that there is still no move to curb expenditure or cut out altogether some of the prestige follies that other hon. Members have mentioned. I refer to ID cards and the huge expenditure that there will be on those. There will be a huge outlay on replacing Trident&#151;a huge prestige folly that might have something to do with people&#146;s idea of status, but has very little to do with serious modern defence strategy. Other prestige follies include massive, expensive and very questionable databases in the health service and elsewhere. The announcement of some pullback in relation to the telecommunications database was welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09042860000015">If the Government are serious, and if we as a Parliament are to be serious about trying to rebalance the Budget, which the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) spoke about, we must ask how we in Parliament play our role in that. I believe that in some cases Parliament is better than Government at controlling expenditure on such prestige follies, precisely because of the &#147;Yes, Minister&#148; syndrome that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Such projects become big status issues and big totemic demands within Government. Nobody out there in the country particularly wants them, but Government have a huge need for them and Government know best. There is also a false belief that Government can spend and buy better. More parliamentary control of those big ticket items would be a great help in the future. We need to consider structural reform of the way that we manage Budgets in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09042860000016">There were significant measures in the Budget, not just the high borrowing figures and the implications for future spending. Because of all the other details in the Budget, perhaps we have lost sight of the Budget&#146;s significance in terms of carbon budgeting. It is the first big step towards that. Many people say cynically that the Government have produced a Budget for the short term, with a view to the election, but we should appreciate the enormity and the significance of the carbon budgeting measures. Some hon. Members might disagree with the value of that measure in the present context, but it proves the sincerity of the Government&#146;s commitment. The exigencies of the current circumstances are not being used as an excuse to pull back from those principles and targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09042860000017">In the context of the commitment to carbon budgeting and the Budget&#146;s positive interventions, there is the &#163;750 million strategic investment fund and the high profile that has been accorded to the low-carbon economy to ensure that we have a green recovery from the recession. I, like the hon. Member for Belfast, North, hope to see Northern Ireland companies avail themselves of that fund and flex their innovatory muscles to make the most of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para8"><a name="09042860000018">There are other interventions in respect of business, including some on taxation, so that people can offset losses this year against previous tax. That is very welcome in the circumstances. The measures on payroll shelter and short-work schemes are very important, and I and others will want them reflected in Northern Ireland, using our devolved capacity. We have argued for such measures.</p>

Many different measures have been announced for the short term, and some in the Budget are projected for the short term, but the method whereby different measures are announced by Lord Mandelson in one meeting and then announced somewhere else does not convey the sense of a coherent framework of intervention, and we need one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para10"><a name="09042860000020">We must ensure also that Europe plays its role in properly allowing creative intervention nationally and regionally. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland were in Brussels recently, and the President of the Commission encouraged them to use public spending innovatively. Sometimes, concern about EU state aid rules gets in the way of the innovative use of public expenditure, and EU state aid rules can be called on and used against positive intervention measures. Although the EU says that it is trying to relax those rules, there is no clear framework for what is and is not relaxed, so, when people speculate on possible proposals to help particular sectors and industries, they are not quite sure where things will stand with regard to state-aid. We therefore need to press Europe for a clear regime, so that, nationally and at a devolved regional level, we all know our discretion to intervene to support our competitive businesses, and they are not counted out under those rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para11"><a name="09042860000021">We must recognise that, through some of the Budget&#146;s other measures, the Government have shown a continuing commitment on child poverty, including the provisions on child tax credits.

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09042860000022">This has been a mixed Budget in very difficult circumstances. We need to recognise that we are in an unprecedented matrix of uncertainty, and, in that situation, we cannot all rely on all the projections. I fully accept that some of the Budget&#146;s projections are on the optimistic side, but I am glad that it includes, first, commitments that show the Government&#146;s determination to try to protect businesses and people in the front-line economy just as much as they tried to protect the banks, which the Government did not do just because the banks wanted it, but to try to ensure that we, ourselves, had a basis for economic stability; and, secondly, measures to try to offset the impact of unemployment and reverse its pattern where it takes hold, so that it does not just hit and, then, drill down and pervade the economy. Such interventions are welcome, but they will have to be developed, and I hope that the Government listen to Members of this House as we come forward with more schemes and ideas as to how best we can do that.</p>

residents of Hornsey and Wood Green compared with last year. Most of those new inquiries were job-related; almost twice as many people as last year are asking for employment advice. Unemployment has a knock-on effect on other areas of concern such as debt and benefits advice. Between 2007-08 and 2008-09, there has been a 60 per cent. increase in debt inquiries and a 30 per cent. increase in benefits inquiries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09042861000002">A whole raft of people who are usually employed have become, in a sense, a new wave of unemployed. They have no experience of how to work their way round a benefits maze or to understand their statutory rights or what is available to them in help from the Government. Many of my local residents are clearly struggling with the recession and in need of such help and advice. The best way to be recession-proof, or as much so as possible, is to know one&#146;s rights and entitlements. The citizens advice bureau is therefore vital. I saw a constituent this week who is not so well, and she has been trying for four weeks to be seen at the local CAB. It has a queuing system, so people have to get there very early in the morning. Because my constituent is not well, she waits for an hour and then has to go home again. It is no use having a citizens advice bureau if it is buckling under the weight of the rising number of inquiries resulting from the effects of the recession and if it does not have enough advisers to cope with demand. Given that dramatic rise in inquiries, I was disappointed that there was nothing in the Budget about extra grant funding. Of course, I am on to the local council, Haringey, as well, but its main funding comes from national Government. I am sure that my constituency is not alone in being affected.</p>

They are suffering dreadfully. The banks are still not extending loans to them, and there is no relief from their landlords in terms of moratoriums on rent rises. I wondered about the possibility of automating small business rate relief. That is quite complicated to apply for&#151;I think that it is based on square footage&#151;yet it is worth about &#163;1,200 a year to small businesses. It would help them enormously if it were automatic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para15"><a name="09042861000004">We recently had a debate in this House on what would happen to women in the economic downturn. We agreed, on a cross-party basis, that it would be tragic if the high level of female employment and the advances made on equality were swept away by the recession. Women already have a tough time in the workplace. It was clear from the debate that sectors such as retail and services, which are populated mainly by women who are already poorly paid, would be hit extremely hard, as would part-time work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para16"><a name="09042861000005">Another problem is employers and others apparently believing that somehow women&#146;s earnings are not as important as men&#146;s and that if someone has to go, it should be a woman.

employers who pay above the statutory minimum. As employers try to squeeze their costs down, it is not hard to imagine that firms offering maternity pay plus benefits will begin to reduce such costs. Women who choose to stay in work rather than be persuaded out of it will have to manage on a very low amount if their benefit is reduced to the statutory minimum, which is &#163;117.18 a week. Miraculously, most women receive about &#163;400 a week because of good employers providing maternity pay plus benefits. That is a substantial difference.</p>

Evidence about that is being collected. They will then face even greater barriers to getting back into work in a few years&#146; time.</p>

In an economic downturn, anybody with children is at a disadvantage if they apply for a job. According to the Equal Opportunities Commission in 2005, before it became part of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, 30,000 women a year were sacked for being pregnant. More recently, Nicola Brewer, the chief executive of the commission, said that women were not being employed because it was better for employers not to take them on, as they might open themselves up to the risk of further costs through maternity benefits. It will be terrible if our maternity benefits, which are relatively good although with room for improvement, become a cause of women not being able to access jobs. If the situation is bad now&#151;that was a couple of months ago&#151;we can expect that women will find it harder and harder.</p>

 The hon. Lady makes an interesting point.

 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. Indeed, I shall make almost the same point shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para22"><a name="09042861000015">Earlier this year, Martin Bright, who is the former political editor of the <i> New </i><i> Statesman,</i><i> </i>wrote a piece entitled, &#147;A New Deal of the Mind&#148;. I do not know how many hon. Members read it, but the Government were greatly interested and supported it. It was a truly visionary piece, which was about scooping up that potentially lost generation and creating a version of Franklin Roosevelt&#146;s new deal of the 1930s. It is targeted more towards those leaving university or tertiary education so that a whole generation will not be lost. It would mean an army of young people employed on projects&#151;the article also suggests using that army to do things that are not normally done&#151;to record, write, film, photograph, design and archive aspects of our lives, the recession and living histories, thus creating a legacy from this era for future generations. They would document all the communities in our land&#151;that does not get done in better times&#151;while battling the scourge of unemployment in current times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para23"><a name="09042861000016">The article was so inspiring&#151;I tell everyone to google &#147;A New Deal of the Mind&#148;&#151;that it received much cross-party support. There was another bit of a do at No. 11 Downing street to launch the new deal of the mind&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I do not spend all my time at No. 11 Downing street. There was a stellar gathering, with the head of every artistic, musical and literary institute and organisation in this country present. I have never seen a guest list like it. They were all buying into the concept. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport were there and fully signed up to the ideal. The hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) also attended and spoke in support. I am sure that it will come as a relief to Conservative Members to know that support was not caveat free, but we all spoke in favour. The leader of my party also supports the new deal of the mind&#151;it is simply a good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09042861000017">Ideas included a brains trust for the 21st century, a national oral history taskforce, a national family history project and a new deal for art and drama. I have been so enthusiastic about the project since I first heard about it that I have been blogging about it. At the weekend, I visited another constituent, who happens to run a charity. He said, &#147;You&#146;re interested in this new deal of the mind&#151;you&#146;ve been blogging about it.&#148; His charity is cataloguing oil paintings in public ownership in every county of the land. He said that if I could hook him up  <br>

with new deal of the mind, he had an apprenticeship to offer in every county because a book of oil paintings in public ownership is produced for every county. Apart from local councils, there are many people who have a vision, want to help and could be harnessed in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para25"><a name="09042861000018">I hope that the new deal of the mind will be part of the Government&#146;s guarantee. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) said, I do not understand why those projects cannot start from day one. The sooner people leaving college with nowhere to go get involved in that worthy and marvellous idea, the better. What part of the guaranteed budget will be used to ensure that all 18 to 24-year-olds will be in a job? How can it be accessed? How will it work? How much of that budget will go to a new deal of the mind? It is important to realise that vision, which has the hallmark of greatness. It will leave a legacy to this country for which everyone in years to come will be grateful.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone), who brought a passion and an energy to her advocacy of the aesthetic aspect of what might be done to engage people usefully and purposefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para26"><a name="09042862000002">How one responds to the Budget depends on how strongly one feels about the long run. I assert that the political class has become less concerned with the past and the future. The view of the past and the future among politicians has changed, as the here and now has predominated. The &#147;want it all and want it now&#148; culture, which has been fuelled by a &#147;borrow and spend&#148; paradigm, is bound to displace a proper consideration of the long run. Yet surely we know that the present is a momentary thing. We live our lives&#151;do we not?&#151;in the then and the when. Thus an emphasis on the long run is important for politicians and this House, and it is certainly important for the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90428-0016.htm_para27"><a name="09042862000003">The Budget was couched in the language of Keynesianism and we heard something of Keynes from the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher), who made the best speech that we have heard in the debate today. It was Keynes who once famously declared:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para0"><a name="09042862000004">However, Keynes, as his comments imply, had no children. I, on the other hand, have two young sons. I care desperately about their future and about that of their contemporaries&#151;the children and grandchildren of my constituents in South Holland and The Deepings. That means that I care about the long run and about our duty to those who follow us, a duty that informs my conservatism. I prefer Edmund Burke to Keynes. It was Burke who said:</p>
<a name="90428-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="09042862000019"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;History is a pact between the dead, the living and the yet unborn.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09042862000005">The Budget breaks that pact. It is the product of politicians and Ministers who are preoccupied by the present, largely ignorant of the past and careless of the future.</p>

cent. of national income. We surely know across the House that we cannot go on spending for ever, but like St. Augustine, the Chancellor declares, &#147;Lord make me chaste, but not yet.&#148; He and the Prime Minister hope that the tough decisions can be delayed until after the general election and probably, therefore, taken by somebody else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09042862000007">It is instructive in these circumstances to consider the crisis faced by the Labour Government in 1931. Then a Scottish Labour Prime Minister put country before party. Now a Scottish Prime Minister should do the same, yet the Budget burdens future generations with a mountain of debt. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that the national debt will return to sustainable levels in 2032, which is 23 years from now. That is not acceptable. I do not want to be excessively partisan&#151;these debates are often too partisan&#151;but in the end, when the Prime Minister speaks of a &#147;decade of irresponsibility&#148;, one has to reflect that he was the man, first as Chancellor and now as Prime Minister, who presided over the policies that fuelled that irresponsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09042862000008">There was much in the Budget about housing. The Government&#146;s policy on housing illustrates the sort of short-termism of which I am so critical. For me, the idea of a home is the emblem of my conservatism. To talk about housing is one thing; to talk of the home lifts us to a different emotional plane. The difference between a house and a home is like the difference between calling a parent a mum or an acquaintance a friend. The home stands at the bright centre of our lives. It is where lives start and end; it is where we return at the end of each day and at the end of all our days. Our hearts are where the home is. But there are far too many people in our country who either do not have a home or do not have the kind of home that they need and deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09042862000009">Frustrated aspirations to home ownership and overcrowding are the painful symptoms of what is going wrong with Britain. The Government&#146;s failure to tackle these problems helps to explain why social mobility has declined. To build a socially mobile, cohesive and socially just society, we need to help people find the homes that they need in the right places, yet we have wasted a decade of opportunities to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09042862000010">Over the past decade or so, about 24,000 fewer homes a year have been built than under the tenure of the last Conservative Government, and house building has now shrunk to an historically low level. The Government have also failed to develop other methods&#151;particularly share equity&#151;to help people into the homes that they want. In the Budget, the Chancellor promised an extra &#163;80 million for the HomeBuy Direct shared ownership scheme, but that will help a maximum of 10,000 buyers. Even in these grim times, about 10,000 new mortgages are approved per month for first-time buyers. So the sum of &#163;80 million represents one month&#146;s mortgage applications, so it is no wonder that experts have already dismissed the proposal as marginal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09042862000011">More than five years ago, when I was the shadow Minister for housing, I published a paper proposing 33,000 new homes via HomeBuy, which was far more than the Government were delivering. If they had taken the Opposition&#146;s advice then, and backed shared equity when house prices were rising, they could have generated  <br>

receipts through sales that could have been recycled to provide further support, but instead we had far too little, far too late.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09042862000012">The same is true if we look at the Chancellor&#146;s other proposals on housing. He promised &#163;100 million for local authorities to build new energy-efficient housing, but experts say that that will pay for just 900 new homes at a time when 4.5 million people are on waiting lists for social housing. More than 28,000 people have lost their homes as a result of delays in the implementation of the home owners&#146; mortgage scheme, following its announcement last December. In February, the Prime Minister said that he would do everything in his power to stop repossessions, yet the Council of Mortgage Lenders estimates that there will be 75,000 repossessions this year alone, a rise of 67 per cent. on last year. Members will have seen the figures in today&#146;s press which suggest that the repossession rate will continue to rise, and the frightening graph projecting a forecast of mortgage arrears that will undoubtedly lead to yet further repossessions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09042862000013">I also want to say something about public debt. We face a future crippled by debt and, while the Prime Minister keeps talking about the global nature of this crisis, we should understand that we are alone in our present approach to debt. Of the G7 countries, not one other will countenance an increase in the level of debt such as that proposed in this Budget. Shockingly, the Office for National Statistics revealed this month that, in the financial year 2008-09, the public sector recorded a deficit of &#163;52.3 billion. That public sector net debt, expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, was 50.9 per cent. at the end of March 2009, compared with 43.1 per cent. at the end of March 2008. By 2013, total Government debt will rise to a staggering 79 per cent. of GDP. Across the EU, no other country is considering such a rapid rise in debt levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09042862000014">The International Monetary Fund report, &#147;The State of Public Finances&#148;, indicates that, from 2009 to 2014, we are alone in our reckless approach to borrowing. Germany&#146;s debt will rise from 76.1 to 77.2 per cent., and Spain&#146;s will rise from 48.6 to 56.3 per cent. Even for Italy, a country that is no stranger to borrowing, the IMF predicts a rise of under 10 per cent. across the same period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09042862000015">The circumstances to be found more widely across the world are even more alarming. China&#146;s debt will fall, as will that of Brazil. Indeed, the IMF&#146;s &#147;World Economic Outlook&#148; indicates that world public debt, including that of vast numbers of developing economies, will only rise from 61 per cent. in 2008 to 71 per cent. in 2014. All of this risks our competitiveness, productivity and prudence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09042862000016">I am not an economic liberal. Indeed, I am not a liberal at all. It is one of the destructive products of the orthodox acceptance of liberalism that we have come to regard individuals and their will as being more important than the history that precedes them, the coming generations that they spawn or the families and communities rich in values and ideas that nurture them. So I am not an economic liberal and have no problem in principle with the role of government in mitigating the excesses of the state of nature. But I am a fiscal conservative. The reason for my being so is that I believe in the long run and the long term&#151;what we see in this Budget and in the Government&#146;s economic policies is what happens if one does not.

Good parents want the best for their children&#151;as I said, I want the best for mine&#151;and they must despair, as I do, when they read that their children will have to pay for the decisions that we are going to take today. If we want to give our children the best possible chance in life, the opportunities to succeed regardless of from where they start and the chance to live in a home of their own in a strong, cohesive community, we need public policy that focuses on the long term, we need politicians who are prepared to sacrifice the immediate interest for something greater, better and more strategic, and we need a Government who care about the long run.</p>

 It is a great honour to be called to speak in this debate, and I am delighted to follow my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes). Deciding exactly what to say is one of the problems for tail-end Charlies in this debate, because although there is a lot to talk about, so much has been said before. I do not seem to get invited to the same number of things as the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone), so I spent my one-line Whip night off last night, and indeed this morning, reading the contributions that other hon. Members have made&#151;that shows what an exciting chap I am&#151;and I found that it appears that Budgets are judged by certain tests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09042870000002">The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions opened today&#146;s debate by saying that it should be about people, not statistics, but of course he spent the remainder of his contribution making up statistics and fantasy policies of which to accuse the Conservative Front-Bench team. He missed out the key statistics&#151;the amount of debt with which this Government will saddle future generations and the fall in total managed expenditure that will result. He was completely wrong in what he said, because the statistics are what this is about, for it is they and the forecasts that underlie what the Chancellor has put into the Budget that will determine the fate of people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09042870000003">Many hon. Members have observed that every Budget is judged by certain tests, and it seems to me that those tests are threefold. The primary and central test of a Budget is whether it does and will improve the health of our economy and the wealth of our people. In today&#146;s economic climate, one might judge that by considering whether a Budget delivers the real help that people need in the recession. One of the concerns expressed by a number of hon. Members has been that some of the help that is available is too little and too late.</p>

Representatives from one business came to see me here less than six weeks ago, with exactly that problem, and that business is now relocating to Toulouse rather than staying in Wimbledon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para17"><a name="09042870000005">Another test should be whether the Budget will put the public finances back into order and deliver sustainable growth. Beyond the central tests, there are two other tests, the first of which is the unravelling test. How long does it take before the forecasts are found to be inaccurate? How long does it take for the consequences of the measures announced to be revealed? Everyone will remember the dramatic 2 per cent. cut in the basic rate of tax, but it only took half an hour to work out that it came at the expense of those paying the 10p tax rate. This Budget has failed that test spectacularly. Even as the Chancellor was speaking, the borrowing numbers&#151;which are linked to the growth numbers&#151;became incredible, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) rightly accused the Chancellor of swallowing the numbers rather than announcing them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para18"><a name="09042870000006">The third test is the devil in the detail test. Much has been written over the years about the 1997 smash and grab raid on UK pensions, but there are some equally pernicious measures in this Budget on pensions, including the tapering of relief and the limit on one-off contributions that will hit the aspirational and wealth-creating class whom we need to encourage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09042870000007">Other hon. Members have spoken about some of the other devils in the detail today, including the point that the support through the tax credit is &#163;20 a year, not &#163;20 a week. The biggest failure of the devil in the detail test is that anyone earning &#163;20,000 a year will see an increase in tax through their national insurance contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09042870000008">The central test is the health of the economy. As the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said, at the moment we are taking 38 per cent. in tax and spending 48 per cent. If the forecasts are wrong, those numbers are wrong, and they are wrong in a harmful direction for the economy. The slowing of growth is the norm for economies in economic cycles: recessions are not, and the UK has had only three recessions since the second world war.

 As my hon. Friend will know, recessions have a shape. The Government do not know whether this is a V-shaped recession or a U-shaped recession.

During the recession of 1979 to 1982, the first quarter of negative growth happened in the first quarter of 1979. However, the recession was not evident until the fourth quarter. We had consistent negative growth through to the first quarter of 1981 and we did not return to trend growth until the first quarter of 1983. The recession of the 1990s followed a shallower but similar pattern. The first quarter of negative growth was in Q3 of 1990 but it was not until Q3 of 1993 that we returned to trend growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para28"><a name="09042870000018">It seems to me that what the Chancellor has postulated, which is that we will see a growth of 3.25 per cent. in 2011, borders on the incredible. The first negative quarter of growth in this recession was in the third quarter of 2008. We have had three quarters of negative growth since then. It is quite clear from the Chancellor&#146;s prediction for the fall in GDP this year that we will continue to see negative growth quarters up until the fourth quarter of this year&#151;let us be optimistic and say that that will be the last quarter of negative growth. The point is that we will not see any return to trend growth until at least two years after that, which takes us well beyond the Chancellor&#146;s expectations for 2011.</p>

 The implication, if I understand what my hon. Friend is saying, is that there will once again be a hole in the Government&#146;s budget. If growth is not V-shaped, then the tax revenues that the Government have assumed will be collected will not magically appear. Does my hon. Friend share those concerns?</p>

<p><a name="st_o352"><a name="09042870000020"><a name="90428-0017.htm_spnew4"><a name="09042870000075"><b>Stephen Hammond:</b>
 My hon. Friend, as ever, gets to the point that I wanted to make rather more quickly and more eloquently than I did. I am making exactly that point. These statistics and these forecasts do matter, because they matter for people. When they are proved to be wrong, the hole in the public finances will be even bigger, the debt mounting on people will be even bigger and the tax receipts that will have to be raised in the future will be even bigger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para29"><a name="09042870000021">I accept that there are international causes to this recession, but it is not true that, as one hon. Member said, this is a very different depression or recession from any other. If we look at history, by what are recessions characterised? They are characterised by a sharp drop in house price inflation and a drop in business investment as a percentage of GDP. Company profits and corporate profitability fall as a share of national income. There is a sharp rise in unemployment, a rise in inflation as measured by the retail prices index and a rise in short-term  <br>

rates. We can all agree that, barring the last two, those features are present in this recession. A number of people would also argue that the difference in inflation as measured by RPI and the consumer prices index shows that a lot of people are experiencing that hike in inflation, because the CPI has been deflated by the mortgage impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para30"><a name="09042870000022">A number of people, including in particular the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher), made the point that there is a big difference in lending levels at the moment. The base rate might be at 0.5 per cent., but the banks are lending to the companies that need to make the investment at levels closer to LIBOR and over LIBOR. The banks are not allowing companies to borrow at rates that will allow them to make the investment they need.</p>

<p><a name="st_o353"><a name="09042870000023"><a name="90428-0017.htm_spnew5"><a name="09042870000076"><b>Mr. Hayes:</b>
 My hon. Friend illustrates the point that one of the differences between responses to earlier recessions and to this one is that it is much harder for the Government to pull policy levers that have a direct effect. Interest rates are a classic example; another is what economists call saturation&#151;people are unlikely to spend on capital goods they already have. Cars are a good example, which is one reason the Government&#146;s car scheme is unlikely to succeed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o354"><a name="09042870000024"><a name="90428-0017.htm_spnew6"><a name="09042870000077"><b>Stephen Hammond:</b>
 My hon. Friend is obviously correct. He leads me to my next point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para31"><a name="09042870000025">Today, a number people have spoken about John Maynard Keynes, of whom much is made by the Prime Minister. However, we have forgotten two of Keynes&#146; central propositions, one of which was about counter-cyclicism. After years of growth, the public finances ought to have been in a position to bear large fiscal stimuli, but because the Government spent all the way through the good times, the public finances are not in that order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para32"><a name="09042870000026">The second point is taken as an absolute shibboleth even though it is not actually what Keynes said. He did not say that we should spend our way out of recession. He said that public finances and public spending might need to be raised, but that what was actually needed was to raise effective demand. There are a number of ways of doing that, which lead directly from my hon. Friend&#146;s absolutely correct point about saturation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para33"><a name="09042870000027">The central point is that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions was wrong this afternoon. The debate should be about statistics and forecasts, because they will undermine the Budget and its effect on people&#146;s lives. It seems to me that history tells us that the Chancellor&#146;s forecast numbers are unlikely to prove either credible or sustainable, that a number of the actions taken have been too little, too late, and that there is dishonesty in postponing until after the general election&#151;without telling people&#151;the taxes on the many and the cuts in public expenditure that the Government propose in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90428-0017.htm_para34"><a name="09042870000028">The Budget will not return the economy to sustainable growth or restore public finances. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney said, it is absolutely true that all Labour Governments run out of money and it will be an incoming Conservative Government who will have to encourage saving, prioritise reductions in taxation on the many and spend responsibly on essential public services. This country needs that cure sooner rather than later.</p>

 I did not intend that my son should become the focus of the debate, but I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s intervention. I thought that I knew how my son would vote, but after he realises that he will have to pay back &#163;22,000, we will be sure of his voting intention.</p>

Thanks to the Government&#146;s relaxation of the rules in the UK, banks were lending money that they did not have, to people who could not afford it, in ways that they did not understand. The Bank of England&#146;s powers were transferred to the Financial Services Authority, which did not know how to use them, and the Government then saddled the country with debt. They even tried to change the economic cycle to conceal the debt that was being accumulated. As a result, Britain has been the worst hit economically of all G20 countries, which puts in perspective the importance of the 2009 Budget for leading the nation through choppy waters towards a calmer and more stable economic environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="90428-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09042870000036">As hon. Members have repeated throughout our four-day debate, however, there has been no leadership or vision, or even a sustainable and costed plan. The Budget not only lacked honesty in spirit, but broke Labour&#146;s own rules, which have arguably kept them in power for three Parliaments. As soon as the Chancellor sat down last Wednesday, every economist worth his salt was queuing up to criticise the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="90428-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09042870000037">The first criticism was about the amount that the Government will borrow: &#163;348 billion over the next two years. That will not only double the national debt, but exceed the total borrowing of all Governments going back 300 years. If that is not shocking enough, the Government say that borrowing will reach more than &#163;600 billion over the next four years, which will saddle even those taxpayers who are yet to be born.</p>

have done so&#151;was when the Chancellor claimed that the economy would grow by 1.25 per cent. next year. Let us not forget that the Chancellor predicted in the pre-Budget report that GDP in 2009-10 would be 2.5 per cent., with net borrowing at &#163;38 billion and income receipts to the tune of &#163;171 billion. Six months later, he had to admit that the economy would not grow by 2.5 per cent., but shrink by 3.5 per cent., and that net Government borrowing would be not &#163;38 billion but &#163;175 billion. The shortfall comes in because of net income receipts, because they are to be not &#163;171 billion, but just &#163;141 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90428-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09042870000039">How, therefore, can we believe any prediction that the Chancellor or the Prime Minister make? The only thing that can be believed with any assurance is the Chancellor&#146;s reputation as the worst forecaster in modern history. I am sure that last Wednesday&#146;s statistics will come back to haunt him in November&#146;s pre-Budget report.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He makes a good point about debt, but it would be helpful to set out a broader picture. He talks about debt of &#163;600 billion or &#163;700 billion, but when that is added to what already exists, the figure will be closer to &#163;1.4 trillion, which is 100 per cent. of GDP. While that is shocking in itself, what is most shocking is the Government&#146;s lack of transparency, as they are probably hiding an extra &#163;1 trillion or &#163;2 trillion off balance sheet.</p>

Friend&#146;s argument explains exactly why the IMF has dismissed the Budget&#151;no wonder it has been given the nickname of the fantasy Budget. The IMF predicts not a recovery next year, but a worsening of the UK&#146;s situation, with not 1.25 per cent. growth, but a decline of about 4 per cent. The bottom line is that the Budget does not add up. The shortfall in tax revenues alone means that an additional &#163;170 billion will be needed this year and next to meet the Government&#146;s targets.</p>

I have a sneaking suspicion that we are wandering down that road again. I hope not.</p>

That is a scandal, considering how much money has been spent on the health service. In education, the story is the same. The number of NEETs is increasing and one in four primary school children fail to meet basic standards.

We need a plan for economic recovery based on savings and ownership, not borrowing and debt. We need a new low-carbon, high-skilled productive and balanced economy that will be the engine of sustainable growth for years to come, and we must reform the public finances and our system of financial regulation, so that no Labour Government will be able to bankrupt us again.</p>

We need a new culture of thrift in government, because it is not Government money, but taxpayers&#146; money. We need to cure our big social problems, not just treat them.

Instead of harnessing the full economic potential of the next generation, this Government have fuelled a cultural shift toward mediocrity. Surely we should be rejuvenating the next generation, encouraging them to stay in school until they are 18 not because the Government told them to, but because they want to; and to seek a job not because otherwise they would lose benefits, but because they have a skill on which they can build, for which they can be paid a good salary and of which they can be proud.</p>

worth &#163;114 billion to the economy, is twice the size of the IT services sector and four times the size of the agriculture sector, but it does not get the attention it deserves. It sustains more than 2.6 million jobs and is responsible for one in every four new jobs created here in the UK. It is worth our attention because every pound that Visit Britain spends abroad brings &#163;25 back into the economy. How many other departments can say that their spending money in that way brings money back into this country&#146;s Exchequer? I want more emphasis on how we can take advantage of that.</p>

They have just cut Visit Britain&#146;s budget by 20 per cent., which is a scandal. There is no leadership in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Regulations are created in other Departments, but the DCMS has no say at all. Visa costs went up by &#163;130 per cent., and DCMS had no say in the matter. Fire regulations are hitting bed and breakfasts hard; DCMS had no say in the matter.</p>

We have no idea what the impact will be on the industry, and how many holiday lets will close. The measure will, of course, affect places such as Fowey in Cornwall, where I spent a week during the recess. If those places close, it means a loss not just to the individual who provides the let, but to local pubs, the local community, and the tourism operations there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="90428-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09042870000056">There is also the issue of structures. The creation of the regional development agencies has taken responsibility for tourism away from a body with a national voice, such as Visit England, and given it to the nine regions, which ended up competing with each other in a confusing and overlapping system. The irony is that the Government have now realised that and are reinvigorating Visit England, but it is a decade too late.</p>

The increase in duties is a tax on the many, not the few who drink irresponsibly. The VAT reduction to 15 per cent. was not helpful at all, because people in the retail and tourism sectors were already giving 10, 15 and 20 per cent. discounts. Why on earth are the Government changing VAT back to 17.5 per cent. on 31 December, at the end of this year? I do not understand that, and I hope that the Treasury Ministers on the Government Bench will take this issue away and consider it. That has to be the busiest period for any bar, pub or club, or any retail outlet. I ask the Government to take a look at that, and to shift the change to a different day.</p>

That has long been called for, but what the Government give with one hand, they take away with the other, as gross profits tax has gone up to 22 per cent. That means that bingo clubs will start closing across the UK. The dear old ladies who like their one night out will have nowhere to go. Bingo halls are part of our community. People who choose to take part in soft gambling may migrate to harder forms of gambling. That cannot be good, so I ask the Government to reconsider that. There is also the issue of what to do with regard to the announcements on swine flu. I just want to show the House the <i> Evening Standard</i><i> . </i>It says: &#147;Killer flu virus &#145;already circulating in London&#146;&#148;. That does not help British tourism at all.</p>

In the end, it was more about partisan politics than responsible Government. It was a tribal Budget, with its flagship policy of a 50p tax rate&#151;a crude attempt to corner the Conservatives and shore up Labour support rather than care for the nation&#146;s finances. The Government are not on the back foot, but on their knees searching in the gutter for ideas, as the disgraced Damian McBride proved only last week. The Government blame the US, but it is not the US that is responsible for 120 per cent. mortgages here, or indeed for easing the borrowing rules introduced more than a decade ago.</p>

What is happening here is exactly the opposite. Today&#146;s Government seem to be out of touch, and are certainly out of ideas. They are going down, and attempting to drag the country with them. If there was one ounce of honour left in the new Labour project, the Government would fall on their sword and allow the nation the chance to vote and put the country out of its misery. This discredited Administration will selfishly limp on until May 2010, when finally the curtain will come down on a Government who have refused to apologise for their part in Britain&#146;s economic downturn, and who have no idea how to get us out of it.</p>

 As many of my hon. Friends have pointed out, we have scarcely reached the end of the Budget debate, and already its subject has fallen part. After four days of parliamentary scrutiny, the Chancellor&#146;s Budget, which was flimsy when it was delivered, has comprehensively unravelled. It is already looking as fanciful as the pre-Budget report quickly became. The past week has seen the final nail in the coffin of what little remained of Labour&#146;s economic credibility. Within minutes of the Chancellor sitting down, his growth forecasts were flatly contradicted by the International Monetary Fund, and his Budget was condemned by the CBI as lacking a &#147;credible and rigorous&#148; plan to restore the public finances.</p>

I was struck&#151;and I suspect that many of my colleagues were, too&#151;by the tone of Labour Members&#146; speeches this evening. They just do not seem to have grasped the implications of the Red Book for future spending, or the fact that it is already obsolete, reflecting, just a week after the Budget, a best-case outcome if economic recovery is far quicker and stronger than the IMF and all other reputable commentators have predicted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90428-0018.htm_para22"><a name="09042874000003">I was asked on Sunday whether I had any idea how the Chancellor had arrived at his 3.5 per cent. growth prediction for 2011. I think I do. My very first boss showed me something that he called the &#147;right-hand up&#148; budgeting approach. He started in the bottom right-hand corner of the spreadsheet with the number he wanted to reach, and he worked up to the top left-hand corner, filling in the numbers that he needed to get the answer he wanted. It is an exercise in fantasy forecasting that undermines not only the robustness of the Budget but the credibility of the entire process. The case for an independent office of budget responsibility, proposed by my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor, has never been made more eloquently than by the Chancellor himself in presenting those fantasy forecasts last week.</p>

What we got was a Budget that had more to do with saving the Prime Minister than with saving the British economy. As usual, it was based on spin.</p>

If new Labour was about anything, it was about reaching out beyond its traditional core support to a wider public in an aspirational nation. It speaks volumes about the Prime Minister that, facing a general election that will be a referendum on his competence and record in managing the British economy, he has abandoned any attempt at broad appeal, and has refocused his efforts on his core heartland vote, chucking a bit of red meat to those who despise aspiration and success, revealing as much about himself, his values and priorities, as a clutch of unauthorised biographies could ever do.</p>

He needed it, because the old one&#151;public spending and investment&#151;was rubbed out when his Chancellor announced the most swingeing real-term cuts in public spending since the second world war.

We&#146;ll sort it out by taxing the rich.&#148; But the British people are not stupid. They have been here before. They know it does not work like that. If one studies the Budget book closely, one sees that it does not even pretend that it works like that, either in the bits that the Chancellor told us about last Wednesday or in the bits that he did not tell us about. In the bit that he told us about, only half the tax increases are paid for by the rich.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09042874000009">The other half are taxes on ordinary families&#151;on alcohol, tobacco and fuel and, of course, the stupidest tax of all, on jobs, which is the national insurance contribution increase in 2011 that will hit everybody earning &#163;20,000 a year or more, just as the economy is starting to grow again. In the bit of the Budget that the Chancellor did not tell us about, there are another &#163;45 billion a year of tax increases pencilled in to make his numbers add up by 2017, even with his highly optimistic growth assumptions. That is &#163;1,430 per family of extra tax every year for every family in Britain&#151;a secret Labour tax bombshell aimed at the many, not the few, and timed to go off after the next general election.</p>

He seemed to gloss over the dramatic changes in spending plans in his Budget speech. The downgraded spending growth assumption from 1.1 per cent. to 0.7 per cent. was announced without any fanfare. There was no mention, either, of the allocation of &#163;2.3 billion of cuts to the NHS next year, or of the halving of net public capital investment over the next five years&#151;something that Labour have consistently said they would not do in response to economic pressure.</p>

Friends that at the time of the 2005 general election, when the Conservatives were already warning that public spending was growing too fast and needed to be restrained, the Prime Minister told the country that every conceivable efficiency saving had already been made, and that any further reduction in public spending growth would lead to a catastrophic collapse in front-line services. Since that election, he claims to have made &#163;26 billion in efficiency savings. Last November he discovered another &#163;5 billion worth and, last week, he told us that he had found another &#163;9 billion. That is &#163;40 billion in total.</p>

All in all, it was the most dishonest and most partisan Budget that we have yet seen from the Government, and it beat off some competition to win that title.</p>

It is not about the economy; it is about the election.</p>

He clearly thought, as he left No. 11 in the summer of 2007, that he was safely in the latter category, but, as his legacy crumbles around him, the British public can now see that he is not only firmly in the former category, but in a sub-class of spectacular and cataclysmic failure all of his own.</p>

The Prime Minister, the man who single-handedly managed the British economy for a decade and, as I remember, was happy enough to take the credit for it when it was going well, is responsible for turning that golden legacy into this disaster. It was he, aided and abetted by the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, who was responsible for the failed system of regulation that prevented the Bank of England calling time on debt, and who let our banks and our households borrow too much; it was he who failed to prepare Britain for the recession, so that we entered it with the highest public sector deficit of any major industrial nation; and it was he who failed spectacularly to deliver the solutions that the nation needs to address the challenges that we now face.</p>

biggest deficit that this country has ever seen, with, according to the CBI, no credible or rigorous plan to restore the public finances. They are a morally bankrupt Government, with a vicious culture of spin, manipulation and sleaze&#151;dodging the truth, postponing the pain and putting off until after the election what for Britain&#146;s sake needs doing today. They are inward-looking and focused on saving their own skin at all costs. They said that this Budget was about jobs. Correction: it is about a job.

Any fool can spend money and, to be fair, cut budgets, but, now that the cupboard is bare and the country must start living within its means, the challenge for policy makers is to do things smarter rather than simply to spend more public money.

It is now clear that they will carry on playing their political game until finally their time runs out and this unelected, failed Prime Minister can be put out of his misery by the British electorate.

Japanese economy by 4.6 per cent., and the UK economy by 2.3 per cent. The world stock market is down &#163;30 trillion from its peak in 2007. So, as we agreed at the G20 summit, it is vital that every Government act to support their economy through a difficult time. That is why this Budget sets out further measures to help those who lose their jobs, to help those fearful of losing their homes, to help businesses struggling to invest, and to help savers affected by interest rate reductions&#151;all measures to support the economy at a difficult time. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions set out proposals for &#163;5 billion of extra investment to help the unemployed: extra help and advice; extra training places; golden hellos for employers who take someone on; and now a jobs guarantee backed by 250,000 new jobs. I think that those are the most important measures in the Budget, because we should never go back to the travesty of long-term youth unemployment that we saw in the 1980s.</p>

Again, I give her an opportunity to tell the House whether she supports the extra investment for the unemployed and has done a U-turn on the fiscal stimulus, or opposes the additional &#163;5 billion of investment over the next two years to support the unemployed. I give Conservative Front Benchers the opportunity to intervene&#151;Back Benchers may also want to do so&#151;to tell us whether they support the &#163;5 billion of additional investment to help the unemployed. The right hon. Lady said that she did, yet the shadow Chancellor has said that he does not. Do they support extra investment to support the unemployed, or not? Do they support the fiscal stimulus, or not? <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> They are saying that it is not &#163;5 billion.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09042874000032">We can afford to support the economy right now, because our public sector debt when the credit crunch hit was one of the lowest in the G7. That is why the IMF said:</p>
<a name="90428-0019.htm_brev3"><a name="09042874000051"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Some countries entered the crisis with greater fiscal space to expand, including more favorable levels of deficits, public debt contingent liabilities and interest rates (Canada, China, France, Germany, the UK and the US)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para22"><a name="09042874000033">But yes, public finances are being affected here, as they are across the world.

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para23"><a name="09042874000034">The IMF forecast, on which Opposition Members are so keen, is still that UK public sector debt, when it is at its highest level in a few years, will be below that of Germany and the US, significantly below that of Japan and Italy and only slightly higher than that of France. Every one of those countries is backing increased Government action to support their economies right now, because they know, as we know, that we cannot cut our way out of recession. We have to invest and grow our way through a downturn such as this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para24"><a name="09042874000035">There is a clear choice. The Conservatives are offering a very different approach to recession. Not only are they opposing all the extra support to help our economy  <br>

recover, they want to go further and make cuts in the budgets with which public services are operating right now. The right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has said:</p>
<a name="90428-0019.htm_brev4"><a name="09042874000052"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have said that the government should have come off its spending plans in 2009 and 2010, that they&#146;ve got to make a start in reducing this deficit.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para25"><a name="09042874000036">It is time that the Conservatives told us what their plans for this year and next would really mean. They previously told us that they wanted &#163;5 billion of cuts in the budgets that people are already spending this year. On Wednesday, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) said that they would deliver &#163;6 billion more in 2010. On Sunday, his party leader said:</p>
<a name="90428-0019.htm_brev5"><a name="09042874000053"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;They&#146;ve just announced a spending increase... of &#163;20 billion for next year.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para26"><a name="09042874000037">He later said,</p>
<a name="90428-0019.htm_brev6"><a name="09042874000054"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;and now we&#146;re saying they should abandon their irresponsible plan to increase spending in 2010.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para27"><a name="09042874000038">So which is it&#151;&#163;5 billion, &#163;6 billion, &#163;20 billion? The shadow Chief Secretary should watch out; his figures look positively profligate compared with those of his boss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para28"><a name="09042874000039">However, Conservative Members have never said where any of the savings would come from. They say the NHS computer, yet they have admitted that there are no savings to be found. They say ContactPoint, yet that recommendation of the Laming review costs &#163;40 million to run and saves more than &#163;80 million across services. They say tax credits for households on over &#163;50,000, but that includes couples, both on the average wage, who form 0.2 per cent. of the tax credit bill&#151;less than &#163;40 million. That is not &#163;5 billion of cuts, but tinkering. Again, Conservative Members play hide and seek and do not tell people where their axe would fall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para29"><a name="09042874000040">The Conservatives were a bit more open in February when they described specific restrictions on departmental budgets. Housing would lose &#163;810 million in the middle of a recession, and education and training would lose &#163;910 million this year&#151;equivalent to cutting 220,000 apprenticeships now. That is economic madness. It is economically dangerous, not just today, but for the future. Such cuts would not only delay recovery, but push up the bills of recession and leave the Conservatives making even more cuts in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para30"><a name="09042874000041">There will be tough choices for the future. The Budget sets out plans to halve borrowing over four years, because we need it to decrease, and we need those on the highest incomes to pay more. That is a fair way in which to help reduce borrowing. Public spending budgets will be tighter, which means setting priorities, and we will do that as part of the spending review. However, we have been clear: we will continue to support front-line services and we believe that it is right to reduce borrowing step by step, steadily as the economy grows, precisely so that we can continue to safeguard public services for the future. It is not the shock and awe approach of the Conservative party, which appears to want immediate cuts in borrowing and public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para31"><a name="09042874000042">In the four-day debate, some Conservative Back Benchers have been literally salivating at the prospect of spending cuts. So much for modern, compassionate Conservatism and backing investment in public services. The right hon. Member for Witney has let the dogs off the leash  <br>

and they are slavering for the flesh of the NHS. There are serious choices to make and the Conservatives are making different choices. We should listen to the glee with which the right hon. Gentleman calls for austerity. For whom does he want austerity? He wants austerity for public services and couples on the average wage who get tax credits, but not for the millionaires, whose tax increases he wants reviewed. He wants no austerity for millionaires&#146; estates, to which he would give more money. Three thousand of the richest estates in the country would get an average of &#163;200,000 each. At the weekend, the right hon. Gentleman said, &#147;that will be done.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para32"><a name="09042874000043">Conservatives say that the economic circumstances are so severe that they must ditch their plans to support our investment in public services. Yet the economic circumstances are clearly not sufficiently severe for them to drop their commitment to tax breaks for millionaires. That is shocking&#151;a shocking set of priorities from the Conservative party, which would rather defend tax breaks for millionaires&#146; estates than public services. They would rather cut investment in apprenticeships and housing in the middle of a recession than support action to help the unemployed and people who need our help now, so that we can get through the recession faster, come through it stronger and build for recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90428-0019.htm_para33"><a name="09042874000044">We have set out our Budget for the future and plans not only to help the British economy through the world recession, but to build for the long term.</p>

 I am delighted to have secured this Adjournment debate, and I am touched by the fact that so many colleagues have stayed behind to listen to it at this extremely late hour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="90428-0025.htm_para25"><a name="09042910000223">On 12 March a letter arrived in my party leader&#146;s office, complaining about my registering anonymously rather than publishing my address on the New Forest, East electoral roll. That is a basic security precaution, taken because of the work that I did before, and to some extent after, becoming an MP against political extremists at home and abroad.

In this case, however, the author is a Liberal Democrat prospective parliamentary candidate, a 63-year-old retired military policeman who aims to oppose me at the next general election. His name is Terry Scriven, and his previous attempt to compromise my home address was drawn to the House&#146;s attention on 22 July last year. Since then, his campaign to blacken my name has intensified, most recently with the connivance of the <i> News of the World</i>. It has therefore become necessary to return to this subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para1"><a name="09042910000227">I realise that the Deputy Leader of the House will not be able to address my situation in detail, and he knows that I can give him only a little time in which to reply, but I trust that he will confirm that not just the press but even political opponents have a duty to show some restraint where the personal security of parliamentarians is at stake. What has happened to me illustrates the mischief that malicious adversaries can make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para2"><a name="09042910000228">In setting their prospective candidate&#146;s antics on the record, I mean no disrespect towards Liberals in my constituency in general. I have worked with Liberal Democrats to save community hospitals, and even now I am working with their group leader on the district council on an issue on which we agree. Several of them have told me privately of their dismay at Terry Scriven&#146;s tactics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para3"><a name="09042910000229">I have previously fought three general elections in the New Forest without experiencing anything comparable to the events of the past few months. In 1997, when my seat had just been formed, the Liberal Democrat candidate was a New Forest district councillor, George Dawson. He fought a clean campaign. In 2001, my Liberal Democrat opponent was a county councillor called Brian Dash. I had worked with him on a cross-party basis to oppose the construction of a container port on sensitive land at Dibden bay. Before the 2001 election, I spoke to Mr. Dash about my constituency home. I told him my address and  <br>

explained that if he looked it up on the electoral roll, he would find that as a basic security precaution, I was registered under a nom de plume. I added that that was by arrangement with the electoral registration officer at the district council, and I invited him to visit my home so that he could satisfy himself that it was genuine. He assured me that no such visit was necessary, that he fully appreciated why I had made the special registration arrangements and that they would never be an issue between us in an election campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para4"><a name="09042910000230">Brian Dash kept his word, not only in the 2001 campaign but in the 2005 campaign, when he stood against me for a second time. By then, my seat had become a target for the Liberal Democrats and that campaign was not clean. Tacticalvoter.net, a left-wing group, infiltrated the local Labour party and installed Stephen Roberts as the Labour candidate. He worked hand in glove with the Liberal Democrats to try to oust me. Yet, despite the bitterness of that battle, the Liberal candidate, Brian Dash, kept his promise not to make an issue of the steps that I had taken to protect my home address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para5"><a name="09042910000231">Following my improved majority in 2005&#151;which may have had something to do with Tacticalvoter.net&#151;and a boundary change helpful to the Conservatives, I learned that the Liberal Democrats would not be targeting my seat next time. That is apparently why they allowed Terry Scriven to become their candidate, despite the fact that he lives miles away from New Forest, East, on the far side of New Forest, West, and has given no indication of moving into the constituency that he says he wishes to serve. Since becoming a prospective parliamentary candidate in 2007, Mr. Scriven&#146;s impact on my constituency has been vanishingly small. Knowing that he cannot defeat me politically, he has gambled everything on trying to smear me personally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para6"><a name="09042910000232">When I worked as a political researcher in the 1980s and early 1990s, I spent a lot of time ferreting out facts about left-wing political opponents. For example, I am holding a 250-page directory of Labour Members of Parliament and left-wing causes, which was published in the run-up to the 1992 general election. Yet nowhere in that book or in any of my other political research work will hon. Members find cases of my using personal rather than political information against any of the people featured. Indeed, until I encountered Mr. Scriven, I had never felt it necessary to consider personal misbehaviour by a political opponent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para7"><a name="09042910000233">Last year, I began my campaign to neutralise the extraordinary decision of three High Court judges that MPs&#146; home addresses should be revealed in response to freedom of information requests. In part, the judges based their ruling on the fact that all general election candidates had been required since the late 19th century to disclose a home address on nomination and ballot papers. We changed the law on MPs&#146; addresses by statutory instrument in July 2008 and we are in the process of doing the same on candidates&#146; addresses after the free vote on 2 March 2009. Significantly, the date of that vote was only 24 hours later than the smear story against me in the <i> News of the World&#151;</i>I do not think that that was a coincidence.</p>

with the electoral registration officer. That gave Terry Scriven his first opportunity. As I now know, on 25 June 2008, he e-mailed the chief executive of New Forest district council, Mr. Dave Yates, who is in overall charge of electoral registration, as follows:</p>

Would you also state under which regulation this procedure is authorised and by whom? I am not trying to create any waves here just to understand facts so that I do not ask silly questions in public. I must also add at this moment I have no intention of making information I have in my position&#148;&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para12"><a name="09042910000238">Mr. Yates replied that I had indeed registered in that way, by arrangement with the previous electoral registration officer, for reasons of personal safety. That had happened for a number of years but, Mr. Yates told Scriven, now that a new system of &#147;Anonymous Registration&#148; existed, I would be asked to use that instead of the nom de plume method in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para13"><a name="09042910000239">On 11 July, Mr. Scriven replied to the chief executive in the following apparently generous terms:</p>
<a name="90428-0026.htm_brev5"><a name="09042910000359"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Your email is very clear. I fully understand the reasons for Julian wishing to keep his private address confidential despite it appearing on the election forms and the agreement that was clearly entered into. I am sure both Julian and I understand the need for security.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para14"><a name="09042910000240">That was the first but by no means the last time that Mr. Scriven professed to support me in keeping MPs&#146; home addresses confidential. However, his private conduct has been utterly incompatible with his public position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para15"><a name="09042910000241">As I told the House last July, New Forest district council chief executive Dave Yates was contacted by a Sunday newspaper just seven days after Scriven&#146;s supposedly supportive e-mail. The exchange of e-mails between Mr. Scriven and Mr. Yates had been leaked to a journalist called Ben Leapman&#151;the very reporter leading the campaign for MPs&#146; home addresses to be published to all and sundry. The leak could have come only from Terry Scriven, if we exclude impropriety by the staff of New Forest district council, which I am sure we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para16"><a name="09042910000242">I have repeatedly asked Mr. Scriven to explain why he approached Ben Leapman to investigate a supposed irregularity in my electoral registration arrangements, when he had indicated to Mr. Yates that he fully accepted the need for those arrangements. Time and again, Mr. Scriven has refused to answer that question. I have also asked him why he chose Ben Leapman as the journalist to approach, given that reporter&#146;s hostility towards me for thwarting his efforts to force MPs&#146; addresses to be published. If Mr. Scriven is sincere in his proclaimed support for my campaign to protect MPs&#146; home addresses, Mr. Leapman is the last journalist in Britain whom he should have contacted. That question, too, Mr. Scriven refuses to answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para17"><a name="09042910000243">In the end, <i> The Sunday Telegraph</i> decided not to run Mr. Leapman&#146;s story, which simply tried to catch me out for having used a nom de plume for one year too long, rather than the new procedure of anonymous  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para19"><a name="09042910000247">Terry Scriven did not even have the decency to inform me of what he had done, but at once telephoned a local reporter in order to use the press to twist the knife that he had aimed at my back. Fortunately it missed its target, as the following report in the <i> Lymington Times</i>, dated 16 August 2008, makes clear. The headline is &#147;Chief Constable Scorns Call for MP Investigation&#148; and the story reads as follows:</p>

But Mr. Scriven&#146;s action was scorned by Hampshire&#146;s top policeman, Paul Kernaghan, who rejected his request for an investigation and said Dr. Lewis had acted &#145;in good faith&#146; on the advice of the District Council officer in charge of electoral registration. Mr. Kernaghan wrote to the MP: &#145;I sincerely hope that [Mr. Scriven] will decide to move on, as it is my personal view that this &#147;complaint&#148; does not enhance our collective respect for democracy and the electoral process.&#146;&#148;</p>

Some of the publicity surrounding Terry Scriven resulted in my being contacted by people who had previously suffered at his hands. Three were from the military police, but I cannot report what they said in language permissible in this Chamber. It boiled down to the fact that Terry Scriven&#146;s conduct had shown him to be a devious and two-faced bully who operates in the dark and never owns up to what he has done. My experience has confirmed that assessment in every respect.He blatantly refuses to answer any questions put to him about his own conduct, his sole response being to accuse me of trying to &#147;intimidate&#148; him by posing such questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="90428-0026.htm_para26"><a name="09042910000257">In May 1999, Scriven was elected unopposed as one of half a dozen members of the parish council at Hyde in New Forest, West, the constituency in which he lives. Although he was elected for a four-year term, he lasted just six months as a parish councillor. During that time, he attended only four of the first nine meetings and resigned at the tenth&#151;which was his fifth&#151;after constant disagreements with his colleagues.</p>

He attended his first council meeting on 26 July, but resigned from the planning committee on 25 October, only three months later, after a blazing row with the other members. In April 2007, the mayor of Ringwood announced, with some relief, that Scriven would be stepping down from the council completely.</p>

Such was his disruptive behaviour that, after attending only two meetings, he was twice asked to resign by the other trustees. He did so on 6 December, only two months later. [Hon.

Normally, one would simply write Scriven off as a malevolent failure and put one&#146;s faith in the good sense of the voters when the election is called. However, this brings me back to where I began, for Terry Scriven has finally had a success. He has managed to get the <i> News of the World</i> to publish a story falsely accusing me of hardly ever &#147;visiting&#148;, as it puts it, the home in my constituency where I have lived continuously for the past 11 years when I am not at Westminster. My genuine neighbours state, correctly, that I am constantly using my home, yet unnamed people, described as &#147;neighbours&#148; and &#147;locals&#148;, supposedly told the newspaper that I am &#147;HARDLY THERE&#148;&#151;the quote is all in capitals&#151;enabling it to denounce me for claiming my parliamentary allowance on my London flat, which I am perfectly entitled to do. The newspaper&#146;s story contained one factual item: the date on which I changed my main home designation from my flat in London to my house in my constituency. That had never been published before, but it had been disclosed by the House of Commons to Terry Scriven and to nobody else on 11 July 2008, at the same time as his freedom of information request for my home address in London was rightly rejected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="90428-0027.htm_para0"><a name="09042910000268">What Scriven did not do in this letter was to deny for one moment that he had indeed been the initiator of the <i> News of the World</i> smear. As my solicitor has now informed him, the only reason that a &#147;pile of other letters&#148; exists has been his own behaviour towards me and my staff, and his constant evasion of all questions put to him about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="90428-0027.htm_para1"><a name="09042910000269">I have little doubt that at some point during the next general election campaign Mr. Scriven will seek to distribute, perhaps unattributably, and perhaps with its date removed in order to make it look current, large numbers of copies of the <i> News of the World</i> smear story against me&#151;that is, assuming that decent Liberal Democrats who, unlike Terry Scriven, actually live in the New Forest, East constituency, have not finally realised that they made a disastrous mistake in selecting as their candidate someone whose behaviour makes him unfit for any elected position in public life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="90428-0027.htm_para2"><a name="09042910000270">My only defence against the covert tactics of this man is to bring them out into the open in the hope of inoculating the community against their intended effects. I have given him numerous opportunities to explain and justify his conduct, and his only response has been to claim to feel intimidated by me&#151;that is the classic refrain of the bully when an intended victim actually stands up to him. What can we expect next? Will it be a press smear against Sir Neil Thorne or the armed forces parliamentary scheme, or just another smear against me, as a shadow Defence Minister, for daring to spend so much time with the military? Can we expect a demand for the abolition of parliamentary privilege, so that hon. Members cannot rebut scurrilous critics such as Mr. Scriven? Actually&#151;I am not making this up&#151;he has tried that one already. Perhaps we can expect a police raid on my home, because Terry Scriven feels &#147;intimidated&#148; by my asking him to confirm or deny his role in the <i> News of the World </i>smear?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o513"><a name="90428-0027.htm_para3"><a name="09042910000271">I began by discussing Scriven&#146;s preposterous letter to my party leader, which, typically, was labelled &#147;In Confidence&#148;, so that I should not see his latest attempt to disparage me. It revealed that Terry Scriven expects the director general of MI5 and the chief of the Secret Intelligence Service to tell him if I have ever been involved with either organisation. Perhaps he does not realise that, just as people who work with or for such bodies have a lifelong obligation of confidentiality towards them, the reverse is also true. I can only apologise to them, to the chief constable of Hampshire, to Sir Neil Thorne, and to everyone else whose valuable time is being wasted by intrusive and inappropriate correspondence from this person, who likes to describe himself as the &#147;prospective Member of Parliament&#148; for my constituency. [Hon. Members: &#147;Never!&#148;] I am glad that my hon. Friends say, &#147;Never.&#148; This is a calculated effort to blacken my reputation in the eyes of my constituents. Thanks to the internet I have been able to respond quickly to the smears of the <i> News of the World</i> and to post the full documentation about Terry Scriven&#146;s antics in a special section of my website so people can read them and make up their own minds. Despite the co-operation of a certain sort of journalist, I do not think that Mr. Scriven will succeed in the end, but as he has to some extent poisoned the politics of New Forest, East, I thank the House for this opportunity to expose his behaviour and to set it on the record&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear!&#148;]</p>

 This is far too much excitement for an Adjournment debate. There is obviously also too much excitement in politics in the constituency of the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), although he rather lost me when he was going on about the mayor of Ringwood, which sounds like a veterinary equine condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o514"><a name="90428-0027.htm_para4"><a name="09042910000273">I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman, who is not only one of the most fastidious Members, but one of the most respectful, and indeed the most fastidiously respectful of hon. Members. I have never found him intimidating, not even when he has been trying to be intimidating, so I am delighted that he has managed to see off the gentleman in his constituency. I am also fascinated by the idea of having a nom de plume. It sounds like having a nom de guerre, and again is far too exciting. I have also never known anyone be quite so public about being private about their address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="90428-0027.htm_para5"><a name="09042910000274">I can be dispassionate on this issue as mine is the only constituency in the country in which both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have lost their deposits on the same occasion.

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="90428-0027.htm_para6"><a name="09042910000275">We can agree on many issues in this debate. First, the armed forces parliamentary scheme should not be taken lightly. It has provided an invaluable service for many hon. Members, including me, who would otherwise know very little of the armed forces, and we should thank Sir Neil Thorne. Secondly, the security of all hon. Members and their families and staff&#151;we should not forget them&#151;is a very serious matter. There have been very serious incidents in the past that the Liberal Democrats and other parties have had to face. That is a matter for the whole House.</p>

He said, &#147;I&#146;m very submissive.&#148; I used an expletive and he said, &#147;I&#146;m not that submissive.&#148; The police took him away. On a second occasion, someone was sent to prison for harassment, not because they were particularly aggressive towards me, but because they were making it impossible for me to do my job at my surgery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o518"><a name="90428-0027.htm_para8"><a name="09042910000277">All hon. Members will be aware of cases in their constituencies where they have had to deal with people who have mental health problems or who are fixated on them.

It is permissive, and if people want to put their address on they can do so. There were 235 votes in favour of changing the law and only 176 against. We also introduced a statutory instrument under the freedom of information legislation to ensure that Members&#146; residential addresses could be kept secure for the obvious reasons that the hon.
