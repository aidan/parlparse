 Registration details are not collected on the basis of residency. However, the number of patients registered with dental practices in south Leicestershire is equivalent to 51 per cent. of the local population, a 3.1 per cent. increase since October 2004. Fifteen practices are currently accepting NHS patients.

 The other 49 per cent., including my family and myself and my constituents in the Lutterworth area, would like to register with an NHS dentist but, believe me, it is impossible to find one. Can the Minister explain how it was that in September 1999 the Prime Minister said to the Labour party conference:

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, we are reforming the system whereby NHS dentistry is delivered. With regard to the first part of his question, there is a dental access centre in his area. There are 15 practices currently registering NHS patients in his area, so I suggest he contacts the PCT to see whether he can be registered.

 Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The changes that we will bring in next year will address some of the problems related to the fact that NHS dentists have increasingly been undertaking private work. The offer that we are making to dentists is a fair one. Allowing them more time to do preventive work, and other measures, such as increasing the number of dentists in training and bringing in international recruits, will help to ease the current problem. We know that it is by no means solved, but we are taking firm measures to deal with the crisis that we inherited from the Conservatives.

 I have corresponded with the Minister and received a delightful letter back from her. Will she come to my constituency, visit the PCT and acknowledge the crisis in NHS dentistry in Peterborough?

 I am aware of the hon.

However, I also know that the PCT has been in discussions with other local dentists and is confident that if that dentist deregisters, it can offer those patients places with NHS dentists. I am aware of the problem, and the PCT is dealing with it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will join me in encouraging the dentist to stay with the NHS and in thanking the PCT, which is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 (Lab/Co-op): My hon. Friend has visited my constituency to meet Mr.   Tariq Drabu, who has a dental practice in Middleton. Since her visit, he has invested some &#163;50,000 of his own money and, with the help of the PCT, increased his NHS patients by 1,000, and he is also about to take on a new partner. Does she think that his commitment to the NHS sets a good example to other dentists and will she consider visiting Middleton in the new year to see the progress made?
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51122-01_spnew9"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I remember visiting my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, where I was particularly impressed by the fact that the dentist to whom he has referred was working under a personal dental services contract. I thank the dentists who have taken that approach, because they have shown how the new contract will work. The system allows more preventive treatment and greater clinical judgment by dentists on how to look after their patients, which benefits not only dentists, but patients, too. That is how we will approach the new contract in April 2006, and my hon. Friend is right that how his PCT has worked locally is an extremely good example of how NHS dentistry can be turned round in a local area.

</p>





<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51122-01_spnew11"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 Of course that is not progress, and it is not good that the number of NHS places has fallen. One reason why the decrease has occurred is that more dentists have turned to private work. We have tried to turn the situation around by working with dentists to introduce a new contract that reflects how they say that they want to work and by introducing a simpler system of patient charges to reduce bureaucracy, about which dentists have complained. We are bringing dentists back into the NHS, using international recruits and training more new dentists, which started in October. I know that the situation is far from perfect, particularly in Rochdale, where I have visited the dental access centre, and we are taking steps to turn the situation around.

When dentists deregister, despite the excellent remuneration under the new system, will she encourage PCTs to commission other dental services or directly employ salaried dentists?
</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51122-01_spnew13"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to point out that if a dentist makes a reasonable commitment to the NHS, they can expect to receive about &#163;80,000 in pay plus another &#163;60,000 in business expenses, which is not an unreasonable salary. Because the power and the money will be devolved to the local level, if an NHS dentist decides to leave the NHS despite those generous

 (Con): As you know, Mr. Speaker, I have a slight interest in the subject, so I might be able to help. The Minister knows that dentists are trained to use new methods, materials and techniques that patients demand and which are, I think correctly, available only outside the NHS. Will she re-examine the contract to see whether it can be tweaked to encourage mixed NHS and private dentistry, which would allow dentists to stay with the NHS, at least in part?
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51122-01_spnew15"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 Nothing in the new contract will prevent the continuing mix of NHS and private dentistry. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that new materials are available as well as so-called cosmetic dentistry, which is not allowed on the NHS at the moment. He and I have discussed several of those issues, and I can assure him that nothing in the new contract prevents dentists from undertaking private work if that is what patients demand.

 My hon. Friend is right that there has been confusion; I am sure that other hon. Members will have had experience of that. People say to me, &quot;I&#039;ve just paid &#163;1,500 for NHS dental treatment&quot;, and I say, &quot;No, you haven&#039;t, because the maximum you could pay was &#163;383.&quot; The Office of Fair Trading looked into this very thoroughly and said in its report that there is some confusion. As a result of the changes that we are making, we want dentists to make the prices for private work absolutely clear in their surgeries and to tell patients what they can expect to pay under the NHS. The simplified banding system will also make it clearer to patients what they can expect to pay on the NHS. I accept that there has been a problem, but we are taking steps to put it right.
</p>





<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51122-01_spnew18"><b> Dr. Andrew Murrison  (Westbury)</b> 
 (Con): Is it not the case that the Minister&#039;s plans will result in more patients paying more, perverse incentives for dentists to offer cheaper treatments within each of the charging bands, and little help from units of dental activity to encourage preventive work of the sort that my hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51122-01_spnew19"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 No, they will not. We should be absolutely clear about what we are offering dentists under the new contract. If they give a reasonable level of commitment to the NHS, they can expect to take home about &#163;80,000 a year. On top of that, about &#163;60,000 is given in expenses to help run practices. That will be guaranteed for three years to encourage the same level of commitment to NHS dentistry as at present. However, in terms of units of dental activity, there will be a reduction to allow for preventive care. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to say that this militates against

 Some 1,453 dentists were recruited by the end of October 2005, contributing to a 1,100 net increase in the number of NHS dentists in England between September 2004 and September 2005. This recruitment drive improved access to dentistry in many parts of the country. During the past 12 months, registrations increased by 700,000.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_1">As regards what will happen if dentists do choose to leave the NHS, the whole idea of commissioning at local level is that instead of the money reverting to the centre, as it used to, it remains at local level.

</p>





<p><a name="st_28"><a name="51122-02_spnew5"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 One of the advantages of the new contract and the new system of commissioning dentistry is that the local PCT will be required to consider local health needs for dentistry and then examine the number of dentists who provide it. If necessary, in the instance that the hon.

 Is it Government policy to close community hospitals and force patients to travel 40 miles to overstretched general hospitals?

 Walnuttree hospital has a building that was constructed in 1836 and has already had &#163;300,000 invested in it to bring it up to the standard required by fire safety regulations, albeit temporarily.

 As the hon. Lady knows, Herceptin is not yet licensed for women with early breast cancer but, as with other unlicensed drugs, it can be used in some cases. It is for clinicians to decide, in discussion with patients, whether Herceptin is appropriate, taking into account potential risks and medical history. I appreciate that the hon. Lady is an assiduous campaigner on behalf of one of her constituents. She may like to know that, following last Friday&#039;s decision by the 14 primary care trusts of Greater Manchester to provide funding to support the wider prescribing of Herceptin in their area, the Central Cheshire PCT, which covers her constituency and is in the Greater Manchester and Cheshire cancer network area, is meeting this afternoon to consider the matter.
</p>





<p><a name="st_35"><a name="51122-02_spnew10"><b> Ann Winterton: </b> 
 Will the Minister accept that that reply is good news for my constituent, Joanne Leese? Will she also examine postcode prescribing&#151;the postcode lottery? If the Central Cheshire PCT does not go along with the Greater Manchester group, my constituent will be further disadvantaged. It is wrong, when a clinician has said that a person should have Herceptin, that cost should prevent the prescription of that good medication for her condition.
</p>





<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51122-02_spnew11"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 PCTs will need to take a range of factors into consideration when reaching these decisions, including the appropriateness of the treatment for an individual patient, and its cost-effectiveness. The drug will not be appropriate for all women. The important thing is that PCTs do not refuse to fund the drug for early breast cancer on principle, and that they take into account all the considerations relating to each case.

</p>





<p><a name="st_38"><a name="51122-02_spnew13"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 It is important to remember that, as with other cancer drugs, Herceptin can have side effects. For example, it can cause heart damage in some patients. That is why we need to ensure that it will be safe for routine use. That is the role of the licensing process, and the reason why that process is so important in regard to the considerations that must be taken into account. The House might like to know, however, that the National Cancer Research Institute is producing guidelines on the use of Herceptin for early breast cancer prior to licensing. I am sure that that will be of great help to primary care trusts in considering these decisions.

 No, I do not. The cost of Herceptin will need to be met from the existing settlement agreed for the national health service.

 Of course I join my hon. Friend in congratulating the North-East cancer network. The directors of the cancer networks have played a key role in ensuring that the right decisions are made, and that Herceptin is prescribed only for patients for whom it is appropriate. As I have said, the drug is believed to have serious side effects, and it is too early to judge its full effectiveness, its overall cost-effectiveness and all the risks involved. That is why licensing remains so important, along with the NICE appraisal that will be carried out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-02_para1">
<a name="stpa_2">I have announced, with NICE, the new procedure that NICE is introducing. Herceptin and four other potentially life-saving drugs will be subjected to a single appraisal, which we hope will be completed within a few weeks of the announcement of the licence. The whole process will become much swifter. Let me record my appreciation of the institute&#039;s efforts to bring about a change that will benefit many patients enormously.

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="51122-02_spnew22"><b> Steve Webb  (Northavon)</b> 
 (LD): Does the Secretary of State have the power to guarantee Herceptin to women whose clinicians believe that it is appropriate for them now? If she has that power, why has she not used it? If she does not have that power, is there not a danger&#151;I put this gently&#151;that false hopes will be raised among women who are in a desperate situation? They will hear an announcement that suggests that Herceptin will be available, on which the Secretary of State will then be unable to deliver.
</p>





<p><a name="st_48"><a name="51122-02_spnew23"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 No. We rightly decided to give primary care trusts&#151;the local organisations that understand local circumstances best&#151;authority to make the necessary decision when a drug that has not been licensed is being offered to a patient, or when treatment with the drug is being discussed with a patient. We have said, however, that the decision making should not constitute a blanket policy of not prescribing, but should take place on a case-by-case basis. Decisions involving an important drug such as Herceptin must take all the circumstances into account; they must not be made simply on the basis of cost.
</p>





<p><a name="st_49"><a name="51122-02_spnew24"><b> Mr. John Baron  (Billericay)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister will be well aware that because of deficits, many primary care trusts are struggling to implement NICE guidance and fund the provision of Herceptin for late-stage breast cancer. Given that experts such as those working for Breakthrough Breast Cancer believe that 1,000 lives a year could be saved if Herceptin were available for early-stage breast cancer, and given the Government&#039;s recent announcement that Herceptin should not be withheld for reasons of cost alone, what additional funding will the Government provide so that PCTs can implement that direction? They need to ensure that other local services do not suffer, and also that the shameful postcode lottery that exists in relation to Herceptin and late-stage breast cancer is not replicated in the case of early-stage breast cancer.

<a name="stpa_3">It is important to acknowledge the huge amount of extra resources that the health service has received. It is perfectly possible for PCTs and hospitals to manage their resources properly, and the vast majority are doing so. Professor Mike Richards wrote to the NHS in mid October, advising it that it would need to make arrangements to provide Herceptin for women for whom it was appropriate. It is appropriate that the NHS organises its budgets locally, gets its priorities in place and then makes payments where appropriate for particular patients.

What I and my constituents want to know is why there is such a gap in the provision of services for such children. Why will the NHS not take notice of parental preferences for care&#151;in this case, for Aidan&#151;and why will it not fund more proactive care, which this couple want for their son, to give him a real chance in life?

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for discussing the case with me personally in the last two or three days. Children with cerebral palsy are, of course, first and foremost children, so it is for local clinicians together with the parents to take decisions about the right course of treatment. Quite complex packages will often be required and it is important for parents to make their own preferences clear to the clinicians in that process. PCTs are then free to fund whatever treatment they think is appropriate, provided that they do so on the basis of available evidence and are convinced of the effectiveness of the treatment proposed.

 The short answer is no. This Government should be credited for identifying the existence of health inequalities in the first place, and we have set into play a number of activities, resourced and supported from the centre, to tackle them. The hon. Gentleman is right: the status report produced over the summer&#151;we commissioned it so that we could actively monitor the situation&#151;did show that the relative gap for life expectancy, and for infant mortality, had increased. However, it also demonstrated that infant mortality rates had fallen in routine and manual groups and in the total population. It further showed that life expectancy had increased for men and women in England, and in the PCTs with the worst health and deprivation indicators. We have also reduced the gap in cancer and circulatory disease mortality, and we are reducing child poverty and improving housing quality. We are moving in the right direction.

 I welcome that reply but, before Second Reading, will the Minister also publish the findings of the Government&#039;s Better Regulation Task Force, which has come out against the Airdrie and Shotts fudge? If the Minister read the political tea leaves, she would understand that there is a majority in the House of Commons for a total ban, comparable with the one that will be introduced by the Labour party in Scotland and by the Labour Government at Westminster in Northern Ireland. We need a free vote to test whether there is a majority in the House of Commons, and I hope that Ministers will reflect on what is prudent, just and protects and promotes the best interests of poor working-class people who suffer&#151;

 We have taken on board a range of views and representations and will publish the regulatory impact assessment in the usual way. The manifesto commitment was discussed through our national policy forums and the wording in the manifesto was agreed at the Warwick national policy forum, so it has gone through our party machinery in the usual way. Although I accept the views of many Members and organisations outside this place who would like a total ban, in terms of public support and the surveys we have carried out, the Office for National Statistics survey in 2004 found that 88 per cent. of people, when asked, supported restrictions in public places but only 31 per cent. supported complete bans.

We want to minimise the damage from second-hand smoke, which is not just about bans but about the support we give in the NHS for people who are giving up smoking.

 My hon.

Will she commend the work of the charity Re-Solv in schools, and in particular the work done by pupils of Wirral grammar school for girls, who are raising awareness among their peers of the dangers of solvent abuse?

<a name="51122-05_head0"><h3 align=center>Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Supplies</h3>
<a name="time_0">
<a name="51122-05_time0"><h5>3.31 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51122-05_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Health  (Ms Patricia Hewitt): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about seasonal flu vaccine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Five years ago, we decided to give higher priority to protecting the health of the public from winter flu. We introduced the annual seasonal flu vaccination programme and we targeted those at increased risk from seasonal flu&#151;people aged 65 and over, and younger people in certain clinical risk groups as identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. This is an annual programme, because each year new strains of flu can emerge and therefore the flu vaccines need to be reformulated accordingly. In this way, each year&#039;s vaccine provides the best protection against the influenza virus currently circulating.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Since the programme was introduced in the winter of 2000&#150;01, vaccination uptake in people aged 65 and over has increased year on year. In the first year of the targeted programme, just over 65 per cent. of elderly patients were vaccinated. Last year 71.5 per cent. of those aged 65 and over received the seasonal flu vaccine&#151;some 5.2 million people&#151;and in addition 1.2 million younger people in the clinical risk groups were vaccinated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The responsibility for ordering seasonal flu vaccine and administering the vaccine has always fallen on general practitioners. GPs order their own supply of vaccine, based on the number of eligible patients on the register, and make contractual arrangements with any of the six manufacturers who supply flu vaccine to the UK. In addition to the GP orders, the Department of Health purchases a stock of flu vaccine each year as part of our contingency planning measures. We hold that for emergency use, in case GPs run into difficulties with vaccine supply.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">We routinely meet representatives from the UK vaccine industry group at the beginning of each year to inform the industry of how much seasonal flu vaccine will be required in the UK. This is based on the numbers of people covered by the current Department of Health policy. This year, the estimated production total from all UK vaccine manufacturers was over 14 million doses&#151;more than ever before, and sufficient to immunise 100 per cent. of those in the targeted groups, in other words the elderly and younger people in clinical risk groups, as set out in the letter from the chief medical officer to the NHS in July.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">In late October, however, we began to hear anecdotal evidence that some GPs were facing a shortage of flu vaccine. In order to assess the potential problem, officials wrote on 3 November to the flu immunisation co-ordinators of all the primary care trusts. That letter reminded them of the priority groups for flu vaccination and how additional stocks of vaccine could be ordered from the Department of Health contingency stock, should extra supplies be required by practices in their area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The current problems may be due to a combination of factors, such as possibly the under-ordering of vaccine on the one hand, and possibly vaccination of the worried well on the other. It also seems likely that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1372</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>awareness of the need for flu vaccinations is higher this year, due in part to the very high level of media interest in the threat of avian flu in birds and of pandemic flu.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">We do not, of course, expect seasonal flu vaccine to protect people against bird flu or pandemic flu, but I stress that seasonal flu vaccine is important for people aged 65 and over and for the clinical risk groups and that high uptake in those groups is to be welcomed. We need to ensure that GPs prioritise their remaining stocks of flu vaccine to help those who will really benefit most&#151;in other words, people aged 65 and over and younger people in the clinical risk groups. Officials wrote to influenza immunisation co-ordinators to that effect yesterday.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">The Department is also helping GPs by releasing flu vaccine from the contingency stock that we have purchased. We have taken orders against that stock, and deliveries are already being made and will continue into December. There is, of course, exceptionally high demand globally for flu vaccine, despite which the Department has been able to secure an additional 200,000 doses of flu vaccine on top of the 400,000 dose contingency reserve that we have already obtained. The additional 200,000 doses will be delivered in January. We are also discussing with manufacturers whether additional supplies can be made available, over and above those additional 200,000 doses, and if so, when those stocks would be available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">In previous years, the GP-led arrangement that I have described has, on the whole, worked well. In view of what has happened this year, however, I am reviewing the arrangements currently in place for the seasonal flu vaccination programme and will consider this matter urgently.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51122-05_spnew2"><b> Mr. Andrew Lansley  (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> 
 I am sure that the House is grateful to the Secretary of State for her statement, although she must understand that we would have been more grateful if she had come to the House yesterday to make a statement on the same day as selected members of the press were being briefed on this subject. I am grateful to her not only for providing me with advance sight of her statement, but&#151;indeed at 1.50 this afternoon&#151;for replying by fax to the letter that I sent to her on 5 October raising concerns about the winter flu vaccination programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">I am sure that the House will have listened to the Secretary of State&#039;s statement and found in it no acknowledgement of a simple fact: people have been going to their GP surgery to get their flu jabs and been told that supplies have run out.
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51122-05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Dennis Skinner  (Bolsover) (Lab):</b> 
 Not everybody.
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51122-05_spnew4"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 Happily, not everybody, but one person missed in the at-risk group is one person too many. The hon. Gentleman and the rest of the House should know that, even where that has not yet happened, it will happen because supplies are running out, and we have not completed the period during which the highest levels of immunisation occur.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">The Secretary of State did not accept responsibility. She should have done so, but she did not. The delivery of the influenza immunisation programme is the Government&#039;s responsibility. It is not good enough that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1373</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>she has come to the House to blame general practitioners for the failure of the programme. Not only has she failed to apologise, she has not even remotely begun to explain what has gone wrong. If the House will forgive me, let us start with the actual figures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">First, the Secretary of State underestimated the success of the flu immunisation programme. Her own Department&#039;s figures suggest that, in 2004&#150;05, a 71.5 per cent. vaccine uptake among the over-65 population in England amounted to 5.9 million people immunised&#151;not the 5.2 million that she set out. However, she did not refer to the overall figures on vaccine uptake. Uptake was 71.5 per cent. in England, 68.1 per cent. in Scotland and 62 per cent. in Wales. For risk groups below 65 years old, the comparable figures were 42.6 per cent. in England, 39.3 per cent. in Scotland and just 25 per cent. in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">The Secretary of State did not make comparisons clearly between what has happened in previous years and what is happening this year. On 26 October last year, her noble Friend Lord Warner told another place:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;The Government made sure that there were around 14 million doses of flu vaccine available for this year&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">he was speaking of last winter, not this&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;despite the problems in the Speke factory, which are well known&#151;compared with 12 million administered last year.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 26 October 2004; Vol. 665, c. 1174.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">That implies that the number of doses that the Department of Health has made available this year&#151;14 million&#151;is the same as the number for the previous year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">The letter that the Department of Health sent to general practitioners yesterday referred on the one hand to 11 million people in the at-risk groups and on the other to the 14 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine that were available. Unfortunately, the 11 million people refers to England, but the 14 million doses refers to the United Kingdom. It would have been more accurate to talk of about 14 million people in the at-risk groups and 14 million doses of influenza vaccine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">The Secretary of State did not point out in her statement that, although the Department of Health met manufacturers early this year to agree that 13.4 million doses of vaccine would be available&#151;it subsequently procured a contingency supply of 400,000, which I accept is routinely the same each year&#151;it agreed at a later stage that the at-risk groups would include people with chronic liver disease, who had not previously been included. It also agreed that the recommended groups would include main carers with responsibility for the care of elderly and disabled people who would be at risk if their carers were to become ill. The Department has no figures on the likely number of such people, but it means that perhaps millions of carers might have gone to their GP surgeries this winter to try to get flu jabs and then received them appropriately, although that would not have been the case in previous years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">Those are the figures&#151;the Secretary of State might have had the courtesy to tell us what they were&#151;and the facts about the extension of recommended groups this year compared with previous years. The House will understand that, broadly speaking, the available vaccine supply did not increase, whereas the number of recommended groups did. The prospect of a great deal 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1374</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of speculation about avian flu in the autumn certainly should have led the Department to be aware at an earlier stage about the desirability of being prepared for a much greater take-up of flu vaccine among people in the recommended groups than in previous years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">Let me ask the Secretary of State several questions about what was done. When carers were added to the recommended groups for vaccination, was the number of doses of vaccine that was intended to be supplied increased from 13.4 million? When the British Medical Association told the Department of Health in October&#151;this was not just anecdotal, as the Secretary of State said&#151;that it had concerns about the availability of vaccine, what did the Department do?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para19">
<a name="stpa_19">The Secretary of State will recall that the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) made it clear on 17 October that he, for one, had gone to his surgery and been told not only that he could not have his flu jab on the day of his visit, but that he would not receive it until the end of November, at the earliest. What did she do after 17 October, given that we have now arrived at 22 November and we have a crisis? When a manufacturing company ran out of supply in late October and told the Department about that, what did the Department do?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para20">
<a name="stpa_20">When did the Department find out the new figures on uptake? Responses to parliamentary questions said that the uptake figures were due in the Department on 14 November. The Department talked to the UK vaccine industry group on 16 November&#151;six days ago&#151;and asked for additional supplies. Health Ministers did not have the courtesy to tell the House about the lack of availability of supply, even though they had talked to the industry about it. However, they must have talked to the industry because they knew the uptake figures on 14 November. What are the figures and how do they compare with those for previous years?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para21">
<a name="stpa_21">What is the Government&#039;s evidence that general practitioners have been vaccinating what the Secretary of State cares to call the worried well&#151;people outside the recommended groups? The BMA certainly has no evidence that that is the case and the Scottish Executive do not tell the public and the BMA that it is the problem in Scotland. The Secretary of State might care to explain why general practitioners should vaccinate people who are not in the recommended groups, as they have no financial incentive from the NHS to do that&#151;they are not paid by the NHS to do it&#151;and would be out of pocket from buying the vaccine were they to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-05_para22">
<a name="stpa_22">The Secretary of State has not told the House the figures. She has not explained to the House when the Government knew about the implications of changes this year in the uptake of vaccine and in the number of groups recommended. The consequence of all those changes has been our constituents visiting GP surgeries seeking flu vaccinations and being unable to get them. What estimate does she have of the number of people who will at the end of this immunisation season be un-immunised? What justification does she have for coming to the House and instead of taking what is in truth her responsibility for the flu immunisation programme seeking to blame general practitioners?

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51122-06_spnew0"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I very much regret that the hon. Gentleman has chosen not to give any credit at all for the great success over many years of the targeted winter flu programme. Nor has he chosen to acknowledge the fact that in 1996&#150;97, for which I happen to have the figures, vaccine production for the United Kingdom was a mere 6.1 million doses. For last winter, the figure was double that&#151;12.3 million doses&#151;and for the current year and the current winter season it will be nearly 14 million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_23">As I said to the House, the number of people in the risk groups&#151;I mean by that the over-65s and younger people who are clinically at risk&#151;is some 11 million. Therefore, it was the conclusion of the Department of Health that the availability of 14 million or so doses this year would be sufficient not only for 100 per cent. immunisation of the at-risk groups but for immunisation of carers, whom it has always been open to GPs to immunise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_24">When we discussed this issue at a recent Health questions, one of my hon. Friends said that he had been unable to get his vaccination. I went back to the Department to check and found that, as I had believed to be the case, there had been delay in production from one of the companies on which we rely for the vaccines. That problem in production was corrected some weeks ago, so the vaccine that should have been produced by that company has now been produced and, as I understand it, delivered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_25">The hon. Gentleman asked specifically about the uptake figures. The figures that I have, which have been made available to primary care trusts from a large number of GP practices, show that at the end of October&#151;these are the latest figures that I have&#151;the uptake of the flu vaccine was very similar indeed to that for last year. If one looks, for instance, at the figures for the over-65s, one sees that, by the end of October this year, 48.9 per cent. had been vaccinated. By the end of October last year, the figure for elderly people was in fact 55 per cent. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman asked for the figures; perhaps he would like to listen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_26">This year, for younger people in the clinical risk groups, 25 per cent. had been immunised. By the end of October last year, the figure was 28 per cent. That is why the director of immunisation for the Department says that there is no evidence to support the proposition that a much higher proportion of people in the at-risk groups have been asking for immunisation. I have spoken to the chairman of the BMA to ask whether it has any evidence of a sudden upsurge in the past few weeks in requests for immunisation. He said that he did not, in fact, believe that there had been but he is to some extent relying on anecdotal reports, as do we in relation to reports from GPs of increased demand by people whom I did indeed describe as the worried well who do not fall into the at-risk groups for whom we recommend immunisation but who none the less may wish to try to obtain the vaccine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_27">The most important issue at this point is ensuring that we provide supplies of vaccine to GPs who, for whatever reason, do not have enough. That is the problem. As in every previous year, GPs have placed their orders. The total number of doses available to the country is about 1 million higher than in the previous year which, in turn, was about 1 million higher than the year before and so on. A number of GPs, however, have run out of vaccine, which is why we are doing everything possible in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Department to fulfil our responsibilities and ensure that the supplies that we already have are delivered to GPs who have run out as quickly as possible and that we secure fresh supplies as quickly as possible and in turn make those available to GPs who need them so that everybody, particularly in the at-risk groups, who wants a flu vaccination this winter can have one as soon as possible.

 I am grateful for sight of the Secretary of State&#039;s statement.

<p>
<a name="51122-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_28">Does the Secretary of State accept that central Government have only two things to do? They must ensure that the emergency stockpile is adequate and they must monitor what is happening on the ground. Does she accept that the Government have failed on both fronts? We are told that the emergency stockpile will expire in a few days and, from what she has said, the Department does not appear to have a clue about what is going on. In her statement, she said that problems &quot;may be due&quot; to certain factors and used the words &quot;possibly vaccination&quot; and &quot;awareness may be&quot;. Frankly, the Government do not know. Will the Secretary of State admit that she cannot say what has happened to all those vaccines? Does she know where they are and who has had them?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_29">Has not the Department of Health been grossly complacent about the issue? I and Conservative Front Benchers wrote to the Secretary of State in the first half of October, but she told us today that the Government had to rely on anecdotal evidence in late October and more recently. Why did she not take action when hon. Members contacted her to alert her to the issue? Is the Department not guilty of gross complacency? How many pensioners have gone to GP surgeries and been turned away? Does she have any idea how many we are talking about? Given that many people face a barrier when going to have a vaccination&#151;it is an ordeal even to think about it&#151;how many will never come back because they have been turned away and simply do not want to face it again?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_30">The Government need to take responsibility instead of blaming GPs for prescribing to the wrong people, because there does not appear to be any evidence that GPs have done so. Did the Secretary of State ask the BMA if its members had been prescribing to the worried well and, if so, what did it say? I do not imagine that it said that its members had been doing so. If this is how the Government cope with predictable seasonal flu, which they know about every year and for which they have plenty of time to plan, can we have any confidence that they will cope with a much bigger flu pandemic if we have one?
</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51122-06_spnew2"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 When the hon. Gentleman accuses my Department of complacency and a lack of preparedness he is simply talking rubbish. At the beginning of the year, my Department did what it has done every year since we embarked on this programme&#151;talk to the industry about the amount of flu dosage that would be available and ensure that it would be more this year than it was last year. As I said, there has been an increase every year for the past eight years in the amount of vaccine for winter flu available in our country. When we began to receive information and calls from GPs who were running low on supplies, we immediately took 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>steps to set up a national audit, from which I have cited figures to show the position for the at-risk groups by the end of October. We also contacted the industry to secure more supplies. We were accused by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) of not contacting the industry until the middle of November. In fact, that was the second time that we went to the industry to secure more stock for departmental supplies because of the problems that GPs had encountered.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_31">The fact remains that for the winter flu vaccine programme&#151;this is a different arrangement from the one that is in place for childhood immunisation&#151;general practitioners have always been responsible for ordering and administering the flu vaccine. Given the overall amounts&#151;some 14 million doses&#151;that have been delivered in our country, we can be clear that GPs have ordered at least the same amounts, if not somewhat more, compared with last year.

<a name="51122-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_32">As regards possible pandemic flu, the arrangements that we are already making for obtaining antivirals and for obtaining vaccines are based on the system that we use for childhood vaccination&#151;in other words, a central ordering system. The only central ordering system that we have for the winter flu vaccine is the relatively small but now increasing stockpile that we use to supplement the far larger amount that GPs order, based on their own patient lists and knowledge of the number of patients who fall within the at-risk groups. As I stressed, it is important now to ensure that we continue to do as we are doing, to obtain as much additional stock as we can and supply that to the GPs as quickly as possible.

 In my constituency, in at least one health centre, those in priority groups&#151;the over-65s&#151;have been told not only that supplies are exhausted, but that it is too late in the season for new supplies to be obtained. Is it the case that a seasonal cut-off date has until now been applied to the supply of vaccine?

 No, it is not the case that there is now a cut-off date and that my hon. Friend&#039;s elderly constituents are too late for the flu vaccine. As I said, we are distributing a significant number of doses&#151;indeed, we have orders for some 200,000 doses that we are starting to distribute. We are taking further orders, which we will fill as more vaccine becomes available. As I mentioned, we have already placed an additional order for a further 200,000 doses&#151;that is, on top of our initial order of 400,000 doses&#151;so an additional 200,000 doses of flu vaccine will become available in January, and will continue to be made available to GPs who need it for their elderly patients and other at-risk groups. I hope that my hon.

 Fairly recently, hon. Members on both sides of the House took part in a promotional exercise to seek to draw to our constituents&#039; attention the availability of influenza vaccine and the necessity for the elderly, particularly, and those at risk to use it. We did so, confident of the information made available by the Department of Health that there was sufficient available. Clearly, that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1378</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>confidence was sadly misplaced. In the small village of Birchington in my constituency, over the past few days, more than 50 people have presented at Courts the chemist carrying prescriptions for vaccine that is not available. A ring-round suggests that no chemist in the area has any vaccine at all. It is no good saying that it will be January before the vaccine arrives. When will people get it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51122-07_spnew1"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 As I have just told the House, we already have orders from GPs who have run out of vaccine, and we are filling those orders. We still have several thousand doses of flu vaccine in our own stockpile. Those are being made available to GPs in the order in which GPs place their orders to us. We will continue to fill those orders and, because of the problem that has emerged, we have secured additional stocks of flu vaccine. We have done so despite the fact that the manufacturers are reporting far higher global demand than was the case last year, so we have responded promptly to the problem that has emerged.

<a name="51122-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_33">I stress to the hon. Gentleman that the GPs in his constituency are responsible this year, as they have been for every year since winter flu began, for placing their orders. They did so. The number of doses available to our country is significantly higher than last year, and was sufficient for 100 per cent. take-up of the vaccine among the elderly and the other at-risk groups. It is something of a puzzle, it is fair to say, that at a point in the year when, by the end of October, only about half of the over-65s and only about a quarter of the under-65s at risk had been immunised, the stocks have already run out. There are clearly lessons that need to be learned for next year. This year, the priority is to get our stocks out as quickly as possible to the GPs and replenished, so that other GPs who have not yet placed their orders can get them.

 I declare an interest&#151;as a result of the session in the Palace of Westminster, I am one of those who has fortunately had the winter influenza jab. I fall into the vulnerable group. Was the Secretary of State actually alleging that general practitioners have not ordered as many doses of flu vaccine as they should have done this year? If the Department of Health were to order a larger quantity of vaccine in order to hold a larger balance in case of an outbreak or pandemic, would the vaccine go off? Does the flu vaccine go off after a time, which would prevent the Department ordering a larger quantity? I agree with the hon.

As we did with considerable success in previous years, this year we ensured that GPs placed their orders in the usual way, and we placed an order for a relatively modest, but none the less significant, stockpile of 400,000 doses in case any GPs faced difficulties. I have already referred to one manufacturer having a problem with one of its production plants, which has delayed the delivery of supplies to some GPs who rely on that particular company. Last year, there was also a problem with a production facility, but we were able to step in.

<a name="stpa_34">We do not know exactly how many doses each GP ordered, although the overall figures suggest that GPs ordered at least as many doses as they did last year&#151;they probably ordered more than that. Those supplies have now run out, despite the fact that at the end of October the same proportion of people in the at-risk groups had been vaccinated as last year. We are ensuring that our stockpile is distributed to GPs as quickly as possible, with the exception of a small amount that we have ring-fenced for poultry workers, and we are supplementing that stockpile with the additional 200,000 doses to which I referred earlier.

 My right hon. Friend will recall that I gave her some anecdotal evidence about the matter in this House on 17 October, and she asked her officials to make sure that there was not a problem of the kind that I described, which was the appropriate ministerial response. As she has said, however, we still do not know what has happened, which is a problem and a puzzle. People such as me were asking whether it was likely that demand for seasonal flu vaccine would increase because of the attention paid to avian flu, but did the Department factor that point into its calculations? If there is a question about the vaccinating practices of GPs, is there any check on whether they are giving the vaccine to priority groups only?
</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51122-07_spnew7"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises important points. He refers to the problem that he had encountered, which he mentioned to me on 17 October. After that, I checked with the Department and established that there had indeed been delays because of production problems with one manufacturer. Those problems were overcome and the delayed supplies were then delivered to the GPs who had ordered them. We also put in place a national audit process so that we could track exactly what was happening. GPs regularly provide information to their primary care trusts, mostly through the computer system, on the numbers of people in the at-risk groups whom they have vaccinated. I gave those figures and proportions to the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_35">If somebody who is not in an at-risk group asks for a flu vaccination because they think that it might be a good thing to have this year, perhaps because of the publicity that they have read about avian flu, that does not mean that a GP necessarily should or will give a vaccination to that person. GPs are not required to report to PCTs on vaccinations given to people who fall outside the at-risk groups, although those figures might become available later in the year when they claim reimbursement for such vaccinations.

 Will the Minister give a categorical assurance that GPs will be directed to stay within the at-risk patients guidelines for the vaccine so that the worried well, who are allegedly being vaccinated, do not receive the vaccine until the crucial groups are catered for? Given that we face an extreme winter period, surely the vulnerable must be first in line to get this much-needed vaccine.
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51122-07_spnew9"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I agree. The whole point about having priority groups is that they should get priority. The letter that went from the Department yesterday to the flu co-ordinators and the advice that goes through them to GPs stresses that the vaccine should now be directed towards the priority groups&#151;the elderly, younger people at clinical risk and carers&#151;who are at risk.

 The Secretary of State says that lessons have to be learned for next year. What lessons has she learned, given that she does not seem to be taking any responsibility for the crisis that we are facing? Steve Flynn of Mellor in my constituency contacted me today. He is an asthma sufferer who was told that he could not get the flu jab this week. He said, &quot;I&#039;ll ring back next week&quot;, and was told, &quot;Yes, give us a try.&quot; I then phoned both my Clitheroe practices, which expect it to run out of the vaccine at the end of the week. Will the Secretary of State say how long the 400,000 doses that she has in the current contingency stock are likely to last, and will she ensure that all practices, in rural as well as urban areas, get access to it?

As I said earlier, 10,000 doses are being reserved for poultry workers. In other words, a total of 80,000 doses will still be available for order.

There are either 11 million people in England and 14 million throughout the United Kingdom or there are simply 11 million people who need the vaccine.

 My hon. Friend raises important points. We need to get much more information than we currently have by the end of the winter.

<br>&nbsp;<br>what they believe they need for their practices, taking into account the Department&#039;s advice on the risk groups for whom immunisation is a priority. As I have said several times, the number of doses&#151;14 million&#151;available this year is significantly higher than in previous years and should have been more than adequate for not only 100 per cent. take-up in the at-risk groups, which we have never achieved, but for others, including health care workers, for whom immunisation is often desirable.

 The last time the Secretary of State spoke on the issue, I asked her whether there was a need for a Government information campaign to deal with public confusion about the differences between a seasonal flu jab, a pandemic and avian flu. In her reply, she said that the Government&#039;s information campaign on seasonal flu had already been completed. Who is therefore to blame for those non-vulnerable and ineligible groups seeking the flu jab&#151;the Government for not informing the public properly, the media for confusing the message that the Government needed to convey or the public for not understanding the Government&#039;s message?

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51122-08_spnew7"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 In line with contingency plans and World Health Organisation guidance, we have published a great deal of material, all of which was well tested on the public to ensure that it is as clear as possible. We have made that available to GPs and on a variety of websites. We do our best to brief the media on the difference between bird flu, which does not exist in Britain and poses a very small risk to human health in Europe generally, a possible pandemic flu of a currently unknown strain, and winter flu, with which we have been dealing in the usual way.

 The Secretary of State said that last year one in four of the elderly at risk did not manage to get vaccinated. It is reasonable to infer that those people are more likely to be infirm and housebound, and therefore less able to get to their GP&#039;s surgery for their vaccination. Does the Secretary of State want GPs to carry out domiciliary visits in order to reach the elderly infirm, of whom there are increasing numbers, at home?
</p>





<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51122-08_spnew9"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. Because we give priority to the elderly and other clinically at-risk groups, and because GP practices are paid specifically for vaccinating the people in those groups, there are already quite a lot of programmes of that sort. District nurses, for instance, go to old people&#039;s residential homes, or to very frail elderly people who might well be housebound, to offer them the flu vaccine. However, there has never been a 100 per cent. uptake and GPs tend to base their orders for the vaccine on what they used the previous year, as they do not want to be left with unused stock. The GPs and the Government do everything possible to ensure that vulnerable elderly people get the protection that they need and deserve.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The Government made major announcements today on the reorganisation of local government in Northern Ireland. They also announced the implications of that reorganisation on the education, health and social services sectors. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has referred to the proposed changes as &quot;major&quot; and &quot;substantial&quot;, yet he has chosen to make the announcements in written form, rather than by coming here to announce the proposals on the Floor of the House of Commons.

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker.

That will have an impact on hundreds, if not thousands, of employees. Surely, rather than announcing such important changes at a press conference in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State should have come to this Chamber to allow the Members of Parliament elected by the people of Northern Ireland and other right hon. and hon.

This is quite wrong, and I hope that you agree, Mr. Speaker, that the Secretary of State should have come to this House to make these announcements.

To my surprise, this afternoon the Press Association carries a story that the Minister responsible for defence procurement, Lord Drayson, has held a press briefing providing a partial interpretation of the forthcoming NAO report.

Please will you use your best offices&#151;I know that you will&#151;to ensure that statements of importance to Members are made in the House and not outside?

 I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. All information should come to the House; it should not go to television studios or reporters.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the British Nationality Act 1981 to enable citizens of the Republic of Ireland resident in the Untied Kingdom to register as British subjects.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_45">The Bill will offer people born in the Republic of Ireland after 1949 who have associations with the United Kingdom through residency some of the rights that are currently given to those born before 1949. It will provide political, practical and symbolic recognition of those affected and will allow them to join and to be treated in all other regards as British subjects. That end is achieved by amending the British Nationality Act 1981. There will be a requirement that anyone applying to register as a British subject under the provision swear an oath of allegiance to the Crown, as provided in schedule 5 of the 1981 Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_46">It is not easy to estimate the number of people who would wish to avail themselves of that scheme, but the 2001 census for Northern Ireland provides some evidence. Its figures show that the number of people born in the Republic of Ireland, but now resident in Northern Ireland, is around 40,000, though it does not indicate how many of them were born before 1949 or give any indication of the number who might wish to avail themselves of the provision. In the Northern Ireland Westminster parliamentary constituencies, the number of people born in the Republic of Ireland ranges significantly, from less than 1,000 in one instance to more than 5,000 at the other extreme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_47">There is a long history to these matters, Mr. Speaker, dating way back to the Act of Union 1801 and perhaps long before it. For present purposes, Members will be content to note that I will confine myself to the last century in general and the last 50 years or so in particular. I will point out that there is already a scheme in place for those people in this position who were born before 1949.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-09_para9">
<a name="stpa_48">The law as it stands makes provision for anyone born before 1949 in the Republic of Ireland with associations with the UK&#151;as defined in the 1981 Act&#151;to become a British subject. Indeed, we have the ludicrous position whereby those born in Northern Ireland who consider themselves Irish, though they have never lived in the Irish Republic or voted in an Irish election or paid Irish taxes, can avail themselves of an Irish passport by a straightforward process of completing an application form and enclosing the fee, yet those born a few miles across the border in the Republic since 1949, having lived in the UK for many years, having voted in UK elections and having paid UK taxes, cannot avail themselves of a British passport without going through the cumbersome procedure of applying for what is known as naturalisation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-09_para10">
<a name="stpa_49">It is impossible to understand the issue without fully appreciating the relationships between all the people who live within the British Isles. Just a few weeks ago, we remembered those who have died in various conflicts, including the first world war. At that time, many born in what is now the Republic of Ireland fought as British soldiers in the British Army. As I have already explained, the law reflects their circumstances, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1387</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>as they were obviously born before 1949. It is those born after that arbitrary date, some of whom were descendants of those soldiers, who are denied the same option.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-09_para11">
<a name="stpa_50">The last few decades have inevitably focused on events in Northern Ireland and the history of our Province. There has not been much focus on the history of the Republic of Ireland since partition. One is inevitably driven to generalities when dealing with such matters. For example, in the 1920s, the drawing of the boundary between what is now Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was not without contention. Some areas with a significant Protestant or Unionist population were not included in Northern Ireland. The reduction in the number of Protestants living in the Republic from 1921 to today is also a matter of historical fact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-09_para12">
<a name="stpa_51">The reasons why that has been the case are a matter for another day, but quite a number of those people have moved to Northern Ireland. As I have explained, if those who moved were born before 1949, they are already catered for, but many born in the Republic of Ireland after that date will be able to benefit from the Bill. These people, aged 56 and under, are indistinguishable in every respect from other British citizens in Northern Ireland&#151;except in their formal nationality. As a result, they travel on Irish passports and are legally regarded as citizens of the Republic of Ireland, despite many of them regarding themselves as British. To qualify for British citizenship on another basis&#151;if such is available to them&#151;they are required to undergo the lengthy process that I outlined earlier.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-09_para13">
<a name="stpa_52">I mention only in passing the approach taken by the Republic of Ireland to those who are born in Northern Ireland. Under article 1(vi) of the British-Irish agreement&#151;the treaty section of the Belfast agreement&#151;anyone born in Northern Ireland has the right to identify themselves as Irish or British or both, as they so choose; it is a matter for them. They also have the right to be regarded as Irish citizens. This allows me, living in Northern Ireland, to regard myself as an Irish citizen if I so wish, yet some of my neighbours&#151;those born, for example, in County Donegal in the 1950s and 1960s, but who have lived in the United Kingdom for almost all their lives&#151;cannot currently become British subjects without some inconvenience and additional cost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-09_para14">
<a name="stpa_53">I do not believe it too much of an assumption to accept that the majority of those in Northern Ireland who would wish to benefit from this change in legislation are from the Unionist tradition, but it would of course be open to all to whom it applied. None the less, since I raised this issue publicly in Northern Ireland, there has been no opposition to the provisions. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how anyone could oppose this anomaly&#039;s being resolved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-09_para15">
<a name="stpa_54">This Bill is important not just in a symbolic, but in a very practical, way. It is important to these individuals that they be recognised as subjects in the country in which they live, contribute, vote and pay taxes.

<p><a name="st_44"><a name="51122-10_spnew0"><b> Mr. Eric Forth  (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con):</b> 
 I am very unhappy about this proposal. It carries with it a number of very important assumptions and implications with which I am certainly not prepared to go along at this stage; it needs a lot of further debate. The first assumption is the casual one that the good folk of Ireland should continue to have special privileges in this country that others do not have. Of course, Ireland is a proud member of the European Union, as, indeed, is this country&#151;for the time being. That suggests that for fairness and even-handedness, we should treat Ireland in exactly the same way as we treat other EU member states: no better and no worse. This constant demand for special treatment for Ireland strikes me as anomalous, to say the least. If the Irish want their country to be treated as a sovereign nation within the EU, they should surely accept the responsibilities that go with that. So there is a basic problem with this proposition that we have to face up to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_55">I turn to another difficulty. The hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell) made some play of the fact that the naturalisation process is extremely difficult, arduous and strenuous. I do not think that that is so, but if it is, it is properly the case. Surely British citizenship is a privilege that should be somewhat arduous and difficult, rather than casual and easy, for people of any other nationality to obtain. So the idea that we make the privilege of British citizenship very simple and easy to get strikes me as odd. We should move in the other direction instead, given the problems that we face with people coming from other countries to this country. If, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, they come to live here for a long time, pay taxes and so on, there is a process open to them whereby they may apply to become British citizens, and it is a perfectly proper and correct process. I hope that that process is retained. Indeed, I could easily be persuaded that it should be made somewhat more difficult, rather than easier.

<br>
That this House is extremely concerned that the Government is failing to tackle welfare reform despite promises to do so; recognises that the pensions system is in crisis; notes that the Prime Minister believes the Child Support Agency is not suited to carry out the task that it has been given; believes that the New Deal has failed to deliver; notes that 116,000 more people are claiming incapacity benefit than in 1997 despite the Government&#039;s pledge to reduce the number; is deeply disturbed that the Incapacity Benefit Green Paper, which was due to be published in the summer and then the autumn, will not now be published until January; believes that this is due to continuing conflict between the Prime Minister and the Department for Work and Pensions on the desired content of the Paper; and calls on the Government finally to deal with the increasingly urgent need for welfare reform, for the benefit of users of the system and all taxpayers.
<br>



<p><a name="st_49">My first, and very pleasant, duty is to welcome the new Secretary of State to his responsibilities. I am getting rather good at this, as only six months ago I welcomed his predecessor, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). The right hon. Gentleman is no less than the fourth person to occupy the role in just over 12 months. The Prime Minister had better get careful: to lose one Secretary of State is a misfortune, to lose two is clearly carelessness, but to lose three suggests a degree of serial incompetence in 10 Downing street. In part, that explains some of the incoherence that we are experiencing in welfare policy.</p>





<p><a name="st_50">Of course, we wish the new Secretary of State well. I hope that he will not mind if I borrow a phrase from pension language and say that he will find his Department rather difficult to handle, with very few direct benefits for him. He will expect to make most of the contributions and will find that a difficult task. One of the questions on which we will judge his performance is whether he can live up to his predecessor, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside. Despite his other failings, he was a big beast and could hold out against 10 Downing street when that was appropriate. The Secretary of State does not yet have that reputation, and we wait with interest to see whether he can earn it.</p>





<p><a name="st_51">Welfare reform is an appropriate subject for debate today. When they first came to office in 1997, the Government chose to adopt it as one of the major issues on which they would be judged. It was one of the great themes of that election, but the Prime Minister essentially fell at the first hurdle. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) was appointed as the Minister in charge of welfare and invited to think the unthinkable. However, he was out of government within a year, and never emerged again.</p>





<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1390</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


<p><a name="st_52">That was our first evidence that, on welfare reform and many other issues, the Prime Minister is very powerful when it comes to rhetoric, but very poor when it comes to delivery.</p>

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51122-10_spnew3"><b> Sir Malcolm Rifkind: </b> 
 I will in a moment. The Prime Minister likes to give the impression that he leads from the front but, on a great many issues, he prefers to go for public opinion when the going gets tough. In effect, he tells people, &quot;Tell me where you wish to go, in order that I might lead you.&quot;
</p>





<p><a name="st_55"><a name="51122-10_spnew4"><b> Ed Balls: </b> 
 In 1997, the Government introduced the new deal, which has reduced unemployment in my constituency by 80 per cent. and helped 550 single parents into work. Why does the right hon. and learned Gentleman want to abolish the new deal? Is that a coherent policy?
</p>





<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51122-10_spnew5"><b> Sir Malcolm Rifkind: </b> 
 Like the hon. Gentleman, we know that most jobs offered under the new deal are not permanent. It has not had the impact that had been hoped for, and a powerful argument for using the private and voluntary sectors to find jobs is that they tend to offer long-term or permanent employment.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_58">On so many issues, at the first sign of difficulty, the Prime Minister tries to distance himself from the policy of his own Government. Only last week, the Prime Minister dropped broad hints at the Dispatch Box that he was enthusiastic about the suggestion that the Child Support Agency should be abolished&#151;he knows the low esteem in which it is held by the public. But of course, soon after the Prime Minister left the Chamber, No. 10 Downing street and the Department for Work and Pensions were asked for confirmation of the policy, and we then heard the magic word, &quot;clarification&quot;. That made it clear that there was no intent to abolish the CSA. There was no new policy on the CSA: the Prime Minister simply wished to make a short-term impact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_59">The same thing happened with the deal that was done between the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the public sector trade unions. The Prime Minister let it be known how unhappy he was with the deal that had been made, as if somehow it had nothing to do with him. His attitude was, &quot;Forgive me, I&#039;m only the Prime Minister. I can&#039;t be expected to be held responsible for deals made by my Government.&quot; But we know that that deal has been enormously damaged by the Government&#039;s attempt to argue that the rest of the population should work longer and retire later while

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman probably knows that areas in my constituency&#151;Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taff&#151;saw the rolling out of the pathways to work pilots. It is right to say that since the Government have been in power the number of incapacity benefit claimants has risen from 2.6 million to just over 2.7 million. However, will the right hon. and learned Gentleman confirm that if the trend established under the Conservatives had continued, the increase would have been from 2.6 million to 4 million? This Government have tightened up the system and helped people back into work under the pathways to work pilot.

Of course, when one introduces such improvements, there is an initial high take-up, but that should be welcomed because it improves the wellbeing of our fellow citizens. However, the Government cannot rest on that case. When they came to office in 1997, they said that the number claiming&#151;the hon.

 No. The hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_64">The situation is even more alarming than that. The biggest increase in that overall total is in the number of people who have been claiming IB for stress or depression, subjects that by their nature are far more difficult to prove or disprove and where general practitioners have the greatest difficulty in establishing the reliability of the claim. The figure was 592,000 in 1997, but it is now more than 1 million, a 39 per cent. increase. That is the mark of the Government&#039;s failure.

 I appreciate the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s generosity in giving way again on that point. He did not accept my figure of 4 million if the Conservative policy had continued, but will he accept that since 1997 the Government have succeeded in tightening up the gateway so that although people already on incapacity benefit will, as part of our policy, be increasingly well protected, the trend for people going on to incapacity benefit is downwards? That was certainly not happening under the Conservatives.
</p>





<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51122-11_spnew9"><b> Sir Malcolm Rifkind: </b> 
 Only the hon.

That is a matter on which we will have to agree to differ.

<a name="51122-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_65">By the Government&#039;s own standards, they have failed over the past eight years. There has been a remarkable collapse. Each year, Ministers have to say the same thing. In 1997, they were saying that a million people needed to be found jobs and in 2004, after they had already been in office for seven years, there were still a million people who needed to be found jobs. Only last year, the Secretary of State&#039;s predecessor found yet another million people who still had to be found jobs, yet nothing has happened and that is typical of the Government&#039;s approach.

 I was interested to hear the right hon. and learned Gentleman say that he was proud to have introduced incapacity benefit. The reason for reform is that the benefit itself has put barriers in the way of disabled people who want to get back into work. How can he be proud of that?

 I understand why hon. Gentlemen wish to deflect me, but they will not succeed.

We were told then that there would be a Green Paper&#151;seemingly it had to be a Green Paper, but at least it would be published in the summer&#151;and that remained the Government&#039;s position.

So we must now assume that it is highly likely that it will be 2009, not 2008, before the proposals are implemented. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the Secretary of State can possibly bear to listen to the debate, he might like to consider whether the date is still 2008, or whether, as a result of the six-month delay in the publication of the Green Paper, 2009 is a more credible date from the Government&#039;s point of view.

Since 1997, we have taken forward a programme of radical reform of our welfare state. First and foremost, we have provided much more effective help for people looking for work through the new deal.

<a name="stpa_105">When the Opposition were in power their policies meant that unemployment reached 3 million and there was a 300 per cent. increase in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit. Between 1979 and 1997, the number of people on incapacity benefit trebled from 700,000 to 2.6 million&#151;the equivalent of 2,000 extra claimants every single week. The Conservatives&#039; dismal record of incompetence and failure wrecked families and communities the length and breadth of the country. They managed the extraordinary feat of creating 3 million unemployed not once but twice during their period of office&#151;a unique achievement in 20th-century history&#151;not that they cared very much about it. The right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), whose own contribution was to add 1 million to the unemployment figures as Employment Secretary was quoted as saying that &quot;unemployment never matters&quot;. He will soon have the opportunity to reflect on the accuracy of his observation.

He is a lawyer, and he should know the importance of studying evidence and drawing conclusions from it. Let me put my evidence to him. There are now more people in jobs than ever before&#151;2.3 million more than in 1997. Unemployment is at its lowest level for nearly 30 years, with long-term youth unemployment 90 per cent. lower than in 1997. With almost three quarters of the working-age population in work, our employment rate is the highest of any of the G8 countries. The right hon. and learned Gentleman, not surprisingly, failed to mention any of those facts. I suspect the hon.

It is a menu of support tailored to the needs of the individual, focused on the right to work as the best route out of poverty, and balanced by a clear set of responsibilities on the individual seeking benefit.

Because of the measures that we have taken, there are now nearly 1 million lone parents in work and the numbers of lone parents on income support have fallen by more than 200,000 since 1997. When the Conservative party was in power, lone parents were stigmatised rather than supported.

The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 lounged&#151;that is the only description for it&#151;on the statute book.

 I am explicitly answering the right hon. and learned Gentleman. The territory that the Green Paper will occupy is that which we mapped out in the manifesto and our five-year plan.

<a name="51122-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_126">We are now experiencing progress in helping people off incapacity benefit, with new cases down by a third since 1997 and, as I said, the first falls in the total count&#151;down by 41,000. However, we have to accept the need to modernise the way in which we deliver our services. That is why we have sought improvements in the service that Jobcentre Plus provides.

<a name="51122-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_127">Jobcentre Plus helps almost 3,000 people into jobs every working day. It does that against a background of a major efficiency exercise. It has reduced its staff from around 86,000 in March 2002 to 74,000 in March 2005 and is on course to reduce the total number of staff employed to 65,650 by March 2008.

<a name="stpa_128">Ninety-seven per cent. of our customers are now being paid their entitlement by direct debit. That move to direct payment will save the taxpayer more than &#163;1 billion over the next five years. Centralised pensions centres provide a new telephone-based service, which is designed around the needs of today&#039;s 11 million pensioners. One year ahead of schedule, the Pension Service has already achieved the target of 2.1 million pensioners in receipt of the guarantee element of pension credit by 2006. Taken with our other measures to help pensioners, including winter fuel payments, free TV licences for the over-75s and the pension credit&#151;all of which Opposition Members opposed&#151;the average pensioner household is now &#163;1,400 a year better off compared with the 1997 system, with the poorest third on average &#163;1,900 better off.

Will the Secretary of State guarantee that, in expecting people to take responsibility, the Government will continue to contribute the correct amount of resources, and all the additional advisers and rehabilitation staff who are required so that the pilots are not perceived to be a cost-cutting exercise, but continue to be a genuine method of getting people who can work back into work?

 Of course we shall do that. There are a couple of important issues that need to be tackled head on in this reform programme. One is that we need to restore the confidence of people with a disability or an illness coming into the benefit system that they will be able to work again soon. About 90 per cent. of people who receive incapacity benefit expect to be able to get back into work soon. Sadly, however, the present system does not ensure that that happens, and we need to tackle that problem head on. That will be at the core of the proposals in the Green Paper.

Every Monday since I took on my portfolio in May, I have come to work expecting an announcement from this Secretary of State or his predecessor. We are still waiting for an announcement, but it seems possible that the only welfare reform issue on which we shall hear any detailed news about the development of Government policy before the end of the year will be the one that the Government have contracted to an outside agency, the Turner commission.

It is not an easy portfolio, but is one of the most important in the Government, not only because it has a larger budget than any other Department, but because it impacts on all our constituents in many different ways.

The issue of pensions policy is particularly relevant there.

<p>
<a name="51122-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_143">I hope that the Secretary State will take a keen interest in the tax credits system, even though it is not directly his responsibility. Since 1997, an increasing degree of influence or even control over the Department for Work and Pensions has come from the Treasury. If I may say so, the Treasury A-team has turned up today in the shape of the hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls), who is no longer in his place, and the hon. Members for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband) and for Dudley, North (Mr. Austin). I hope that that shows the degree of interrelationship between the two Departments and it may also suggest that the Treasury is continuing to do what it has done since 1997&#151;keep a close eye and a short leash on Secretaries of State for Work and Pensions.

<a name="51122-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_144">I hope that the Secretary of State will, in looking at the development of the benefits system, reflect on whether it has really been sensible to transfer responsibility for so much of the means-tested benefit budget away from his Department to the Treasury? In particular, has it been right to put the administration of means-tested benefits for children and for people in work outside the Department for Work and Pensions, which is well used to dealing with that low-income client group, and making it a Treasury responsibility? Frankly, what I have heard in my constituency from people who work in the Secretary of State&#039;s Jobcentre Plus offices, is that that has been immensely unhelpful to the joined-up nature of the benefits system. It has not been helpful for tax credits and other benefits to be sitting in two different Departments. It has not been helpful for claimants&#039; understanding of their entitlements and it has not been helpful for people trying to get back into employment. It has not helped the understanding of the interaction of different benefits.

Labour Members, who are committed to dealing with poverty, should be willing to listen and to address these criticisms. They will be aware from their

I hope that the Secretary of State can liaise with the Treasury on whether these tax credits are sitting in the right place, and use his special position to continue to lobby the Treasury to make the changes necessary to protect the interests of those on very low incomes. That includes not automatically withdrawing tax credits before such people have had a chance to establish whether the overpayments were due to official error&#151;the ombudsman herself has been very critical of that&#151;and considering whether this volatile system is the right way to help such people, or whether we should go back to fixed awards, which would create greater stability. So far, however, the Treasury has shown no willingness to do that.

 I must say that I agree with every word that the hon. Gentleman has said.

They do not want it sitting in their bank account, given the obvious temptation, but they are encountering a great deal of intransigence on the part of the authorities, who seem not to want to reclaim that money immediately.

However, they were contacted six or nine months down the line and told that there had indeed been an overpayment. Of course, by that stage the Inland Revenue is already recovering the money automatically. When the recovery takes place in-year, there is no protection of people&#039;s income in the way that the money is withdrawn. That is causing a lot of problems for people on low incomes.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Member for Kensington and Chelsea, perhaps because of his party&#039;s connection with this debacle&#151;is the problem with the Child Support Agency. Since its introduction in 1993, its operation has been a disaster. Given that we have known that it was failing for a long time, and given that the Prime Minister acknowledged that it was a mess back in 1998, it is surely astonishing that nothing has been done to make the system work more effectively. As a result, billions of pounds in maintenance due to some of the poorest families in the country has not been paid, and an unbelievable backlog of a third of a million cases are sitting in the CSA. Indeed, 80,000 of them have been sitting there for more than two and a half years without being processed. That demonstrates not only that the CSA has been a failure since it was established, but that it continues to be so. It is managing to collect only &#163;1.85 for every pound spent on administering the system. In countries such as Australia, the collection rate is approximately &#163;8 for every pound spent.

It seems as if the Prime Minister was making up policy on the hoof in this area, as he seems to have done since 1998. That is why it is particularly important that there be an early opportunity for the Secretary of State to introduce proposals that tackle these problems, which have existed for many years, in a fundamental way, rather than simply seeking to gloss over them.

Secondly, there are simple administrative failings. That is staggering, given how long the CSA has been around and the number of attempts that must surely have been made to reform the system. I was astonished to be told a few weeks ago by an expert on the CSA that there is currently no obligation on non-resident parents to notify the CSA of a change of job or of address.

In fairness to the CSA, the hard core of cases that it is trying to deal with involve some of the most difficult families in the country in terms not only of their willingness or otherwise to make the assessed maintenance payments, but of the number of changes in their circumstances. That argues for introducing a simple system and&#151;to us&#151;for folding the CSA into the Inland Revenue, so that it can use the large amount of information that the Revenue already holds on people&#039;s incomes. It probably also argues for greater use of deduction at source from the earnings of those who are unwilling to pay, which is the Australian approach. The Australian deduction-of-earnings-at-source rate is about twice the UK&#039;s. As a constituency MP, I am often amazed by the reticence of the CSA to put deduction-of-earnings orders in place, despite the fact that people are often not willing to meet their maintenance liabilities.

 I am somewhat confused about Liberal Democrat policy in respect of the CSA. The party used to favour returning that agency&#039;s responsibilities to the courts, but the hon. Gentleman seems to be proposing that they should be handed over to the Inland Revenue, even though he has spent a large chunk of his speech criticising that agency for its failure to deliver on tax credits. Alternatively, is he just going to tinker at the edges of the problem? After what he has said, I am totally confused about where his party stands.

 Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?
</p>





<p><a name="st_163"><a name="51122-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Laws: </b> 
 No. I am going to press on and deal with a couple of other issues, as time is short. I hope that reform of the CSA will be an early priority for the Secretary of State, and that he will undertake to make a statement about it to the House of Commons rather than simply to the Select Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_150">The two other issues that I want to mention are reform of the pension system, and reform of incapacity benefit. I do not expect much information on pensions from the Secretary of State as he is entitled to say that he is waiting for the report of Lord Turner&#039;s commission. The leaks to various media sources about the contents of that report seem relatively authoritative, but we will see whether they turn out to be as accurate as most people assume. When he responds to the announcement next week of the commission&#039;s final conclusion, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not try to give answers to all the points that are raised. We do not expect that of him, but we do expect him to give a signal on two issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_151">First, I hope that the Secretary of State will give us an indication as to whether he accepts what seems to be the consensus outside Parliament, and among the three commissioners&#151;that the increasing reliance on a complex, means-tested pension system is unsustainable over the long term. I hope that he will make it clear that, even if means testing has been necessary as a way of targeting money on poor pensioners in the short term, he will move away from it in favour of a simpler state pension system that will incentivise private saving over the long term.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_152">The Secretary of State will also have to address the question of fairness in the public and private sectors. If the leaks about Lord Turner&#039;s report are accurate, it is likely that he will suggest an increase in the state pension age to 67 or 69. It would therefore appear very odd for the Government to sign off on a deal with public sector workers that would allow them&#151;even those who have not even joined the public sector yet&#151;to continue to retire at the age of 60 for a number of years after the introduction of Lord Turner&#039;s proposal to set the state pension age at 67. I hope that the Secretary of State will acknowledge that it may be necessary to return to the issue of public sector pensions reform. The office of the Prime Minister seemed to do as much in comments made to <i>The Times</i> in recent days. The matter needs to be looked at more in a more fundamental way. It is possible that a second independent report will need to be commissioned&#151;not necessarily to be compiled by Lord Turner&#151;on the future sustainability of the pension system.

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="51122-19_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, and I know that other hon. Members want to speak, but I am very struck by his request that we revisit the deal on public sector pensions. The hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_165"><a name="51122-19_spnew3"><b> Mr. Laws: </b> 
 The Secretary of State will know that the view among Liberal Democrat Front-Bench Members has been perfectly consistent, and that we have criticised the deals struck by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. If he wants to enlighten us in this debate, will the right hon. Gentleman say whether he thinks that the deal that the Government have struck with some major public sector unions has been helpful to him, and to Lord Turner&#039;s commission, in moving the debate forward on this key issue?
</p>

We will find out then whether his views are in line with those of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, or whether they are more in line with those of the Prime Minister. The latter seems to be very unhappy with the deal that has been struck.
</p>





<p><a name="st_166"><a name="51122-19_spnew4"><b> Adam Afriyie  (Windsor) (Con):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern that the complexity of applying for tax credits and benefits, and of making claims to the CSA&#151;all of which requires long forms to be filled in&#151;deters the least well off and most vulnerable people in society, who often suffer from dyslexia and similar learning difficulties?
</p>





<p><a name="st_167"><a name="51122-19_spnew5"><b> Mr. Laws: </b> 
 I agree precisely on that point. One of the challenges for the Government, and for all political parties, is to simplify the tax and benefits system. A couple of weeks ago, a person came to one of my advice centres from whom a total of between &#163;4,000 and &#163;5,000 in tax credits was being reclaimed. He had learning difficulties, and had been put in a work placement. He had no understanding of how the tax credits system worked, and was therefore facing a very unfair recovery process. Moreover, Government policy is very ambiguous about whether he would be required to repay that money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_154">Finally, I turn to the question of incapacity benefit reform. We welcome the Government&#039;s intention to look at the matter seriously. Over the past 20 years, there has been a turnaround in the number of people on unemployment benefit and incapacity benefit. In the early 1980s, between 2 million and 3 million people claimed unemployment benefit, and very many fewer claimed incapacity benefit. The change since then has been enormous, and the number of people on incapacity benefit is now between 2.6 million and 2.7 million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_155">Clearly, that is extremely wasteful for the economy, but it is often very undesirable for the people involved as well. As the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea noted, the Government have said for eight years that a million people on incapacity benefit want to get back into employment. The fact that that figure of a million people has been used year after year underlines the lack of an effective policy so far to change the system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_156">We believe that the Pathways process helps people to get back into employment. I have visited the Pathways centre in my Yeovil constituency and it seems to be working well so far, although relevant statistics are fairly modest, as the system has been in operation for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1418</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>only a limited period. However, we hope that the Secretary of State will be willing to fund the Pathways process across the country, and that he will not come under pressure to deliver savings in a way that could damage incapacity benefit reform. Such savings might be achieved by time limiting payments or by turning a portion of the payments into vouchers, but they would hit a very vulnerable group of people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_157">Although some people on incapacity benefit would like to work, are capable of doing so and would be helped by the Pathways process, I hope that the Secretary of State has got the message that some very vulnerable people&#151;whose conditions are often difficult to detect&#151;are very worried about the proposals that the Government might bring forward. They are keen to get an assurance that their position and vulnerability will not be threatened by a precipitate attempt to secure savings to fund the Pathways process.

<p>
<a name="51122-19_para8">

</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_159">Debates such as this are an opportunity to probe the Opposition. As Opposition Members have spent the past two months touring the country and the television studios with the tale of two Davids, this could be a useful debate. I recently had a glimpse of one David, the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), giving a speech in Birmingham, in which he attacked the Labour party&#039;s approach to welfare. He told us that his vision for the future promises a huge expansion of the voluntary sector. I do not know whether that was a code for cuts, but I was a bit disturbed when he went on to say what he thinks the sick, the unemployed and the disabled need. Apparently, they do not need the new deal, access to work or pathway-to-work pilots. No, according to him they need the confidence&#151;note the confidence, not the money&#151;to buy a new suit. Well, maybe old Etonians whose confidence has taken a bit of a knock need a quick shopping spree and all is okay, but that is not my experience of how we need to deal with some of the hard problems we face today. To parody that speech a little, I could point out that the hon. Gentleman also commented on Labour&#039;s DNA in our approach to welfare. It is my view that it is the Tories&#039; DNA that characterises their approach to welfare. They simply despise the welfare state, as we have heard again today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_160">We know what kind of Britain the Tories want. In the past, their Britain was a place where mass unemployment was a price worth paying. They trumpeted it. They declared war on every British shipyard worker, steel

It means tearing apart the very bonds of family and community that give society its cohesion. So when I hear Opposition Members accuse us of incoherence or incompetence, I wonder whether they have changed at all.

<a name="stpa_161">I know that the highest concentrations of people on incapacity benefit are densely clustered in areas of disadvantage in once proud industrial and manufacturing towns, and I know that the record rises in claims in those areas occurred during the period when the Opposition were in power, because of their cynical manipulation of the unemployment figures. The party that today thinks that it can point accusing fingers at us would like the public to forget the fact that the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) was once responsible for managing unemployment. Those were the days when GPs signed off healthy men on long-term sickness because their jobs were gone and no one on the other side of the House had any intention of doing anything else for them.

<a name="stpa_164">I think that we have a good track record. Only yesterday, the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire), announced a further &#163;2.6 million for 13 choice and control pilot schemes across the country, which are designed to give older and disabled people more power over the services they use and control over their social care budgets. It is the same approach of putting the individual first that we need to demonstrate with incapacity benefit. We need to make it clear at the outset that disability does not mean &quot;cannot work&quot;. I recall a young man at a place where I worked some years ago. He had a severe sight problem, but with the benefit of an enlarged screen he had no difficulty working with computers. He had been out of work for many years&#151;in fact, I think that it was his first job. He loved it. He loved being useful. That is the spirit that we should seek to engender.

<a name="stpa_165">We need to consider why some people are unable to enter the employment market. I understand that the current incapacity benefit claim form has only one page related to mental health. There are many stress conditions that mean people find particular work environments difficult. I have a friend who had a serious breakdown some years ago and has not worked for a long time. Recently, he started part-time on one of the pathway projects. He told me that he was enjoying it immensely and his confidence was returning. He was grateful for the support that he had received; he was working in an environment where he felt safe and could make a contribution. He is better off under the financial arrangements that we have put in place, and he has an incentive to do well. We need to provide more such help. We need a strong link between the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions to help people get back to work. The choice and control pilots pool the resources and efforts of those two Departments and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, and the same approach is needed to welfare reform.

We need a sliding scale of benefit, with protections built into the system that guarantee that we will look after such people.

<a name="stpa_181">As I have indicated, there is much opposition to the Prime Minister&#039;s radical thinking on welfare. We may have to support his ideas; who knows? However, we know that the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) resigned his position rather than implement radical reform as dictated by No 10. We also know that when the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was Secretary of State for Work and Pensions he fought a pitched battle&#151;he won that one&#151;to rule out the time-limiting of incapacity benefit from the strategic five-year review that he published.

<a name="stpa_182">We have already heard from our Front Bench about the delays in the Green Paper. First, the Prime Minister said that it would be published before the summer recess. Then, the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, who is in the Chamber, said that it would be published later in 2005. Finally, last week, the Prime Minister said that it would be published some time in January. We might think that we needed no more evidence, but there is more to come. We know that the Secretary of State for International Development did not want to take the job of Secretary of State for Work and Pensions because he knew that he was on to a loser. He would have had to defend and argue for radical reform that his own side could not stomach. Perhaps most depressing of all for the Prime Minister&#151;it really shows that he is beleaguered&#151;is that he cannot even install his No. 10 hawk on welfare policy, Mr. Gareth Davies&#151;the gentleman who wrote the memo to which I referred&#151;as a director in the DWP serving the Secretary of State, due to opposition from the civil service. As was widely reported in the<i> Financial Times</i> and elsewhere, Sir Richard Mottram, the permanent secretary, blocked the appointment of Mr. Davies. One of the newspapers reported:
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_185">The reason why the Government have placed such a consistently strong emphasis on welfare reform is that the inherited system of benefits led to the most appalling social exclusion. Welfare is, by definition, for the poorest and the most vulnerable, but welfare should also be about well-being, and for most people, work is still 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1424</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the best route to both. Work is how we build our self-esteem, learn more skills and self-reliance and develop our social life. It is something that every Member of the House takes for granted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_186">Labour&#039;s welfare reform agenda is about helping those who want to find work find a good job, but it is also about giving extra support to those who cannot work. We have had a consistent, targeted and tested welfare agenda since 1997, with a range of successful new deal programmes. A welfare system cannot be tinkered with, but nor can it sustain massive overnight change, which I think that the Opposition have asked for. But I think everybody agrees that our welfare system must change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_187">A person who has been claiming incapacity benefit for over two years is more likely to die or retire than to work again, ever. That is so wrong, and that is why we must reform our incapacity benefit system. Not just as a Government but as a society, we should be ensuring that everyone has the opportunities that we have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_188">The vast majority of people claiming incapacity benefit would like to return to work, but the current system is stacked against them. Once on incapacity benefit, there is no expectation that an individual will look for work, even if it would help to improve their condition. The system that we have inherited means that 2.8 million people have effectively been consigned to a life of poverty and lack of opportunity. That is not just a criminal waste of talent; it is a crime against equal opportunities. Unfortunately, we still live in a society that does not give everyone the same chances&#151;a society that still discriminates against sick and disabled people. It is no surprise that having a serious health condition is a barrier to work, so it is no surprise that benefit claimants have real problems getting a job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_189">Our ongoing welfare reforms, of which the reform of incapacity benefit is a vital part, have been targeted and tested in those parts of the country where benefits claims are the highest. Derbyshire was one of the three initial pathways to work pilots, and covers the constituency that I represent. The pilot was introduced in 2003, through Jobcentre Plus, and I shall go into a bit of detail about this because I have heard a lot today that has demonstrated that the Opposition are not too clear in their minds about the details of pathways to work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_190">Pathways to work is aimed at cutting the number of people moving on to incapacity benefit in the first place, as well as moving people who are already on benefit into work. I apologise in advance for all the jargon that I shall use now, but it is part of pathways to work. Through work-focused interviews, using specially trained personal advisers and a varied choices package, a claimant can access professional and tailored information, advice, guidance and support. The choices package is really important, because it recognises that claimants have a range of different barriers to work. People are being helped to manage their conditions by working with primary care trusts and GPs, and they are given suitable training to ensure that they are ready for jobs. This condition management programme is arguably the most imaginative and successful part of pathways to work. It recognises that an individual&#039;s condition is what initially brought them on to incapacity benefit, but it also recognises that work is sometimes the best way of dealing with a deteriorating illness.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1425</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_191">Fundamentally, the pathways to work programme is such a success because it focuses on what people are able to achieve rather than writing them off as incapacitated. There are hundreds of stories to illustrate that. When people who have been off work because of sickness for many years arrive reluctantly for their first work-focused interviews, they are nervous and lacking in self-confidence, but they are being given the chance to rebuild their self-esteem through condition management and work, and they have the feeling that their life is being given back to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para16">
<a name="stpa_192">To get even more parochial, at the start of the pathways to work pilot in Derbyshire, the Staveley neighbourhood management project commissioned the Derbyshire unemployed workers centre to carry out a study of barriers to employment. Staveley had a long history of coal mining and heavy manufacturing, which used to make up the majority of the work. The pit closures and the loss of manufacturing continue to have a devastating impact on employment in the area. Many of those people in Staveley who are now long-term incapacity benefit claimants would have been usefully employed in light duties when we still had a mining industry in North-East Derbyshire. There is no mystery behind the high number of people claiming incapacity benefit, as there is no mystery behind the high crime levels and poor health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para17">
<a name="stpa_193">The unemployed workers centre&#039;s study is a very small study of about 10,000 people, but interestingly, it reflects absolutely what is happening nationally. The vast majority of people want to go back to work and the vast majority of them have welcomed the pathways to work pilot. Most people who had claimed incapacity benefit before the start of the pathways to work pilot had received no help from employment services. Now those same people welcomed work-focused interviews with Jobcentre Plus and looked forward to a return to work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para18">
<a name="stpa_194">Every month, Jobcentre Plus personal advisers in Derbyshire interview about 700 incapacity benefit claimants. These figures are small but they are really significant. Of those 700 people, 150 find work every month. This is not scratching the surface; this is real success, and the feedback is positive not just from those who are being helped off benefits and into work&#151;advisers and employers are massively enthusiastic about being involved in these pilots.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para19">
<a name="stpa_195">One of the really exciting developments in Derbyshire is the pathways agreement with Tesco, which is offering tasters and in-work support to benefits claimants. If we can roll out to the rest of the country not just the pathways to work models but the enthusiasm that comes with them, we shall be taking a huge step towards greater social inclusion and greater equality. This is the right direction for welfare reform. It is not a punitive agenda designed to force people into work; it is a positive agenda, which helps people to stay in work and allows them to develop themselves and improve their economic circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para20">
<a name="stpa_196">To conclude, I want to point out again that our welfare reforms have been ongoing, they have been targeted and they have been coherent since 1997. We have tried wherever possible to break down barriers to work. We have recognised that health does not have to be a barrier to working. Over 3 million people with long-term illness or disability are at the moment in work. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1426</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Work and well-being are two sides of the same coin. Our welfare system must be flexible to suit changing needs, but it must provide opportunities for people to work and greater support for those who cannot work. Our Labour Government&#039;s answer is to make policy to suit individual need. Pathways to work, which has been rolled out to a third of the country, has demonstrated that a personal advice strategy to help people into work has meant that twice as many people leave benefits and find jobs as before. Most important, they are staying in those jobs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-21_para21">
<a name="stpa_197">The Opposition day motion calls upon the Government to deal with the increasingly urgent need for welfare reform. We are reforming welfare, and we have been doing so since 1997. I hope that after this debate the Opposition will support us both in our progress and our successes to date.

<p><a name="st_186"><a name="51122-22_spnew0"><b> Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory  (Wells) (Con):</b> 
 We called this debate in our own time with the aim of giving the Government an opportunity of clarifying and explaining their own policy, and we did so in a genuine spirit of inquiry on behalf of many millions of claimants, who want to know what the Government mean by reform. The hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) said that the Government are in a continuous reform programme. All I can say is that we have not noticed that. The windy rhetoric that accompanied the first election victory of the Labour Government has simply not been carried into practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_198">Again, in this short debate many questions have been raised and almost no answers have been provided, so I do hope that when the Minister gets to her feet to wind up the debate she will start to give us some hard answers to some of the hard questions that we have asked&#151;not least by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), who in an excellent short speech asked, in effect, which side is the Department on: the Prime Minister&#039;s, or Back Benchers&#039;&#151;or perhaps its own side? That triangulation is going on between different bits of the Government and the Labour party, and it is profoundly damaging to any real or genuine reform.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_199">For instance, we have not got to the bottom of the incredible shrinking Green Paper on welfare reform, which the Prime Minister promised immediately after the election. In fact, I think that it was the first promise that he made in May this year. He said that the Green Paper would be produced by the new Secretary of State by July this year. I join other hon. Members in welcoming the new Secretary of State to his position, but I hope that, despite the fantastic turnover of Secretaries of State in the Department for Work and Pensions, he will survive long enough to see the publication of his own Green Paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_200">The victims of the continuing confusion and delay are not just successive Secretaries of State and Ministers, but more importantly, the benefit claimants themselves who are trying to grapple with a system of increasing complexity that is not only beyond their own comprehension, but very often a bafflement to those whose job it is to administer the system. The National Audit Office made some observations on that only earlier this month. It pointed out that the very 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1427</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>complexity of the system is itself an inducement to fraud, because those who are administering the system are trying to process vast quantities of information, often of a very personal kind, and&#151;in the language of the NAO report&#151;that
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;may persuade some people that fraud is a risk worth taking.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_201">We need a massive simplification programme as part of the reform, but we know that benefit claimants are not part of the debate at all. The real dynamic is between No. 10&#151;the Prime Minister and the policy unit&#151;on one side and the Department on the other. The Prime Minister generally cries, &quot;Forward.&quot; The Department cries, &quot;Back.&quot;

 May I take the right hon. Gentleman to a point of substance in the debate: the nature of the pathways to work programme? Earlier, the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) said that the programme did not apply to existing claimants. In fact&#151;I have checked this&#151;11,000 existing claimants have volunteered for the programme, and from February 2005, the programme has been applied to more existing claimants. Will the right hon. Gentleman correct the record on that point?

 No. The hon. Gentleman is making a mistake. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) was referring to the Green Paper programme, which will not apply&#151;at least initially&#151;to existing claimants, but only to new ones. Of course the pathways to work programme, to which he was not referring, applies to new claimants. That is a simple category mistake, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to refer to the <i>Official Report.</i>

<a name="51122-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_202">What we had in February this year was a five-year plan. Despite its rather Stalinist title, it gave us some indication of how the Government wish to split incapacity benefit in two: one benefit more appropriate for those who will never work, and other benefit to become a pathway back into the world of work. We did not agree with all the substance in the February paper, but it was at least reasonably specific and somewhat detailed. So imagine our surprise when, on 7 October this year, we went back to what are called the &quot;Principles of Welfare Reform&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_203">Remarkably, in eight months, the Government have gone from fairly specific proposals to very general principles. The world was rather surprised that the new policy on welfare reform was summed up in various phrases. That document says:

We want to know how the Government want to put those principles into action. Will they still pursue the split in incapacity benefit in the way that they set out back in February? We also want to know what has happened to the promised review of housing benefit. That has not been mentioned in the debate, but in the Queen&#039;s Speech, Her Majesty read out the following sentence:

<p>
<a name="51122-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_208">The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) referred to pensions. We did not hear a word on pensions from the Secretary of State, although pensions form part of both the motion and the Government&#039;s amendment. Of course the truth about pensions is that the halving of the savings ratio under the Government has dealt a body blow to the entire concept of private sector provision. The reason for that goes back, again, eight years to 1997, when in almost the Government&#039;s first fiscal action, they removed dividend tax credits from private pension funds. The Government&#039;s siphoning of money from the private sector pensions into the Treasury has gone on year after year. If the Prime Minister wants to pick a fight with a Department, I suggest that he should do so not with the Department for Work and Pensions, but with the Treasury and the Chancellor, because that is where the damage to pensions has been done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_209">In 1997, our pensions system was an acknowledged international success. We had more private sector pensions under management than the rest of Europe put together. That fact has been alluded many times by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and other hon. Members of all parties. That policy is now in ruins. Instead, the Chancellor&#039;s contribution to welfare reform&#151;and his main legacy from the Treasury&#151;will be a vast extension of means testing. Again, that has been alluded to in the debate. Almost half of all pensioners are now subject to means testing and the proportion is increasing. So the Treasury is responsible for not only the policy, but the shambolic administration of child and pension credits, as we know from our surgeries and advice centres, and the developing, unresolved mess that that is producing.

<a name="stpa_216">The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) got a lot wrong. I think that he would not take interventions because he did not want to be corrected, so I would like to correct one point for the record. People who move from benefits into work have the entitlement to come back on to that benefit level. Indeed, we are extending the time for that to two years from April 2006 so that we can deal with the insecurity that some people feel.

 Will the Minister take an intervention in the interests of correction?

 It is always a pleasure to listen to the Minister&#151;I say that in all seriousness&#151;but we are entitled to be clear about the historical record. Is she saying that she was misquoted by <i>The Herald</i> in Glasgow in so far as she was alleged to have said

<p>
<a name="51122-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_218">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) on her passionate and strong speech. She pointed out the importance of work to individuals and the way in which work and well-being are two sides of the same coin. She showed a proper understanding of the issues and the way in which we can bring down the number of people on incapacity benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_219">I agree with the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) about simplification of the benefit system. We are attempting to do that day in, day out, whereas when his party was in government it failed even to think about the measurement of fraud. The Conservatives never measured fraud, let alone took action to reduce it, whereas we have done that successfully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_220">Let me put on record the fact that the right hon. Gentleman and his party are wrong to suggest that existing benefit claimants cannot take advantage of the opportunities in the pathways to work pilots&#151;they can, they do, and they are returning to work. It is absolute nonsense to suggest that we are not talking to interested groups about welfare reform. The Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire), and I have done that. Indeed, our new Secretary of State has already visited several groups that would be affected by the proposals that we shall put before the House and the country when we publish our Green Paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_221">The debate has given us the facts with which to judge which political party is fit to tackle welfare reform. The simple fact is that we are completely divided&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> No, we are completely divided across political parties on the reasons behind the programme of welfare reform and the purpose of it&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps Conservative Members should listen to this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_222">Labour Members are committed to our agenda because we see it as a means through which we can unlock opportunity for all so that all can find jobs and individuals can support themselves and their families, realise their potential, enjoy the sense of purpose and self-worth that comes with work and develop a network of friends and companions. We are committed to our agenda because we recognise it as a means of eradicating poverty from British communities and British society. We are committed to our agenda because we understand that by realising individual potential, we can build a stronger economy in the more competitive global environment in which we have to live.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_223">For the Conservative party, the agenda is benefit cuts to finance tax cuts. It is about fostering individual greed at the expense of wider interests and needs. Compassionate conservatism is about dismantling the active welfare state and destroying the support and opportunities that we in government have created. The Conservatives&#039; policies in government created dependency, chaos, incoherence and despair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_224">The words of the Opposition motion give us a clear indication of their incoherence and direction of travel, whereas the Government&#039;s record on welfare reform is one of which we are immensely proud. The challenges that we face in the immediate and long term are complex and important, but the platform that we have built is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>strong, the values that inform our approach are right, and the task of translating those values into programmes is one we welcome and on which we shall deliver. The truth is that the Conservative party has not just lost the argument, it has lost the plot.

<a name="stpa_232">My purpose in launching the debate is to engage in an inquiry. I want to try to understand what I genuinely do not fully understand&#151;whether there is the basis for cross-party consensus. That depends on the answer to the question: what is it that the Prime Minister and other Ministers have been saying over the past few months, and what is the position that they take? I say that in a spirit of genuine inquiry, as I think will become evident in the remainder of my remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_233">There are three questions that need to be examined. The first is the relationship between carbon reduction and economic growth; the second is the relationship between targets and technology; and the third is the relationship between UK actions and global actions.

<a name="stpa_234">It is in relation to the three issues that the recent statements by the Prime Minister and other Ministers cause the inquiring mind to ask where exactly the Government are headed. Are they headed in a direction that can create the basis for the cross-party consensus that we seek?

<a name="51122-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_235">I shall start with a pessimistic interpretation of those remarks and move on to an optimistic interpretation. I hope that that will set the scene for the Minister to cast light on where we are as a country and as a group of people engaged in a seminal political discussion. The pessimistic interpretation has been offered by some of the lobby groups and it is this: that the meaning behind, and perhaps to some extent in, the Prime Minister&#039;s recent statements is that the Kyoto process is dead, that domestic targets will largely be abandoned hereafter, that it is impossible to combine economic growth and serious and binding international and national targets, and that we should therefore do what we can to promote technological solutions that help to alleviate the amount of carbon being produced, engage in activities such as emissions trading, express aspirations and hope for the best. I think that I have given a more or less accurate summary of what the pessimists assert is the meaning of the Government&#039;s actions.

<p>
<a name="51122-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_236">I am loth to come to the conclusion that those are the meanings behind what has been said, and much that has been said does not fit with that interpretation. There is a basis for hoping that that is not what the Government mean. Yes, I have read various articles and it is difficult to know which means what. I shall now put the optimistic interpretation, and if the Minister in his response can give us a clear idea where the Government stand, that will be an enormous step forward.

Does he agree that one of the reasons why Kyoto is dead is because of the United States, yet it is the United States that probably has the most to offer in providing technological expertise and investment, which will help us in the long term to achieve the sort of consensus that he seeks?

<p><a name="st_226"><a name="51122-26_spnew4"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has mistaken my meaning. I am not saying that the Kyoto process is dead; I do not believe that the Kyoto process is dead; and I am not even sure whether the Prime Minister thinks that the Kyoto process is dead. I was trying to say that on a pessimistic interpretation of what the Prime Minister said, one might have thought&#151;some of the green lobby have concluded that this is what he thinks&#151;that the Kyoto process is dead.

<p>
<a name="51122-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_237">Bringing the United States, China and India into the process is critical, and technology is an enormously important component in doing so, and it is also true that the United States is a significant contributor to bringing technology into the process. This is my question: does the Prime Minister believe that Kyoto and binding targets are dead, because they are not consistent with economic growth and hence cannot bring in China and India&#151;and, while we are at it, Brazil and Russia? The pessimistic interpretation is that is what he believes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_238">Turning to the optimistic interpretation, I hope that the Prime Minister and the Government recognise that a combination of growth, energy security and carbon reduction is needed&#151;I am fairly confident that the Government believe that; I certainly believe that; and I expect that the hon.

We have got over the idea that there is a choice&#151;in my view, it is a false choice&#151;and I think that the Government have, too, between growth and energy security on the one side and carbon reduction on the other.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_239">If it is true that the Government have got over that false dichotomy, this is the next question: do they also agree that we must recognise that neither the UK alone nor even the EU can make a significant difference to the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and hence to prospects for climate change? I am fairly certain that the Government accept that proposition because it is, after all, a matter of fact. Returning to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway), I think and hope that the Prime Minister&#039;s remarks should be interpreted as meaning that the way to bring China, India and the US to the table is to identify technologies that will enable those countries to combine economic progress and growth with the reduction of carbon.

 Like the right hon. Gentleman, I hope that we can reach an agreement in this House that will last for many years.

 I do not think that that is fair. I have spent the better part of my political life fighting off Liberal Democrats who were trying to take my seat, so I have some experience of their campaigning techniques. It is not only Liberal Democrats and the Labour party, but Conservatives&#151;this will always be true of all parties and all politicians&#151;who respond to a considerable degree to local circumstance and to concerns other than those about climate change. We must all understand that each and every one of the technologies that the hon. Member for Sherwood and I believe need to be brought forward have constraints, some of which are environmental constraints. There is a continuous tension between each technology and something. In some cases, the tension is between a technology and a resource; in some cases, it is between a technology and the economics of the situation; and in some cases, it is between a technology and the environmental consequences for the landscape or cityscape. We should not deride one another across the House if we exhibit some of those tensions, which are an inevitable part of democratic politics.

 Are not targets without the means to achieve them dangerous, because they provide an illusion of progress that is not followed through on the ground? We all know that with rising worldwide energy use, the only realistic way of meeting the threat of climate change is a nuclear power programme. All else is sophistry, illusion and wishful thinking. Is that not the consensus that we should be building worldwide?

<p><a name="st_238"><a name="51122-27_spnew7"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend and I do not wholly agree, although I agree with a large part of his remarks. We will not make progress simply by having targets or even by translating those targets into market incentives. We will make progress only if the market incentives are then translated into action in the form of technologies that work, that combine energy security with carbon reduction, and that allow economic growth. One of those technologies may very well be nuclear. However, the existing nuclear power stations constitute a reduction of about 5 per cent. in our total carbon output. The entirety of our electricity supply industry constitutes only about 40 per cent. of our carbon production. Very much wider steps will need to be taken than merely on one particular type of plant, be it nuclear 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1444</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>or otherwise, in this country and elsewhere. Whether we consider the power sector and carbon sequestration, disaggregated power sector, microgeneration, and energy efficiency in the home, vehicles and the substitution of traditional engines by hybrids and biofuels, or air travel and what we do to constrain the emissions from that, we are considering a vastly wider range than the &quot;nuclear or not nuclear&quot; debate has allowed for.

<a name="stpa_240">I would say to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) that I fear that the Prime Minister&#039;s habitual brilliance in highlighting particular items in order to carry the political day has led him to overstretch the importance of nuclear power and the debate around it because he believes that that will allow us not to focus on the many other things that are, in many cases, very much more difficult to achieve.

 The right hon. Gentleman says that there are wide-ranging solutions to the host of issues that we face. Surely one of those issues must be the fact that billions of tonnes of coal reside in this country, giving us an edge against many of our European competitors and linking the economy with how we deal with climate change. Carbon capture is an extremely important area, and we should not throw it out of the discussion.

 I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman, just as I agreed with my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells that nuclear may be an important component. Carbon sequestration or capture may well play a huge part, not only in this country but in China and India, because undoubtedly coal stations will need to be built in great number. Of course, it is not yet a well-established technology, but we all have high hopes that it will become so and that it will become affordable.

Very few people believe that improving the cladding in roofs is a controversial measure. I suspect that very few people would think it wrong for someone to have a dish-sized windmill on their house, although one currently has to apply for planning permission for one of those but not for a dish, which is rather an oddity. We must ensure that the structures that we create bring forward the lowest-cost solutions that are compatible with achieving the carbon targets. Only then do we have to start arguing about the fine detail of whether there are particular technological solutions that for some reason or other some people cannot stomach.

We disagree with so much of its approach to climate change, but it has directed billions of federal dollars into the hydrogen economy. The brain drain that that is causing from other areas around the world into US universities is striking. Does he have any ideas on how we can encourage that sort of research to come back into the UK?

 My hon. Friend makes a very good point. In fact, the United States as a whole has been making huge advances, not only in carbon reduction but in measures to help carbon reduction hereafter. Many of those have been at state level, but some have been at federal level. What my hon. Friend says is abundantly true. Billions have been invested in forward-looking activities such as trying to promote carbon capture and, as he says, the hydrogen economy. We should be grateful to the United States for investing that money and making that effort. I agree that it would be good if we, too, were to participate in that endeavour.

 In all fairness, that argument is advanced often and there is some truth in it. When the United States alone accounts for 25 per cent. of global emissions, it is essential to engage with it and get it to take action. It is also true that while India and China do not have to have legally binding targets under the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in the Kyoto protocol, they are enormous emitters. Their emissions have been increasing year after year. It is precisely for those reasons that the Prime Minister has been considering the way in which we can engage countries such as India, China and the United States, and especially how we can get India and China to do more when they will not accept binding targets.

If the Minister is now telling me that achieving the 20 per cent. is not possible&#151;I warned him that it would be difficult&#151;will he understand that we shall keep him to it? It may be a voluntary target, but if this country does not manage to meet it, the rest of world will believe that we have let it down on the most important issue that confronts us.

It is why we have the climate change review, which we will publish in due course. That will give some indication of the additional steps that we intend to take to move us towards the 20 per cent. target.

The climate change agreements that go with the levy have already saved 4.6 million tonnes of carbon up to 2002. This Government introduced the world&#039;s first national carbon trading scheme. We also introduced company car tax reforms in 2004 that changed the whole focus on company cars, which account for the biggest share of the new car market. Instead of giving tax discounts on the number of miles travelled, we now give them according to a car&#039;s emissions. That represents a big change and it has had a big impact on sales.

<a name="stpa_256">The round table for G8 Energy and Environment Ministers was the first of its kind and was very successful. We hosted a major international science conference at the Hadley centre in February, which informed some of the sceptics&#151;who, I am glad to say, are becoming fewer and fewer&#151;about the science of climate change. Under our EU presidency, we held an informal Agriculture and Environment Ministers&#039; council on climate change. Such a council had never been convened before. Under our presidency, an EU-China summit was held that led to an agreement with China on the pioneering and developing of clean coal technology. Of course, the Chinese will use their coal because they have huge coal reserves. Then there was the EU-India agreement. We talked to India about renewables and about the possibility of co-operating with India on, in particular, the clean development mechanism. There was also an EU-Russia agreement, which was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping). It was agreed that Russia should become the next president of the G8 and that energy efficiency would become one of its key themes. We have been involved in important international work.

 I understand that earth observation and environmental monitoring were important subjects at the G8 summit and that the UK emphasised their importance. A decision on the global monitoring for environment and security satellite is due in December, and DEFRA is the lead Department when it comes to that important decision at the ministerial meeting on the European Space Agency. Rumour has it that the UK will put in a paltry &#163;2 million, although we really need to put in &#163;11 million if we are to hold our own in the international community. If the rumour is correct, will the Minister immediately go back to the Department and think about investing the &#163;11 million that British industry and the sector really need?

 The Minister must know that we are not opposed to wind energy. As a matter of fact and as I said earlier, we are not opposed to any particular form of energy. Each form of energy poses constraints and problems, and it has to be looked at case by case. Of course we are in favour of allowing local communities a degree of discretion to decide where these things are suitable and where they are not, but that is not the same as being opposed to wind energy. The Minister&#039;s own Government support a system of planning precisely because they accept that there are such constraints. I do not believe that there is much between us on wind energy and certainly not enough to justify not having a consensus on the overall framework.

<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1455</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in a debate on wind energy that was initiated by the official Opposition, some Conservative Front-Bench Members frankly painted a picture of wind energy as generally akin to supping with the devil or having the anti-Christ on our fields. I am not quite clear whether that is the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s or his party&#039;s position, but it certainly needs to be clarified. The right hon. Gentleman also supports the scrapping of the climate change levy, but it has made an enormous contribution to reducing energy consumption in this country and we do not see how scrapping that levy makes a contribution to fighting climate change. Finally, although I do not levy the charge against the right hon. Gentleman, who I have not heard commenting on the matter, every time that there is a dispute about fuel prices and we have demonstrators on the streets, official Conservative spokespeople jump on the bandwagon and demand that the Government cave in immediately to the demonstrators by cutting fuel duty and fuel taxes. Again, that is not an area of consensus between us.

: The point about the fuel protest illustrates precisely why we need cross-party collaboration on these issues&#151;in order to prevent that sort of opportunism, which any Opposition party will be tempted to engage in when life gets tough.

The Prime Minister&#039;s views were more than clarified in the recent article in <i>The Independent</i>, which I highly recommend to all Members who want to know where the Prime Minister stands on targets and binding commitments. It is all spelled out in great detail. The right hon. Gentleman read that article, but was still keen to quote not what the Prime Minister said, but what people who claimed to be saying what the Prime Minister said&#151;because it suited their particular agenda. We have to do better than that. Rather than ignoring fact and repeating fantasies, people who want clarification are free to ask for it. That is the spirit of consensus.

There are real difficulties in turning around the current trend of emissions, but I believe that it can be done. It is false to claim that it is an argument about technology versus targets; we need both.

He undoubtedly did show such signs, but as the Minister rightly says, an article in <i>The Independent</i> has hopefully put that fear to bed. If the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has managed to bring the Prime Minister back on board, that is all to the good, but international agreement cannot be achieved at any price.

But I do not regard that as sufficient. Further action has to be taken, as the Minister probably admits privately. The reality, however, is that he and his colleagues will be reluctant to go further in case the national papers produce headlines such as, &quot;Government hit airline travellers&quot;, or &quot;Blair puts &#163;25 on your air ticket&quot;.

 Of course we, as politicians, have to take into account certain consequences, but it is not simply a question of that so far as aviation taxes are concerned. The question is: what is the most effective fiscal measure? Some charter airlines have imposed a &#163;20 fuel surcharge, but it has had not the slightest effect on passenger numbers. I do not doubt that, theoretically, people could be priced out of the market, but rationing travel on the basis of who is rich enough to pay for pollution does not accord with social equity.

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that many of the taxes proposed to deal with carbon emissions would be rather regressive and hit poorer people harder than others? In that context, does he support the concept of domestic tradable quotas, the subject of my private Member&#039;s Bill last year? Under the system, which offers a way to deal with the problem in a progressive manner, people have a carbon cap and are allowed to trade their carbon allocations.

It has the attraction of being liberal&#151;with both a small &quot;l&quot; and a big &quot;L&quot;&#151;in that it allows people to limit carbon emissions by their personal actions. It gives them choices, and at the same time information about what those choices are.

<a name="stpa_272">For example, the system means that people would be given information on their airline tickets about the number of rail journeys that would be equivalent to their flight.

<a name="stpa_273">The empowerment of individuals generally is important. Personal carbon allowances are one option, but the personal production of energy is another. Why do we have to have an energy system based on huge units&#151;nuclear or coal-fired power stations, or even wind farms&#151;that are situated miles away from centres of population? Why not have decentralised energy, so that people can have a say about what they use? That was the burden of the private Member&#039;s Bill introduced last year by the hon.

 The honest answer is that there is a lot more work to do on the proposal. We are moving towards taking radical measures to tackle climate change. A number of economists have suggested the carbon allowances approach: implementing the allowances could

They give the impression that no politicians of any party, including those in the Government, have anything to say about it. I, for one, am fed up with reports on the &quot;Today&quot; programme or stories in the broadsheets that go into great detail about horrendous and apocalyptic things going on in the world but which contain no comment from any politician. That means that no Minister is put on the spot and asked what is being done about the subject of the story, and the opinions of Members of Parliament are not sought either.

<a name="stpa_275">What should we do about policies that, collectively, are failing to deliver domestically the reaction to climate change that we need? The motion has been tabled by both Conservative and Liberal Democrats Members, and follows on from earlier debates and initiatives undertaken by myself and the right hon. Member for West Dorset. It wants to deal with the problem of climate change by putting it higher on the agenda, and telling the media that the story is political as well as simply scientific. It is designed to make it easier for the Minister and the good guys in government to argue with people who are perhaps less enlightened in other Departments, such as the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I hope that it will also help the Government to take difficult decisions in the knowledge that they will not be exploited for narrow party reasons.

 Only one Opposition Member has mentioned the biggest contribution we could make on climate change&#151;nuclear power. The Liberals have a principled opposition to nuclear power, but countries such as China and South Africa are going nuclear, even though they have massive coal stocks, because they realise that nuclear is the cleanest form of power.

 I do not agree that it is the cleanest source, and we could have a long debate about nuclear energy&#151;as we doubtless will in due course.

<a name="stpa_277">We will have the argument about nuclear power later, but that subject brings me to the issue of consensus. Last time we had a debate on climate change, I was asked how I could possibly want to do business with the Conservatives when their position on the climate change levy is so dreadful. Indeed, the Minister mentioned that today. Let me make it plain. I do not share all the Conservatives&#039; views on the environment, and they do not share mine or those of my colleagues. That is not a requirement. We are not entering a coalition or seeking to agree every dot and comma for a joint Administration. We are setting off down the road and seeing how far we can get with a common policy. At some point, we will fork off and go in different directions&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I said, &quot;Fork off&quot;! However, it makes sense to go as far down the road together as we can&#151;and I include the Government&#151;instead of picking on differences and saying, &quot;Well, you&#039;re in a different party so we are going to find a reason to disagree with you. We will pick some council that has done something unhelpful and make an issue of that, instead of trying to address the issues of climate change.&quot; That is not the response that members of the public want to hear. They want a proper, concerted response that proves that MPs are taking climate change seriously. That requires a different approach from us.

We may not agree on nuclear power as a solution&#151;that is quite possible, as we shall probably soon find out. However, if we appear to disagree on climate change, that sends out damaging signals.

That is an example of consensus going wrong. In Sweden, there was cross-party consensus on that subject, and consensus among the media, including broadcasters, and the people rejected it. In fact it was anticipated that they would reject it, despite the great sense that the establishment supported it.

 It is widely accepted&#151;the debate has confirmed it&#151;that the Government so far have a pretty good record on climate change. We played a significant role in securing the Kyoto protocol in December 1997. We chaired the European Council in 1998 that produced agreement on the allocation of carbon reduction targets among all EU member states. We then produced a programme for countering climate change that was probably the most detailed and extensive of any country in the world. It is fair to say that we have been consistently proactive and effective in international negotiations to push the climate change agenda. We have been one of the only two or three countries in the

</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_298">A few months ago, British officials started lobbying in Brussels to try to persuade other EU countries that the successor regime to be implemented after Kyoto ends in 2012 should contain no targets or time scales. That is of course what President Bush wants, but it would defenestrate the entire global effort to stop and reverse global warming.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_299">Then, a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister stated at a private conference in New York that the way to deal with climate change was not through the Kyoto mechanisms, but by more research and development in improved technology, as has been referred to. In other words, it should be business as usual, but with more scientific ingenuity to try to lessen the catastrophic consequences. I profoundly disagree with that approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_300">If the world is to achieve the exceedingly exacting target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions not just by 5 per cent., as Kyoto requires, but by 60 per cent. by 2050, which scientists say is necessary to reverse global warming, a post-Kyoto international treaty that lacks targets, time scales and mechanisms is, to be honest, hardly worth the paper on which it is written. If that is the line that we are now taking as the presidency of the EU at the Montreal conference of parties, which is starting next week&#151;I hope that I am wrong&#151;it is a seriously retrograde step.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_301">We will never solve the problem through business as usual plus merely improved technology. Welcome and useful though that new technology may be, we will do so only if we remove the causes of climate change: the burning of fossil fuels. To those such as the Prime Minister who seem to fear that that will inhibit economic growth&#151;there has been a good deal of discussion about that in this debate&#151;I say that helping developing countries to do that via the clean-development mechanism, which was specifically put into the Kyoto protocol, will not dumb down economic growth. It will increase the opening up of vast new international markets for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

<a name="stpa_302">That worrying shift in strategy&#151;there have been some confusing signals, so I am not absolutely clear about the policy&#151;is now beginning to seep into other more specific areas of policy. Over the summer, the national allocation plan targets that set out the carbon dioxide limits that are allowed for each industrial sector were increased by the Government, in one case above the levels already agreed by the EU Commission, as a result, of course, of industrial lobbying. I believe that I am right in saying that we are still intending to take the Commission to court in order to force it to accept that 3 per cent. increase. I hope that I am wrong, but if I am not, we should think about that again.

Even with recent slippages, largely because of the shift from gas back to coal, we are still on track to achieve at least a 14 per cent. reduction. However, we are not doing considerably better, as many of us would like, because of the reasons that I have spelled out and, importantly, because we have made glacial progress in promoting renewables. The Minister is nodding, and I am sure that he agrees with me.

On current trends, we will fall well short of the 10,000 MW target for combined heat and power by 2010, and we have not made any commitment to the EU goal of 20 per cent. renewables by 2020. It has even been proposed&#151;I hope that the Minister will say that this is wrong&#151;that the funding support for the burgeoning solar industry should be largely withdrawn. The Prime Minister appears to be gearing up to renege on the energy White Paper of February 2003, which was produced by his own Government and proposed no new nuclear build and a major switch to renewables. He is doing so despite the enormous downsides of nuclear, which is more expensive than wind power, coal and gas and which, over the past 50 years, has accumulated taxpayer liabilities of no less than &#163;56 billion according to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. It generates colossal amounts of waste&#151;10,000 tonnes at present, and 0.5 million tonnes according to the Department of Trade and Industry at the end of the century&#151;which Governments have tried, genuinely but fruitlessly, to dispose of. Nuclear plants create a major terrorist risk. They are surrounded in every case, studies show, by cancer and leukaemia clusters. The risk, however small&#151;I am sure that it is very small&#151;of a catastrophic nuclear accident can never be ruled out entirely.

<a name="stpa_308">I am not seeking to knock nuclear, but simply wish to make the point that we do not need it. As an offshore island, we have enormous wind power capacity which we have not tapped. Experts, however, have calculated that it is sufficient to provide our entire electricity requirement four to six times over. We need to be much more determined in our pursuit of carbon reduction policies across the piece, and I shall end by suggesting a few.

It is ironic that in the same amendment they also   ask us to welcome the publication of a climate change programme review, which was set up in acknowledgement of the probability of failure&#151;specifically, the failure to hit the 2010 carbon dioxide reduction target that is at the heart of that claim to effective leadership. The logic is tortuous. The more honest truth is that the global challenge of climate change faces a vacuum of credible leadership, not least with the imminent departure of the Prime Minister, at the very point when we reach a critical crossroad in the run-up to 2012 and the expiry of the Kyoto treaty.

<a name="51122-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_312">The issue remains riddled with uncertainties, both in terms of risk and the cost/benefits of alternative approaches to managing that risk. It is clear that we are living a dangerous experiment with current levels of carbon concentration in our atmosphere. We are at 381 parts per million and growing, according to Sir David King, at 2 parts per million per annum. We do not know what a safe level is. The working scientific assumption is 550 parts per million, which is thought to be compatible with an increase of 2&#176; this century. Even if we could stabilise concentrations at 550 parts per million&#151;and it remains a huge &quot;if&quot;&#151;we face, in the words of Sir David King, very severe impacts around the world, leaving aside the impact on biodiversity.

<p>
<a name="51122-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_313">The scale and pace of these impacts are uncertain, but the message from the scientific community is that the risks are rising, not falling. The political response to the challenge to date has been the pursuit of international treaties to impose a top-down interventionist centralising solution. We should be honest and recognise that that has failed. Fifteen years of political effort went into producing the Rio agreement and the Kyoto treaty. They are milestones of a sort, but on a journey that has not taken us very far in controlling emissions or incentivising the technology breakthroughs that offer our best chance. They represent a vessel holed below the waterline by the absence of the big polluters&#151;the USA and the emerging giants.

As has been pointed out in numerous interventions from the Opposition Benches, the most urgent priority must be to minimise the carbon intensity of industrial development in China, India and Brazil. If we do not, we will find ourselves locked quickly into an even higher level of carbon concentrations. The solution, as the Prime Minister knows, lies in technology. That technology is increasingly available, whether it be micro-generation, solar, wind or new generation nuclear power, clean coal or hybrid cars, but it is relatively expensive.

<p><a name="st_330"><a name="51122-36_spnew0"><b> Colin Challen: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman and I both serve on the Environmental Audit Committee. Sir David King told us last week that the target for reductions by 2050 is closer to 80 per cent. than 60 per cent., which shows us that the task is urgent. Does he agree that the necessary technologies must be brought on stream now and not in 10 or 15 years&#039; time?
</p>





<p><a name="st_331"><a name="51122-36_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hurd: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has anticipated my second point, which is key: how can we accelerate the development and deployment of those technologies to make them more affordable? Why should we expect countries such as China to pay a premium for their basic infrastructure as they develop? The response of Governments must surely focus on this question: what can we do to accelerate the deployment, development and sharing of technology? That makes not only environmental sense, but commercial sense, because it is in our interests to grow those markets, which is a point that is not lost on the French. I did not hear anything in the Minister&#039;s remarks to suggest that the Government are any clearer on how to accelerate and share the technology.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_316">As has been said, a further priority must be to establish a framework for an agreement post-2012, which is do-able and would bind the big polluters into a common objective. As most people know, the challenge lies in reconciling the objectives of countries at different stages of development, and there is no shortage of ideas on the table&#151;for example, the ideas set out by the international climate change taskforce make good reading.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_318">My third point does not come up often enough in these debates. An urgent priority for Governments must be to support a sustained effort to reduce scientific uncertainty on the impacts and correlations between emissions growth and temperature increase. We desperately need the debate to be framed by more certainty, and an urgent role for Governments is to support that scientific process.

<a name="stpa_319">The fourth priority, which has been raised throughout the debate, is the urgent need to engage consumers and businesses, who will be agents of sustainable change. Arguably, that is the greatest political failure of the past 15 years. The key argument to win is that it is in the world interest to reduce the carbon intensity of our development. The chance of a stable climate with less pollution is not the only prize. Reduced dependence on the major producers of fossil fuels should mean greater energy security, which is a big issue for the United States and a growing issue for Britain. The law of supply and demand means that fossil fuels will become more expensive, and it is therefore in our economic interest to develop a cost-effective alternative.

<a name="stpa_320">Last but by no means least, the development of low-carbon technology will create a new global market that can help to drive more sustainable economic growth.

<a name="stpa_322">What is Britain&#039;s role? We have an opportunity to show the world that it is possible to reduce carbon emissions without sacrificing growth, but we must put our house in order because emissions have risen since 1997, and we are undermining the argument. When one engages with non-governmental organisations or submissions to Committees, it is clear that we could do so much more. Sonning common cries out for solar panels.

<a name="stpa_323">There is much more room for the Government to send clearer market signals to consumers, businesses and investors about policy direction in terms of what kind of energy mix we want and the desire to grow markets for cleaner cars and cleaner fuels. They should set a much better example in terms of the standards that we expect from manufacturers of cars, electrical appliances and new homes. The Environmental Audit Committee produced a report that showed the Government&#039;s deficiencies in setting standards for public procurement.

In the next decade, we will face four interconnected crises relating to climate change&#151;crises of food security, water management, energy security and insurability. To emphasise the scale of the latter crisis, it has been calculated that this summer&#039;s girls&#039; night out between the hurricanes of Wilma, Rita and Katrina has resulted in higher insurable damage than America has ever known.

He points out that if one takes the energy inputs from a power station, for every 100 inputs into the energy system, the end user has access to less than 10 per cent. One can stand in front of any power station in this country and see 60 per cent. of energy inputs going up in steam into the atmosphere. That is a colossal waste.

<p><a name="st_341"><a name="51122-37_spnew6"><b> Bill Wiggin  (Leominster) (Con):</b> 
 Many interesting comments have been made during this debate, which confirm that we have all come to see climate change as a real and dangerous threat. The debate started with my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1476</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>(Mr. Letwin), and I take my hat off to him for his efforts to achieve consensus. I am not a particularly good consensus person, which is why a lot of my speeches are made in here. My right hon. Friend, however, could not have done more or gone further to encourage the consensus that he so rightly believes in. I pay tribute to the way in which he explained the purpose of this debate, and the fact that the Prime Minister&#039;s mixed messages mean that we need to find out from the Government where we are going to get to. I also pay tribute to the way in which he explained the difficulty involved in striking a balance between economic growth and reducing carbon emissions, and between adopting UK-centric or global policies. His efforts were humbling to me; even when he talked about Liberal Democrat campaigning techniques, he was exceptionally generous. He concluded with a particularly clear understanding of what consensus would enable, and the various layers and targets that it involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_335">I felt, however, that the Minister was less than charitable&#151;uncharacteristically for him. He listed the Government&#039;s achievements, although he seemed to recognise the growing concern about climate change throughout the House following the numerous interventions. He made six points about Conservative policy. He said that he needed to know where we stood on wind energy, scrapping the climate change levy and fuel protestors. He also mentioned the Prime Minister&#039;s comments. He ended by saying that he had left the door open.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_336">At that point, the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) explained consensus in what I considered to be a helpful and constructive manner, until he spoke of &quot;forking off&quot;. I forgave him for that immediately, because I realised that he was trying to say that while we would not agree on every part of the way forward, we did agree that a way forward was essential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_337">My hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) talked about photovoltaic roofs and planning permission. He made the immortal comment that &quot;the Minister for whatever it is&quot; should acknowledge the importance of the subject. I submit that there could be no finer advocate of solar panels on behalf of his constituent. My hon. Friend had a single, practical policy, he made his case vociferously and eloquently, and I am sure that his constituent will sing his praises from her rooftop in years to come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_338">The right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) delivered all the parts of my speech that I have now abandoned. He made an important and, perhaps, a rather harsh attack on the Government, citing the lack of speed and progress on this vital issue. His was an interesting and valuable speech. He said that we did not seem to be doing enough of the right things, which is obviously a worry for all of us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_339">My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) also spoke of real worries about progress on climate change. He said, perhaps a little unfairly, that Rio and Kyoto had failed, but went on to talk about   why policies were up for review and about the    disappointment felt by non-governmental organisations. I agreed with what he said about carbon emissions from China, India and Brazil. I also agreed when he said that the solution was technological. He put his case very eloquently, especially when describing Britain as a role model for the rest of the world, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1477</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>suggesting that economic growth along with carbon reduction was the most important progress that we had achieved. He rightly pointed out that the duty of the House was constructing market frameworks rather than picking winners. He made an excellent speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_340">Last time we debated this subject, the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) described himself as a heretic. Like me, he sought no vote on the motion, which I considered helpful. He also spoke of the four apocalyptic crises that would befall us, affecting food security, water security, energy security and insurability. That tied in helpfully with an e-mail that I received today from the Association of British Insurers, which stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;we need to stop putting people, jobs and property in harm&#039;s way. A quarter of Environment Agency objections to development consents on flood risk . . . are being ignored by planning authorities . . . the houses we build now need to withstand the weather of the 2050s and later . . . flood defence investment needs to defend existing property&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_341">The ABI believes that there will be a major crisis in insurability. So the heresy of the hon. Member for Nottingham, South has become apocalyptic. I always enjoy listening to his speeches. He also made a number of constructive suggestions to help us to catch up with the rest of the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_342">I think that the scientific evidence on climate change is conclusive. In the past 30 years alone, the average temperature in August has risen by 0.3&#176; C in a decade. The subsequent warming of our planet has caused sea levels to rise by an average of 20 cm in the last century. As we have seen repeatedly and with great loss of life this summer, extreme weather events such as the hurricanes which have tormented the Gulf of Mexico are becoming far more frequent. Our ecosystems are being transformed at an unprecedented pace, and increases in ocean acidity and temperature threaten the world&#039;s diverse sea life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_343">Governments across the world have recognised the problems associated with climate change, and over the past two decades concerted efforts have been made to take action. There have been high-profile discussions at Kyoto and Rio, in which many Conservative Members past and present have been involved. We in the UK, however, cannot afford to be complacent. We should not only do more to save our own environment, but take a lead on the international stage to show countries how changes can be made successfully without slowing economic growth.

 Is my hon. Friend as convinced as I am that local authorities have a huge role to play? It is all very well looking at the international position, but local authorities and their planning decisions have, as in so much else, a huge role to play. Unfortunately, they are not yet playing it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_343"><a name="51122-38_spnew1"><b> Bill Wiggin: </b> 
 I partly agree with my hon. Friend. He will know that when it comes to recycling, the top authorities are Conservative-run. Some authorities are doing their best, but my hon. Friend is right that we could all do more. He will have heard the contributions from Labour Members, particularly on what people can do as individuals. Responsibility starts at home and can be spread through local authorities all the way to the Government and then on internationally. I agree with my hon. Friend on that.

<a name="stpa_345">It is a shame and surprising to note that the average car emissions from new cars sold in the UK in 2004 were a worrying 31.4 g per kilometre above the EU target of 140 g per kilometre by 2008. Things are clearly not going the way we want. The failure to reach our own targets would serve as a damning indictment of our efforts to tackle climate change. It is essential that we reach and surpass those targets if we are to make a difference to our own environment and set an example to others across the world. How else can we expect other countries to heed our voice on the need to fight climate change? It should be our international duty to lead, not simply to follow.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_346">On this side of the House, we do not doubt the honourable intentions of the Government to act against climate change, but we question the Government&#039;s ability to make much difference. Back in 2000, the Prime Minister announced that

<a name="51122-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_348">However well intentioned those words, they mean nothing without action. Procrastination is the adversary of success. On climate change, it is the sworn enemy of our ability to safeguard the environment as the inheritance of future generations. My greatest concern is a doubt whether, despite all the words and promises, the Government&#039;s approach to finding real solutions will be felt in years in to come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_349">We have spoken before about consensus. On this side of the House, it has already been acknowledged that climate change is an issue on which we must all fight together.

 The Minister for Climate Change and the Environment stated in his opening speech that climate change was the greatest environmental challenge that we face. There is no longer any significant doubt about the scientific basis for action, and I was pleased to hear the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) say the same. It has been recognised internationally, stimulating more action and discussion on the issue this year than ever before.

<a name="stpa_350">Impacts are felt all around us, as I can see in my role as the UK Minister responsible for biodiversity. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1479</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>(Mr. Hurd) for mentioning that in passing. Biodiversity is an excellent indicator of the effects of climate change. By the end of the century, climate change and its impacts may be the biggest cause of biodiversity loss and the change in ecosystems service globally. Over the past 50 years, humans have affected ecosystems more rapidly and more extensively than in any comparable period of human history&#151;largely to meet rapidly growing demands for food, fresh water, timber, fibre and fuel. That has resulted in a substantial loss to the diversity of life on earth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_351">Species such as the polar bear, the mountain gorilla and the river dolphin are all under real threat due to climate change. The loss of these great animals would be a tragedy in its own right, but that loss of biodiversity would also expose the human population to greater threats of disease, and to threats to our livelihoods. I commend to the House a document analysing the effect of climate change on migratory species, published last month by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It was much discussed at the conference of the parties to the convention on migratory species. Another such conference is taking place this weekend in Kenya.

We are also committed to implementing our ambitious domestic programme. The current review of the UK climate change programme, which will be published at the turn of the year, will set out how we will achieve our targets for 2010, 2012 and 2050 across Government Departments. We have seen that the economic impact of cuts in greenhouse gas emissions need not be prohibitive, so long as Governments introduce sensible policies, combined with a wide range of low-carbon technologies.

<p><a name="st_372"><a name="51122-40_spnew0"><b> Ann Winterton  (Congleton) (Con):</b> 
 The issue of Gypsies and Travellers and their need for accommodation is highly topical, and I am grateful to the House for the opportunity to raise the matter on the Floor of the House and to seek some much-needed clarification from the Government. There are two matters that concern Congleton borough council: first, demand for additional caravan sites for Gypsies in terms of their location and size; and, secondly, the stationing of caravans belonging to Gypsies and Travellers within the curtilages of the residential properties that they have purchased. At the moment, the second issue appears to be located only in one part of the borough&#151;Middlewich.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-40_para0">
<a name="stpa_369">Middlewich has approximately 30 houses owned by Gypsy families with multiple caravans compacted in their garden areas. The adopted Congleton borough local plan contains policies that relate to Gypsy caravan sites, and there are a number of criteria against which planning applications will be judged. A number of permissions have been granted for small sites, but recently there have been incidences of illegal encampments, notably at Cranage. The latter would provide enough material for another debate, but I want to focus this evening on the second issue that appears to be peculiar to Middlewich, which historically has had a number of Gypsies among its population.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-40_para1">
<a name="stpa_370">An increasing number of Middlewich residents have raised concerns about various domestic operations and activities undertaken by Gypsy families more recently settled in the town. Specifically, residents query whether those families are in breach of planning legislation by hard surfacing the whole or a major part of their gardens; by installing elaborate decorative railings; by keeping and using one or more caravans in their gardens; and by installing shower and lavatory blocks and electricity points in the gardens to facilitate living in the caravans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-40_para2">
<a name="stpa_371">For the past two years, the CW10 residents action group has been trying to establish why our local authority allows mini-caravan sites in the cartilage of dwelling houses without the need for planning permission, licence conditions such as those for health and safety, or enforcement, which are the normal requirement for any land where the intensification of use has occurred&#151;that is, where a material change of use has taken place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-40_para3">
<a name="stpa_372">The council has considered the issues and two barristers, each specialising in Gypsy-related planning law, have been consulted. Their advice is that caravans do not need planning permission if they are ancillary or incidental to the use of a dwelling house. What is incidental varies according to the particular facts of each case, and to ascertain those facts, the proper approach is to investigate and judge each case on its merits, taking into account, first, the degree to which each caravan is functionally connected with and subordinate to the use of the dwelling house. For example, to what extent do those who sleep in the caravans use facilities in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 1488</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>house? Do the caravans provide independent living accommodation or are their occupants dependent on facilities in the house, too?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-40_para4">
<a name="stpa_373">Secondly, the relative scale of accommodation available in both the dwelling house and the caravan must be taken into account. For example, caravans providing sleeping accommodation for a small overflow of family members may well have a subordinate, functional link to the main house, but may not where the caravans provide more accommodation than the house itself. Thirdly, account must be taken of the relative size of the dwelling house, its garden and the caravan. The larger the first two and the smaller the latter, the more likely it is that a subordinate, functional link exists. Fourthly, the relationship between the occupants must be taken into account. Extended family groups are more likely to share functional links.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-40_para5">
<a name="stpa_374">To help to decide whether caravans are incidental or require planning permission, enforcement officers would need to ask each family questions along the following lines. Who lives in the house? Who lives in the caravan? What is the relationship between those people? What size of rooms and what kind of facilities exist in the house and caravan, and who uses what? How are utilities such as electricity, gas, water and waste shared? Are any payments shared? Is rent paid? What are the family&#039;s intentions for the proposed use of the caravans, including time scales?
</p>

<p>

Putting a dwelling in the curtilage of another dwelling is always a material change of use and, in turn, cannot be incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house, so surely planning permission is required. Furthermore, the same group believes that an extended family member includes three generations of the same family&#151;grandparents, parents and their children&#151;but not other independent family units, such as aunts, uncles, cousins and so on.

A caravan within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse may have a number of ancillary uses for which planning permission would not be required. For example, it could be used for additional living accommodation, provided that it remained part of the same planning unit as the dwellinghouse and the unit remained in single family occupation.&quot;</p>

Above that limit, planning permission would be required, and it would be clear to all where the distinction lay.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton) on securing this debate and I hope to provide the clarification that she seeks. However, she posed some detailed questions about the legislation, which I accept were entirely appropriate, and I therefore undertake to write to her to ensure that in due course we cover all the points that she made.

The hon. Lady asked a number of detailed questions about the location of caravans in back gardens, and I shall attempt to answer them as fully as possible. However, as I said, I shall write to her in due course, because I do not think that I will cover every point that she made.

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-41_para2">
<a name="stpa_393">A caravan is not a building. Stationing one on land is not itself &quot;operational development&quot; that requires planning permission, although associated works such as the provision of infrastructure and hygiene facilities may well be. Under planning law, householders can park caravans in their gardens or driveways indefinitely, provided that no material change of use of land occurs. However, in certain circumstances, the placing of a caravan on land may change the principal use of that land, which would amount to development in the form of a material change of use of land. It is for that reason that the use of land for an occupied caravan generally requires planning permission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51122-41_para3">
<a name="stpa_394">The hon. Lady asked whether adding extra caravans would still be incidental. A householder is entitled to use caravans as extra accommodation without planning permission, provided that the occupants continue to use the house, for example, the kitchen or bathroom. If, on the other hand, a caravan is there for another purpose not incidental to the enjoyment of the main dwelling, known as the dwelling house&#151;for example, it is inhabited quite separately from, and independently of, the dwelling house&#151;planning permission for change of use of the land would, generally speaking, be required. As it would result in the creation of a new planning unit, such permission may well not be granted in a residential area. If a caravan was being used in connection with a commercial purpose, the local planning authority may decide that an unauthorised change of use of land had occurred, for which planning permission should be sought.

As I stated previously, caravans can be stationed indefinitely in someone&#039;s garden or driveway, provided that no material change to the use of land occurs. There is no legally defined limit on the number of caravans that can be stationed in gardens before planning permission is required. However, if so many caravans were stationed in the garden of a house that they ceased to be incidental to the principal use of that land, the local planning authority could require a planning application, or take enforcement action against the unauthorised change of land use.

 Can my hon. Friend deal with a point relating to the advice that the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton) mentioned in connection with extended families and their use of caravans?

The current law allows flexibility for local authorities to determine the merits of any case as to whether the stationing of a caravan or caravans constitutes development requiring planning permission.

<br>&nbsp;<br>depend on the circumstances in each particular case. For example, it would not be reasonable to require planning permission if the house was unoccupied while the owners were away on holiday and had left a caravan in the back garden. However, if a caravan was being used as the sole residence of a family and was stationed in the garden of an unoccupied house that was not used at all by the family, the local authority might consider this to be a material change of use of land, as the caravan was not ancillary to the enjoyment of the main dwelling house.

The environmental health officer is under a duty to contact other relevant agencies, including the local fire authority, if he or she believes that they need to be aware of the concentration of caravans. Local residents who are concerned should therefore contact their environmental health officer in the first instance. Finally, the term &quot;extended family&quot; is not a legal one, and it must be given its ordinary, everyday meaning. The question whether a person is covered by the term is a question of fact that needs to be determined by looking at the particular circumstances of the case.

Our aim is to reduce the tensions between Gypsies and Travellers and the settled community, and in some cases unauthorised camping can be dealt with through negotiation. However, in other cases firm and prompt action is necessary: firm action to enforce against encampments in inappropriate places; firm action to provide the right sort of authorised sites, in appropriate locations; and where people are unwilling to respect the rights of others, firm action to enforce against antisocial behaviour and environmental damage. Where persistent and repeated offences occur, action must be relentless in upholding the law.

 The hon. Lady has made some valid points. Options are available to local authorities to claim compensation from those who cause damage.

We will issue guidance on how to carry out accommodation needs assessments in due course, but in the meantime we will seek to facilitate the sharing of good practice between local authorities and other players, and we will do all that we can to help local authorities find a way to share provision.
