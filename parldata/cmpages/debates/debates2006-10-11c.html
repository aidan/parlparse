 I remind the hon.

Of course, delaying the process beyond the start of April 2007, when it is due to come into force, would put a big hole in the budget for next year. An incoming Assembly would be free to reverse the process, but it would have to find the money to keep the investment going into water and sewerage services that they desperately need. If we are not to do that by asking people to pay a fair share domestically, the money will have to come from other parts of the budget&#151;from health, education and training and skills&#151;and I do not think the people of Northern Ireland would welcome that either.</p>

Mr. Eddie McGrady (South Down) (SDLP): I would like to reiterate my total opposition to the introduction of water rates, which are already collected under the regional rate. However, the Minister&#146;s colleague wrote to me on 9 September citing Government policy in respect of rates and said:</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has to face up to a simple fact: domestic households pay in council tax and water charges about &#163;1,300 in England and Wales, &#163;1,250 in Scotland and &#163;668 in Northern Ireland. That is not sustainable if we want the investment in water and sewerage services that is needed to bring them up to the standards required. The process is a way of ensuring that people pay a fair share&#151;not more than their fair share. At the same time, we have what we call an affordability tariff&#151;help for those on lower incomes&#151;that is far more generous than anything that applies elsewhere in the United Kingdom. We should be commended for a package of measures that gives the investment we absolutely need, is fair to everyone and gives support to those on low incomes.</p>

 This matter has been under consultation since 2001. The idea that the consultation period has been shortened is absolute nonsense. The matter comes before the court tomorrow, but on the general principle the consumer council supports the introduction of water charges. It has worked with us because it recognises that, if we are to have the investment we need to bring water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland up to an acceptable level, people&#151;domestic consumers&#151;have to pay their fair share. The consumer council supports that policy. I am absolutely convinced that we have consulted properly, thoroughly and rigorously on it, and we shall not delay it any longer.</p>

 There are indeed and I welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s point. That is exactly what is happening. For example, we are seeing &#163;60 million invested in renewable energy schemes and environmental protection schemes to make Northern Ireland the leader of the green agenda in the United Kingdom. There are also 100 per cent. grants to low-income households to install solar panels on their roofs, alternative microgeneration schemes and a change in building regulations, so that, from April 2008, no new build in Northern Ireland&#151;whether it be a hospital, a school, a factory, an office or a home&#151;can proceed without microgeneration designed in from the beginning. That will contribute to the fight against climate change, as well as reduce bills.</p>

Sadly, in those two areas, money is often siphoned off when there are shortfalls within the national health service.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Although Northern Ireland has excellence at the top of our schools system, it has a very poor achievement rate down the ability ladder. What we need is everyone having opportunities in schools so that Northern Ireland can be world class. That is why I have ring-fenced funding for children and young people. For example, I have provided extra money directly to head teachers in about 400 schools in the most disadvantaged areas&#151;including the one that my hon. Friend mentioned&#151;to enable them to run breakfast and after-school clubs, providing high-quality care, so that parents can work if they wish to and children can get a better start in life.

 The hon. Gentleman makes some very fair points. I congratulate Bertha McDougall on her work to date as interim commissioner. She is doing a sterling job in reviewing these issues. As the hon. Gentleman said, she has identified a lack of co-ordination, duplication of funding arrangements and the fact that, in some cases, bureaucracy is preventing victims, through no fault of their own, from receiving what is due to them. That is the very reason why we asked her to examine the issues and the very reason why she will make proposals in December. I greatly share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s aspiration for a more focused and targeted approach to funding for victims and for people who need Government support, so that they receive it in a proper and effective way.

They do not reject the language of moving on, but they fear that they are being left in some sort of forgottenhood. Does he recognise that the promises made to victims in the Good Friday agreement have not been upheld? The Government and all the parties can do more to deliver those promises.

 Again, there is much in what my hon. Friend says that I genuinely share. Bertha McDougall, as the interim victims commissioner, is examining the possibility of bringing together individuals to look at some of the issues that deal with the past. What has happened in Northern Ireland over the past 35 years and the impact on victims and survivors has been devastating to their lives, cannot be moved on from and will always need to be remembered, but it needs to be put into a context where we offer support and accommodation to examine those issues in detail. We will very shortly introduce into the Commons an order to establish the victims commissioner permanently.

 The hon.

In respect of those who have been inactive for some time, confidence-building measures and helping them to deal with the health conditions that often keep them on incapacity benefit are vital first steps. Both interventions need to go forward together, and they will as we roll out pathways to work.</p>

 Hold on a minute. I know the Prime Minister has only a few more goes. Let us look at something else that he said. He said that any foreign national convicted of an imprisonable offence should be deported automatically. The Home Secretary is now bribing prisoners with up to &#163;2,500 to get them to go home. Whatever happened to automatic deportation?</p>

He is making sure that all those foreign prisoners can be returned as early as possible. It will obviously cost money, but in order to ensure that it happens more quickly we are making sure not that they are given a cash payment&#151;that is absolutely wrong&#151;but that we pay for their return before their sentence is completed, so that we reduce the pressure on British prisons and so that, when their sentence is completed, prisoners are returned immediately.

The Secretary of State for Health told us that this was the best year ever for the NHS. Will the Prime Minister confirm that, since then, 20,000 jobs are being cut, 80 community hospitals are under threat and 60 major hospitals face cutbacks?

 I am delighted that we have got on to the national health service. There are not 20,000 jobs going in the national health service. Since the Government came to power, there are 250,000 extra people employed in the national health service. Let me point out to the right hon. Gentleman, since he is launching a campaign on Saturday about cuts in the national health service, that his policy proposal earlier this week was for an independent commissioning board that would apparently be free to commission all services. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Nobody on the Government Front Bench is in favour of an independent commissioning board. It would be free to commission all services, and we know from the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) that there would be no limits to independent commissioning. Therefore, under the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal, if the board wished to commission maternity services, paediatric services or diagnostics from the private sector, it would be able to do so without limit. How does he put forward that policy proposal on the Monday, and then launch a campaign asking me to intervene in local decisions and provide more money at the end of the week?</p>

I will talk about the policy on the NHS, our policy and his policy, because in the end the issue for the country is who has the right policies for the future, and it is the Labour party that has made record investment in the NHS, which he voted against. It is this party that has delivered better waiting times, improved cardiac and cancer care and accident and emergency departments, and his policies would put all of that at risk, and that is why we will stick with our policies,not his.</p>

 This week, soldiers from 16 Air Assault Brigade have been returned to Colchester garrision after their dangerous deployment in Afghanistan. I am sure that the House will salute their courage and send its best wishes for recovery to those who have been injured and its condolences to the families of those who lost their lives serving their country&#151;Captain James Phillippson, Private Damien Jackson, Captain Alex Eida, Private Andrew Cutts, Corporal Bryan Budd and Corporal Mark Wright. Will the Prime Minister confirm that UK troops are in Afghanistan to help rid the world of terrorism? If that is the case, does he share my dismay that the majority of EU and NATO countries have not deployed their troops to Helmand province?</p>

 First, I join the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to the Paras and the extraordinary work that they have done in Afghanistan. It is hard for anyone to imagine the trial that they have been through or the courage with which they have met it. It is also very clear from what is happening in Helmand province that they have been successful in pushing the Taliban back. The struggle is by no means over, but it is essential that we continue with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para0"><a name="06101166000162">The hon. Gentleman is also right to say that it is important that all members of NATO should play their part. However, to be fair, Canadian and American soldiers in the area are also losing their lives, and Spain, Italy, France and Germany have all lost troops there. I was with the Finnish Prime Minister last week and I can tell the hon. Gentleman that even the relatively small contingent from Finland has lost troops there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para1"><a name="06101166000163">The situation is very difficult. We want to make sure that NATO does more, and that is what the Defence Secretary said at the meeting the other day. It is important that we all make it clear why our troops are in Afghanistan. The country was used as a training ground for al-Qaeda. It was from there that terrorism was exported and the 11 September attacks&#151;in which more British lives were lost than in any other terrorist incident&#151;were launched. If we allow Helmand province or any other parts of Afghanistan to return to the grip of the Taliban and al-Qaeda, they will yet again become a training ground for terrorism. That is why the work that our Paras did was not only immensely brave but immensely necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para2"><a name="06101166000164">Sometimes it is important that we do not merely support our troops in the obvious way by saluting their courage, but that we also have pride in the success of the work that they are doing. It is absolutely vital, for our security and for that of the whole world. We should be extremely grateful that we have men and women in our armed forces who are prepared to risk their lives and make that sacrifice.</p>

 I do not know whether you, Mr. Speaker, have ever ridden a motorbike. The closest that I ever got was when I hired a Vespa on holiday in Greece. I think that I was the only person in that country to wear a helmet, and I certainly rode considerably more slowly than any Greek person did&#151;even the octogenarian grandmothers carrying 15 chickens on the back of their bikes. However, I know that many bikers derive enormous pleasure from their motorbikes. They describe the sense of excitement and the adrenalin rush in almost ecstatic terms, saying that only a biker truly knows why a dog sticks its head out of a car window.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para3"><a name="06101166000168">I want to do nothing to undermine bikers&#146; sense of enjoyment and excitement, least of all in the Rhondda and the valleys. I know that many bikers come to the valleys because it is an enormously exciting and pleasurable place to go biking. For example, one can go over the Bwlch into the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), or over the Rhigos, or over into Llanwonno&#151;wherever one goes, there are beautiful places for biking. It is easier if one is on a motorbike rather than a pedal bike, as I know to my cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para4"><a name="06101166000169">Part of the thrill of biking is the sense of danger that is attached to it. It is true that in this country two-wheel drivers are 40 times more likely to suffer a serious injury or to die than four-wheel drivers. Some 585 motorcyclists were killed and 6,063 were seriously injured in road accidents in 2004. Motorcyclists represent only 1 per cent. of the traffic in the UK, but 19 per cent. of the deaths and serious injuries. The more we can do to enhance safety and to make sure, for instance, that drivers in their cars look out for motorbikes when they turn on to a main road, the better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para5"><a name="06101166000170">However, my Bill has nothing to do with those licensed road users. It is about the thousands of unlicensed vehicles, many of them supposedly designed to be ridden off-road. The problem is pretty simple. The law makes it clear that if a bike is driven on the road, it must be registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, taxed and insured, and have a standard number plate, proper brakes, audible warning instruments, brake lights and indicators. The exhaust must also conform and&#151;this is important&#151;must not be too loud or altered in any way. In addition, the law states that the rider must hold a driving licence for that class of vehicle and must wear an approved protective helmet. Furthermore, if the bike is used at night, it must comply with lighting regulations and have lights fitted and working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para6"><a name="06101166000171">I am sure that all Members would agree that all that is fine and dandy, but, by definition, it applies only to vehicles designed for use on the road, when they are on  <br>

the road. There is a whole other category of bikes that are not licensed because they are, in theory, designed to be used only off-road. That is where the problem begins. Every evening and every weekend in the Rhondda there are literally thousands of unlicensed, uninsured scrambler and mini-motorbikes on the road. I suspect that the Rhondda is not unique in that and that all hon. Members have experience of that phenomenon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para7"><a name="06101166000172">In theory, those bikes are only to be used on private land. In practice, they are driven over public land, bridleways and paths, private land without permission and, notably, on the road. Often, they are unsafe vehicles with poor tread and unreliable brakes because they do not have to go through an MOT. Often, they are driven by children&#151;not only under the legal age, but sometimes as young as eight, nine, 10 and 11. Often, they are driven recklessly and dangerously, and as they are often driven by children, it is difficult to expect more. Often, they ruin areas of natural beauty, digging up beautiful areas of the countryside. Often, they are fitted with so-called silencers, which actually make the vehicles louder rather than quieter&#151;something that the industry must work on. In every instance, by definition, they are not insured, so when there is an accident, the innocent party often not only has the problem of the crash, but has to face increased insurance premiums later in the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para8"><a name="06101166000173">For people in the Rhondda, that means a deafening racket reverberating around the valleys nearly every evening and every weekend. It means that pavements and roads&#151;especially, for some bizarre reason in cul-de-sacs&#151;become virtual race tracks. All too often, it means that a 10 or 11-year-old is put in charge of a lethal weapon that can go up to 60 mph. I believe that that is simply wrong. One person e-mailed me yesterday to say:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para9"><a name="06101166000174">The situation is getting worse. According to Revenue and Customs, there has been a twentyfold increase in the number of Chinese-imported mini-motorcycles coming into the UK. The number rocketed from 7,000 in 2001 to 144,000 in 2005, the last year for which figures are available. No wonder that, in Reading, 44 per cent. of all calls to the council&#146;s antisocial behaviour hotline are to do with mini-motorbikes and the noise that they create. No wonder that Kent police received 4,000 calls about them last year alone. No wonder people complain about the problem at every single PACT meeting in the Rhondda, or that my local chief superintendent, Jeff Farrar, says:</p>
<a name="61011-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="06101166001480"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the menace of scrambler motor bikes is the biggest single issue ruining people&#146;s lives in the Valleys&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para10"><a name="06101166000175">The police have tried all sorts of things. They have tried stopping all the vehicles at the areas where they regularly congregate and arresting the riders in one fell swoop. They have tried providing information about what is legal and illegal. They have tried using new on-the-spot fines legislation, which has been successful, and impounding vehicles. However, their biggest difficulty is that they are hamstrung when they see someone driving a bike illegally. They cannot give chase, because if they did and a youngster came off the bike and was injured, it would be quite likely that the  <br>

police officer involved would be suspended pending an investigation. Additionally, such a chase would of course be dangerous to the general public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para11"><a name="06101166000176">The main problem is that the police cannot identify the bikes because they do not have licence plates. That is why I believe that we should license all bikes, regardless of whether they are designed to be driven on the road. The relevant legislation is section 1(1) of the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994, which says:</p>
<a name="61011-0004.htm_brev3"><a name="06101166001481"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A duty of excise...shall be charged in respect of every mechanically propelled vehicle which is used, or kept, on a public road in the United Kingdom and shall be paid on a licence to be taken out by the person keeping the vehicle.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para12"><a name="06101166000177">The provision should be amended so that it covers not just on-road vehicles, but all off-road vehicles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para13"><a name="06101166000178">Who supports the proposal? The British Motorcyclists&#146; Federation does, with its 130,000 members, as does the Trail Riders Fellowship. The Greater Manchester police authority supports it&#151;I am sure that many hon. Members&#146; police authorities do&#151;and has been calling for such a scheme for a while, as has my hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright), not least because a friend of his was knocked down on a piece of open land by an unlicensed, unidentifiable bike that drove off. The fact that the bike had no number plate meant that it could not be tracked and justice has thus not been done. Licensing is not the only thing that we should do. I have mentioned the noisy silencers, and it must be time that either the industry acts to make biking quiet, or the Government take action to ensure that everyone can enjoy their right to a peaceful existence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para14"><a name="06101166000179">We must accept that many local authorities have been slow to make proper legal provision for bikers. As one constituent wrote today:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para15"><a name="06101166000180">I agree. Proper, well-designed tracks in areas where noise will not impinge on the local population are vital if we are to win the battle. Biking is a great sport&#151;I am sure that my right hon.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para19"><a name="06101166000186">The purpose of this debate is straightforward. The NHS is, in a real sense, its staff. The number and quality of health care professionals in the NHS is key to the quality of health care provided, and I am sure that Members on both sides of the House share a deep gratitude to doctors, nurses, therapists, scientists and health care professionals of all types across the NHS for their tremendous work. Improving the number of NHS staff is central to improving services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="61011-0004.htm_para20"><a name="06101166000187">Under the Conservative Government, the number of doctors increased by 23,000 and the number of nurses by 55,000. Under the present Government, according to the work force census, there are 33,368 more doctors, contrary to what the Government amendment says. There are 85,305 more qualified nurses and midwives than in 1997. The number of administrators has, of course, increased by 107,000. Under Labour, not only have the resources been badly used&#151;according to the Office for National Statistics, productivity has fallen by 1 per cent. a year during the life of this Government&#151;but now deficits are hitting those very staff. We know, and have debated, the scale of the deficits&#151;today&#146;s debate is not primarily about that subject&#151;and the Secretary of State has had to admit not only that the deficit last year was &#163;1.3 billion gross, but that it was higher than she had previously estimated. It is now &#163;547 million net.</p>

 The answer is straightforward: no money would be removed from the NHS. On the contrary, what my right hon. and hon.

I know that it depresses Labour Members that the Leader of the Opposition has frequently said that he will give priority to the NHS and has expressed his determination not only to increase its resources but to give it freedom from day-to-day political interference. We have said all of those things, and the public agree with them. The hon. Gentleman has to understand that we are putting that forward not on the basis of political advantage, but because it is in the interests of the national health service.</p>

I will give way to him again if he cares to tell us how he thinks that the deficits at St. George&#146;s hospital, Tooting, will be resolved other than by giving the NHS, including hospitals such as St. George&#146;s, much greater freedom to enable them to use resources more effectively. Frankly, under this Government, that is not happening. Hospitals such as St. George&#146;s are living under a regime of regulation and control, and the financial imposition of costs by the Secretary of State is causing them enormous damage. Perhaps he can comment on the fact that the Government admit that a 25 per cent. increase in the cost of hospital services in the past three years has eaten up all the money that has been provided to hospitals such as his.</p>

 If the Labour party would vacate the Government Benches and give us the opportunity to take up the responsibilities of government, we would ensure that NHS resources are used more effectively to deliver services for patients, that the staff the NHS recruit are front-line staff who deliver those services for patients, that accessible services&#151;which are demanded by patients and GPs&#151;can be commissioned by GPs on their patients&#146; behalf, and that the threat that is the consequence of the Government&#146;s policies is lifted. Unfortunately, I cannot promise that, because the Government are not going to disappear tomorrow and the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) is asking me about jobs that are under threat now. I cannot promise that I can restore those jobs&#151;of course I cannot.

If the Prime Minister tries to deny that, let me refer him to the NHS Confederation, which is in no mood simply to support my party on this matter. It wants to minimise the effect of what might happen and it has issued a briefing.

Friend the Member for Christchurch, with which he may or may not agree. NICE has to do an exhaustive job of trying to assess whether it is in the interests of the NHS that a treatment be provided because it is both clinically effective and cost-effective. That process has been extremely useful because it has increasingly exposed what is cost-effective and clinically effective about Alzheimer&#146;s drugs. They are effective for patients, especially for those with moderate and severe Alzheimer&#146;s&#151;dementia. However, in respect of mild dementia, they are not regarded as sufficiently effective to be a treatment that should be recommended on the NHS. Frankly, it is my opinion that in an independent national health service such decisions must be made independently and we must ensure that there is a correct statutory framework.

important issue remains in my mind. Because of the nature of the regulations prescribed by the Government, the benefits that NICE can take into account apply only to the national health service and to publicly funded social care. The benefits to carers and their families beyond that point cannot be taken into account. We must look into that&#151;and that might, of course, have a bearing on the outcome of any appraisal undertaken by NICE.</p>

 As my hon. Friend knows, hundreds of jobs have gone at Hinchingbrooke hospital, with hundreds more likely to go, and the hospital is now subject to a closure threat.

The implication&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Members might like to listen to this point.

However, on the contrary, we have a strategic health authority that has just been established and that has inherited a financial problem&#151;many of my colleagues right across the east of England are in the same position. Because of a &#163;233 million deficit, it will decide which hospitals stay open and which are shut. That is a disgrace. In a year or two services will be shut down by the strategic health authority, but in subsequent years we will have to re-establish them because they are required to meet the needs of patients. </p>

The work force census showed that in the last year for which figures were available, there were 485 fewer health visitors, 760 fewer district nurses, and even 36 fewer midwives.

help thinking that we might be losing the focus of this debate. Surely what matters in the health service is patient outcomes and patient care. As I still work as a GP, I can point to the fact that it now takes only two weeks to see a cancer consultant and to the fact that waiting lists are falling and GPs are providing much more care in their own practices, thereby significantly reducing the need to refer people to secondary care.

There is a long-term secular reduction in both coronary heart disease and cancer death rates, which is very much to be welcomed.

I hope that the Secretary of State will have the grace to apologise for trying, for political reasons, to steer a capital project to St. Helier, rather than to where the evidence pointed to. She had to backtrack on that in August.</p>

 I am going to carry on because, as the hon. Member for Dartford rightly said, we have got to get to the points that really matter. There are a lot of NHS staff out there who want to know what the Government are actually going to do now about these problems. There are junior doctors worrying about whether they will find training places. I am glad that the Government said that they are going to find between 22,000 and 23,000 places in August 2007; indeed, I raised precisely that issue with the Secretary of State back in January. Of course, and as I recall from last year&#146;s flu statistics, she has always had problems understanding what is England and what is the United Kingdom. In this instance, she has gone for 22,000 to 23,000 training posts in the UK, in order to meet a demand for 22,000 such posts in England, so the figures do not quite add up.</p>

 I agree that we should be honest about the debate. Part of the reason why death rates for cancer and heart disease are falling is that our Government have set targets&#151;[Hon.

 I am sorry that the hon. Lady was clearly not even listening to what I was saying. As yet, there is no discernible change in the trend reduction in deaths from cancer, even as a consequence of the additional investment in the NHS cancer plan. We might wish it otherwise, but that is the case. The fact that death rates continue to go down is much to be welcomed, but it has much more to do with things such as the reduction of smoking, as well as with the quality of service. When we compare our cancer death rates to those in other countries, we see that early identification of tumours will be absolutely instrumental in their further reduction. The cancer plan said that there needed to be awareness of symptoms and up-front investment for prevention, but that has not happened.</p>

The Royal College of Anaesthetists tells me that whereas in previous years there have almost always been about 30 advertisements a month for new anaesthetist posts&#151;last year there were 31 in July and 29 in August&#151;only 17 were advertised in July this year and only four in August.

 To go back to my hon.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The situation for stroke patients, for example, is utterly depressing. Even if they are able to secure early and intensive rehabilitation, sometimes treatment cannot be followed up to maximise their chances of recovery, owing to the lack of physiotherapists in post. We must have more physiotherapists. The Government said that we needed more physiotherapists and that there would be 60 per cent. more. People went into the profession as a result. A physiotherapist told me: &#147;I knew what was intended so I went into the course. Now there are no jobs.&#148; That is a deeply depressing fact; it is a cruel irony played on people who took up such courses.</p>

She might like to consider the example of Leicester, where the strategic health authority says that it will cut &#163;52 million from the training budget. The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust told Leicester university that it will cut clinical academic funding by 20 per cent.

In April 2004, Members may recall that we warned the Government about the impact of the European working time directive. I shall not rehearse all the arguments, but it was clear that if the Government did not secure an amendment to the directive there would be serious consequences for services. The Government claimed that would not be the case. The right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton), now the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said that they would maintain access to services despite the working time directive. But what has happened?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="61011-0006.htm_para7"><a name="06101166000265">I shall quote from a document about changing maternity and paediatric services produced by the Manchester SHA. Manchester itself&#151;not the whole north-west&#151;is a good example, as it is not generally driven by deficits and ended last year with a health economy in surplus. The document states:</p>
<a name="61011-0006.htm_brev2"><a name="06101166001491"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Staffing pressures on the 13 units providing in-patient care are getting worse. Already children&#146;s wards and maternity units have to close on occasions because there are not enough staff to cover them safely. We will not be able to staff all these units by 2009 when the European Working Time Directive becomes law and doctors are not allowed to work the hours they currently work. This is already resulting in units being closed frequently. In 2002 there were over 200 closures to the admission of children and young people across 13 hospitals, due to either a shortage of doctors or a shortage of specialist nurses.&#148;</p>

 No, I am not giving way, as I am moving towards my conclusion, but before I do so, I want to be fair to the Government. We are talking about work force planning and because I wanted to understand the Government&#146;s approach towards it, I looked at their evidence submitted to the Health Committee, which is currently investigating the matter. Here it is. The Government say that there is now &#147;a streamlined framework&#148; for work force planning. There are workforce directorates within strategic health authorities and they work with the social partnership forum, with the workforce programme board, with the national workforce group, with the workforce review team, with NHS national workforce projects, with Skills for Health and with NHS employers. There is even a diagram to explain it all&#151;and all that is supposed to be the &#147;streamlined&#148; framework! Whatever it is, it is certainly not yet streamlined enough. We need a much better system because out there in the NHS, staff have no idea what the work force plans look like, as even now, posts are being cut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="61011-0006.htm_para10"><a name="06101166000270">The staff of the NHS are, as we have said, its greatest asset. They work miracles daily and we need them to be motivated and inspired, but at the moment they are demoralised. The Secretary of State has gone from her &#147;best year ever&#148; in May to a &#147;very difficult year&#148; by September. NHS staff are seeing a feast turn into a famine. They see promises of expansion turn into cutbacks and they see the advertising campaigns of three or four years ago to recruit new nurses and therapists turning into the cruel irony of people leaving training unable to pursue their vocations and find jobs. They see sham consultations over service reconfigurations driven by short-term financial expedients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="61011-0006.htm_para11"><a name="06101166000271">The staff also note how the effects of the European working time directive are dressed up to suggest that services have to be shut down because they are deemed unsafe. Frankly, that is a slur on NHS staff. People are working across the country to save their local NHS services. Labour Members should not decry that as a Tory conspiracy; it is happening because people are angry about the loss of their local NHS services. They do not want to block changes, but they want them to be guided by evidence and to take account of needs for accessible services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="61011-0006.htm_para12"><a name="06101166000272">The new chief executive of the NHS says that more than one in four of district general hospitals have to be downgraded. He then tells us, in an interview in <i> The Guardian</i>, that he &#147;understands the politics&#148; of it. Well, we do not need an NHS chief executive who understands politics, but one who is focused on patients. We need a chief executive who is not spending all his time trying to work out what Ministers want him to do, but assessing what is in the best interests of patients and the NHS. We need an NHS free of the Secretary of State and the chairman of the Labour party sitting down with their advisers, trying to decide which hospitals to close.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="61011-0006.htm_para13"><a name="06101166000273">I am an optimist. I believe in the NHS and I believe in what NHS staff can achieve, but they can do so only if we give them the framework, the resources and the freedom to deliver. That is our objective, so I commend the motion to the House.</p>

Just 12 months ago, fewer than seven out of 10 patients with most suspected cancers could count on being seen, diagnosed and then beginning their treatment within two months.

As the Secretary of State knows, I have a strong and continuing personal interest in that subject. Given that the Vale of Aylesbury primary care trust is now turning away new referrals and inviting hard-pressed parents to seek help privately, what does the Secretary of State say to those parents who, in a million years, cannot afford to do so and who, without immediate and practical help, will find that their children&#146;s future prospects are permanently damaged?</p>

 First, as the hon.

[Hon. Members: &#147;What about the Vale of Aylesbury?] Funding for the Vale of Aylesbury primary care trust has increased by more than 30 per cent. over the past three years, by &#163;40 million. In Buckinghamshire PCT, over the next two years, there will be an additional &#163;91.5 million. However, what we must do&#151;Opposition Members refuse to accept this&#151;is support the NHS in making decisions that are often difficult, to get better value for that money, to release the savings that it needs to pay for more speech and language therapists, for new drugs and for all the other services that need improving.

 Although I do not doubt the Secretary of State&#146;s sincerity, I hope that she will visit Cornwall to see for herself the impact of the reforms that she and others have been implementing in areas such as my constituency. Despite the protestations that her Department is not enforcing the diversion by local trusts of NHS resources into the private sector, is she aware that, in fact, patients who are facing unnecessary, enforced minimum waits, including waits of more than nine weeks for breast care at the moment, receive unsolicited calls from NHS managers inviting them to be seen sooner in the private sector? Will she come to Cornwall to see the results of those reforms and their impact on the financially hard-pressed service there at present? In fact, it is a financial mess.

 My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health will indeed shortly visit Cornwall; I hope to do so in the near future. There are indeed some real challenges not only in the hon.

 Since we were last here, the Secretary of State has had to reverse the quite disgraceful decision that she took on 19 December 2005, to overrule a consultation that had the full support of the local medical community to build a new hospital at Sutton, not at St. Helier, and to site the thing at St. Helier, at the request of the hon.

 My decision was made precisely on the grounds of health inequalities and fairness, in which the hon. Gentleman and the Conservative party simply are not interested. The reason why things have moved on is that, unfortunately, the financial situation in south London, in that part of the NHS, is worse than those involved believed it to be when they came up with the plan for a new hospital. It is, I am afraid, no longer clear that the proposal for a new critical care hospital and nine new community hospitals is affordable in the way that the local NHS originally planned it. It therefore makes sense to look afresh at that model of care&#151;which, in principle, is the right one&#151;to ensure that it is affordable before any further decisions or arguments take place about where the hospital is sited.</p>

Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner)&#151;we were the only two Members there&#151;understood that Salford and Wigan, which are the areas closest to us, had very severe health inequalities and health needs.

 Conservative Members are missing the point of what patients want. Patients want three things: they want greater preventive services, they want services nearer to the community in which they live and, when they need expensive, high-tech services, they want them quickly and efficiently. What they want as the result of the new GP contract is to have more pharmacists and GPs working together to provide far more screening, far more care closer to home and far more preventive medicine with greater use of statins and ACE inhibitors. All that reduces the need for people to go to hospital at all and that is what patients are calling for&#151;greater prevention, more care in the community and, when they need high-tech care, that care being available swiftly and in a centre that has all the expertise that it needs.</p>

Conservative Members are out on the picket lines when anything like that is proposed in their constituencies, but what Tony Hadley and his team did in Norwich was to listen to patients who want to be cared for at home rather than in hospital and they put half the staff out of the community hospital and into the community itself. They doubled the number of patients that they could care for, they slashed the number of emergency admissions and they saved &#163;1 million a year that can go into better care for other patients.

 I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is simply incoherent on this point. It is not possible to take advantage of all the changes in modern medicine that make it possible to take tests and treatments out of acute and community hospitals and into GP surgeries, health centres and patients&#146; own homes, which is where patients would rather be, without making difficult decisions about the numbers of beds, wards and cottage hospitals that we have.

Conservatives say that they are in favour of more health care close to people&#146;s homes&#151;we have just heard it again&#151;but when emergency admissions are cut, as community staff are doing all around the country, when there is more day-case surgery, and some hospitals are not doing enough, and when the average length of stay is reduced, as all the best hospitals are doing, we do not need as many acute beds in some hospitals and we do not need as many staff in those hospitals. When a hospital makes such difficult decisions, and when it makes difficult decisions to bring the NHS back into financial balance instead of allowing the problems to build up over and again and to get worse and worse, the Conservative party completely refuses to support them.</p>

 Ravenscourt Park hospital was an investment from the private sector. It went bankrupt&#151;or pretty nearly so. We bought it for a very small amount of money and we did put some investment in it. It has treated a relatively small number of patients.

Gentleman&#146;s constituents and other parts of west London. The Conservative party has clearly given up completely on economic stability and sound finances. I take an old-fashioned view of these matters: I believe in prudent use of public money. I believe that we hold taxpayers&#146; money in trust.

 I shall in a moment&#151;perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will be able to explain what his manifesto called for. For those who could afford from their own resources to buy their way out of the NHS, the manifesto called for a subsidy from the taxpayer to enable them to do so.

He is looking at the Division list on a national insurance tax increase and linking the &#163;8 billion that was the result of that tax increase to increased NHS expenditure. That is the Government&#146;s line, but it does not need to be the Lib Dems&#146;. If he looks at the Budget for that year, he will find that the biggest single increase in public expenditure in the year in which that Bill raising the money to pay for it went through, was not for the national health service at all. The biggest single increase in public expenditure that year went into the social security budget, so why does the hon.

Simply because the Chancellor labels something does not automatically mean that it is so. I am very much of that view, but if we did not have the 1p on national insurance, which we supported and which we warned before the 2001general election would be required but which Labour never quite got round to mentioning, we would have &#163;8 billion less of total Government revenue. We can argue about where that would come from, but clearly it is ring-fenced and earmarked for the NHS by statute, and that is the right place for it.</p>

 As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) rightly points out, it is a fiction that the change in national insurance directly determined the level of NHS expenditure. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the accounts for last year, as I am sure he has done, since he is a professor, he will find that national insurance provided &#163;1.5 billion less to the national health service than it was expected to provide. Did that change the amount spent by the NHS? That is separately determined in public expenditure through the vote. The point that we were making in 2002 related to the economic consequences of the way in which the Chancellor would raise the money. That is why, at the subsequent election, we committed ourselves to maintain that level of expenditure, but of course my right hon. Friend might have chosen to raise the money in a different way.</p>

I do not go only to areas where everything is excellent. In the real world, most areas have to make difficult decisions to achieve the best use of their resources. Rather than continuing to sit on the fence, the hon.

 At the risk of being parochial, there is the strange coincidence that the hospital in my Liberal Democrat-held constituency closed so that a new one could be built in the neighbouring Labour-controlled constituency.

She is anticipating whatever the Healthcare Commission might find tomorrow about the health service&#146;s performance. She said that we need action plans. In other words, where PCTs are found to  be weak we urgently need action plans to start  within a month. That typifies the Government&#146;s mismanagement of the NHS. She does not say that we need long-term strategic thinking for efficiency over a period of years or that we need deep-seated financial problems sorted out in the medium term, but that we anticipate a bad headline tomorrow, so we need an action plan and we have a month&#151;a month&#151;to do things that presumably have not been done for the last nine years.

The words &#147;pot&#148;, &#147;kettle&#148; and &#147;black&#148; spring to mind. Independent sector treatment centres are being given better prices than the NHS, guaranteed volumes of delivery, the chance to cherry-pick the easy hips, cataracts and scans, but at the expense of what? She mentioned the ISCT at Shepton Mallet, but that has resulted in job cuts at the Royal United hospital in Bath just up the road. Frenshay hospital will virtually close and the chances are that an ISTC will be built on the site, so the same people will be having the same procedures on the same site but done by the private sector instead of the public sector, probably at greater cost&#151;and that is not privatising the NHS?

Let&#146;s try to refer them somewhere else.&#148; How that squares with patient choice I am not sure.

 Just to confirm the cases that have been brought up by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), about a week ago my local GP complained to me that, having called up various consultants for treatment of his patients and been told that they and the operating theatre were available, when he tried to book in the patients he was told that there must be a 10-week delay until they are right up against the target barrier. That, presumably, is a mechanism for pushing costs, certainly within the London area, into the next financial year by delaying treatment as long as possible. My GP is very concerned about the deteriorating condition of his patients. I am now asking patients if they are willing to give me their names so that we can bring those cases forward.</p>

There is the question whether enough money is going into the system in the south and whether too much money is going into the system in the north. How can the Conservative party run a &#147;no cuts&#148; campaign without promising to spend any extra money? It is difficult to work that one out, until one realises that, with one or two exceptions, it does not intend to win any seats north of the Watford gap. Conservative candidates in seats south of the Watford gap will say, &#147;We will spend more money in this area.&#148; If, however, we were to have a parliamentary by-election north of the Watford gap, the Conservative candidate would not mention spending less in that area.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the economics of the issue and health outputs both involve using the money wisely and both concern productivity, which lies at the root of the Government&#146;s failure? By reducing centralising bureaucracy and, as he has wisely pointed out, distortions caused by target setting, it would be possible to use the existing money to deliver more care. As the Labour party used to say before it got into power, which it has wasted, it is not only about money.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman represents a seat north of the Watford gap, and he is right that we need to spend every penny wisely.

The Conservative party is saying that it would spend more money in the south of England without ever saying that it would spend less in the north. The shadow Secretary of State has said that the Conservative party should regard public health money as one pot and money for illness as another pot.

 As a Yorkshire MP, my right hon. Friend may wish to comment on annex E of the Conservative campaign pack, which has a list of &#147;job losses&#148;, as they are called. It claims that 1,100 jobs will be lost in the Mid Yorkshire NHS trust. The information that the Department has is that although up to 400 jobs could be at risk, only six people will be made compulsorily redundant&#151;though even six is too many. Does my right hon.

 Yes, I do, because it is wrong, false and misleading. This is no conversion to the national health service. They say on a Monday that they will not use the NHS as a political football and, before the ink is dry on that speech, they table a motion that does exactly that, with a campaign to be launched on Saturday morning. The people who work in the health service remember what happened between 1979 and 1997. Their memories are not as short as some people would believe. They know that the NHS has been a political football for far too long and they also know the improvements, for patients and the work force, that have taken place in the past few years.</p>

In my day, they were often Victorian workhouses. I would explain how we had to strive for more day surgery, shorter stays in hospital and more use of community services. That is all common sense when running any health care system. The snag is, as has been illustrated over and over, that that is not at the root of the present bad crisis. At the moment, many parts of the country&#151;including mine&#151;are being driven to short-term expedients to address financial deficits. They are saving money wherever they can. The failure to offer jobs to physiotherapists has nothing to do with a movement towards a more rational service. Student nurses are having more difficulty finding jobs and clinical staff are being shed because the NHS is in a total shambles. If the Secretary of State will not acknowledge that, we do not have much chance of curing it. I preferred my hon. Friend&#146;s approach.</p>

 Well, I could retaliate with a list of the years in which we increased growth by 5 per cent. in real terms, but this is corny stuff. Expenditure on the health service has always gone up. We increased spending on health by 1 per cent. of GDP. Every developed country increases its spending on health care and, given today&#146;s demography, will continue to do so. It is corny nonsense to say, &#147;Aha, the Conservatives spent less than we did&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="61011-0011.htm_para1"><a name="06101166000467">I would point out that the rate of increase of recent years cannot be maintained. A fundamental spending review is on its way and it will be impossible to maintain 7 per cent. real-terms growth in health spending, without doing fantastic things to the budget of every other part of the public sector. The public spending review towards which the Government are just beginning painfully to creep cannot maintain that rate of growth. It will shrink, and the failure to tackle the present problems will produce more crises, unless the Government face up to the fact that they are going nowhere fast. They must face the fact that just spending money has not delivered what they wanted and expected.</p>

It would have been impossible to spend all that money without seeing some improvements, but the health service has always improved, year on year, ever since it was created.

Ministers of State used to have to get stuck in, because no one on either side of the House could be persuaded that the affordability of pay increases was something that had to be borne in mind. What has happened since then? The working time directive has been allowed to go through, and there has been a huge increase in the number of doctors. The 24-hour commitment of GPs has been abolished, and all nursing grades have been raised as a result of people writing their own descriptions of their responsibilities. Lots of other staff are now employed, and we have the best paid clinical professions in western Europe. I congratulate the BMA and the RCN: as usual, they have taken the Department of Health to the cleaners, but what were Ministers doing when all that was happening?</p>

We all believe in a giant NHS run on principles that everyone accepts, but there must be a system of financial control. All other giant organisations&#151;such as Marks and Spencer and BP, although they are smaller than the NHS&#151;have that. I can think of no other business-like activity whose first thought is to cut back its service, or product. The health service goes running around closing wards because it cannot afford the staff to keep them open. It closes community hospitals and stops recruiting the necessary trainee staff, but none of those problems has been addressed.</p>

strong warning. What we heard from a number of Members, and particularly the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) and others who talked about the campaign pack from the Conservatives, was that that pack provides a stark warning. The Conservatives will move resources from Wigan to Windsor, from South Kirklees to south Cambridgeshire, and from Leicester to Leominster&#151;from places that need those resources, because health there is poorer, to places that do not need them, because health there is better. Resources will no longer be based on health needs. They will be gerrymandered yet again to Tory areas. If anybody in Wigan votes for the Conservative party at the next election, they should know what they are voting for.</p>

 I want to respond briefly to the point with which the hon. Gentleman closed. It has been apparent several times in the course of the debate, listening to Members on the Front Bench, as well as the Back Benches, that the charge now being levelled against the announcements that were made by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition on Monday is that they represent at attempt to gerrymander resources. The truth is precisely the opposite. The announcements are a response to the Government&#146;s gerrymandering of resources. We seek to set up an established authoritative body that can provide an independent assessment of where health resources ought to go. We want to do that in order to ensure that the national health service is in a position to deliver the objective that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) made clear is shared explicitly right across the House: we want to have a largely tax-funded health care system that is available to people on the basis on need&#151;on the principle of equitable access to those who need it, without regard to ability to pay. Attempts by Labour Members to undermine, or eliminate, that political consensus across the House are doomed to fail. I want to return to some of those themes in a moment.</p>

Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) on the fact that he has focused the debate on the key resource of the national health service. The message coming back right across the health service is that, although Ministers repeatedly say that the delivery of health care depends on the professionalism and commitment of health service staff, which we all know to be true, the message that is received by national health service staff themselves is that their professionalism and their commitment to the service is being systematically undervalued by the Government who are supposed to be their employer. Staff feel that their commitment is undervalued because&#151;despite the huge increase in resources committed to the health service, which commands support right across the House&#151;they find themselves in the too familiar situation of being caught up in the management of short-term crises that are repeating themselves right through the national health service. In any organisation, when people find themselves responding to firefighting initiatives and short-term crisis management measures, that undermines morale and that is precisely what is happening right through the national health service today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="61011-0012.htm_para0"><a name="06101166000503">Like my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe, I think that it is fundamental that we understand why that situation has arisen despite the huge increase in resources committed to the national health service. I was struck by the fact that the Secretary of State was lecturing the House from the Dispatch Box on the importance of Ministers and managers in the national health service facing hard truths about the requirement to use resources efficiently if the health service is to deliver its objective of equitable access to high quality health care. As my right hon. and learned Friend said, he has made that speech, as have I&#151;every Secretary of State for Health has made it. The problem is that this generation of Ministers had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to use resources to address some of those fundamental problems of efficiency in health care delivery in the health service and they fluffed it. They had an opportunity that was not available to my right hon. and learned Friend when he was Secretary of State for Health and that he made certain, when he was Chancellor, was not available to me when I was Secretary of State for Health&#151;an opportunity to use that huge increase in resources to oil the wheels of change. The present Government had the opportunity to use those resources to provide a step change in the efficiency and quality of service that is being delivered by the health service. The present generation of Ministers has missed that opportunity and the result is that we are back with short-term responses and crisis management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="61011-0012.htm_para1"><a name="06101166000504">Let me give the House three specific examples of what that means in practice for people who deliver care to patients on a day-by-day basis, rather than make speeches about the health service. First, we have what are often called in health service-speak the priority services. There is an unintended irony in that phrase. I am talking about community services, therapies and the low-tech services that are delivered at community level that often bring a quite disproportionate benefit to the quality of life of patients. However, they are the easy targets every time a health service manager faces the need to make short-term cuts so that the books can be balanced. That is why we have unemployed physiotherapists throughout the country&#151;the health service cannot afford to employ them&#151;why occupational therapists are looking for jobs and why social services are complaining about their inability to get local partnership arrangements out of the health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="61011-0012.htm_para2"><a name="06101166000505">The effect of such short-term cuts in community-based services throughout the health service is twofold. First, they undermine morale because those who are delivering the service know that it is not as good as it could be. Secondly, and absurdly, they mean that we are building up long-term costs in the health service because people are being trapped in hospital, rather than released to properly funded and resourced community services.</p>

 My hon. Friend is entirely right. He cites a perfect example of the trend about which I am talking, which exists throughout the health service. Resources are being taken out of the community services because they are an easy hit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="61011-0012.htm_para3"><a name="06101166000508">The second example of short-term crisis management is the difference between the rate of inflation of health care costs in the system and the change that the Government have made to the tariff charged by secondary care to PCTs and commissioners. We all know that health care costs are rising very quickly&#151;my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe referred to that&#151;and the latest estimate from the Office for National Statistics, which was published in August, is that they are rising by 6 per cent. a year. Given that the costs are rising at such a rate and the tariff that the Government published on 26 January increased by 1.5 per cent. a year, one does not need to be a statistician to work out that that represents a 4.5 per cent. cut in the real resources available for the delivery of individual procedures by NHS providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="61011-0012.htm_para4"><a name="06101166000509">The situation shows that Ministers are not facing up to the consequences of their actions. If costs are rising by 6 per cent., yet Ministers fund them to the tune of 1.5 per cent., Ministers are effectively hoping that all the people in the national health service will somehow cover up the 4.5 per cent. gap so that they can avoid political embarrassment. It is not surprising that those people find their morale undermined if Ministers apparently believe that they are employed to do such a job. Those people think that they are employed to deliver high-quality health care to patients, as they should be. However, their experience is one of being asked to cover up the consequences of ministerial unwillingness to face precisely the kind of tough decisions about which the Secretary of State talked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="61011-0012.htm_para5"><a name="06101166000510">The development of training policy in the NHS, which is my third example of the short-term responses, has already been referred to during the debate. I have previously welcomed in the House the fact that we now spend more on training doctors and nurses in medical and nursing schools than we did when I was Secretary of State. I have reminded Ministers on previous occasions that that has happened partly because of carrying through plans that started to be generated when I was Secretary of State, but the big increase is welcome. However, it is not welcome that people who leave medical schools, and especially nursing schools, find that they cannot be employed in the national health service because Ministers have not faced up to the need to improve the efficiency with which health care is delivered. Furthermore, not only do we have unemployed nurses and doctors coming out of the growing medical and nursing schools, but the operators of the schools anticipate a 10 per cent. cut in the budgets available for training future doctors and nurses for the national health service. The Government have created a growing training sector, but they are not employing the people whom it produces, and they are also preparing a substantial cut to the increased training budget for which they are claiming credit.</p>

 Of course, that is true not only of doctors and nurses.

 My hon. Friend is right. Why does that undermine morale? It is partly because it results in unemployed people with training that they want to use and partly because the people in the service know better than the politicians the impact of the failures on the service delivered to patients from day to day. They can compare that service with what they want to deliver and what they know could be delivered if only the health service was led in a way that faced up to the real choices about which the Secretary of State likes to talk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="61011-0012.htm_para6"><a name="06101166000513">I agree with the Secretary of State when she talks about the importance of facing hard choices to deliver real improvements in health care. However, I look for a Minister who not only talks the talk, but walks the walk. I want to link the situation to the seven or eight rounds of bureaucratic change that we have had in the health service since 1997. The Government have brought us back round to virtually the same point at which they started nine years ago. Not only has that process led to a huge waste of resources&#151;I have seen estimates suggesting that the whole rigmarole has cost roughly &#163;1 billion&#151;but more fundamentally and importantly, it has meant that the kaleidoscope of changing management structures simply has not addressed the real choices about which the Secretary of State has talked. That is the link between the bureaucratic changes for which the Government are responsible and their fundamental failure to deliver improvements in health care, which is what hon.

 The Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) gently mocked Labour Members for hyperventilating when it comes to the Conservative record of all those years ago. I agree with him that policy convergence is taking place.

 I agree entirely. Last year, there was a lunatic proposal from Lord Warner to transfer 250,000 people directly employed by primary care trusts from the NHS into the private, voluntary and not-for-profit sectors. That was stopped only because of the huge outcry from Labour Members. The announcement was made on 28 July, and it was finally overturned by my friend the Secretary of State last November.</p>

The Prime Minister tells us that we are the change makers, but every time that we change the organisation, it is set back a year, or perhaps 18 months. It takes time to recover, and as soon as it has recovered, we slap it in the face again and reorganise. The way in which we endlessly reorganise the health service is Maoist, which is why people in the health service are so antagonistic towards us, why the platform lost an important conference motion moved by Unison in Manchester, and why a statement by the national executive committee, saying that more work had to be done to engage people working in the health service, was rejected by the conference. We regard people working in the health service as pawns that can be moved about, but they are finally saying, &#147;No, we are not having it.&#148;</p>

 It is often what happens to individuals, rather than what happens to institutions, that tells us when something is going badly wrong. Over the past two years, I have read with mounting disbelief letters from my constituents about the NHS in Hampshire. In case after case, they complain that they cannot get the treatment that they need. They tell me that national policies, such as cancer treatment within four weeks of diagnosis or the provision of services in community hospitals, are not being delivered on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="61011-0013.htm_para0"><a name="06101166000545">When I take up these problems with the relevant authorities, I am sent from one to another, on a bewildering journey around an amazing merry-go-round of bureaucracies, none of whom seems to be wholly responsible for what has happened. Is it the hospital trust that is responsible, or the primary care trust, or the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#151;or even, perhaps, the ambulance service? The space between the various bodies is not so much a gap as a swamp into which my queries sink into boggy depths, with all too often no satisfactory explanation for what has gone wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="61011-0013.htm_para1"><a name="06101166000546">Let me say something else&#151;by way of light relief, perhaps. The new Hampshire strategic health authority started on 1 October. Its chief executive was the chief executive of one of the major trusts in the county; he has moved up the ladder, as so often happens in such situations, and I do not knock him for that. However, when I wrote to him about a problem at the beginning of September, he replied&#151;very promptly&#151;that he could not help me until 1 October because he did not exist until then. Such bureaucratic problems make a bad situation even worse.</p>

weeks. Indeed, they had to wait nine weeks for treatment at the other hospital in Portsmouth, St. Mary&#146;s. During the intervening period, her condition deteriorated, so that in the end radiotherapy treatment was too much for her to bear and had to be stopped. She died six weeks later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="61011-0013.htm_para3"><a name="06101166000548">Why did she not receive treatment within the stated time? I shall seek an explanation from the two hospitals involved. One of the things that my constituent simply cannot believe is that it takes two weeks for medical records to travel the two miles from one hospital to the other, because they are sent by second-class post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="61011-0013.htm_para4"><a name="06101166000549">But it is not just in headline grabbing areas such as cancer treatment that the NHS has problems. The Government say that they are committed to community hospitals, but both of the community hospitals in my constituency have experienced significant service reductions at a time when, as everybody agrees, the NHS budget has been expanding. At the Alton community hospital, the Inwood ward was closed for many months. Happily, it will now reopen. At Petersfield hospital, the Grange maternity suite was closed at two weeks&#146; notice because of staff shortages, and it has stayed closed for 16 months. Happily, that is also now reopening. But how could the planning go so awry that those closures were necessary in the first place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="61011-0013.htm_para5"><a name="06101166000550">The trouble is that the NHS&#151;particularly in Hampshire&#151;is suffering from a stop-go policy. Sudden staff shortages or budget crises cause the withdrawal of a service. That sets off an understandable public row. Health service managers promise to reopen the facility, but are vague about when that will happen. After many months&#151;often over a year&#151;it is necessary to launch a recruitment drive to find the staff to run the service so that it can be reopened. Meanwhile, other parts of the NHS are making people redundant. The facility then reopens, but often&#151;as at Petersfield&#151;with a reduction in services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="61011-0013.htm_para6"><a name="06101166000551">That stop-go approach is deeply debilitating. It undermines morale in the NHS, wastes resources as facilities have to be closed and then reopened, and, worst of all, it bewilders patients. It is the most vulnerable patients who suffer from the closure of community hospital facilities, as they are the ones who are unable to travel to the nearest district general hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="61011-0013.htm_para7"><a name="06101166000552">This mismanagement&#151;that is what it is&#151;results from the total absence of stability within the service, as my right hon. and hon. Friends, whose knowledge is greater than mine, have mentioned. When my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition spoke about taking politicians out of the NHS, he did not mean for us to walk away from our ultimate responsibility to provide health care; he meant that the constant chopping and changing brought about by the pressure of party politics has to stop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="61011-0013.htm_para8"><a name="06101166000553">Somebody said that there have been seven reorganisations of NHS bureaucracy since 1997, but I make it 10.

Clinical trials of the drug have been conducted for about six months and it has proved extraordinarily effective, to the extent that another of my constituents&#151;a 38-year-old woman&#151;is back home with her family. Yet before the trials began, it was thought that she had only weeks to live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="61011-0013.htm_para10"><a name="06101166000555">My constituent&#146;s kidney cancer was diagnosed two days after the trials officially ended, and although the treatment has been proven to be highly effective, it is not available any more, the argument being that it has not been approved by NICE. Indeed, according to a written answer in June from the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), the Department of Health is still deciding whether to refer the drug to NICE for consideration. When I asked about this, Lord Warner replied that it was for hospitals and PCTs to decide whether to prescribe new treatments. He went further, saying that</p>
<a name="61011-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="06101166000556"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;PCTs cannot refuse to fund drugs simply because NICE guidance is not available&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<a name="61011-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="06101166001509"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;should not refuse to fund treatment solely on the grounds of cost but should consider all the circumstances before making a decision.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="61011-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06101166000558">So what is the problem? The drug is the treatment of choice of the consultant, who is thrilled with the success of the trials. It is available, but it is not allowed to be prescribed and my constituent cannot have it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="61011-0013.htm_para13"><a name="06101166000559">The reality is that health rationing is going on all over Britain, and it is a complete lottery as to whether a particular treatment is available in a particular area. That does not add up to a national health service. I do not doubt the personal commitment of Ministers to solving some of the problems, but they do not seem to recognise that it is their making constant changes, the expansion in the number of managers and the obsession with targets that is denying patients the choice that they should properly have. If the focus of the national health service should be on anything, it should be on nothing more than patient care.</p>

 I want to thank the Opposition for calling this debate, although the picture of the NHS painted by the hon.

There are 32,000 more doctors and 85,000 more nurses, and by 2010 there will be 100 new hospitals. As you know only too well, Madam Deputy Speaker, my constituency has a brand new hospital that is treating more of your and my constituents more quickly than ever before.

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="61011-0013.htm_para14"><a name="06101166000561">Last week, we were told by the Leader of the Opposition how much he now cares about the health service. This remarkable conversion follows earlier eye-catching statements in which he said, for example, that he is not a Thatcherite and that he now cares about poverty. He and his party have chosen &#147;change to win&#148; as their slogan, because they know that their brand was discredited and distrusted and associated with the failures and betrayals of the past. That is why they are trying to show that they now care about issues such as the NHS, on which they have never been trusted before. They might be doing a decent job on public relations, but they face much stricter tests&#151;vague claims about intent are not enough. I am not one of those people who say that the Tories believe in nothing and that they have no policies&#151;quite the reverse. It is because of their beliefs and values that they cannot be trusted with the health service.</p>

He has committed his party to the so-called proceeds of growth rule, which&#151;whatever the Tories say&#151;commits their party to cuts, year in, year out. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said earlier, if the Tories were in power this year, the new rule would mean expenditure at a slower rate of growth than under the Government&#146;s plans. This year, the difference between the Opposition&#146;s plans and the Government&#146;s plans would be &#163;17 billion, and it would be bigger in the future.</p>

I hope that the House listened carefully to the speeches of the two former Secretaries of State for Health, my right hon. Friend the Members for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), which were full of wisdom and clarity about the way ahead.

Friend the Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates)&#151;in my constituency and local area. We have had &#147;Modern Hospital Services for Central Sussex&#151;A challenge for us all&#148; in 2000, and even more ridiculous names such as &#147;Strengthening Hospital Services in Central Sussex&#148; in 2001 and the &#147;Best Care, Best Place&#148; consultation in 2004.

management costs and rapidly accumulating debts, which are at the nub of our present unhappy state. Matters were so serious that the Government asked Michael Taylor, then chief executive of Oxfordshire health authority, to investigate and report on West Sussex as a failing and debt-ridden health authority. His report, which was damning, set out a series of recommendations, which were by and large completely ignored by Candy Morris, who was acting chief executive of West Sussex health authority until its demise. She was also responsible for the NHS consultation documents from 2000. By an astonishing quirk of fate, she is now one of the architects of proposals about to be announced for the apparent deconstruction of the NHS in West Sussex.</p>

Friend the Member for East Hampshire&#151;involving duplication, replication and wastefulness. No one paid any attention to his warnings and this continuing, wilful mismanagement of the NHS has now led to colossal debts of well over &#163;100 million in West Sussex.</p>

My constituents and I feel that that amounts to a deceit, a betrayal and totally unacceptable behaviour by the management of the NHS, which has lost its way and has been party to the waste of hundreds of millions of pounds over recent years&#151;money that could quite well have been spent on patient care.</p>

Indeed, the &#147;Best Care, Best Place&#148; consultation document said that both the Royal Sussex County and the Princess Royal hospitals will keep their A and E departments. Those assurances turn out not to be worth the paper that they were written on.</p>

Gatwick airport is only 15 miles away, and there is always the possibility of a major catastrophe. In times of conflict, the Princess Royal hospital would be needed as a casualty clearing station.

Although I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe that there have been many changes for the better and that excellent changes are afoot to move services into the local community, interfering with the fundamental infrastructure of the health service in the way that is being done is a fatal mistake.</p>

I would like to remind the House of what it was like in my area. Like everywhere else, we had long waits for elective treatment&#151;18 months was the norm and, as we have heard, it could have been anything up to two years.

The second biggest change that we have seen is that today one can go to a completely modernised accident and emergency unit that is not crowded and one can be treated in under four hours.

The Anglian Harbours NHS Trust, a community services trust, did not just have a deficit, but crashed and went out of business. Local NHS managers had to pick up the mess.

Will the hon. Gentleman follow the example of the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) who looked at the difficulties, which does not mean denying that improvements and benefits can be found? Looking at the problems and concerns today about the failure of productivity would help us to get a better deal for patients. After the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Austin), we have yet another party political rant based on the memories of what happened 10 years ago, and that is an entire waste of time. The hon.

We have had our share of the extra doctors and nurses, a new accident and emergency unit, as I have said, new theatres, intensive care units, maternity units, pathology facilities, eye units, new renal stations, scanners, digital X-ray, and most recently a new emergency admissions and discharge unit, which is helping to make the hospital far more efficient and to treat more people.</p>

My local hospital has got to grips with MRSA: last year it saw 300,000 patients and had 41 cases. It has had only 14 cases in the past seven months, but it wants to do better. Even its food was given a 98 per cent. satisfaction rate among patients in a recent national survey. That is why the hospital has been a three-star trust for successive years, why it has had no deficit for 2005-06&#151;in fact it had a surplus&#151;and why in August this year it became a foundation trust hospital, joining the other 47 in the country.</p>

The Lowestoft hospital, which faced closure, has had a major overhaul with massive investment, and I welcome the Government&#146;s announcement of &#163;700 million more across the country and hope that some of it will come our way.</p>

A problem arises, however, when two neighbouring trusts do not move in the same direction, and we have such a problem at the moment with South Norfolk PCT, which is talking about reducing the number of contracts. If it does that, there will be a knock-on effect in my constituency, where the local trust wants to go in another direction, so I hope that we will see greater co-ordination. With practice-based commissioning, I know that local people will want to choose that hospital and that GPs will want to send them there, so with that type of commissioning and the new payments system, we hope we have a future.</p>

That organisation can focus on commissioning the health services that are right for our local area based on local need, working closely with local GPs to serve local people, maintaining that relationship with the local hospital, and getting the funding appropriate to our needs. In mental health, we have brand-new facilities for in-patients. The ambulance service has turned itself around completely, as I said, and I expect it to get a good rating from the Healthcare Commission tomorrow.</p>

The Conservatives and their newspapers are trying to present a picture of an NHS that is falling apart, but the NHS Confederation has just published a report, &#147;Lost in translation&#148;, which points out that when people who have been in hospital are asked about the experience, they say that they had good treatment.

clinical side. All year there has been anxiety about deficits and disputes about their cause and the solution to them. We have seen plenty of management consultants, plenty of hassle and plenty of controversy. Despite all that controversy and hassle, the staff have got on and delivered an exemplary service, but the word &#147;planning&#148; has no place in their world that they can understand. One can plan only when one properly understands the environment in which one is working, and there is no evidence over the past 10 years in my constituency that anybody has been able to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="61011-0014.htm_para25"><a name="06101166000622">Ten years ago my local trust, which controls two hospitals, tried to deliver a plan&#151;not a very good plan, but it was based on allegedly clinical criteria. It was based on the demands of the medical profession for safety, clinical standards, training capacity and so on. It was deeply flawed. It had children who had suffered any kind of trauma or accident by-passing a fully fledged casualty department, and it was not acceptable to the people of my constituency. It was supposedly and unconvincingly based on the latest recommendations from the royal colleges, but it was at least coupled with a substantial new build investment programme.</p>

Just as that was heading for a settled outcome, payment by results appeared on the radar, ushering in uncertainty and further turmoil. Management consultants then proposed clinically absurd proposals at variance with all the previous proposals, and the new capital investment under payment by results became a financial millstone. The accountants&#151;McKinsey&#146;s, Ernst and Young and the rest&#151;rather than the doctors appeared to be calling the shots.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="61011-0014.htm_para27"><a name="06101166000624">That was not planning. It was reactive. It was crisis management. It is crisis management, but each crisis is internally generated. The public are left baffled and angry and the politics is messy and at times unpleasant. At the height of all this, there was a blessed moment of sanity in my constituency. The primary care trust, backed by the strategic health authority, took matters in hand, called all the parties together, sat them down and asked simply, &#147;What do people here need? What can people fairly expect to receive?&#148; Genuine consultation took place and for a time real solutions seemed to be in the offing. It was a model of crisis resolution.</p>

People cite figures showing the considerable fall in hospital occupancy over the past decade. However, they omit to tell us that the number of acute beds, as opposed to beds for maternity and the elderly infirm, has not fallen appreciably. We get flimsy clinical excuses for financially based decisions. Looking on anxiously in almost every constituency are the poor public&#151;the citizen, whether ill or well&#151;unable to detect the shape of future services, unsure of what awaits them, and unconvinced of the existence of even a Baldrick-like cunning plan.</p>

 When I was first elected to represent Bedford and Kempston in 1997, a regular feature of my postbag then and for some years thereafter was people asking for help because of the consequences of excessive hospital waiting&#151;the pain, the living in distress and the time off work. Many people were driven to the private sector. If that goes too far, it undermines the principles of the NHS. That is the way it was nine years ago. Today, I hardly ever have such a case brought to me by a constituent. People acknowledge that there has been a real improvement in waiting times. The Conservative party must hope for a national collective outbreak of amnesia on this point if it is to make progress with its claim to be the true party of the NHS.</p>

the problem is that acute services cannot be operated directly in the community; they need decent sized hospitals that are relatively close to where people live. One consequence of concentrating on specialist hospitals alone is that, in rural areas such as mine, one ends up with the situation such as that at Westmorland general hospital where the medical emergency admissions may soon be shut down because of the drive for the best. The best is becoming the enemy of the good enough. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that we need to ensure that we have safe services that are close enough to people for them to get there in time to survive and be stabilised when they have conditions such as heart attacks?</p>

 I did not follow that entirely, but yes, of course, we want a better NHS, if that is what the hon. Gentleman said. If we have more services in the community, that will free up the acute sector to enable it to treat more people more quickly. If people have to go to hospital, they want the prospect of safe treatment without having to wait too long and as locally as possible, although that depends on the nature of the operation that they face.</p>

It involves change and change can be difficult, but it is a good news story which, when I discuss it with NHS staff and constituents, is one that they can broadly sign up to, even if it goes under the peculiar term of reconfiguration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="61011-0015.htm_para3"><a name="06101166000636">But the context has dramatically changed in recent months, and that context arises from the consequences in Bedford of the Bedford Hospital NHS Trust&#146;s &#163;11.8 million deficit. I do not have time to go into why there is that deficit, but it is combined with the Government&#146;s decision this year to address the NHS&#146;s overall deficit of the last financial year by top-slicing the budgets to PCTs, and the two together have created real pressures. They are short-term financial pressures, but they could lead to up to 200 redundancies at Bedford hospital, although the figure is likely to be significantly less. Nevertheless, it is worrying, and damaging to staff morale, and it will slow up the development of the consequential primary care services that will be needed if there is to be a shift to some extent from acute to primary. Such uncertainty is bad for staff morale and the public do not understand what is happening. They know that there have been improvements and that there is a lot more money year in, year out, but they face difficulties such as they have not experienced for years. That situation provides fertile ground for others to increase people&#146;s fears by telling scare stories. In the case of Bedford hospital, the scare stories were started by the Liberal Democrats in <i> The Daily Telegraph </i>on 14 September. The scare tactic involved saying that Bedford hospital is scheduled for closure&#151;a Bedford hospital consultant went on the record to make that point and Bedford and Kempston Conservative party is circulating a leaflet reinforcing the fear of the threat of closure. Let me make my position clear. I totally support Bedford district general hospital as a viable district general hospital. The hospital is not at risk from closure, and it is wholly wrong to whip up fears that it is.</p>

managing the four-year financial recovery plan to eliminate the hospital&#146;s debt, changing the shape of local NHS services to improve them for the long term and ensuring that those two tasks are carried out while maintaining a full range of services, particularly the 24-hour accident and emergency service. Those are the challenges in Bedford, and they clearly worry my constituents. We are not helped by fears being whipped up unnecessarily, which goes on day in, day out in my constituency.</p>

First, when changes are prepared and published, there should be a three-month statutory consultation process with which people are urged by all parties to engage on the basis of facts and a measured and informed debate rather than on the basis of scare tactics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="61011-0015.htm_para6"><a name="06101166000639">Secondly, the Government must examine RAB, the resource accounting and budgeting financial management system that now applies across central Government. The principles of RAB have supposedly been applied to NHS trusts across the country, which means that, if a trust reports a deficit in one year, its income is reduced by that amount in the following year. That is a double whammy, which is unfair and guaranteed to make a difficult situation worse. Furthermore, the in-year deficit is reported to the balance sheet reserve and carried forward cumulatively. Bedford hospital trust reported an income and expenditure deficit of &#163;8.48 million in 2004-05, and Bedford PCT passed on a reduction in its service level agreement income of that amount in the following year as a result of RAB. However, because that reduction would have devastated the hospital, which would not have been able to pay many of its staff, the trust was permitted to borrow that sum from the strategic health authority. That cash borrowing, which did not appear in the accounts in the normal way, was interest-free, and the sum was to be paid back in the following year. In 2005-06, the in-year deficit was reduced by the trust to &#163;3.41 million, which under RAB should have led to a cut in its income of that same amount in this financial year, but that did not happen, because a deal was done with the SHA.</p>

It calls for an end to RAB being applied to the NHS and for a system of much greater clarity and transparency. What is happening to Bedford hospital reinforces the message from the Audit Commission. In one year, RAB was applied, but cash borrowing was allowed to cover the cut, and then it was not applied in the next year.</p>

pretending that they do not exist, but at least we could then build on a system that enables clear planning, openness and transparency which more people than just the finance director could understand. The NHS needs that important development, so that it is not just left to the finance director to understand the finances, and so that all elements of a hospital, for example, contribute to financial efficiency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="61011-0015.htm_para9"><a name="06101166000642">It is also important to get rid of RAB so that we abolish its cumulative balance sheet feature. That element might not appear to matter, but it will from April next year when the capital funding regime is due to change and an NHS trust&#146;s ability to borrow will partly be judged by the state of the balance sheet. Under RAB, while Bedford Hospital NHS Trust should eliminate its deficit within four years, the balance sheet will show the deficit for eight years. That is a wholly ridiculous situation.</p>

Some welcome reforms, such as practice-based commissioning, the choose-and-book system and payment by results, are about to be introduced, but it is all happening at once.

Since 1997, this Government have also done good things for the health service. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) rightly said, there is a growing consensus in this Chamber and the country over the national health service&#151;a consensus to which I have adhered from the first day I entered this House&#151;that we should have a first-class health service, based on free access for those eligible to use it and paid for by taxes, except for those areas on the fringes that, historically, have not been free at the point of use, such as prescription charges.</p>

There have been improvements in the health service in the past 10 years, but there are also some significant problems.

I pay tribute to them, but there are problems because the money that has been made available in record amounts by the Government is not reaching front-line services at the level and in the scope that we would expect. Chelmsford PCT has a deficit of &#163;13 million. To try to overcome that problem, as it has been told to do, two intermediate care wards have been closed completely, so there is now a gap in intermediate care that will have a knock-on effect on the local hospital and, potentially, delayed discharges will begin to escalate again.</p>

More and more people were encouraged to train as nurses and investment was made in their training, but now that they have those nursing skills there are very few jobs for them.

with a brilliant PFI scheme worth &#163;180 million. Chelmsford has two hospitals&#151;Broomfield hospital, which is an old tuberculosis hospital that has been modernised and is now state of the art, and St. John&#146;s hospital, which was built in Victorian times and is way past its sell-by date. Contrary to what the Secretary of State said&#151;it did not fit her agenda&#151;there are Conservative Members who support hospital closures when they see the logic behind them. From the outset, I have supported the closure of St. John&#146;s hospital, as have the medical staff and my constituents, because the services were to be moved four miles to the Broomfield hospital site. That is the right thing to do when the building is outdated.</p>

I have to hand it to them, because it is a centrepiece that would deliver an improvement in health care. The scheme was ready, it had been validated and approved by the Essex strategic health authority, and it went to the Department of Health in October for final approval. Unfortunately, the Department could not get its act together and, having said that we would have a decision by the end of November and then by the end of the year, it had still failed to make a decision by late January.

The right hon. Lady speaks to hon. Members like a know-all head teacher speaking to naughty schoolchildren.

 I welcome this debate, and am very pleased to be able to contribute to it. I should like to speak about the demands that the NHS faces, and to which it must respond. Demand for a mass health system is not always visible. I have many constituents in parts of Denton and Reddish who need NHS support but who do not actively seek it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="61011-0015.htm_para25"><a name="06101166000662">I think that that is the challenge. Of course, the NHS must respond to the demands made on it, but it must also find new ways for those demands to be made, and especially by the most dislocated and vulnerable people in Britain. The debate has moved on from being simply about quantities of investment. Stephen Watkins, the director of public health in Stockport, has written:</p>
<a name="61011-0015.htm_brev2"><a name="06101166001517"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For several years now the Government has been investing very large sums of new money into the NHS. This money far exceeds anything that would have been dreamed of throughout the late 1970s, 1980s, or early 1990s. Those who called for UK health spending to be increased to the European average were dismissed as unrealistic dreamers. In 1996, the BMA said that &#163;6 billion of real new investment was required for the NHS and was attacked by other health organisations for going over the top. In 1999, the Government injected &#163;12 billion of real new recurrent money to start a process of increasing NHS spending to the European average.&#148;</p>
</ul>

<a name="61011-0015.htm_brev3"><a name="06101166001518"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;With this additional money the NHS has dramatically improved.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="61011-0015.htm_para27"><a name="06101166000664">That is not a political statement. That comes directly from the director of public health in Stockport and his 2006 public health annual report. Clearly, the level of Government spending was the argument in the 1990s. To solve the problems that the NHS may face in the future requires reform for our changing society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="61011-0015.htm_para28"><a name="06101166000665">The Labour Government who took office in 1945 were a response to the demands of post-war Britain. War and sacrifice, both at home and abroad, led to the most demanding British electorate since the emergence of mass suffrage. That electorate demanded that the Government provide a free and first class health service for all throughout the country, and the Labour Government responded. The British people have, of course, changed a great deal since the 1940s. They have become ever-more demanding&#151;my constituents included. Their expectations are much higher and rightly so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="61011-0016.htm_para0"><a name="06101166000666">As we look to the future, this will become an increasingly ageing society. The number of people aged 85 and over has grown to a record 1.2 million. That is resulting in ever-increasing demands on the NHS, but also in many more hidden and vulnerable people&#151;sometimes without family support&#151;with whom the NHS must make meaningful contact. As in the past, the national health service must be reformed and expanded to cope with the changes. By 2025, the number of people aged over 85 will have increased by two thirds. Each of those people will need, on average, five times as much care as the average 16 to 44-year-old. An NHS that can cope with those pressures requires both investment and reform. In fact, the NHS&#146;s ability to be reformed and to meet the challenges of the day is why it remains one of the most popular institutions in Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="61011-0016.htm_para1"><a name="06101166000667">During the 1980s and the early 1990s, NHS staff were let down by the Government. During the 1980s, the Conservatives managed to build just one new NHS hospital in Britain. Since Labour came to power in 1997, we have turned that decline around. By 2008, more than &#163;90 billion will be invested in the NHS, in a huge range of services. As a result, the NHS is treating more people and treating them faster than ever before, with treatment free at the point of need and available to all.</p>

That will include the building of a new state-of-the-art health facility, including an expanded and improved accident and emergency department. The improvements being made to the NHS are, however, not simply a result of investment, but of careful reform. The Conservative party did not want careful reform. Just over a year ago, the Tories believed that the best way to help the people of Britain would be allow the wealthy to pocket NHS money, provided by hard-working families all over Britain, and take it away to subsidise private treatment. That would have left areas in which people have relatively poor health and low incomes, such as parts of my constituency, starved of much-needed funds. The Tories are still at it. Having voted against the extra investment in the NHS, they now want that money to be spent only in their areas, where deficits have accrued. They cannot campaign for more money in public while voting against it in the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="61011-0016.htm_para3"><a name="06101166000671">Our challenge is to find the most efficient way of providing health care to all, not the fastest way to drain the NHS of funds. If NHS money is better spent caring for people in their own homes than in hospital beds in large general hospitals, that is what should be done. If the money is better spent on specialist units, that is what should be done, and if the money is better spent on an expanded and improved accident and emergency department at Tameside general hospital, that is what should be done&#151;and that is what is being done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="61011-0016.htm_para4"><a name="06101166000672">A modern NHS requires a range of different services to provide the best care. If money is taken away from one service, it is not being cut or disappearing. It is being channelled towards a service that is better for more patients. The NHS survives through reform and investment. British society has changed immeasurably. We are living longer, becoming more demanding and expect state-of-the-art treatments when it is convenient for us, and rightly so. The people have not, however, changed their minds about the NHS. My constituents want the NHS. They want the first class state-of-the-art treatments that will soon be provided by the new &#163;80 million investment at Tameside and by the new facilities at Stepping Hill, but they also want the freedom to choose when they want that treatment and whether they would rather stay in hospital or recover, supported by medical practitioners, in their own home. Many of my constituents are not the wealthiest people in Britain&#151;far from it&#151;but they deserve the best possible treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="61011-0016.htm_para5"><a name="06101166000673">The history of my Greater Manchester constituency is one of change. Denton was famous for making hats. Huge swathes of the population of Denton and Stockport were involved in hat manufacturing, as well as other textile and heavy industries. Today, the people of Denton and Reddish lead different lives, so the NHS must continue to find new ways to make itself accessible to people with varied lifestyles. It has been argued by many that the importance of choice in health care is exaggerated. No; choice in health care is not like choice in shopping&#151;it is much more important than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="61011-0016.htm_para6"><a name="06101166000674">Many people in my constituency&#151;often those in the most deprived areas&#151;are not sufficiently connected with doctors and nurses. Those connections must be strengthened for the sake of both my constituents&#146; health and the efficiency of health provision. If my constituents, some of whom are trying to hold down two or three part-time jobs, cannot choose when and where they and their families access health care, their quality of health and NHS money will be wasted. If a range of times and locations are not available to those in need of treatment and advice, appointments will be missed. When that happens, treatments and advice are not given, medical practitioners are not able to understand further their patients&#146; needs and public money is wasted. Without more freedom, many of my most vulnerable constituents will not access health care and health advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="61011-0016.htm_para7"><a name="06101166000675">The health profile of England maps, which were published yesterday, show the problems that we still face, and I am well aware that my constituents face them every day. Like many northern areas of England, Denton and Reddish has higher obesity rates, more smoking-related deaths and, consequently, lower life expectancies than the English average. Men can expect to live for 74 years and women 79 years, but both figures are lower than the national and regional averages. The goal for the NHS should be to make it as easy as possible for those in need to receive the advice and treatment that they need to the end the health divide.</p>

 Various things have happened in the NHS in the past year. The crisis involving deficits affected many NHS trusts and demonstrated itself through the closure of many community hospitals, or, in my constituency, the non-opening of a new community hospital, which the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) had promised from the Dispatch Box when he was a Health Minister. He said that we would have a new and enlarged community hospital in Bicester, but that has not happened and clearly will not now happen. The Secretary of State&#146;s speech gave us no explanation of why the Government have suddenly turned their back on community hospitals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="61011-0016.htm_para9"><a name="06101166000678">We are now moving towards another trend of downgrading so many services in smaller general hospitals that they effectively cease to be general hospitals. Such a thing is proposed and threatened for the Horton general hospital in Banbury. The hospital serves a large catchment area&#151;much of south Northamptonshire, much of south Warwickshire and west Oxfordshire&#151;which is why today my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), my hon. Friends the Members for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maples) and for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and I have submitted a joint observation to the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust. If hon. Members want to read it in full, it can be found at www.save-our-services.com. The important point is that we say:</p>
<a name="61011-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="06101166001519"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We believe that the Oxford Radcliffe NHS Trust, the Strategic Health Authority and the Government should be seeking to ensure that we can keep the Horton as a General Hospital delivering all the clinical and medical services that one would reasonably expect a local General Hospital to deliver&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="61011-0016.htm_para10"><a name="06101166000679">which seems not unreasonable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="61011-0016.htm_para11"><a name="06101166000680">The tragedy about the proposals is that they are not a consequence of the trust saving particularly large sums of money. In fact, over a full year, the trust would save only some &#163;1 million to &#163;1.3 million, which is between 0.25 to 0.5 per cent. of the total Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust budget. If the trust, the strategic health authority and the Government had the will, they could find those savings elsewhere in the trust budget without leading to a significant downgrading of services at Horton general hospital&#151;a downgrading that will have a major impact on local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="61011-0016.htm_para12"><a name="06101166000681">The downgrading starts with the downgrading of paediatric services. The sadness of the matter is that long ago in 1974 a young boy from Bloxham, a village just outside Banbury, died. The then Secretary of State, Barbara Castle, ordered an independent inquiry that found that there should be 24/7 paediatric services at Horton general hospital to serve the wider catchment area. Under the proposals, we will effectively go back 30 years to the period before Barbara Castle&#146;s decision. The knock-on effect of not providing 24/7 paediatric services is that one can no longer provide obstetric services, because there is no special care baby unit, yet  <br>

There are three factors, the first of which, of course, is the money. It is not by chance that these improvements have happened. On listening to some of the contributions from Conservative Members during this debate, one would think that we have somehow magically profited from benign economic circumstances and that, had they been in the same situation, they, too, could have done it. It is our economic policies that have led to this situation, but most importantly, we raised taxes, which Conservative Members opposed, to do it. This is not chance&#151;it is deliberate action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="61011-0016.htm_para25"><a name="06101166000701">The second way that we have achieved our outcomes is by setting targets. We have not just thrown money into the system&#151;the Government have sent an extremely clear signal about what we want devolved management to spend that money on. I hope that the Conservative Front-Bench spokesperson will say later which of those targets they would cut, given that they are on record as saying that they would do so. Would they cut our target of a mere 18 weeks from GP referral to actual operation&#151;down from 18 months under the previous Government? Would they cut our target of seeing accident and emergency patients within four hours, which is practically being met, I am proud to say, in my constituency? Would they cut our target to have urgent cancer cases seen by a specialist consultant within two months, which I believe is also largely being met in my constituency? We need the answers to those questions because these are the issues that matter to the public; yet the Conservatives say that targets do not matter to them.</p>

 I have been looking forward to this moment for a long time. I shall start by offering advice&#151;freely given and well meant&#151;to the Government and in the second part of my speech I shall offer advice to the Government and to the Tory Opposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="61011-0017.htm_para7"><a name="06101166000716">First, what does service development mean? To me, it means improving and updating the service for the good of the patient: not for managers, not for staff, not for politicians, but for the patient. In the past 25 years, 28 reforms of the health service have been carried out by Governments of both colours. They were well described as debilitating changes by the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), and they were decried by the hon. Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall) and by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), so I shall not spend much time on them.</p>

If anyone knows how not to set about reconfiguring hospitals it is me, so I offered the benefit of my advice to the chief executive of the NHS, whom I know vaguely. I thought that I would receive no reply, but this morning I had a letter from him saying that he would like to arrange a meeting. So it seems that he wants to take my advice, which is superb. Perhaps the Government realise that as an Independent I am not automatically against them all the time and that sometimes I can help.</p>

We have heard much about overview and scrutiny committees today and a little about the independent reconfiguration panel, the crucial body set up by the Government to ensure independence in the reconfiguration process and to take it out of the political arena. It is essential that they use the panel.</p>

We heard several things. Perhaps the Government&#146;s record is improving slightly&#151;there have been 18 referrals to the Secretary of State and four have got through to the IRP. Furthermore, we heard that the panel has the promise of money so that it can expand to cope with the work as it comes in.

independent reconfiguration panel will take the politics out of it all. It is no good having the Government tsar for emergency services come up with an independent review.

 As ever, the hon. Gentleman is making a thoughtful contribution. May I take him back to the independent reconfiguration panel? Does he accept that it is very much a second-best world, whereby local people who have a problem can go for the mercy of the Secretary of State, who may or not appeal to a group of people who were not elected in the first place? Is not that less satisfying than what he referred to previously: local people taking local decisions?</p>

 I am grateful for that, because it allows me the opportunity to clarify what the independent reconfiguration panel is now doing. Because it has been used so little by the Secretary of State, it is putting itself forward as an advice service early on in the process, before an issue goes to formal consultation, thereby bringing together parties from both sides in order to broker a compromise. Time and again, compromise will prove essential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="61011-0017.htm_para16"><a name="06101166000727">To clarify my position, I reluctantly have to accept that we cannot keep every acute district general hospital doing everything in every town. The European working time directive, changes in practice, the move to primary care and the existence of financial deficits make that impossible. However, I will never accept that what happened at Kidderminster was right or should ever happen anywhere else. As hon. Members will know, we lost everything that makes an acute hospital an acute hospital. We lost in-patient medicine, in-patient surgery and hence, of course, the accident and emergency department.</p>

bread-and-butter emergencies and so forth. It is now well understood that in any A and E department, the bulk of emergencies requiring admission are medical and not surgical. In &#147;Keeping the NHS Local&#148;, the Government produced some models of the downgrading of hospitals that are far less severe than what happened at Kidderminster and that have been accepted by local people. One need mention only Hexham and Bishop Auckland, where emergency medicine was kept, even though emergency surgery was lost. They were able to keep what are called urgent care centres, which are a jolly sight better than the minor injuries unit that is all that Kidderminster has left.</p>

It has suddenly come to me what the Conservative party and the Labour Government regard as privatisation, and it is not the same as what most of us who worked in the NHS and most other people think. To the Government and the Conservative party, so long as the patient does not pay, we have a national health service.</p>

I absolutely take the comments of many hon. Members on both sides of the House who have pointed out the hefty involvement of the private sector. Uniformity of provision was what Bevan produced. By introducing common pay scales right across the whole country, he immediately made it just as satisfactory for the best doctors and nurses to work out in the country as in London. By privatising some of the providers, we are risking a great deal of the real good that is in the NHS, and that will be one of the battle grounds in the future.</p>

 This is an important time for the NHS&#151;change is never easy or straightforward&#151;and I should like to think that the Conservative party had called this debate to help us with our deliberations and to engage constructively in a discussion about the future of the NHS. After listening to much of what has been said today, however, I fear that the debate is simply opportunistic and an attempt to exploit some of the difficulties and challenges that are associated with change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="61011-0017.htm_para24"><a name="06101166000736">Figures that were published by the Department of Health earlier this week show that health inequalities still exist and that health outcomes for people in the north are still poorer than in the south. In the north-east, where my constituency is located, life expectancy is lower than in other areas of the country and people are still dying prematurely from cancer and circulatory diseases. Although there have clearly been huge improvements in the NHS, they have not been good enough. It is important to note that Labour Members recognise that improvements must still be made, and a number of Department of Health documents, which I will talk about later, recognise that fact and set out a strategy to address those needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="61011-0017.htm_para25"><a name="06101166000737">We need better diagnostics and quicker treatment. People need to be not only more aware of lifestyle facts, but to act on them. We need greater community support for lifestyle changes, because some of the communities that we are talking about are extremely vulnerable, with very vulnerable people living in them, and they need support to make changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="61011-0017.htm_para26"><a name="06101166000738">We also need a much greater availability of a range of low cost sport and leisure services and, to this end, I am disappointed that the Liberal Democrat council in Durham has chosen to build its new swimming pool&#151;we all applaud it for doing that&#151;in the most affluent area of the city and ignored the deprived ex-mining villages. That will not help us to reduce the health inequality gap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="61011-0017.htm_para27"><a name="06101166000739">Although challenges remain for constituencies such as mine, I want to recognise the improvement in local services. We have a new hospital in Durham and it is doing extremely well at meeting the Government&#146;s targets. The figure is 100 per cent. for all out-patient services and it is 100 per cent. for more than half of in-patient services. Things are getting better for the people I represent. We are now close to an 18-week waiting list for all services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="61011-0017.htm_para28"><a name="06101166000740">We should also note in passing that the quality of information that we now have about what is happening in our local hospitals and GP practices is excellent and enables us to see what is going wrong in a way that certainly never happened under the previous Government. A Conservative Member said that there was greater anxiety now about what was happening in the health service, but I dispute that not only because things are much better, but because there would have been huge anxiety under the previous Government if people had actually known what was happening to health services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="61011-0017.htm_para29"><a name="06101166000741">In terms of service development in Durham, we have the new hospital and new mental health services, which have not been mentioned much in the debate. Such  <br>

services are critical but, in Durham under the previous Government, they were left to languish in an old Victorian hospital with no investment whatever. We are now getting a new mental health facility with acute and community-based services. Our PCT reconfiguration will also help to deliver partnership working with the local authority across a range of services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="61011-0017.htm_para30"><a name="06101166000742">I also want, however, to refer to some of the challenges that remain. In Durham and other areas, the Government have recognised that we need a shift to more community-based services. Many more people want to have services at home or in their local community if that is at all possible. I pay tribute to the Government for producing three documents that address some of these issues. They are &#147;Health Challenge England&#148;, which was published earlier this week and gives detailed information on health inequalities and the problems that still need to be tackled; &#147;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&#148;, which looks at involving local people in making decisions about their community; and &#147;Choosing Health&#148;. Those documents are important because they help us to look at challenges resulting from demographic and technological changes and from what is happening to consumer awareness and consumer demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="61011-0017.htm_para31"><a name="06101166000743">The documents also consider several professional issues and that leads to a key point. Money needs to be directed at reducing inequalities in health and that means directing money to the areas where it is most needed. I have sat on these Benches for many debates and many Question Times listening to Conservative Members trying to defend primary care trusts that have not lived within their budgets and that seek to obtain subsidies from areas such as the one that I represent where there are poor health outcomes.</p>

 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would look at the primary care trust in Durham, which has enormous health challenges, as I outlined, yet manages to live within its budget&#151;so it is possible. To return to my point, difficult decisions have to be made and if health inequalities are to be addressed, money has to be directed towards areas that need it most and that have the poorest health outcomes.</p>

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the situation varies across the country and has a great deal to do with how effectively resources are managed. I will give him an example. The acute trust in Durham is considering how it can reduce some of the acute services where there is overcapacity and shift those resources towards primary care services. I hope that that will lead to better treatment services in local communities&#151;that is what has to happen. It is a difficult decision, and I have had to argue for it locally because the local press and opposition are trying to make out that that means cuts. It does not; it is about planning for the future and reconfiguring according to need. We on the Labour Benches have started a very important debate.</p>

As Conservative Members have said, a consensus is emerging on the way forward for the NHS&#151;a consensus on making the best use of the resources that we have. The hon.

Labour&#146;s victory in 1997 was achieved on the basis that a Labour Government would accept Conservative economic prescriptions but use that economic strength to make our education and health systems world class, too. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) said, it is greatly to the Labour party&#146;s credit that it reflected public opinion and the public&#146;s desire for world-class public services&#151;a desire for spending to increase to the European average. The measures taken at that time were opposed by the Conservatives, but my party has listened to the British people and recognised the need to change, and it is doing so.</p>

Productivity was improving sharply during the 1990s. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> If the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) will allow me, I am trying to address the root of the problem. There is a consensus about the broad approach, and we as a Parliament and as politicians need to work together to find a way forward. In the six years after 1997, however, there was only a 14 per cent. increase in hospital treatments, and according to the Office for National Statistics, productivity in the NHS has fallen by up to 1.3 per cent. each year since 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="61011-0018.htm_para13"><a name="06101166000768">Labour Members can take credit for the massively increased expenditure on the NHS, and there have been improvements in standards as a result of that investment; those points are valid and they deserve to be made.

 No, that is a very different model. It is putting GPs in the driving seat on patient care, where most people have their first, and last, contact with the health service. It is not differential funding, and that is important to remember. There is no sweetener for people trying to take a different route and opt out of the NHS. They are working with hospital doctors to ensure closer care and for more of it to be provided at GP surgeries. For many of my constituents, just getting to the hospital, even though it is very local compared with those of many hon. Members, and having a local, safe, known environment means that there is a much greater chance of them getting the treatment that will prevent some future health inequalities.

emergency admissions, and the tariff for that is much lower than those for other treatments. It is unusual for a hospital to have the high level of emergency work that the Homerton has.

People in Hackney are diagnosed with schizophrenia more often and admissions to hospital for schizophrenia are three times higher in Hackney than they are in England. The borough has unusually high rates of illness across the mental health spectrum. The factors are many and I do not have time today to go into them, but in terms of future service development, the Government&#146;s focus on delivering race equality in mental health is very welcome and pertinent to Hackney, South and Shoreditch.</p>

I commend Derman, which is a bilingual health advocacy service to the Kurdish and Turkish communities, to Ministers. It enables those communities to access a range of mental health services, and it helps to reduce hospital admissions and health inequalities, which I have not had time to discuss today. It is vital that we look at the differences between areas.</p>

as it should be. Conservative Front Benchers have introduced the possibility of separating funding for disease and funding for public health, which would allow us to have an impact on health inequalities. Despite the protestations of Labour Members, who go on and on about health inequalities, and despite the huge increases in investment, health inequalities are getting bigger.

It employs 2,300 staff, including 280 doctors, 800 nurses and midwives and a multitude of therapists and scientific and support staff. It is a success story both in the care that it delivers to patients&#151;with a top-performing accident and emergency department, waiting times for surgery met, 100 per cent. compliance with cancer waiting times and the joint lowest mortality rates in England&#151;and in the way that it develops its staff. It offers outstanding development opportunities for its staff, with 96 per cent. receiving training. The focus on staff welfare is demonstrated by the job satisfaction experienced by staff. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) commented, however, the strategic health authority is undergoing a review of acute services.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. There is huge cynicism about the consultation exercise. Proposals were meant to appear in the middle of August. That was then put off until the middle of September, and then late October. We now hear that the proposals will not come forward until the beginning of December. As the debate is about the work force and how we look after and value them, it is appalling that the Government can sit back and let such exercises go on and on while staff face huge uncertainty about their jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="61011-0019.htm_para7"><a name="06101185000034">The Government can act now and stop this.

The new chief executive of the NHS made it absolutely clear that he wants to see 60 acute trusts close. He wants more care delivered in people&#146;s homes, and that aim and vision is not inappropriate but, as ever, the closures will happen before the investment is put in.

I contend that this Government will put lives at risk if they continue in their determination to close A and E departments and to downgrade our acute trusts, which also add to the huge research base in this country.</p>

The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) criticised the &#147;Agenda for Change&#148;, introduced by the Labour Government, but I am proud that we dealt with the poverty pay in the lower NHS pay scales. I remember watching the news as I grew up, with nurses talking year after year about how they were not paid properly. Labour has introduced proper pay scales and rates for nurses. We have also developed the nursing profession through nurse consultants and the introduction of modern matrons. We have an enormous amount to be proud of.</p>

Listening to the debate, it struck me that several of my hon. Friends whose constituencies also have high levels of health inequalities said that their PCTS and acute trusts are managing their budgets and keeping within them, just as the Hull PCT has done. The East Riding PCTs did not keep within their budgets, but they serve a much more affluent, and therefore healthier, population than does Hull PCT. That is cause for thought.</p>

managers in the NHS is always to be looking at how the service can be developed.

Putting that right will lead to more savings, but the point is that we must look at service reconfiguration and redesign to ensure that the NHS is fit for the 21st century. The matter goes beyond beds, bricks and mortar: we need to keep developing our community and LIFT facilities, and we must also look at the role played by midwives who were seconded into Sure Start children&#146;s centres, as it is very important that the NHS is taken out into the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="61011-0019.htm_para21"><a name="06101166000790">I utterly disagree with the Conservative proposal to run the public health budget separately from everything else. That is completely the wrong way to go. We need to mainstream public health into everything that we do. I am very proud that the Government have taken a bold but correct approach to smoking, and we in Hull are leading the way by making sure that all children have access to healthy food every day that they are in school.

Let us hope that that promise sticks. However, most of our local maternity service&#151;probably some 2,000 deliveries a year&#151;will be lost and people will have to travel to Gloucester.

 I am sorry that I was not here earlier. I am grateful to have been called because there are difficulties in the health service in my area and I appreciate the opportunity to make a contribution. Like everybody else, I welcome all the extra funding that has gone into my local health services. I welcome the extra staff, the extra services, the proposals for a new acute hospital and the proposals for a new mental health hospital.</p>
<a name="06101166001464">
<p>I also welcome the new services and greater access that are available. For example, NHS Direct means that we do not even have to go to a GP because we can phone up for advice. Like many people, I have used the service in situations such as when one is anxious about a child late at night. I also welcome the shorter time taken in accident and emergency. We can now go in with a kid with an injury who can see a nurse, have an X-ray and be out within a couple of hours, which is phenomenal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para0"><a name="06101166000802">While all that is happening, however, there are cuts to services because of deficits. We need a real understanding of what is happening. Our acute trust is in deficit for particular reasons, but not because it has been hugely incompetent. The financial management of the hospital has improved greatly, but it has experienced difficulties. Our PCT is in deficit, which has led to the mental health trust being made to take some of the strain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para1"><a name="06101166000803">The kind of cuts that we have experienced include stopping all IVF treatment on the NHS, which puts it back to being subject to a postcode lottery, which is something against which I and others have campaigned for a long time. I think that the same thing has happened elsewhere. Several treatments have been cut, including some that are not so minor. There are proposals to cut all talking therapies in the mental health services and to cut access to certain drugs on NHS prescriptions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para2"><a name="06101166000804">Although I will not take up my full time, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I must tell my right hon. Friend the Secretary  <br>

of State that while I, like others, welcome the big picture&#151;I think that it is wonderful&#151;a lot of people will focus on whether they can get the treatment that they want at the time that they want it. One might say that that is a little picture, but it is their picture and it is important to them, and that is why some of the cuts and the ways in which the deficits have been managed have been painful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para3"><a name="06101166000805">Some will judge the situation on their perception of their job security, given that the NHS is a huge employer. Its staff also use its service, and it is really important that those involved in service design take the staff with them, but that has not happened, especially locally. We sometimes talk about service development as though it is about only new services and more money, but some aspects of it are intensely painful. For example, it is about moving services not only from the hospital to the community but, in my area, from the hospice to the community. Changes in palliative care mean that people want to die at home, but that might result in cuts in services at a hospice in which people might have seen their friends or family die and for which they might have raised funds. The process of change can thus be difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para4"><a name="06101166000806">The Conservative party&#146;s focus on staff development is completely hypocritical. One of the big arguments about funding is that all the extra money that has gone to the NHS has not been properly spent. Yes, a lot of it has been spent on pay rises&#151;quite rightly so&#151;and that has of course affected the productivity figures. The pay increases have not been small. In London and the south-east during the 1990s, when I was chair of a community health council, the contract staff who cleaned hospitals in the NHS were on &#163;2 an hour. The increase in salary up to the minimum wage and beyond affects the unit cost of all work done in hospitals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para5"><a name="06101166000807">It is also not true that deficits are something new. When I was first selected as a candidate in Northampton, the local health authority was faced with deficits in the financial year 1995-96 because it had overspent. It took the decision to keep the following year&#146;s spending on services the same and to hold reviews to deal with the funding problems. It simply carried out deficit budgeting, as it is known in local government, and rolled the deficit on. Deficits in the NHS are thus not new; what has changed is the way with which they are dealt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para6"><a name="06101166000808">If the public ever fell for the Conservative party&#146;s blandishments about the NHS, they would live bitterly to regret it. There is no doubt that ours is the party that has always delivered for the NHS, and that is what got many of us into politics. I remind my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, however, that we must not just make change, but manage change. We must take the public with us and we must recognise that treatments that might seem minor to us are major to the people at the receiving end. It is important that people&#146;s experience of the NHS is that they receive the treatment that they want, that they can talk through the process and that they can see clearly that the NHS is safe in Labour&#146;s hands.</p>

of the debate in such sartorially elegant fashion? I wish that I could be as gallant about what she has done to hospital provision in my Reigate constituency, but I am afraid that I cannot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para7"><a name="06101166000810">The debate has been characterised by a remarkable contrast. A number of Government Members have said how splendid things are in their constituency and how cross they are about the prospect of their budgets being put at risk so that deficits can be dealt with&#151;deficits that, by a remarkable coincidence, seem to be in trusts represented by Conservative Members. It is beyond belief that all the incompetent NHS managers have ended up in Conservative constituencies, while all the brilliant managers have somehow ended up in Labour constituencies. The principal acute trust in my constituency&#151;Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust&#151;is about to appoint its seventh chief executive since 1997. It may be the sixth chief executive&#151;I may be one out, as it is easy to lose count.</p>

Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) and my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) made about the independence of the health service. The speech of the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard) was instructive. He wanted the ability to interfere politically in the provision of health care in his constituency. What happened in my constituency is nothing short of a disgrace. On 19 December last year, the Secretary of State overturned a recommendation for a new hospital in Sutton in favour of a new hospital at St. Helier, at the explicit request of her hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) solely on the basis of evidence provided by the hon. Lady.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para9"><a name="06101166000812">Earlier in our debate, the Secretary of State told us that she took that decision on the basis of health inequalities. The only problem with that explanation is that she received advice that directly contradicts that explanation from her own adviser on the NHS in London, Dr. Sue Atkinson, on health inequalities and the merits of that decision. Dr. Atkinson&#146;s advice to the Secretary of State was unequivocal:</p>
<a name="61011-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="06101166001543"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I recommend that you should therefore accept the judgment of the local NHS on the location of the Critical Care Hospital...to be at Sutton.&#148;</p>

Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) made the point that decisions in which the Secretary of State had intervened had not been referred to the independent reconfiguration panel, and nor was the decision in my area. I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that there is a case for independent review when the Secretary of State intends to overrule the decision of the local health community. If the Secretary of State is minded to accept a recommendation&#151;in this case, the unanimous decision of the local medical establishment that a new hospital at Sutton was the right decision&#151;I do not think that there is a case for the Secretary of State to go to the independent reconfiguration panel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para11"><a name="06101166000814">The Secretary of State&#146;s decision was so outrageous that Reigate and Banstead borough council and Surrey county council decided, having taken counsel&#146;s advice, to seek judicial review of that decision because it was unreasonable. The first stage of the process was complete, a case to answer was identified and a court date had been set, but on 16 August the Secretary of  <br>

State reversed her decision, pending another review. That is one of the cover-ups that always goes on when there has been political interference. That case was direct political interference in the interests of the Labour party in Mitcham and Morden: I can say that because the Government have form, as the same thing happened at the southern end of my constituency. I notice that the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) is present. We have had this debate on numerous occasions and I will not repeat it now, except to say that one month before the 2001 general election, the Secretary of State directly interfered, at the request of the hon. Member for Crawley, to affect a decision in the political interests of the Labour party in Crawley.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para12"><a name="06101166000815">The hon. Lady has defended herself, saying that she will go on intervening to defend her constituents&#146; interests. I know, as well as she does, that what she did was not in the interests of her constituents or of all the people who were being provided with acute hospital care in the area. It was not the right decision, and it has taken another four or five years for Crawley hospital to be extracted from the provision of acute care by the acute hospital trust. I am delighted that it is now the responsibility of the hon. Lady&#146;s local primary care trust, and it is now out of the hair of the managers who are trying to provide acute hospital care.</p>

 It probably is right that the hon. Gentleman give way, so that I can give the House my account, rather than his account of what he thinks I was doing. I will continue to campaign, and the hon.

 In 2001, the hon. Lady enjoyed the benefit of that political interference, and in the 2005 general election she enjoyed the biggest swing in the country against a Labour candidate. The people of Crawley rumbled her and she was very nearly replaced as their Member in this House&#151;her majority was only 32 votes.</p>

Why? What has changed? The political party representing the constituency of Hammersmith and Fulham is the only thing that has changed.</p>

I absolutely commend the splitting of public health provision to address directly the issues of health inequalities. The acute provision&#151;the critical care provision&#151;should then be done on a properly assessed basis. Haste the day that we can get to that point and take the corruption of party politics out of the provision of health care in this country.</p>

telling us that everything is well, and Opposition Members pointing out problems. As ever, the truth probably lies somewhere in between. However, the specific subject of the debate is staff cuts and the surrounding financial environment, on which I wish to touch briefly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para15"><a name="06101166000821">There are many different ways in which the constraints on the health service are impacting on the way that it is run. I am very pleased that the Secretary of State is in her seat, so that I can mention one of them. Sterilisation of instruments is increasingly being centralised and as that is happening, operations are being cancelled, which is decreasing the efficiency of the health service. Next Monday, a report will be published showing a 21 per cent. increase in the number of operations cancelled, purely as a result of the centralisation of sterilisation of instruments used in operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para16"><a name="06101166000822">I have a letter from a constituent who said that last week, she was in the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in Welwyn Garden City waiting for her operation. She came in the day before, so she used a hospital bed, in which she was put up overnight. A high-dependency bed was booked for her the day after her operation. She spent the entire day in the waiting room&#151;the anteroom, as she calls it&#151;awaiting surgery, only to be told that the operating implements were dirty and that no more could be obtained in time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para17"><a name="06101166000823">It was not only my constituent&#146;s operation that was cancelled that day; 10 others were also cancelled. Surely it cannot be long&#151;it has probably already happened in the QEII hospital and elsewhere where centralisation is taking place&#151;before somebody is on the operating table and is cut open, only for it to be found that an instrument of a different size or nature is required to finish the task. I know that that happens in operations&#151;I once had my clavicle operated on, and exactly that happened. If no instruments are available, the person has to be sewn back together and told to come back another day. I tell the Secretary of State that that is an unacceptable situation, which is a direct consequence of the financial crisis that we are experiencing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para18"><a name="06101166000824">Another fact, sourced through a freedom of information request, is that there has been a 40 per cent. increase in the number of operations cancelled merely for administrative reasons, because, for example, the operating theatre had not been booked or the patient&#146;s notes not sent&#151;even because the patient had not been told that the operation would be taking place. In a period of only three years, a 40 per cent. increase in cancelled operations for such reasons is of real concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para19"><a name="06101166000825">I would appreciate the Secretary of State taking this point on board: 640 operations are cancelled every day, simply due to administrative cock-up&#151;640 throughout the NHS. That is a huge figure. On Monday, I shall be supplying her with the figures, so that she can see for herself. They have been obtained from all the hospital trusts through the freedom of information procedure, and I shall be interested to know what action the right hon. Lady intends to take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para20"><a name="06101166000826">Time is short, so I shall conclude by mentioning Hatfield hospital. The Secretary of State will be aware  <br>

that her predecessor visited Hatfield before the election when a Health Minister held my seat with a dodgy majority.

We are about to lose A and E, maternity, paediatrics and much more besides. That simply does not add up.

 When the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) spoke, she was very content about the fact that her PCT was breaking even. However, she failed to mention one vital fact: every person in Hackney has &#163;2,000 a year spent on them. In the Prime Minister&#146;s constituency, the amount is &#163;1,300 a year and the average for England is &#163;1,200, while in my constituency the average is only &#163;900 a year. It is thus hardly surprising to discover that my PCT is &#163;43 million in deficit across the SHA and that, as a result, health provision in North Wiltshire is in a deep and damaging crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para22"><a name="06101166000829">It was tragic to drive past Malmesbury hospital the other day and see the barriers behind which it was being demolished. It is tragic to hear that maternity services at Chippenham are so badly underfunded that there are no staff, so the services can no longer be provided. It is tragic that according to a consultation paper currently out for consideration up to seven community hospitals across the county of Wiltshire could be closed. It is tragic that the Royal United hospital in Bath, which serves my constituency, is laying off about 300 people and closing 60 beds, and that the Great Western hospital in Swindon is laying off 198 people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para23"><a name="06101166000830">When we put all those facts alongside the failure to provide dentistry and proper GP services in parts of my rural constituency, they amount to a significant crisis in health care in North Wiltshire. Whether that is the fault of the Labour party, senior managers or me, I know not, but I can tell the Secretary of State one thing in the few moments remaining for my speech: if she thinks that the NHS is having its best-ever year, I challenge her to visit North Wiltshire and see what I see in my constituency surgery every Saturday. Let her go to Malmesbury hospital, now being destroyed, to Chippenham hospital where destruction is imminent and to the seven hospitals in my area that are threatened with closure and then tell me that all is well with the health service in Wiltshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para26"><a name="06101166000834">After my hon. Friend&#146;s excellent opening speech, we heard from the Chairman of the Select Committee, the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), who called for more evidence to build on some of the anecdotal points. I do not see him in his place, but he rather uncharacteristically spent his time hair splitting on the semantics of whether we are talking about &#147;posts&#148; or &#147;jobs&#148; in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="61011-0020.htm_para27"><a name="06101166000835">Our debate is more likely to be remembered for the outstanding contributions of two former Secretaries of State for Health, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell). My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe rightly said that there was a remarkable consensus about the partnership approach that we all adopt to supporting the NHS. He also rightly argued that, because of some of the Government&#146;s actions and despite good will, we are in danger of seeing reform being given a bad name, when we need the money and reform to ride together. He was particularly concerned about the short-term expediency forced on so many NHS organisations through financial pressures and cuts. His major point was that those factors are unlikely to lead to greater efficiencies, so productivity is damaged&#151;a point strongly reinforced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood when he said that a once in a lifetime chance to reform the NHS and its productivity had been fluffed. He argued that it was important to challenge moves to take resources out of community services, which represent an easy hit for a Government attempting to correct financial incompetence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="61011-0021.htm_para0"><a name="06101166000836">Those two remarkable speeches were followed by that of the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), who reminded us&#151;more a revelation than a reminder for Opposition Members&#151;that at the parliamentary Labour party meeting on Monday, the Prime Minister had urged Labour MPs to attack Conservatives on the so-called &#147;marketisation agenda&#148;, as the Prime Minister is alleged to have put it. The hon. Member for Pendle thought, &#147;Goodness me&#148;, recognising that that seemed to be the pot calling the kettle black. Moreover, he then said that the Government had Maoist tendencies in pursuing a ceaseless recovery and reorganisation programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="61011-0021.htm_para1"><a name="06101166000837">My right hon. and hon. Friends made many good speeches. My right hon. Friend the Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates) spoke about the importance of continuing commitment to our community hospitals and my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) coupled praise for local NHS staff with concern for the future of medical provision in his area. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="61011-0021.htm_para2"><a name="06101166000838">My hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) made a very powerful and balanced speech about delay to a new facility, despite all the promises that had gone before, and the necessary closure of an organisation&#151;something that he supported, so long as it was replaced by another&#151;and about the disappointment that has attended the process. The speech that followed was a plea by my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) not to downgrade the Horton general district hospital in his constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="61011-0021.htm_para3"><a name="06101166000839">Many Labour Members spoke, but it would take up too much time to recite the points that they were seeking to make. However, it was a question of deciding at what point in the 10 minutes allocated to all Back-Bench Members that the rose-tinted spectacles fell and the word &#147;but&#148; was used to launch the plea that they wanted to make about their own constituencies to try to stop the Government doing what they were about to do, or to ask the Government to do something that they had already indicated that they were not prepared to do. That was quite characteristic and particularly notable in the speech of the hon. Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall). However, it is fair to say that there were some honourable exceptions, not least the hon. Member for Pendle, but also the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), who spoke quite late in the debate and made a constructive set of criticisms, to which I hope Ministers were listening carefully.</p>

 To try to avoid the ding-dong to which the hon. Gentleman refers and in the interests of trying to make the NHS better, will he tell us what three steps the Conservative party would take to improve productivity in the NHS?</p>

 It is very interesting that, ever since I have been a Member, the hon. Gentleman has always asked that question, whatever the subject. He ought to reflect on the very significant and strategic offer that my party is making&#151;to try to remove the politics from the NHS, to stop politicians from meddling in the NHS and to create independence&#151;which is in sharp distinction to the view expressed by the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="61011-0021.htm_para4"><a name="06101166000842">Numerous other speeches were made, but time does not allow me to go into them. Instead, it would be helpful to hear serious responses from the Minister to the serious questions about the NHS work force, whose morale is being sapped by the concerns that are now attendant to all NHS organisations. Will he postpone the full implementation of the European working time directive from 2009 to 2012? I am sure that he can ask the Secretary of State about that, because she was responsible for those negotiations when at the Department of Trade and Industry. She now has responsibility for what we hope at the very least will be a push to amend the directive, given its effect, so that the challenges that now face NHS doctors can be met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="61011-0021.htm_para5"><a name="06101166000843">Will nurses and physiotherapists now be guaranteed a year&#146;s employment, following their training, as happens in Scotland? At the moment, many people who have chosen to dedicate themselves to those professions find that they are not given the opportunity to build their experience immediately after they finish training. That is having a major effect on their employability, as they require hands-on experience to progress to become essential members of the NHS work force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="61011-0021.htm_para6"><a name="06101166000844">It would be very helpful if the Minister could tell us what evidence the Government have to show the true causes of job losses, redundancies, lost posts and the freeze on filling vacancies. Given the constraints, the financial crises that exist in so many of our NHS organisations, the working time directive and the staff shortages, what are the financial effects as against the desire to improve patient care and safety? Let it be said that no one is against all change, but change should take place only to improve patient care and patient safety, not for short-term expediency, to cover a financial crisis caused by financial incompetence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="61011-0021.htm_para7"><a name="06101166000845">On the NHS work force, we also have concerns about, for example, school nurses, hospital chaplains and dentists, but it is important to ask the Minister to ensure that he answers the specific, serious questions that have been asked today. That is what is required to make the NHS improve and build on the best.</p>

 This has been a lively and entertaining debate with a range of excellent contributions. Many of the contributions from Labour Members have told of an improving NHS that is on the way to ending long waits and that has new facilities and services. There have been measured contributions from the Opposition Members who sought to take a balanced view of how we see through some of the challenges that the NHS faces. We have also had, however, the road-to-Damascus speeches from the newfound defenders of the NHS on the Conservative Benches. Every single one of them without exception stood at the last election on a pledge to take money out of the NHS through the patient&#146;s passport. Today we hear a different tune, and that gives the electorate a problem. Who means it and who does not? To help the House,  <br>

 Will the Minister tell me what improvements there will be to the health service from making 2,000 expectant mothers every year travel 20 miles from Hastings, which is an area of social deprivation, and the surrounding area to the district general hospital in Eastbourne? What is improving the health service about that?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is alone if he thinks that there have been no improvements to the health service and his hon. Friends have pointed them out today.</p>

The shadow Health Secretary talked about independence and he was right to uphold the independence of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in supporting the difficult job that it does. I applaud him for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="61011-0021.htm_para10"><a name="06101166000853">The hon. Member for Northavon raised questions about independent sector treatment centres. May I point out that we pay significantly less for operations done through the private sector using this system than the extra premium that was paid in the past? He mentioned physios, as did many others, and there are genuine issues there. We are working with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy to address these matters. We have removed physiotherapy from the list of shortage occupations for work permits and are working with NHS employers to make more junior posts available. However, I take his point on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="61011-0021.htm_para11"><a name="06101166000854">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) made a measured and important speech. He more than anybody knows the interplay between the NHS and politics and the important issues that that raises. He congratulated my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on the referral of more cases to the independent reconfiguration panel and he had important things to say about urgent care and the delivery of urgent medicine without necessarily having to have the back-up of other acute facilities. I look forward to hearing how his meeting with the NHS chief executive goes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="61011-0021.htm_para12"><a name="06101166000855">The hon. Gentleman made points about the private sector, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice). I assume that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents are like mine and want 18-week maximum waits for treatment from the end of 2008. I also assume that he does not want stranded NHS capacity all round the country once we have met that target, so I hope that he will take it on board that, when it is sensible to use the private sector to help the NHS, we will continue to do so.</p>

People can draw their own conclusions, but it is dangerous information that the Tories are seeking to put into the public domain. My hon. Friends the Members for Dudley, North (Mr. Austin) and for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) did a forensic analysis of Tory health policy and the dissembling statements from the Conservative party.

 I will not give way. I almost had to pinch myself. In a debate on NHS staff, a Tory Member of Parliament was taking away the credit for paying cleaners and porters more than the pittance that they received under his Government.

 Such points are left to local discretion. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is compounding the point: he is again making an argument against &#147;Agenda for Change&#148; during a Conservative-inspired debate on protection for NHS staff. Today&#146;s pose is that the Tories are the friends of NHS staff. Their campaign pack has a petition, no less, to show support for the staff of our NHS. NHS staff will remember driving past advertising billboards at the last election. &#147;How hard is it to clean a hospital?&#148; the Tories sneered from those billboards. It was a derogatory swipe at NHS cleaners that was no doubt authorised by one of the campaign chiefs, Mr. &#147;Bring me sunshine&#148; himself, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron). We see in the campaign pack a tissue of inaccurate figures and shameless contradictions&#151;a document that is completely intellectually dishonest. Like the right hon. Gentleman, I have not done many real jobs in my life, but I was once responsible for preparing such documents, and that is one of the worst of its kind that I have seen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="61011-0021.htm_para18"><a name="06101166000869">On fairer funding, the document urges councils to pass a motion to provide funding to reflect accurately the burden of disease, but then it urges Tory activists to criticise the funding given to Greater Manchester primary care trusts, which have the lowest life expectancy in the country, where people get sicker younger, and where there are more people living with chronic disease. The Tory version of fairer funding means taking funding from areas such as Greater Manchester. Will the hon.

<p><a name="st_o422"><a name="06101166001421"><a name="61011-0022.htm_spnew0"><a name="06101166002545"><b>Sir Patrick Cormack (South Staffordshire) (Con):</b>
 I am grateful to have this opportunity to raise an important subject, which is obviously dear to the heart of most of my hon. Friends. However, I am glad to see that my friend, the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) is in his place, and I hope that he has the good fortune to catch your eye after I have made my remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am also delighted that the Minister is here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para4"><a name="06101166001422">Anybody who visits London at the moment could be forgiven for thinking that our museums and galleries are in a fine state. There are three wonderful exhibitions: there is &#147;Holbein&#148; at the Tate; there is &#147;Velázquez&#148; at the National Gallery, which is due to open next week; and there is &#147;Rodin&#148; at the Royal Academy. Those are exhibitions of world class and importance, and they add lustre to our capital city. However, they do not tell the whole story, because our museums and galleries face a crisis, although it is not the first crisis that they have faced in my 36 years in this House. Indeed, 30 years ago in 1976, I produced a book, &#147;Heritage in danger&#148;, in which I sought to outline some of the difficulties facing our museums, galleries, country houses and churches at that time. At that time, I was writing shortly after the sale of the first &#163;1 million picture, which had escaped the National Gallery. I was also writing before we had a National Heritage Memorial Fund and long before we had a lottery. Progress has therefore been made. One is grateful for things that successive Governments have done. None of the exhibitions to which I referred a few moments ago could take place without the Government indemnity that is available for our great national museums and institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para5"><a name="06101166001423">As I speak, however, all the directors of those national museums and galleries are being asked how they could cut 7 per cent. of their annual budget. I appreciate that that is the beginning of a negotiating position, but it does not augur well. As the national art collections fund, or the Art Fund, as it is more popularly known, has pointed out, even were there a standstill on funding for the next three years, that would amount to a 15 per cent. cut in real terms. That is a danger and a worry to the staff who work in those museums and galleries, and it endangers scholarship itself, which fortifies the great exhibitions to which I have referred and the many others that have been held in our great capital city and around the country over the past several years. Scholarship is an integral part of any great museum or gallery. If we take that away, we take away the intellectual underpinning, which would be a great disservice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para6"><a name="06101166001424">To compound all that, our museums and galleries have no earmarked funds for acquisitions and have not had them since 1993. Again, as the Art Fund has pointed out, that dire situation is at a time when art prices are rocketing. I am not just talking about the Klimt that sold for some &#163;73 million a few months ago but the wonderful Titian that has adorned the walls of the National Gallery for many years and is now  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="11 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 417</b><br>
withdrawn, about to be sold, with the price put on it varying between &#163;60 million and &#163;80 million&#151;who knows? Those are works of enormous importance, which we should seek to retain wherever possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para7"><a name="06101166001425">The situation is made even more dire by the fact that the National Heritage Memorial Fund&#146;s budget has been pared down to &#163;5 million. We are told that it will be increased to &#163;10 million, which is welcome. I was one of those who struggled to establish it, in the wake of Mentmore, and it began with an annual budget of &#163;25 million&#151;that is getting on for 30 years ago. In 1995, the Heritage Lottery Fund gave 10 per cent. of its annual budget, amounting to &#163;18.5 million, towards acquisitions for museums and galleries. In the last full year for which figures are available, it gave 0.7 per cent.&#151;just &#163;2.25 million. Also, the chairman has made it honestly plain that acquisitions are not a priority for the Heritage Lottery Fund. The Art Fund&#151;for all the wonderful work that it does in galvanising public opinion and producing fine grants&#151;cannot really sustain what we need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para8"><a name="06101166001426">It is not just museums and galleries that are affected but our national archives, from which we received representations making this point:</p>
<a name="61011-0022.htm_brev1"><a name="06101166001545"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The growth of a market for historical and literary manuscripts in recent years has not been matched by an increase in the resources available for the purchase of such collections.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para9"><a name="06101166001427">Wherever one looks, one finds that problem. The Art Fund also makes the point that museums and galleries may passively acquire things from time to time through generous gift or benefaction, but the intelligent creative process of building up collections by seeking out new works to complement existing ones has, for most, come to an end, even in London, the richest part of the country. As for the west midlands, from which the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central and I come, that is one of the three poorest regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para10"><a name="06101166001428">Acceptance in lieu, which has been a godsend for museums and galleries over the years, is in danger, because if the owner of a great work of art has to re-roof his house, he is bound to be tempted by a buoyant market. Who can blame people for not choosing to go down the in lieu route?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para11"><a name="06101166001429">Why do we need new acquisitions? A paper submitted by the National Gallery to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee earlier this year stated:</p>
<a name="61011-0022.htm_brev2"><a name="06101166001546"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;New acquisitions generate excitement, attract new audiences, and enliven the Gallery&#146;s education programme&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para12"><a name="06101166001430">The paper also points out that since the foundation of the National Gallery in 1824, Parliament has been at the forefront of acquisitions policy. We have a national duty and responsibility, which our forebears accepted and we must shoulder in our turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para13"><a name="06101166001431">I hope that the Minister, whom I am delighted to see in his place, will listen carefully to those who point out that museums and galleries now face far more significant ministerial interference in how they are run than they have for many years, but their funding becomes increasingly inadequate with each year that goes by. It may be argued that the sums are large, with one picture selling for &#163;73 million. In the context of our national budget, those sums are tiny. Even in the context of the dome and, dare one say it, the Olympics, they are insignificant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para14"><a name="06101166001432">I wish to place some solutions before the Minister this evening. The National Gallery, in its submission to the Committee, says that it would be helped immeasurably if its purchase grants were restored to 1983 levels&#151;or just over &#163;7 million. More than that could be done. The National Heritage Memorial Fund, which was set up originally as the land fund to commemorate those who gave their lives in the war, could and should be augmented. The Heritage Lottery Fund could be directed to give more money to acquisitions. It is not the Minister&#146;s particular responsibility, but the Government have plundered the lottery in a way that is regarded by many of those of us who helped to found it as shameful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para15"><a name="06101166001433">The export reviewing committee is the body that examines works and decides whether they should be exported, and more are slipping through the net because the money is not available to retain them. The chairman of the committee, Lord Inglewood, has called for a national acquisitions fund. That is not a new idea, as it was first proposed by the Treasury in 1922.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para16"><a name="06101166001434">I ask the Minister to talk not only to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, but to the Chancellor about new incentives. For example, we could extend the in lieu provisions to taxes other than inheritance, which could provide a great fillip at a time when the Government appear reluctant to provide the sort of sums that they should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para17"><a name="06101166001435">We like to call ourselves a civilised nation. I believe that we are, but if we allow the great monuments of our forebears, symbolic of our civilisation, to fall into ruin, and if we allow our great museums and galleries, repositories of some of the greatest collections in the world, to stagnate&#151;set in amber with no new works added&#151;we are not fulfilling our duty as guardians of the civilisation of this nation. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide some crumbs of comfort in his reply&#151;not to me, because I do not matter at all&#151;but to those who run our great museums and galleries and bear responsibility for our archives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para18"><a name="06101166001436">I am not speaking in any partisan sense. I had the good fortune to help to found the all-party arts and heritage group in the mid-1970s to campaign against the wealth tax that was threatened at that time. The group still flourishes: I am its chairman, and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central is one of its officers. We have more than 300 members, in both Houses and of all parties. We go out to look at exhibitions or gather in Committee Rooms upstairs to listen to the curators and directors of our museums and galleries. I did not consult with every one of them before making this speech, but I have little doubt that all of them would endorse it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para19"><a name="06101166001437">Dr. Charles Saumarez Smith is the director of the National Gallery. It is as a result of his presentation a few months ago that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central and I decided to try for a debate in the House on this matter. I hope that it will help to bring to a wider public the fact that we face a crisis. I hope that the Minister will not respond by saying, as one of his very illustrious predecessors in the Labour party never did say, &#147;What crisis?&#148;</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) on securing this debate. I tried to do so, but had no success, whereas he has succeeded heroically. He has been generous enough to allow me a couple of minutes of his hard-won time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para20"><a name="06101166001439">I do not disagree with a word of what the hon. Gentleman said. He has great knowledge and experience of these matters, and he has shown a tremendous understanding of them over the years. That is especially true of his contribution tonight, in which he highlighted the concrete problems of acquisition budgets and funding and also pinpointed the necessity that the acquisition process be underpinned by scholarship. That is a crucial matter, but too often forgotten. Without that scholarship, our great collections would be almost nothing: this country&#146;s great tradition of curatorship is threatened by the fact that so many posts are vacant, but we would be in a bad condition without it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para21"><a name="06101166001440">The hon. Member for South Staffordshire has said everything admirably, and I have nothing to add apart from one further point that he did not have time to cover. I want to deal with the difficulties that the acquisition of contemporary art is faced with as a result of the problem that he described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para22"><a name="06101166001441">Contemporary art has always been the Cinderella of the acquisition budget, but it has probably needed less money than, say, the Halifax Titian, which was mentioned earlier. However, if our national and regional galleries and museums do not buy contemporary art now, our children and grandchildren will look at this age and fall to wondering. They will see that we had great and extraordinary artists such as Anthony Gormley, Damien Hirst and Jenny Saville, but also that the work of those artists is not in our national collections. There will be a horrible gap, resembling the one evident when the Tate trustees would not buy European art just after the war. The Tate has an extraordinary collection of 20th century art, but the gap means that it cannot be a great international collection. However, that is not the fault of the present directors and curators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para23"><a name="06101166001442">We need to acquire contemporary art. The scheme that allowed such acquisition was the one administered by the Contemporary Art Society, but it was funded by the arts lottery and was therefore time limited. The scheme expired last year, and nothing has replaced it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para24"><a name="06101166001443">There are 15 regional museums and galleries in this country&#151;including the ones in Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Southampton and the Towner gallery in Eastbourne&#151;and they are no longer able to buy contemporary art. That is a disaster. Moreover, the acquisition scheme disbursed small sums of money to curators that allowed them to travel abroad and meet agents and artists. The closure of the scheme means that they have had to cease all that activity. There is going to be an enormous gap in our regional arts galleries and museums. That is a very small problem in the context of a much larger, more important problem, but it is significant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para25"><a name="06101166001444">I hope that, as the Minister goes to regional museums, he will ask them about that and hear from them how important it is that we buy the work of this  <br>

generation of British artists, which happens to be a particularly fine generation, so that our children and grandchildren will look back and see what an age we lived in. If we do not replace that Society and Arts Council lottery scheme&#151;of course, the people who should do that are the people at the Arts Council, who just happen to be the administrators of the arts lottery scheme that pulled the plug on things&#151;we are going to be looking at an awfully bleak future.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) for raising the issue today and for the contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher). Before I address the points that have been raised, may I say a few words setting out the Government&#146;s position and the great importance that we attach to this issue? Collections, and the acquisitions that feed them, are clearly, as we have heard, the lifeblood of our museums and galleries. They are the raison d&#146;être behind all the interpretative, curatorial and conservation work that museums and galleries do, and the rationale behind the educational and social programmes that they run. Without a living collection and the ebb and flow of new acquisitions and loans, a museum can start to lose its way to the point at which collections may stagnate and people may lose interest and stop coming to visit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para26"><a name="06101166001446">However, collections cannot be seen in isolation. The most dazzling and ever-changing collection is of little use to anyone if it is not displayed and kept in safe and secure surroundings, if it is not interpreted, put in context and brought alive by expert curators, and if it is not conserved and, when necessary, restored by skilled technicians and craftsmen. That is why, since 1997, we have invested across the whole of the museums sector, and why we did not reverse the decision taken by the Conservative Government in 1992 to scrap ring-fenced acquisition funds. A one-size-fits-all approach to cultural spending was not right then and it is not right today either. Our starting point in cultural investment is that the professional people in the museums themselves&#151;both staff and trustees&#151;are far better placed to decide how their resources should be allocated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para27"><a name="06101166001447">This Government have absolutely nothing to apologise for on funding. With the greatest respect to the hon. Member for South Staffordshire, let us just consider the facts. Spending by my Department on our sponsored museums and galleries has increased from &#163;205 million in 1997 to &#163;294 million today. That is a real terms increase of nearly 16 per cent. By 2008, we will have invested &#163;150 million in the renaissance in the regions programme. That is the first ever sustained programme of central Government investment in the infrastructure of our regional museums. I have visited Hull, Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle to see that renaissance in the regions programme. It is absolutely wonderful to see how our regional museums are being revived, when they were really in quite a desperate condition before. There is a revitalisation of museums across the country, reversing decades of under-investment and equipping the museum work force with the skills that they need to thrive in the 21st century.  <br>

<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 421</b><br>
That includes the training necessary to identify and acquire the contemporary art and artefacts that will revitalise our collections. The National Heritage Memorial Fund&#151;its grant from my Department will double next year, by the way&#151;has committed more than &#163;135 million for acquisitions of cultural property since 1980, including more than &#163;30 million for archive and special library collections.</p>

<p><a name="st_o425"><a name="06101166001448"><a name="61011-0022.htm_spnew2"><a name="06101166002548"><b>Sir Patrick Cormack:</b>
 The Minister really cannot get away with that one. I have listened to quite a lot on which I would have liked to intervene, but the National Heritage Memorial Fund&#151;I was one of those who helped to found it&#151;started off with a budget that was much bigger than the one that it is going to have at the end of the year. Of course, we welcome the extra &#163;5 million, but the figure is still &#163;15 million less than the &#163;25 million that it had. We should not led the Minister pretend that that is a success, because it is not.</p>

<p><a name="st_o426"><a name="06101166001449"><a name="61011-0022.htm_spnew3"><a name="06101166002549"><b>Mr. Lammy:</b>
 It is slightly misleading to say that the budget started off at &#163;25 million. The money that is put into the pot is investment that grows year on year. We have sought to double the yearly sum from &#163;5 million to &#163;10 million. This is not as simplistic as saying that there was &#163;25 million in year one, all of which was spent, and that there was then another &#163;25 million, because the fund never worked like that. The fact is that we are doubling the sum. The hon. Gentleman is slightly skewing the perception of the facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para28"><a name="06101166001450">Of course, we have had the Heritage Lottery Fund since 1994. The fund has made grants to museums, galleries and archives of nearly &#163;1.5 billion, including &#163;141 million for museums and galleries for works of art and other objects. On top of that, several forms of tax relief are available to help private owners to give, and public institutions to receive, important cultural objects. The conditional exemption allows estates to defer settlement of inheritance tax bills in exchange for public access to fine works. Douceurs&#151;or sweeteners, if one prefers&#151;make private treaty sales of works of art to public institutions more tax effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para29"><a name="06101166001451">One of the most successful ways of utilising the generosity of the Treasury is of course the acceptance in lieu scheme, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. I use the word &#147;generosity&#148; without irony because acceptance in lieu is in nearly every way the holy grail of public policy. Absolutely everybody is a winner under the scheme. Owners of pre-eminent works of art and artefacts have their inheritance tax demands discounted when they offer their works in lieu of cash to settle the bill. The work of art in question is then saved for the nation, with public access guaranteed for ever, and the museum to which it is allocated gains a fine work for its collection at no cost to its ever-stretched budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="61011-0022.htm_para30"><a name="06101166001452">Our experience is that the position of museums in this country is by no means as bleak as some would suggest. I certainly would not characterise the position as a crisis, or dire. Indeed, the national museums and galleries that are sponsored by my Department have never before in the history of this country had access to so much investment, and I do not think that any hon. Member, or indeed any gallery director, would challenge that statement.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman indicates that he would challenge the statement that museums in this country have never had as much investment as they have now. I am surprised by that because the facts do not bear that out&#151;I am sure that his maths is better than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="61011-0023.htm_para0"><a name="06101166001455">The situation is thanks to the Government&#146;s commitment to the sector and our belief that the best of our cultural heritage should be open to everyone, regardless of their background. The public repaid our faith by visiting in their tens of millions after the financial barrier of charging and the insidious snobbery of elitism were swept away. There was an almost 66 per cent. increase in attendance at museums that used to charge after that charge was waived. The hon. Gentleman says that the Government are meddling in our museums, but that is about ensuring that our museums are free. We wish to ensure that our museums receive people from socially excluded groups so that the collections are enjoyed not solely by the sort of people who are fortunate enough to grace the House, but by the people of this country. I make absolutely no apology as a Culture Minister for the fact that we wish to ensure that the collections are available for everyone to enjoy.</p>

 Sadly, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party did nothing about it. It took the election of a Labour Government in 1997 to take the issue seriously. I am sorry, but I will not take any lectures from him on that point.</p>

Gentleman knows. In addition, there is a safety net that helps to give UK institutions a second chance when pre-eminent items are threatened with export. For the record, I have used that mechanism on a number of occasions to ensure that valuable treasures remain in the country. Our system of export licence deferrals has remained pretty much the same for more than 50 years. It has the respect of the trade, as well as an international reputation for common sense and even-handedness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="61011-0023.htm_para2"><a name="06101166001459">I am very pleased to be able to tell the House that, last year, more than 50 per cent of the items on which the Government put a temporary export stop were saved, in addition to the hundreds of items saved since the reviewing committee was set up by a previous Government in 1952. Exquisite pieces as varied as &#147;The Death of Actaeon&#148; by Titian, Canova&#146;s &#147;Three Graces&#148;, a 102-piece Sèvres dinner service presented to the Duke of Wellington, and the Macclesfield psalter have all been saved thanks to that system. They will remain in this country, with full public access, for ever. I therefore do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument.</p>
