 (Con): If he will make a statement on the recent performance of the Child Support Agency. [57316]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60313-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr. John Hutton): </b> 
 Although there have been recent improvements in some areas, the overall performance of the agency is not acceptable. The operational improvement plan that I published in February sets out the immediate priorities for improvements in administration and enforcement. Sir David Henshaw will report his proposals to me for a new system of child support later in the summer.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60313-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 The Secretary of State will recall that on 9 February he told the House that he proposed to make an additional &#163;30 million available to enable the agency to use the services of private debt recovery agents. What progress has he made with that proposal, and will the cost of recovery by those agents be recoverable from the defaulting parent, or will it be an additional charge on the public purse?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60313-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The &#163;30 million is available to the agency now to use for that purpose. I understand that it is making progress in deploying the resource for the purposes that I have outlined. It is important that the agency should improve its performance in that regard. As I said on 9 February, relationships end but responsibilities do not. If we are to ensure that the CSA discharges that important aspect of its responsibilities, it will need to redouble its efforts. I am happy to keep the hon. Gentleman informed of progress in that area, and if he has any particular concerns about how those resources will be deployed in his constituency, he is welcome to raise them with me.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60313-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Frank Field  (Birkenhead)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend accept that there is widespread agreement on both sides of the House with the efforts that he is making to try to improve the performance of the

<br>&nbsp;<br>agency? Will he share with the House the major lessons that he draws from our failure to have a more effective CSA? Might one of them be that, for good reasons, we have kept access to children separate from payment for children? While there are of course noble exceptions to the general rule, is it not the case that it is mostly men who are unwilling to pay up for their children and women who cease to allow the fathers of their children access?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60313-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend speaks with much authority on this issue. We have all known where the difficulties of the CSA have lain in the past 13 years. We should never lose sight of the fact that we are often dealing with chaotic relationships that do not fall within even a broad definition of what we understand a family to be, and that has made it difficult for the agency to make the progress that we wanted it to make. I agree with my right hon. Friend that we should keep the issue of financial support for children separate from the issue of access. Whatever the disputes between partners about access to a child, there can be no lawful reason or excuse for the non-resident parent not to meet his or her financial responsibilities to that child. I hope that as Sir David Henshaw completes his work, none of us loses sight of that important principle.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60313-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Laws  (Yeovil)</b> 
 (LD): Does the Secretary of State agree that the persistent poor performance of the CSA over a long period must have contributed in some way to the poor performance on the issue of child poverty? I acknowledge the progress that the Government have made in reducing child poverty in recent years, but is he disappointed by recent figures showing that they have missed the target by a third of a million? What policy action is he taking to get back on target?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60313-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I dispute the observation that the hon. Gentleman made at the beginning of his question. When we came into government, we found that child poverty had doubled. It is now falling significantly, and falling faster here than in any other country in the European Union. We want to make further progress, and if we could ensure that child maintenance were paid more regularly and reliably to lone parents, it might act as an encouragement for more of them to take a job and return to the labour market. That in turn would allow us to make more progress in tackling our child poverty targets. They are ambitious targets, and we will need to do more over the next few years if we are to reach them. Some have said that we should not have attempted to reach that target. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party has not committed itself to reaching it, and that is something for him to consider. For all my right hon. and hon. Friends, it is not acceptable for any child to grow up in poverty in this country in this day and age. That is why it is right that we set ourselves the objective of eliminating child poverty, and we remain absolutely committed to it.

 (Lab): Like most hon. Members, I suspect, I cannot get through a surgery without at least one or two CSA cases. It seems as if the CSA does not use sensibly the enforcement powers that it already has. I had a case a week ago in which the absent parent 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1133</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>owned a property in the constituency, the address of which was given to the CSA by his partner. Not only did the agency fail to get any order over it that could have delivered her some cash, but the notice was served on the wrong address. What is going on?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60313-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I do not know the details of that case, but if my hon. Friend would like to raise it with me, I shall be happy to look into it. To be fair to the Child Support Agency&#151;someone needs to be&#151;it is true to say that the    number of enforcement actions is increasing substantially at the moment. I said to the chief executive that I wanted to see a significant improvement in that area, and I am glad to say that we are now seeing it. For the future, that is clearly something on which that Sir David Henshaw will be focusing his attention. It is crucial that the CSA should do better, and that any successor should do better still. I hope that we can all look forward to surgeries with fewer such cases.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60313-01_spnew8"><b> Miss Anne McIntosh  (Vale of York)</b> 
 (Con): The Opposition wish Sir David Henshaw well with his mission. Will he consider the background of 800,000 calls to the Child Support Agency going unanswered in one year, and the continuing delays with cases in both the old and new systems? What is the Secretary of State&#039;s reaction to the cut in training days and staff trained that is planned for the next financial year? How does he imagine that that will improve staff morale or the performance of the agency?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60313-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 On the last point, we are recruiting a significant number of additional staff for the Child Support Agency so that it can deliver on the objectives that we set out in the operational improvement plan. I hope that that will contribute to tackling the morale issues to which the hon. Lady referred. I welcome her support for the review that Sir David Henshaw is about to initiate. I understand that he is seeing her hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) tomorrow to discuss how it can be progressed.

 We set out our proposals for reforming incapacity benefit in the Welfare Reform Green Paper in January. These changes will help provide more support for more disabled people to return to work, while offering more financial support to those who are unable to do so.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60313-01_spnew10"><b> David Wright: </b> 
 If there are to be significant changes in the incapacity benefit system, can we ensure that they are dealt with sensitively and that we have a speedy appeals process, so that if people are asked to move back into work and off incapacity benefit they have an opportunity to appeal against that decision and have it reviewed quickly?


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60313-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Yes, I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. I agree that we need to improve all aspects of the decision-making process for incapacity benefit. The Green Paper set out proposals in two important areas where that will be possible: first, by redesigning the new personal capability assessment test, and secondly, in relation to the conduct and organisation of the appeals process.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60313-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 No, he did not. We have seen the number of people claiming incapacity benefit falling very substantially for the first time&#151;it is down by a third&#151;and the first recorded fall in the overall number of people claiming incapacity benefit. All I would say to the hon. Gentleman is that when his party last had its hands on power, the number claiming incapacity benefit doubled.

She found it difficult, but she agreed to do it&#151;and lost &#163;82 disability living allowance and gained a salary of &#163;12.

 The pathways to work scheme is the most successful back-to-work scheme that any country has developed for people who are disabled. That is not my view but that of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which praised the work that we have done. If one looks at the evidence from my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency and elsewhere, one sees the striking result of our having introduced pathways to work: in areas with the scheme we are twice as successful in getting people back to work as we were before, which is why we are now committed to extending it to every part of the United Kingdom in the next two years.

<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60313-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Pensions Reform  (Mr. Stephen Timms): </b> 
 In November there were more than 2.7 million households in Great Britain receiving pension credit&#151;about 1 million more than received the minimum income guarantee that preceded it.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60313-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Blizzard: </b> 
 Earlier this year I carried out an exercise for Anglia television, living on the minimum pensioner income of &#163;109.45. An overwhelming majority of the pensioners whom I met felt that they were much better off with pension credit and all the other things that this Government have done for them. However, I urge my hon. Friend to continue to raise pension credit each year in line with average earnings. Thanks to council tax benefit and housing benefit, I did just manage on &#163;109.45, but it was a little tight.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60313-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on his experience. It is certainly right to say that pension credit is helping a large number of pensioners. Last week&#039;s figures showed a fall of 1 million&#151;from 2.8 million to 1.8 million&#151;in the number of pensioner households living below the 60 per cent. of median household income threshold since 1997. That is a remarkable achievement at a time when median incomes have been rising quickly thanks to the success and stability that we have seen in the economy. My hon. Friend will be pleased to hear that pension credit will be uprated to &#163;114 from next month, and uprating will continue to be in line with earnings until at least 2008.

 (DUP): On the subject of take-up of pension credit, on Thursday the Department for Social Development published figures showing that annually &#163;221 million of pension credit goes unclaimed by up to 60,000 pensioners in Northern Ireland. Reasons outlined by those who work in this area are confusion and lack of information. Will the Minister tell the House that more will be done, targeting information at those who are entitled to claim but do not?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="60313-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 Yes, I can certainly tell the hon. Gentleman that we are doing a great deal to increase the take-up of pension credit. As I said, there are now more than 2.7 million pensioner households in Great Britain receiving help from pension credit. The Pension Service has sent out 1.5 million mail shots in the past six months and attracted a good response. This year, Pension Service staff will have made 800,000 home visits. I have no doubt that similar arrangements are being made in Northern Ireland, and the figures released on Thursday showing a sharp fall in the number of pensioners living below the poverty line, just in the year following the introduction of pension credit, show how successful the policy has been.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="60313-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 Nobody can be compelled to pay back money as the result of official error. As my hon. Friend rightly suggests, the Conservative party, I am afraid, has been guilty of irresponsible scaremongering, and I hope that we will hear the Conservatives make an apology today to pensioners who have been unduly alarmed. Based on what Conservative Members said, it was reported on Friday that millions of pensioners were being written to, whereas the actual number last year was 76. If it is now Tory policy to frighten pensioners with false claims of that kind, it is just as well that we have found out.

 I am interested to hear the Minister of State&#039;s response. Lord Turner has calculated that 70 per cent. of pensioners will come within the pension credit means test by 2050 if nothing changes.

<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="60313-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 Of course, Lord Turner drew attention in his report to the success of pension credit in reducing pensioner poverty. He also said that a large future expansion of means-testing could have a damaging effect on incentives to save. My view is that he made a strong case, and the hon.

 As I said, we stand by our commitment to enable those in receipt of benefits or pensions who wish to collect them from the post office to continue to do so. The Post Office card account is one way to do that, but there are 25 other accounts that are also accessible at post offices. As I have said, we understand that the Post Office is developing new products, which may well serve as successors to the POCA when it expires in 2010.

 (Lab): The Minister will recall that when the POCA was introduced, it was much derided; however, it has served a useful purpose through its simplicity as an in-and-out account in the post office. Does he share my frustration at the slow speed of development of alternative products that will not only allow in-and-out cash transactions of benefits and pensions but, for example, give people the benefit of standing orders, thus making their bills cheaper? What can we do to put more pressure on Post Office Ltd. and the banks to introduce a far better product when POCA is phased out?

<p><a name="st_o46"><a name="60313-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. He is right to say not only that POCA has served a useful purpose, but that its functionality is limited. One cannot, for example, attach a direct debit to the account. All of us have pensioner constituents expressing concern about increasing bills for gas and electricity, and one way to reduce that cost is to pay those bills by direct debit, but that cannot be done through a POCA.

The consequences will be extremely damaging, especially in rural areas. Last week I surveyed the 42 post offices in my constituency, and 100 per cent. of those who responded said that the change either would or probably would jeopardise the viability of their business.

 The proposals keep the cash value of the contracted-out rebate broadly unchanged.

 We recognise that over time successive piecemeal changes to benefits have led to undue complexity in the system, but unlike previous Administrations we are addressing that. We have already introduced major design reforms such as easements for the poorest pensioners to claim housing and council tax benefits and the piloting of the local housing allowance. From this April, we will simplify the social fund budgeting loans scheme, making it easier to access, more transparent and more responsive.

As was explained in answer to an earlier question, we are not clawing the money back.

In the nine years in which we have been in government, the number of people starting to claim incapacity benefit has decreased by one third, and, for the first time ever, the total number of people on incapacity benefit has started to fall&#151;the total has decreased by 58,000 in the past year, which is a move in the right direction. Our further reform proposals will   provide many people in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s

 As the Minister knows, the city of Nottingham is keen to pursue a city strategy on invalidity and incapacity benefit to get some of the 18,000 people on incapacity benefit back into work. Many people who have been provided with cognitive behaviour therapy, which gives people the morale boost that they need to try to get into work, find their first bridge into work through voluntary work. Will the Minister ensure that people continue not to lose benefit for engaging in voluntary work? Will she also consider giving people who engage in voluntary work a small amount of extra money to encourage them to take the first step on the long road to getting full-time work?

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on his work as chair of One Nottingham in tackling some of the issues raised by worklessness in his constituency. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who gets around the country, visited Nottingham on a previous Thursday and Friday, when he was impressed by the ongoing work. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) is right to stress that undertaking voluntary work is central to building the confidence of people who are locked into dependency on incapacity benefit. The rules are flexible, which enables incapacity benefit claimants to earn some money&#151;for one year, they can earn up to &#163;81 a week&#151;and we constantly reflect on how we can build people&#039;s confidence.

 I am slightly puzzled by the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question. If there is a problem with expenses being paid, he should write to me about it. As I understand it, under the current rules there is no cap at all on the number of hours of voluntary work that those on incapacity benefit can undertake. Clearly, they need to be covered for the expenses that they incur in undertaking that valuable work in their communities.

 We are committed to supporting the hardest to help into employment, including people on incapacity benefit, lone parents, older workers and people from black and minority ethnic communities.

 With permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I should like to make a statement about our operations and force levels in Iraq.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">First, let me express my sincere condolences to the families of Captain Richard Holmes and Private Lee Ellis of 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, killed in Iraq on 28 February, and to the family of Trooper Carl Smith, who died on 2 February. I am sure that the whole House wishes to be associated with those condolences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">We express our sympathy, too, for all those families of the forces of other nations and of the many innocent civilians who have died or been injured as a result of terrorist activity in Iraq in recent months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Hon. Members will have followed the situation carefully, and will, like me, have been concerned about events, especially those following the disgraceful bombing of the al-Askari shrine in Samarra. Some commentators have suggested that that act of terror will lead to a slide into civil war. Those acts of terrorism are cruel and barbaric but they are not mindless. They have a purpose: to undermine the efforts of the vast majority of the Iraqi people who seek peace, stability and democracy in their country, and to try to break the will of the coalition forces supporting them in that quest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Despite the ferocity of the terrorists, the Iraqi people will not be defeated and our will to see the job done will not be broken. Our analysis is that civil war is neither imminent nor inevitable. However, in some areas of Iraq, including in Baghdad, there has been an increase in sectarian violence. That is abhorrent and plays to the aim of the terrorists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">However, in the face of the cynical targeting of the Samarra attack, the aftermath has been characterised more by calls for restraint by Iraqi politicians and religious leaders, the calm reaction of the vast majority of Iraqis in all the circumstances, despite their natural revulsion and anger, and the mature response of Iraq&#039;s new security forces. In the middle of all the problems, those are encouraging signs in a very difficult and delicate situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Our respect and admiration for the men and women of our armed forces remains undiminished. The truly magnificent work that they are doing there is having a positive effect and they have played a vital role in helping Iraq come a long way in a short time. Suffice it to say that the Iraqis have clearly shown us what they want, and it is not a return to fear and oppression. They showed us that most impressively in December when, despite the threats of death and destruction, some 12 million of them voted in free and fair elections. That represents a turnout of about 75 per cent. of the electorate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The present political wrangling over the formation of   a new coalition Government is perhaps natural, but it is also contributing to uncertainty and fuelling speculation. As that process moves forward, the Iraqi politicians must not forget the commitment of the Iraqi people who voted in large numbers to bring order and fair government to a unified Iraq. However, there has been a continual and considerable advance in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1152</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>numbers, capability and morale of the Iraqi security forces, which have developed as democracy has developed. It is in that context that I turn to our United Kingdom troop presence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">When I announced the last changeover in October last year, 190,000 members of the Iraqi security forces were already trained, capable and equipped. Today there are about 235,000&#151;which is 45,000 more than when I announced the last roulement deployment&#151;and others are joining them at the rate of about 5,000 every month. It is against that background that we assess our own force levels. I can therefore tell the House that, as a result of this roulement changeover, there will be a reduction of British forces in Iraq of about 800 personnel. That reflects the completion of our security sector reform tasks to develop the capability of the Iraqi forces, including training the trainers and those involved in guarding their own institutions. The reduction also reflects improvements in the way we configure our own forces. Our force levels reflect the in-theatre assessments in the south-east of Iraq. Today&#039;s announcement marks a reduction from the high point of some 10,000 UK personnel in October 2003 to just over 7,000 from May this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">The lead formation in Iraq, currently 7th Armoured Brigade, will be replaced in early May by 20th Armoured Brigade. The following major units will be deployed to replace those in theatre today: 1st The Queen&#039;s Dragoon Guards; The Queen&#039;s Royal Hussars; 12th Regiment Royal Artillery; 33 and 35 Engineer Regiments; 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards; 1st Battalion The Princess of Wales&#039;s Royal Regiment; 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (Reserve- Cyprus); 2nd Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment; 1st Battalion The Devon and Dorset Light Infantry; 1st Battalion The Light Infantry; and 3 Logistic Support Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">A number of reserve personnel will accompany this deployment, including soldiers from The Lancastrian and Cumbrian Volunteers, and The King&#039;s and Cheshire Regiment. Aviation support will continue to be provided by five Merlin, eight Sea King support helicopters, and four Lynx. In May, there will be a reduction of two Sea King helicopters. Our support to the Iraqi navy and our contribution to the coalition taskforce in the north Arabian gulf will continue unchanged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">Let me stress that the reductions that I have announced today are not part of a handover of security responsibility at operational level. They have not been caused by, nor are they the cause of, changes in troop levels of other coalition allies. In the next few weeks, the joint committee to transfer security responsibility&#151;a body made up of Iraqi ministers, military staff and senior coalition figures&#151;will start the assessment phase to determine whether conditions have been met for some provinces in Iraq to begin the handover process. Today is not that stage of handover. When the committee has reached conclusions, I will of course come back and update the House on the implications of that assessment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">In closing, I would like to reiterate that we continue, amidst the struggle in Iraq, to make progress. Of course, much remains to be done there, but let me stress again today that the significant reductions that I have announced are not part of a handover of security 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>responsibility to the Iraqis themselves, although they do reflect the completion of some of the security sector reform tasks that we set ourselves some time ago in developing the capability of the Iraqi forces&#151;in particular, training the trainers and guarding institutions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">Our commitment to the Iraqi people and their Government remains total and steadfast. Our commitment to the coalition is certain. We will stay as long as we are needed, and wanted, and until the job is done. Today marks another significant step in that direction.

<p>
<a name="60313-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_15">Having been in Basra last week, I can readily join the Secretary of State in congratulating the armed forces on the magnificent job they are doing. It is, unfortunately, one of our national scandals that, while the media accord page after page to any failures, real or invented, they give such little coverage to the hard work our troops carry out on our behalf in the process of reconstructing Iraq.

<a name="60313-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_16">While we welcome any reduction in Britain&#039;s military presence in Iraq, if the military conditions so dictate, we take the view that it would be folly to withdraw hastily, before the Iraqi forces can provide adequate security in place of British troops.

<a name="stpa_18">Towards the end of the statement, the Secretary of State referred to an assessment process due to get under way shortly &quot;to determine whether conditions have been met for some provinces . . . to begin the handover process.&quot; Is it Government policy, if conditions are right, to hand over parts of MND South-East in advance of the Americans so doing in central Iraq? What discussions has he had with Washington about that process?

<a name="stpa_19">Finally, the Secretary of State referred to aviation support. He will know that our helicopter and transport aircraft fleets are operating at a frenetic tempo, well beyond what was expected. How on earth can he justify the withdrawal in May of two Sea King helicopters? I was in a Sea King helicopter on Thursday, flying out to HMS Bulwark, and heard from the Royal Navy the difficulties it is having in getting hold of aircraft today. He well knows that helicopters are the preferred means of transport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_20">What is the Secretary of State doing to address the critical problem of inadequate lift across the board? Does he not accept that the TriStar and VC10 fleets are past their sell-by dates, that some of them cannot be used in theatre because they lack the requisite defensive aids and that the C-130 Hercules fleet is so overworked that it has no capacity to train paratroopers? As a result of all that, the Secretary of State must rely on chartering holiday airliners which are simply not designed to transport troops.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_21">Is the Secretary of State aware that it is utterly demoralising for our troops to have their leave cut thanks to delays in the availability of the transport fleet for which the Royal Air Force is unjustly blamed? In the early hours of Friday morning, I was with 300 soldiers who were delayed by three and a half hours following an engine malfunction on a C-130. We then flew for eight hours from Qatar in a chartered airliner with a seat pitch designed to take holidaymakers on a two-hour trip to Ibiza. Soldiers had to endure intolerable cramped conditions because no TriStars were available.

<a name="stpa_24">Let me now deal with the questions that the hon. Gentleman asked about the reductions in our forces that were announced today. He asked for an assurance that they were based on the merits of the case for an in-theatre assessment, and not on any obligations to find troops for other areas such as Afghanistan. I can give him that guarantee. Indeed, one of the prerequisites that I specified before deciding to deploy troops to Afghanistan was that we would not become dependent on troop reductions in Iraq. We have made it plain all along that our troop deployments there will be based on conditions on the ground, and on the assessments of our commanders in theatre. I can confirm that that applies in this case, and that there is no connection with Afghanistan.

I have been careful today to insist that this does not mark a decision on operational handover&#151;the handing over to the Iraqis of lead political and operational responsibility for whole swathes or provinces. What it does mark is an indication of the incremental and increasing participation of Iraqi forces in counter-terrorism in our operations, which at this stage has allowed us to reduce the number of our troops. The assessment of when the process will have reached a point at which a province, or more than one province, could be handed over to the Iraqis will be made when the conditions have been met. The conditions have been publicised, and I think that the hon. Gentleman is well aware of them.

It is not possible to guarantee that such things will never happen&#151;as the Prime Minister found only three weeks ago, engines can go wrong in even the best hired planes&#151;but we do what we can.

It is the nature of democracy that we do not always agree, but in the midst of the coalition negotiations, all of us should remember the risks that the Iraqi people themselves have taken in coming out to vote in these elections. Ultimately, the salvation of the Iraqi people and their democracy, stability and peace will lie in the hands of Iraqis themselves. It has never been our intention to stay there indefinitely through some imperialist presence. We have said that we will stay until the job is done, that the job will be done when the Iraqis themselves are capable of defending their own democracy and of defending themselves against terrorist activity, and that that will be a process.

<p>
<a name="60313-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_31">Today, I have announced another part of that process&#151;not the end of it by any means. In a sense, this is not even the beginning of the end, but, to quote our most famous politician, it is perhaps the &quot;end of the beginning.&quot; This is a significant reduction based largely on the ability of the Iraqis themselves to participate, and to defend themselves against counter-terrorism. There is a very long way to go, and I have been absolutely clear that we are not yet at the stage where the Iraqi security forces can take responsibility for whole provinces. We will continue to assess the situation and when the conditions are met, I will make another announcement to the House.

<a name="stpa_32">As far as other coalition troops are concerned, nothing that I have said today about the British disposition of troops&#151;as part of the normal six-monthly announcement of roulement deployment&#151;causes, or is caused by, troop dispositions, reductions or increases among any of our allies in the coalition. So the announcement stands on its own, but we have of course informed our Japanese, Italian and Australian partners in Multinational Division South-East&#151;I spoke to the Australian Minister this morning&#151;and we have informed our other allies, including the Americans.

<br>&nbsp;<br>for, maintaining and struggling for democracy has sometimes involved sacrifice. It is nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands of deaths under the tyrant Saddam Hussein. I agree entirely that a benchmark of our progress is in the treatment of civilians. I regret whenever civilians suffer as a result of actions that fall beneath civilised standards, whether performed by our troops, anyone else&#039;s troops or the Iraqis themselves. But I would point out the watershed of difference between what happens now and what happened 10 years ago in Iraq. Now, if there is maltreatment of civilians, it is exposed, whereas under Saddam it was covered up. It is exceptional now, and under Saddam it was institutionalised. The perpetrators are penalised, prosecuted and&#151;I hope&#151;incarcerated, but under Saddam they were honoured and promoted. That is not an insignificant difference.

 What the Secretary of State has told us about the training of an extra 45,000 security forces in Iraq is very good news. The achievements of our British forces there have been very significant indeed. Was the reduction of 800 troops that he has announced discussed with the Iraqi authorities, and what is the general state of discussions between them and British troop commanders, especially in Basra?
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60313-08_spnew4"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 In answer to the first question, it was discussed with the Iraqi authorities insofar as it could be, given that there is no national Government formed at present. We keep in touch with our Iraqi colleagues inside the security forces and so on. As regards the second question, the short answer is that they are better than they were a few weeks ago. As the hon. Gentleman knows, several events&#151;not just the video, which was wrongly portrayed as the main reason for the breakdown in communications in several areas&#151;including in the Basra area, our arrest of certain policemen whom we regarded as being involved in nefarious activities, led to a breakdown in communication in that area, but in all of the areas where there was non-co-operation we have either re-established co-operation or are moving towards doing so.

 Would not the best way to pay tribute to the 103 bereaved families and to those still serving so splendidly in Iraq be to have a proper inquiry into the reasons why we involved ourselves in the war in the first place? We have had four inquiries, all based on out-of-date information, two of them conducted by committees that were well disposed towards the war anyway, and two that considered only partial aspects of the war. Is it not now time for an inquiry that would be comprehensive, rigorous and genuinely independent?

All of the committees approached their specific task with a commendable degree of open-mindedness and scrutiny. The fact that we have had four inquiries and they have not reached the conclusion that my hon. Friend wanted them to reach may be unfortunate, but perhaps it is statistically relevant.

 I declare an interest in a company that works in Iraq. The House will have noticed the Secretary of State&#039;s very careful words that the slide towards civil war is neither imminent nor inevitable. However, he did not say that it is unlikely. Does the Secretary of State agree that Donald Rumsfeld&#039;s remark that if there is a slide into civil war it must be dealt with by Iraqi security forces conceals a fundamental problem in the whole of coalition policy because a very high proportion of those security forces is drawn from the Shi&#039;a and Kurdish communities, and it has been elements of the security forces, particularly the police, that have been responsible for many of the killings and atrocities that have been committed against Iraqi civilians? Can the Secretary of State say what Her Majesty&#039;s Government are doing to impress upon the Iraqi Government that not only must the armed forces be drawn substantially from the Sunni as well as other communities, but much more must be done than is being done to prevent atrocities by rogue elements within the security forces themselves?

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="60313-08_spnew10"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will accept that, without necessarily agreeing with all his premises, I entirely agree with both his conclusions. First, there must be not only a competent Government in Iraq but it must be non-sectarian in character and must reach out to the Sunni section of the population as well as to the majority Shi&#039;a or the Kurd section. That means that the analysis of the violence must be more sophisticated than it sometimes is in some quarters. It is not the case that everyone who is opposed to the Government or to our troops is on the other side of the international war on terrorism. Many young Sunnis are dispossessed, unemployed and alienated&#151;there are 200,000 of them in the Euphrates valley&#151;and may drift in and out of violence for reasons unconnected with fanaticism or extremist ideology. I agree that if they are to be brought into ownership of Iraq, the Government have to reach out to them. Secondly, where there is evidence of bias, ranging from a natural bias towards one&#039;s own community through to the intentional infiltration of the security forces by militias, it has to be rooted out in practice, ideology and theory as well as in operational terms. Both of those things are essential if Iraq is to build national unity.

 That is the second consecutive question that I can answer by saying that I entirely agree with the conclusions and with many of the premises on which those conclusions were based. I hope that everyone in the House, even those who disagreed with the original decision to intervene, now understand that we are operating in Iraq with the full support of the Iraqi democratic majority, the sanction of the United Nations and under United Nations Security Council resolutions. That is the status of what we are doing in Iraq at present. It ill behoves those who normally demand that we adhere to every aspect of United Nations resolutions to say that on this occasion in Iraq, because they did not agree with the position several years ago, they will depart from the United Nations at present. Whatever views we took in the beginning, it is now our job to help the Iraqi people build their democratic Government through their own democratic processes, build their economy, build their security forces and ultimately rule their own lives.

 Given the astonishing skill and triumph of British troops on the ground in Iraq, and in welcoming back the 7th Armoured Brigade when it returns and noting the powerful deployment of the 20th Armoured Brigade, will the Secretary of State nevertheless consider the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) about the increased efforts that need to be made so that people understand the breadth and scale of the work of British troops on the ground in Iraq, and what a tremendous contribution they have made in the most difficult circumstances in a harsh and unforgiving environment? Will the Secretary of State consider what more can be done to ensure that greater opportunities are made available for the press to see the great scale of what is being done and not just to report on the inevitable disasters in a deployment of that type?

<a name="stpa_34">Secondly, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct in saying that sometimes there is a complete lack of understanding of the difficulties under which our troops now operate. It is almost as though they are fighting a 21st-century war in which people expect them to apply 20th-century regulations, international laws and conventions. We may not have all the answers on those matters, but we should certainly face the fact that they create huge problems. Our enemy is less constrained by international conventions, legality, morality or anything else than ever, yet the scrutiny that we constantly place on our soldiers and the international conventions and laws that we expect them to maintain mean that they are more constrained than ever. I do not complain about that, but I ask the public to be a little slower to condemn, a little quicker to support and not to believe everything as represented by the commentariat, because at the end of the day published opinion is not always public opinion.

The relationship between ourselves and the local authorities in Basra broke down, we suspect, precisely because we acted against and arrested several members of the local constabulary, exactly as my hon.

Today&#039;s announcement is not of that nature.

As the right hon. and learned Gentleman suggests, not only do we have a diminished number of and need for trainers, but in the guarding of installations, which is quite an onerous task that takes up quite a number of infantry right across all the battalions that we have sent there, the Iraqis are now able in terms of training, capability, weaponry and morals to defend their own barracks, installations, arsenals or police stations, for instance.

 The Secretary of State may recall the evidence that the Chief of the General Staff gave to the Defence Committee at an earlier stage of our deployment in Iraq, when he said that, although we may operate with the Americans, we do not operate as the Americans. The potential full import of those words seemed to bear out the account of former SAS trooper, Ben Griffin, in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> yesterday, which I am sure that the Secretary of State will have read. That would imply that the mistreatment of civilians and operations towards the civil population in the American areas appear to be somewhat institutionalised to a degree.

 The remarks made by General Jackson took into account the fact that the Americans were dealing with different conditions and circumstances in different parts of Iraq and with different ethnic groups from those circumstances, environments and groups with which the British had to deal. It was therefore not just a matter of a will on the part of the British to act differently from our United States colleagues, but circumstances permitted that to be the case. Nothing that he said would suggest, nor have I heard anything to suggest, that wrongful behaviour on the part of the Americans is institutionalised.

 The hon. Gentleman speaks with some authority, having served his country with the Guards. We are working on housing&#151;single housing accommodation is a disgrace in many areas and we are trying, through a long-term project, to improve that. There is an above-inflation pay increase&#151;slightly bigger for the lower ranks than for others&#151;and we are working to improve the welfare package. I hope that all of that will encourage people to stay in the British armed forces, which offer a fantastic career to young men and women and in which we have vacancies every single year.

 Given that there is no connection to the deployment in Afghanistan, presumably the Secretary of State will be able to assure the House that the 800 troops who are coming back will be allowed to have their 24 months back at home, as outlined in the harmony guidelines, before being sent to Afghanistan.

 I am probably over-sensitive, but I noticed a hint of cynicism there. All I can tell the hon.

Gentleman knows, even before Afghanistan, the harmony level was 21.4 months, rather than 24. However, I repeat what I said at the beginning: the drawdown in Iraq is not dependent on the deployment to Afghanistan, or vice versa. In the next few years, as ever, we shall strive to make sure that we approximate as closely as possible the satisfactory harmony levels for all our troops&#151;not just those coming back from deployment in Iraq, but those coming back from deployment anywhere.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. During questions on the statement, two Members&#151;the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) and the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)&#151;mentioned that they had interests to declare. I have just been to look at the Register of Members&#039; Interests, and it is extremely unclear what interest the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex has in Iraq, because he claims to be a director of a restaurant company and of an investment company. If hon. Members say that they have an interest in a subject of such importance as the presence of British troops in Iraq, we need to know what it is and how much money they are making from it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_47"><a name="60313-11_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 The requirement is that hon. Members make as clear as possible to the House the relevance of their interest to the matter on which they are seeking to address the House. The hon. Gentleman has made that point and I am sure that it will be noted. I suspect that one of the difficulties is that a great many hon. Members have interests that they feel obliged to declare and we could spend a lot of the day on prefaces to questions making such interests known. However, it is helpful to be as specific as possible, so that the House is properly informed.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Have you received a request from the Secretary of State for Defence to come to the House to make a further statement in response to the results of the inquest into the death of Private James Collinson at Deepcut barracks?

 I have not received such a request from the Secretary of State, although I did receive a request from the hon. Gentleman to accept an urgent question. Under the rules on such questions and given today&#039;s business, however, I felt unable to grant his request.

 May I respond to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker? At our request, the coroner clarified the fact that he was not calling for a public inquiry, nor was that what he said. We all sympathise with the feelings of the family in this case and the other cases, but we have already set in motion an independent inquiry led by Nicholas Blake, QC, which should report in the not-too-distant future. It behoves us all to await the outcome of that inquiry before we start to run across Nicholas Blake&#039;s decisions by announcing or seeking another inquiry.

<a name="60313-11_time1"><h5>4.26 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_53"><a name="60313-11_spmin4"><b>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Peter Hain): </b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_43">It is in the nature of adversarial politics that the emphasis is on difference and the focus on disagreement and division. Few places have been more adversarial than Northern Ireland since the latter third of the last century, but finding consensus does not mean losing integrity, and moving forward towards accommodation does not mean turning away from principle. It is my firm conviction that    we can find that consensus and reach that accommodation&#151;not an impossibly naive hope, given the years of experience since the peace process began in Northern Ireland. There is agreement on the principle of consent. There is agreement that Northern Ireland is served best when governed locally. There is agreement that Northern Ireland is served best when governed on the basis of fair and equitable power-sharing. There is agreement that Northern Ireland is served best when the police service has the whole community behind it because the whole community is in it. There is agreement that Northern Ireland must be free from the fear of paramilitary activity and criminality and that the rule of law must apply. There is agreement that common-sense north-south co-operation is of great mutual benefit. There is agreement that the current political impasse cannot continue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_44">It is crucial for Northern Ireland that 2006 is the year of progress in which Northern Ireland politicians, locally accountable and operating on an inclusive basis, once more take responsibility for the things that matter in people&#039;s daily lives. It is clear, too, that there cannot be elections to an Assembly that does not exist. Members of the Legislative Assembly cannot continue to be paid salaries and allowances while the Assembly stands idle and there is no prospect of its restoration. No one can seriously contest either assertion and, to be fair, no one has done so. As the House will know, both Prime Ministers are focused on the way forward. With the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Irish Government, I have been talking with the parties in a series of meetings. We are all determined that devolution should be restored to the people of Northern Ireland, and I know that that determination is shared by the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_45">Before I move on to the detail of the Bill, I wish to inform the House that I have today announced the reconstitution of the Northern Ireland Policing Board with effect from 1 April 2006. The cross-community board is one of the great successes flowing from the Patten recommendations. I pay tribute to all the current members, particularly the hon. Members for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) and for South Down (Mr. McGrady), for their considerable contribution to the Policing Board over the past four and half years. The Bill covers a number of policy objectives which, for the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1167</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>most part, have a single unifying theme&#151;preparing Northern Ireland for the many and various challenges that lie ahead, particularly the fact that there should be no legislative obstacles in the way of devolution. The Bill will chiefly allow maximum flexibility in the arrangements for the future devolution of policing and justice functions to the Assembly, as was envisaged at the time that the Northern Ireland Act 1998 was passed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_46">Ultimately, responsibility for policing and justice in Northern Ireland should lie with Northern Ireland Ministers, accountable to a local Assembly elected by the people of Northern Ireland. That was envisaged in the Belfast agreement and the structure of the devolution settlement set out in the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Our Government have repeated on many occasions their clear commitment to devolve those functions when the time is right. An effective, independent and impartial criminal justice system is fundamental to a properly functioning society. Before the Government can devolve their responsibilities, we must be satisfied that the system will function effectively and that arrangements are in place to ensure, for example, the continued independence of the judiciary and prosecution system and the effective administration of justice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_47">The independence and impartiality of the prosecution system and the judiciary are fundamental principles of the UK justice system. The existing legislation places a duty on Northern Ireland Ministers to uphold that. In addition, I intend to put forward concordats between our Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, to be agreed before the devolution of policing and justice, setting out the core principles of the independence and impartiality of the Northern Ireland judiciary and the public prosecution service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_48">The Bill does not devolve policing and justice. Instead, it supports the framework that we need to put in place to devolve policing and justice by order when&#151;not before&#151;the circumstances are right to do so. That was the intention of the 1998 Act. Section 4 of that Act gives me the power to transfer any reserved matter to make it the responsibility of the Assembly, subject to certain important safeguards. Those safeguards remain and nothing in the Bill undermines them. Most importantly, the Assembly must agree that the time is right for policing and justice to be devolved and must vote for it on a cross-community basis. That is set out clearly in section 4 of the 1998 Act and nothing in the Bill alters that position. The Assembly must also agree what arrangements it wants to put in place to receive the new functions&#151;whether to have one ministerial Department or two, for example. The Government must be convinced that the proposed arrangements are robust, workable and broadly supported by the parties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_49">Finally, when the time comes, the order that effects the transfer of functions will need to be agreed in Parliament. There is more work to be done before we reach that point. On 16 February, alongside the Bill, I published a discussion paper that set out what the Government believe is a sensible and pragmatic framework for policing and justice in Northern Ireland. As I said then, the document is not a blueprint, but a basis for discussion. We look forward to beginning those discussions, especially with all the Northern Ireland political parties.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1168</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_50">In preparing for the devolution of policing and justice, it will be particularly important to ensure that the Assembly and Executive have all the tools that they need to manage the functions transferred to them. One of those tools is an arrangement whereby the Assembly will raise money specifically for policing. The policing precept in England, Scotland and Wales allows money for policing to be raised from council tax. In my constituency of Neath, for example, the precept is &#163;126.42. We believe that it will be useful for the Assembly to have a similar power to raise additional money for policing in Northern Ireland from the regional rate. As that power can be created by an amendment to the Northern Ireland rates legislation, it does not require provision in the Bill. We will legislate for the detail of the precept in planned amendments to the Northern Ireland rates legislation. The power in clause 22 of the Bill will ensure that those changes to rates legislation cannot be amended by a future Assembly, although the level at which the precept is levied, or whether it should be zero-rated, will be matters for the Assembly. I emphasise that that will be additional money to provide enhanced levels of policing to meet Northern Ireland policing priorities and the Assembly will not have to use the power unless it wishes to do so. Equally, if it does not, there may be implications for other spending.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_51">I know that some hon. Members have expressed concern that we will undermine national security by devolving responsibility for policing and justice. Others have suggested that the switch in primacy for national security matters from the Police Service of Northern Ireland to the Security Service represents a sinister plot to undermine policing in Northern Ireland. Both sets of fears are completely without foundation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_52">Constitutionally, central Government have responsibility for national security, whether relating to international or domestic terrorism. We cannot and will not abdicate that responsibility. Integrating the Security Service&#039;s lead and the police&#039;s operational response in the way proposed will bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom, where the Security Service has had lead responsibility since 1992.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_53">Let us be clear about what this change will mean in practice. The Security Service has no executive policing responsibilities, even in countering threats to national security. Such responsibilities rest now and will remain with the police, under the oversight of the Policing Board and the police ombudsman. In future, although the Security Service will gather intelligence and provide the strategic direction, it will be the police&#039;s role to mount related policing operations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-11_para12">
<a name="stpa_54">The main reason is that we cannot address national security on a regional basis anywhere in the United Kingdom. Events have demonstrated that it is vital to provide a consistent and co-ordinated response right across the United Kingdom. International terrorists do not confine their activities to the mainland of the United Kingdom. The recent arrest in Belfast and subsequent conviction of Abbas Boutrab for terrorist-related offences of the kind associated mostly with al-Qaeda shows that. We should all be aware that modern terrorism is an international phenomenon from which Northern Ireland needs to be protected. The changes that will take place during 2007 constitute a part of the

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="60313-12_spnew0"><b> Rev. Ian Paisley  (North Antrim) (DUP):</b> 
 I do not know whether I caught the Secretary of State&#039;s language. If I mistook what I thought he said, he will tell me. I thought he said that security rested with the police and the police ombudsman. Will he clarify that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_55"><a name="60313-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 What I said, and it is helpful to clarify it for the right hon. Gentleman, is that security matters will remain with the Security Service, but operational matters that might or might not flow from intelligence, or advice from the Security Service, or a recommendation from the Security Service will be for the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The Chief Constable has supported these arrangements and the integration of the two&#151;that is, the operational matters carried out by the PSNI and the intelligence and security matters carried out by the Security Service. Those can work very effectively together, and that is indeed planned.
</p>





<p><a name="st_56"><a name="60313-12_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jeffrey M. Donaldson  (Lagan Valley) (DUP):</b> 
 We understand what the Secretary of State is saying in relation to the integration of national security and dealing with the terrorist threat in Northern Ireland. Nevertheless, the Security Service is already stretched by coping with the threat to national security from international terrorism. How will it manage to take on the additional role in Northern Ireland with its existing resources?
</p>





<p><a name="st_57"><a name="60313-12_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 These are matters that have been worked through with the Security Service. It is a fair question, but I notice that the hon. Gentleman is not disputing the principle, which springs from the fact that we are dealing with an international terrorist phenomenon which knows no boundaries. That is demonstrated by the arrest of that individual in Belfast of all places, which was connected not with domestic terrorism, but with the international phenomenon. That is the key point.
</p>





<p><a name="st_58"><a name="60313-12_spnew4"><b> Lady Hermon  (North Down) (UUP):</b> 
 Can the Secretary of State clarify who will adjudicate on what is a matter of national security and what is strictly an operational matter for the Chief Constable? I know that the Chief Constable welcomes some of the proposed arrangements, but he is concerned about who makes that final decision? Will it be a tussle in public or in private? Who will adjudicate?
</p>





<p><a name="st_59"><a name="60313-12_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I do not envisage any tussles in public. I think that the situation will bed down quickly, as it has done in Great Britain, where there is a similar division of responsibility between the chief constable, the relevant police force and the Security Service. The change reflects the increasing normalisation of life, security and politics in Northern Ireland.
</p>





<p><a name="st_60"><a name="60313-12_spnew6"><b> Sammy Wilson  (East Antrim) (DUP):</b> 
 Does the Secretary of State accept that the relationship between the security services and the police in England will not 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1170</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>necessarily be repeated in Northern Ireland, where much of the intelligence gathered will affect criminal investigations due to the close link between terrorists and criminality? How can we ensure that the flow of information about criminal activity from the intelligence services to the police in Northern Ireland is not hindered?
</p>





<p><a name="st_61"><a name="60313-12_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I have made sure that both the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Security Service are satisfied that the overlap between pure gangsterism and paramilitarism can be tackled. If I use the phrase, &quot;pure crime&quot;, I think that the hon. Gentleman knows what I mean, and it will continue to be combated effectively under the new arrangements.
</p>





<p><a name="st_62"><a name="60313-12_spnew8"><b> Mr. Eddie McGrady  (South Down) (SDLP):</b> 
 The Secretary of State has confused the issue. Given the complexity of intelligence gathering in Northern Ireland, intelligence gathering should surely be a unitary matter. Intelligence involves both criminal organisations and terrorist organisations, so it would be better to have one intelligence-gathering organisation, which should be the PSNI. The PSNI should communicate its intelligence on international terrorism and retain information on indigenous terrorism for prosecution. In the past, intelligence was not transferred from MI5 to the police, and people literally got away with murder as a result.
</p>





<p><a name="st_63"><a name="60313-12_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Due to the relationship between the PSNI and the Security Service, what might have happened in the past will not happen in the future other than for reasons of ordinary human failing, which could occur in any situation. When the hon. Gentleman examines the detail and discusses the matter with the Chief Constable&#151;given his long experience on the Policing Board, where he played a valuable role, few people can do that better than him&#151;he will be satisfied that that is the only way in which to proceed. As I have said, the measure concerns terrorism in its broadest context. In particular, we are dealing with the modern phenomena of international terrorism of the kind which occurred in London on 7 July. Indeed, there were fingerprints&#151;albeit isolated fingerprints&#151;in Belfast, where the individual whom I have described was arrested.
</p>





<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60313-12_spnew10"><b> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b> 
 I am sure that the Secretary of State agrees that we will return to many of those points in Committee. Returning to today&#039;s Second Reading debate, however, can he not see that he is doing exactly what many hon. Members have always warned the Government not to do, which is to categorise terrorism in two leagues&#151;international terrorism, which is a threat to state security, and domestic terrorism, which seems to have a more benign status? Will he assure hon. Members that paramilitary terrorism in Northern Ireland will be treated in exactly the same context as international terrorism?
</p>





<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60313-12_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I do not disagree with that proposition. I know that the hon. Gentleman agrees that it is difficult to say whether one form of terrorism is better or worse than another, because all terrorism is equally bad. All I am saying is that the modern form of terrorism that was identified in the arrest of the individual in Belfast is of an international character, and that it is as vital that the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1171</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Security Service is able to tackle that if it surfaces in Northern Ireland as it is in the rest of the United Kingdom. I know that the hon. Gentleman will accept that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_66"><a name="60313-12_spnew12"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack  (South Staffordshire) (Con):</b> 
 A few moments ago, the Secretary of State used the phrase, &quot;pure crime&quot;, which is slightly strange, but we all know what he meant. It is clear from the evidence that the Select Committee has received in its continuing inquiry into organised crime that there is very little that can be described as &quot;pure crime&quot; in Northern Ireland. I think that he has to take that on board.
</p>





<p><a name="st_67"><a name="60313-12_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The Select Committee very appropriately made that point. We have recently seen events in the    Republic of Ireland which indicate that. All paramilitary groups have criminal tentacles. It is difficult to see that some of the loyalist paramilitary groups have any political objective any more&#151;it seems to be pure gangsterism&#151;although it is not quite the same in the case of the dissident republicans.In answer to the question of whether dealing with day-to-day crime unrelated to paramilitary activity of the kind identified by the Select Committee would be hampered, I do not think that it would be at all. On the contrary, an enhanced capability could help in every respect.
</p>





<p><a name="st_68"><a name="60313-12_spnew14"><b> Mr. Ben Wallace  (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con):</b> 
 The Secretary of State said that no one has challenged the principle, but perhaps I may challenge the practicality. The strength of the RUC special branch, and then the PSNI, was that it had intelligence-gathering networks and executive powers, and therefore worked in a joined-up way. In giving some of those powers to the security services, how does the Secretary of State hope to clarify the situation whereby very sensitive intelligence may be handed over to a police force when the Justice Minister in a Northern Ireland Assembly is from Sinn Fein? It is at those hand-over points that intelligence can sometimes break down. I urge him to consider whether, by losing executive powers in some of the intelligence network in Northern Ireland, he may be hampering counter-terrorism efforts.
</p>





<p><a name="st_69"><a name="60313-12_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I do not think that that will be the case; otherwise, neither the Chief Constable nor the Security Service would be satisfied, and neither would I. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Patten report recommended that national security should not be devolved, and we are acting consistently with that. The Patten recommendations have been hugely successful in winning cross-community support for policing, so that in many respects the PSNI is now seen as a model for the rest of the world. The issue here is a switch in primacy, which should reside with the Security Service for the reasons that I have described.
</p>





<p><a name="st_70"><a name="60313-12_spnew16"><b> Mark Durkan  (Foyle) (SDLP):</b> 
 The Secretary of State said that the Patten report did not recommend that national security should be devolved. However, it clearly said that in areas of national security the PSNI would report to the Secretary of State, as opposed to reporting through the devolved mechanisms. It envisaged that issues of national security and intelligence policing at that level would be part of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1172</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>responsibility of the PSNI. The Government are going against the grain of the Patten report in insisting that there should be ulterior policing and intelligence arrangements outside of the PSNI&#151;namely, MI5.

<p><a name="st_71"><a name="60313-13_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I do not accept that interpretation. Paragraph 6.22 of the Patten report, although it did not go into as much detail as the Bill, made it clear that

</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-13_para0">

<a name="stpa_56">I understand the concerns of the Social Democratic and Labour party about the matter, given its wider long-term political objectives. However, I hope that the hon.

I believe that the result will be to strengthen the overall imposition of security and policing in Northern Ireland rather than to undermine it. If there were any danger of undermining it, the Chief Constable would have been the first to warn against that. He most emphatically has not done so&#151;indeed, he supported the changes.

Compelling market-led arguments resulted in similar action in 2003 to enable the Scottish market to be integrated with the England-Wales wholesale electricity market. Now it is Northern Ireland&#039;s turn. The electricity industry and the business community in Northern Ireland support the move, for the simple reason that a single market makes sound economic sense. It will be both more sustainable and more liable to attract new investment. It is expected that the single market will bring consumer benefits by boosting economies of scale and creating fuel savings. Together with access to a larger marketplace, that should spur greater competition and provide for a more efficient pricing mechanism. Crucially, the new market will bring enhanced security and diversity of electricity supplies.

 The heart of the Bill is the section dealing with the proposed devolution of policing and criminal justice. The Opposition agree with the Government that it is right that such matters should in due course be devolved to politicians directly accountable to the people of Northern Ireland, but we need to be clear about the basis on which that will happen. Several interventions in the Secretary of State&#039;s speech showed that there is concern among Members on both sides of the House about precisely how the Bill&#039;s order-making powers might be applied in future.

<a name="stpa_75">I think that the Government are right to transfer lead responsibility for national security from the police to the Security Service, but it will not be easy to define the boundary between strategic matters and operational matters. By the time policing is devolved, the House will need to have a clearer view than we are able to take at present about matters of accountability and, in particular, the extent to which the Northern Ireland Policing Board and the police ombudsman are to have jurisdiction over matters that touch on terrorism or national security.

That independence is critical if the police are to continue to make progress in gaining cross-community support throughout Northern Ireland. As both the Secretary of State and I know from visits to cities in Northern Ireland, it is very impressive to hear from local commanders how they are gradually extending what we would regard as normal policing to parts of Northern Ireland that have not had anything remotely like normal policing for the past 30 years or longer.

The devolution of policing and criminal justice is a desirable objective, but it cannot occur until every political party that appoints Ministers to a devolved Executive has accepted the legitimacy of the police and the courts and is prepared to support those institutions. Support for the police, the courts and the criminal justice system is not an optional extra; nor is it some magnanimous concession that should entitle those offering it to a political reward.

Loyalist communities need investment, jobs and better education and training, and they need to be rid of drug dealing and the protection rackets.

I welcome the effort being made by some men within loyalism to get the paramilitary gangs to decommission their weapons and put themselves out of business, and I am sure that the Secretary of State and I agree that the sooner that happens the better for everybody concerned, especially people on loyalist estates in Northern Ireland&#039;s cities.

 The hon. Gentleman is very generous in giving way. Perhaps I can take of advantage of him to provide that assurance.

 I should like to bring the hon. Gentleman back to his point that people with connections to terrorism could not possibly be involved in certain matters relating to the police, the law and the courts. Would he go further and say that it would not be in the interests of Northern Ireland to have people in government in that part of the United Kingdom who were still connected to terrorists and to terrorist violence?
</p>





<p><a name="st_108"><a name="60313-16_spnew2"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 Yes. I was about to make exactly that point. The Secretary of State referred to the events of last year&#151;to the IRA statement announcing the end of its so-called armed struggle and to the act of decommissioning in September, which General de Chastelain reported involved a very large quantity of guns and explosives. Both those IRA actions were of major significance, and had they happened five or six years ago, when they should have happened&#151;when democratic politicians from both traditions had every right to expect them to have been taken&#151;they might have been of decisive importance in building trust. However, and in response to the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, it is not enough simply to take the events of last year as conclusive. They marked significant steps in the right direction, but we need evidence to convince us that the republican movement&#039;s commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means of attaining its political objectives is both permanent and irreversible.

 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s approach is absolutely right. Whether or not the IRA is on a permanent and irreversible path to peace, the crucial question for many people is whether its members are prepared to disband their military organisation. If they will not, does not that indicate that at some point they would be willing to reconsider the use of violence?
</p>





<p><a name="st_110"><a name="60313-16_spnew4"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 At one stage, Ministers in the Irish Government called on the IRA to disband&#151;the Justice Minister did so recently. I agree that an announcement about disbanding would probably send a more powerful signal to the Unionist community and to democratic nationalists in Northern Ireland than any other single gesture. Instead, too much of the debate about the future devolution of policing has centred on whether and, if so, when Sinn Fein will take up its seats on both the Policing Board and district policing partnerships. Taking seats risks being an empty gesture unless it is a clear demonstration that republicans will henceforward support the PSNI as an institution and work for its success.
</p>

<a name="60313-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_83">Ideology is important. We cannot have on the Policing Board members of a political party that will not accept either the police or the courts as legitimate, but instead looks to the army council of the provisional IRA as the supposed source of legitimate authority not just in the north but throughout the entire island of Ireland.

<p><a name="st_111"><a name="60313-16_spnew5"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner: </b> 
 I agree with every word that my hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_112"><a name="60313-16_spnew6"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. Ideology is important because we are talking about an organisation that takes pride in asserting that it acts in accordance with a consistent ideological position, and a visible shift in ideology would have a very important symbolic impact on republicanism&#039;s own followers. However, my hon. Friend is right to say that that ideological change needs to have clear practical expression. That should not only be in the form of a cessation of punishment beatings, or paramilitary assaults, as they are more properly described; it means the cessation of involvement in criminality of all types.

<a name="60313-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_86">I want briefly to touch on three of the other subjects included in the Bill, the first of which is electoral registration. I was concerned by the original Government proposal in the consultation paper to extend the deadline for electoral registration to just 11 days before the poll, and I noted the concerns of the chief electoral officer that such a tight deadline would make it difficult to carry out the checks that would be needed under the Northern Ireland system and might add to the risk of fraud. I therefore welcome the fact that the Government have now decided to introduce safeguards in response to those concerns. We will want to explore the adequacy of those safeguards in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_87">That leads me to comment that the rigour not just of those safeguards but of the entire system for electoral registration and, indeed, the other changes in the Bill, such as doing away with the statutory annual canvass, depends critically on the integrity, authority and independence of the chief electoral officer. I have met the current office holder and was impressed by what he told me about how electoral registration is carried out in Northern Ireland. In the light of the importance of that office for the integrity of the entire registration system, I confess to being somewhat uneasy about the fact that the Bill makes the chief electoral officer&#039;s reappointment after five years subject to renewal by the Government, whereas at the moment, I understand, he is appointed indefinitely, subject only to good behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_88">I am certainly not casting any adverse imputations at the Secretary of State or any of his Ministers if I say that I am uneasy about the prospect of any politician from any political party having it in his power to decide whether the chief electoral officer should or should not be reappointed after five years. One could see how the chief electoral officer might be subjected to a certain amount of political pressure in how he exercised his judgment because he would want to make sure that he got a second term in the job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_89">I cannot leave the subject of electoral registration, however, without expressing some regret&#151;to take up a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)&#151;that the Government are allowing a different system in Northern Ireland from that in the rest of the United Kingdom, or, more properly, that they are not applying the system of individual registration that is successfully guarding against fraud in Northern Ireland to the rest of the country. I am sorry that the Secretary of State was unable to persuade his Cabinet colleagues to benefit from the experience of Northern Ireland and particularly sad that he was unable to persuade the Secretary of State for Wales to go down that route, and I still hope that, some day soon, the Government may understand that the Northern Ireland example is the one that England, Wales and Scotland should follow.

If the proposal for an island of Ireland wholesale energy market involves lower prices and greater choice for energy consumers in Northern Ireland&#151;there might be a particular advantage for business consumers of energy&#151;it should be supported.

 The Bill before us is an odd one. It is something of a dog&#039;s breakfast in that it contains all sorts of bits and scraps, some not particularly substantive. Yes, there are important provisions and some welcome ones, but as we will show, the most significant feature of the Bill is what is not in it, rather than what is.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_95">It is interesting that, introducing the debate, the Secretary of State took a lot of time to deal with the subject of MI5 and there were many interventions on

<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1185</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the future of intelligence policing when there is nothing in the Bill that deals directly with that matter. If the Bill made direct provision for the enhanced and expanded role that appears to be envisaged for MI5, that would be good cause to vote against it, even on Second Reading; however, it does not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_96">That does not reassure those of us who are concerned about plans for the future of intelligence policing&#151;a point that will be developed by my hon. Friends when they speak. We cannot accept the Secretary of State&#039;s assurance in relation to MI5 that what has happened in the past will not happen in the future. What basis do we have for accepting such an assurance from a Government who are in denial about what has happened in the past and who, through measures such as the Inquiries Act 2005, have acted precisely and deliberately to make sure that the truth cannot emerge about things that happened in the past, courtesy of MI5.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_97">In their interventions, hon. Members referred to various paramilitary organisations and terrorist groups. All the terrorist organisations in Northern Ireland have comported themselves as paramilitary organisations, but the sad and shameful reality is that military interests in Northern Ireland&#151;namely, MI5&#151;have in the past comported themselves as para-terrorists in their handling of and engagement, involvement, collusion and complicity in all sorts of crimes committed by terrorists. They did not share intelligence that could have been used to apprehend people, to alert people, or to save lives. Such was the nature of its operations that MI5 literally, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) said, conspired to allow people to get away with murder. When the Government seem content to cover up those aspects of the past, I find it hard to accept their assurances about the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_98">The suggestion made was that MI5&#151;with its record in Northern Ireland&#151;is to be some new feature. Listening to the Secretary of State talk about trying to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom, one might think that Northern Ireland had never had MI5 and its intelligence operatives before. Well, we have, and we have had far too many of them. Trusting the future of intelligence policing to MI5 is like making Herod the children&#039;s commissioner&#151;it goes against the whole record of experience and legitimate interest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_99">MI5 has not shown respect for the rights of the citizens of Northern Ireland, it has not respected life and it has not respected the duties and responsibilities of other law enforcement agencies, and I have seen nothing to tell me that that will change in future. That is why we have fundamental concerns about the plans for the future of intelligence policing. It is all very well the Secretary of State saying that the police service will have operational responsibility when the Security Service advises the police of something: the big question is what about the circumstances in which the Security Service does not advise the police of something, or deliberately misadvises them? All that has happened in the past, and there is nothing to assure us that it will not happen in the future.
</p>

<p>

Legitimate national security issues will still have to be addressed but, as I said in an intervention, the Patten report clearly recommended that the Chief Constable report to the Secretary of State on such matters, rather than to devolved bodies and the Policing Board. That is the way forward&#151;stick to the Patten path.
</p>





<p><a name="st_114"><a name="60313-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 It is not clear whether the hon. Gentleman accepts my basic point that the Security Service needs to be able to co-ordinate its activities in every part of the United Kingdom mainly to fight the modern problem of international terrorism. Surely, the hon. Gentleman is not disputing that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_115"><a name="60313-17_spnew2"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 I have already said that we should stick to what Patten recommended, and Patten clearly envisaged the need for continued intelligence policing. The report also made clear both the changes that had to be made to the police service to accommodate that capacity and the issues on which the Chief Constable would report to the Secretary of State. There would be some issues of national security on which it would be appropriate for the Secretary of State, rather than the devolved authorities, to receive reports. I therefore do not accept the case that the Secretary of State made for an enhanced and expanded role for MI5 in future.
</p>





<p><a name="st_116"><a name="60313-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Perhaps I am trying the hon. Gentleman&#039;s patience, but we all do so to one another in the House. It is a question of yes or no. Does he think that the Security Service should have primacy when fighting terrorism and doing its work? He spoke about the role of the Chief Constable and so on, but we have made that role clear. I am not certain whether he agrees or disagrees that the Security Service should be able to operate in such a way that it can combat the problems of terrorism, particularly international terrorism, and protect the national interest? Does he agree with that or not, particularly the point about national security?

<p><a name="st_117"><a name="60313-17_spnew4"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 I should have thought that a comparison with Herod as children&#039;s commissioner indicated that I do not accept that the Security Service should be trusted with a role of such primacy, particularly given its record. It is not as if we have a figmentary concern about the future conduct and performance of MI5 and the quality of its relationship with the police service, as history shows the true and ugly face of such matters.

<a name="stpa_101">The Bill makes a number of provisions in several different areas, and my hon. Friends will deal with political donations, electoral registration and the creation of a single energy market throughout the island of Ireland. Those are important provisions, but there are other things that the Government could have included in the legislation but which they have chosen not to include. As long ago as 2000, the British Government agreed to review whether or not the Human Rights Commission should be given powers to call persons and papers, and to enter and inspect the premises of public authorities. Without those powers, the record shows that its investigations can be hampered and impeded, as

 Given that the commitments were made as far back as 2000, that the response to the consultation is now available and that the Government have indicated that there are other amendments that they might be prepared to include in the Bill, they should indicate their willingness to use the Bill to make that provision. Rather than waiting until next year to legislate&#151;as they may or may not plan to do&#151;why not   do so now? Fairly simple and straightforward amendments could be tabled to deal with the matter.

 I do not accept that the commission should have lesser powers than those outlined in the Paris principles when it comes to carrying out its remit in respect of human rights in Northern Ireland. That remit should be significant and many people believed and assumed that it was as significant as what is covered in the Paris principles. That is what has to be rectified and remedied. We should remember that we are talking about a product of the Good Friday agreement. The human rights commission in the Republic is also a product of the Good Friday agreement.

It emerged as a result of negotiations between the two Governments, the Democratic Unionist party and Sinn Fein.

It also agreed that coming out of the shadow Assembly would depend on    the reports of the Independent Monitoring Commission. It now says that it would not have the Independent Monitoring Commission about the place and that the commission should have no part in determining our political future.

 It is not a question of importing the comprehensive agreement wholesale into legislation. The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) and I have spent some time talking to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party, the DUP, the Ulster Unionist party, Sinn Fein and the other parties about a consensus on the way forward, which remains our objective. We intend to try to achieve that, but I need his party to engage positively, rather than to pretend that everything should remain unchanged. The small tweaks, as it were, to the existing arrangements could easily be dealt with by common agreement if his party would focus on the detail, rather than simply saying on principle, &quot;No, we&#039;ll never change anything.&quot;
</p>





<p><a name="st_123"><a name="60313-18_spnew1"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for his intervention, but we have engaged very positively with all the detail. Like many other parties, we were engaged positively and constructively in the detail of such things in the review of the Good Friday agreement and then we found it aborted by the two Governments. We had put forward all sorts of proposals to improve the workings of the institutions, and effectiveness, efficiency, transparency and accountability, because people said that they were worried about those issues. All sorts of ideas were put forward, but the Government were not interested in that.

<a name="stpa_104">Again contrary to what the Secretary of State has said, the comprehensive agreement does not provide for mere tweakings of parts of the Good Friday agreement. Central to the Good Friday agreement was the principle of democratic inclusion and key to the concept of inclusion in the agreement was respect for difference and   for parties&#039; mandates. Parties would go into Government according to the strength of their mandate, if they so chose. Nobody could vet or veto each other&#039;s appointments to Government. That principle of inclusion is torn up by the comprehensive agreement. Not only is there a possibility of people being able to prevent the appointment of Ministers, under the comprehensive agreement the Social Democratic and Labour party and the UUP are effectively threatened with automatic exclusion from ministerial office if we do not bend a knee to Sinn Fein and the DUP and vote

Annex B, strand one, paragraph 9 of the comprehensive agreement states that we will be automatically excluded from office if we abstain on a vote of which the only legal effect would be to elect the First and Deputy First Minister. Someone cannot be automatically excluded from office for committing a crime, misconduct in office or all sorts of other misdemeanours, but they would be   automatically excluded under the comprehensive agreement for exercising a legitimate democratic right and expressing a legitimate democratic difference.

<a name="stpa_105">There are other aspects of the comprehensive agreement that would mean that, in restored institutions, we would find it hard to get decisions taken and that there could be gridlock. The content of the comprehensive agreement is wrong and flawed. Fundamentally, parties need to remember that all the issues relating to the workings of the institutions and the agreement did not bring about suspension. They did not bring the institutions down. The institutions were brought down because of other things happening or not happening completely outside them. Resolving those issues should not be a precondition for restoring the institutions. We can address the issues, as we were addressing them constructively, in the context of a review. The best circumstances for a review to take place would be in the context of working restored institutions, because then every party would have a lot more confidence about the real willingness of other parties to engage in those sort of institutions and processes. It is that lack of confidence that is at the root of the deadlock and stand-off at the moment.

<a name="stpa_106">Of course, it is not just what is in the comprehensive agreement that has worried those of us who stand fully by the Good Friday agreement, but the fact that we were told in a statement by the hon. Member for Belfast, East that the comprehensive agreement had alongside it 100 side deals and secret understandings in the form of more than 100 clarifying answers, notes and letters. We were told that about the comprehensive agreement at a time when the Government were still telling us that there would be no more side deals and we had seen the last of them. In a while, we will probably be told that there has not been a side deal in two months. The fact is that we can trust neither what is in the comprehensive agreement, nor what we have not been shown outside of it. Again, I warn the Government against the misadventure of turning to the comprehensive agreement and things like it for new material for legislation because that will not give us a platform for progress, but just create a political tug of war in a dead end, which will not take anything forward.

<a name="stpa_107">The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) mentioned that provisions on the devolution of policing and justice are at the heart of the Bill. We need to remember that the power to devolve policing and justice already exists&#151;it is not created by the Bill. The Bill does not do much one way or another in respect of that basic power, which is in section 4(2) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_108">The Bill contains provisions that are somewhere between a figment and a fig leaf. It contains provisions that may or may not operate or be called upon, such as the power to appoint a Minister of justice in a way other than by d&#039;Hondt. There may or may not be a joint Ministry and rotating junior and senior Ministers. The Bill provides for all sorts of things that might not happen. We know, as my earlier remarks and the Secretary of State&#039;s comments have shown, that much of the more serious stuff that will happen regarding future policing, such as that involving MI5, lies outside the Bill. We have been given a figment, or fig leaf, so that some people can pretend that the big, outstanding issue that kept them off the Policing Board and prevented them from supporting the policing arrangements has been resolved and that their demand for the devolution of justice and policing has been met.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_109">The scale to which some devolution has already taken place should not be underestimated. The Policing Board already has quite a number of the powers and functions that were formerly exercised by the Secretary of State and the Northern Ireland Office. That was shown graphically when the Secretary of State and the NIO tried to intervene on and influence the Policing Board on the position of the then Chief Constable, Ronnie Flanagan. A similar thing happened in response to the police ombudsman&#039;s report on Omagh. It cannot be emphasised enough that the Policing Board proved that it had devolved powers and independence. Sinn Fein has refused to be part of the devolution that has already taken place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_110">There is a paradox about Sinn Fein&#039;s position on the outstanding issues of devolution. The DUP must be delighted&#151;its members must be grinning like horses chewing thistles&#151;whenever Sinn Fein effectively gives it a veto on the position on policing. Sinn Fein&#039;s big, macho position is that it will not move on policing until the DUP agrees a date for the devolution of justice and

The DUP will pocket that veto and say, &quot;That will do nicely, thank you very much.&quot; It is quite happy that Sinn Fein&#039;s position has given it a veto on the future of policing, the devolution of justice and policing and devolution. People need to understand that there is a ruse going on and that the Bill is somewhere between a figment and a fig leaf.

They should set a date for restoring the political institutions, put it to the parties and flush out where the parties stand on all the institutions of the agreement.

 As you will know, Madam Deputy Speaker, since the last time that we had a debate on Northern Ireland, the Liberal Democrats have elected a new leader. There is a new shadow Cabinet, but I am still here. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell), in his benevolence, has granted me the opportunity to continue to speak on Northern Ireland and, indeed, Wales, which proves that he is far from Ming the merciless, but Ming the merciful. Since the last Ming dynasty lasted 275 years, I am both relieved and delighted to have found favour with the new emperor.

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_112">I thank the Secretary of State for introducing the Bill and explaining its various provisions. On the whole, Liberal Democrats support the motivation behind them, but, once again, we have several serious concerns. We will thus try to improve the Bill as it progresses through the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_113">The hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) correctly pointed out that we had a debate on the possible unintended consequences of the Short money for Sinn Fein. I remind him and the House that the problem with that debate was not the sincere intent of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, but the confused attempt by the Leader of the House to explain what was going on, which led many Liberal Democrat Members to vote as the hon. Gentleman would have liked: against the proposal. I say to the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), who is likely to wind up today&#039;s debate, that it is important that a lesson is learned from that debate. Individuals have become cynical and think that while the Government might intend to do one thing today, a future Secretary of State or Minister may do another thing tomorrow. In Committee, I intend&#151;I hope that hon. Members of all parties will do this&#151;to ensure that we really understand the consequences of such a wide-ranging Bill. The hon. Member for Foyle described the Bill as a dog&#039;s breakfast, but I would more charitably describe it as a catch-all Bill that covers many matters. The worst thing that could happen would be that the Bill had precisely the opposite outcome to that intended by the Government, but that is more than possible, given the history of other legislation.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_114">Let me turn to the details of the Bill. We have little worry about the intention in clause 1 of introducing anonymous registration in Northern Ireland to mirror clause 10 of the Electoral Administration Bill. As the Secretary of State indicated, the power would allow individuals to register anonymously if they feared that their safety, or that of any person in their home, would be at risk if they could be identified from the electoral register. Given the changing threat of terrorism in Northern Ireland, I can only say that I hope that the number of people for whom the provision might be necessary will be small and decrease over time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_115">I am curious about how the Government will achieve anonymous registration. The clause allows the Secretary of State to lay an Order in Council to achieve such registration. However, will the Minister explain why such a measure is not simply in the Bill? Why, once again, do we have to go through the increasingly unsatisfactory Order-in-Council process? Why is it not possible to extend the provisions on electoral administration to Northern Ireland now because the Government could thus achieve their aim earlier than they would by using the Bill? Perhaps there is a procedural explanation, but I have not heard it, so I hope that the Minister will deal with my point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_116">We are disappointed that the Government intend to abolish the annual canvass that was introduced by the Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. The annual canvass has proved to be pretty successful in Northern Ireland. The introduction of individual registration, with personal identifiers, has been a matter for debate throughout the whole of the United Kingdom. In Northern Ireland it has led to a much more accurate and robust electoral register than those compiled under the system of household registration. There are roughly 1.2 million people on the register, which is an estimated 91 per cent. of the voting age population.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_117">I understand the Government&#039;s concern at the continued decline in numbers of people registering, and we must make sure that the procedures are not so onerous that we are discouraging registration. That is a fair point, but I fear that by extending the period of time between canvasses to 10 years, the Government have back-pedalled far too far and will, as an unintended consequence, achieve the exact opposite of what they seek to achieve. Can the Minister, in his summation, explain why a period of 10 years was chosen? Would not a shorter period be more sensible&#151;if not an annual canvass, then a canvass every four years to ensure that the registers are comprehensive in advance of Assembly elections?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_118">There is a logic to tying the registration of individual voters to the timing of Assembly elections. It is not clear to me why the Government would choose a period&#151;10 years&#151;which will necessarily alter the synchronisation of the electoral registration process with the elections, which should be on a fixed time scale once the situation normalises.
</p>





<p><a name="st_129"><a name="60313-19_spnew1"><b> Rev. Ian Paisley: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the fact that people can register up to a few days before the voting date leaves them no excuse for not being on the register?

<p><a name="st_130"><a name="60313-19_spnew2"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is correct. In theory, there is every opportunity for people to register, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1193</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>but it takes some proactivity from the individual elector to do that, whereas the suggested process of registration, if I understand it correctly, produces some back pressure to encourage individual registration. If there is to be a formalised period between registrations, the Government should seriously consider synchronising that process with elections that happen on a fixed time scale.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_119">The Secretary of State and the Minister may want to consider another suggestion. Would it be possible for the chief electoral officer to send to every household every 12 months a sheet of paper containing the details of members of the household who are on the register? Perhaps the Minister intends that to happen anyway, in which case I would be delighted to hear that reassurance. It would allow people to confirm that their details were correct, or to ask for certain different people living in that household to be registered. It would mean that every individual did not have to re-register every year, which is what the Government want to change, but we would still have a more accurate picture every year of the state of the register. The system of individual registration has worked in Northern Ireland, and it would be wrong to undermine it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_120">I turn briefly to clause 8 and the changes that it makes to the tenure of the chief electoral officer. I understand that the current chief electoral officer is due to retire shortly, and that the process to appoint a successor is well under way. Can the Minister confirm to me that the candidates for the position were aware of the impending changes to tenure? That does not relate directly to the Bill, but if the Minister could clear that up in his comments or by way of intervention, that would be helpful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_121">Clause 10 deals with a more important issue. The power to change the date of an election by statutory instrument is a proposal with which we fundamentally disagree. The House may recall that in 2003, the Government postponed the date of elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, not once, but twice. Contrary to the concerns of the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley), I remind him that on both occasions we criticised the Government for interfering with the date of the elections. I realise of course that the provision would not allow the Secretary of State to postpone elections, just to bring them    forward. Nevertheless, this is a fundamental constitutional issue and should not be decided by way of secondary legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_122">In reply to an intervention, the Secretary of State said something that worried me even more. Asked whether he would insist on proceeding with an alteration to the date of an election even if the parties in the House opposed it, he said, &quot;It is not something I would want to do.&quot; The inference was that it was something that he would be willing to do, regardless.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_123">To take a salient example of a democratic deficit, let us remember that the Government were elected with roughly one third of the vote. That means that two thirds of the vote was for parties that opposed the Government&#039;s manifesto, yet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that he would be willing to force through a change to the date of an election even if the parties representing two thirds of the electorate opposed it. The position is worse than that. If the Secretary of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1194</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>State is willing to do that, there is every expectation that he would be willing to ignore the overwhelming view of the parties in Northern Ireland. That is why I am so concerned, and it is to some extent why we were opposed to the change on 17 March 2003, the first change to the date of the elections at that time, and once again we criticised the change on 12 May 2003.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para12">
<a name="stpa_124">I am not satisfied that the Secretary of State has resolved our concern. More than that, Members of the House and of another place should have the opportunity to debate fully the merits of such a move, and to propose such amendments as Parliament considers necessary. I cannot see why a Secretary of State would be so unwilling to countenance a reasonable debate on the Floor of the House and in another place, if he was so sure of his ground.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_125">Despite the contrary claims, I recall that I and others thought that the Government were trying to help one particular party at the time&#151;the Ulster Unionist party&#151;by changing the date on at least one of those occasions. I remember predicting that that would have only a beneficial effect for the Democratic Unionist party, which at the time did not seem to be a particularly close friend of the Government. We know that that relationship has since been mended, and that the DUP and others are a little worried about the notional nature of the friendships that the Government develop with parties from Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para14">
<a name="stpa_126">Let me be clear that there is much to commend the members of the Democratic Unionist party. They are fine and pleasant people one and all, but it is the vicarious way in which one party finds favour, and then another, that causes us concern in regard to legislation that seems to be framed in order to allow Ministers to alter election dates for what we might call reasons of expediency. In any event, we cannot allow democracy and its routine operation to be reduced to a short debate on the Committee Corridor, which would deny a vast number of the Members the opportunity to discuss such an important issue. We cannot accept the inclusion of the clause in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para15">
<a name="stpa_127">I am also disappointed by the provisions in part 4. Although this part aligns donation controls in Northern Ireland more closely with those in England, Scotland and Wales, it does not achieve full transparency. Northern Ireland political parties and regulated donees will continue to be exempt from the full donation controls until October 2007, after which they will be required to comply with most, but not all, of part IV of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. From November 2007 until 2010 the new measures will require Northern Ireland parties only to submit donation returns to the Electoral Commission on a confidential basis. I fully appreciate that concerns still exist about the publication of donors in Northern Ireland, because of fears for their safety. The new measures are a step in the right direction, but can the Secretary of State guarantee that full disclosure will be achieved by 2010?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para16">
<a name="stpa_128">Let us be realistic. Even if the Government think that the process must be opaque in order to get everybody to buy into it, they need to take a reality check. For example, I doubt whether, even under those more generous arrangements, Sinn Fein would put on its list of donors the Northern bank, which has been more than generous in making a recent donation to that organisation and its 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1195</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>paramilitary colleagues. Paramilitarism and illegal action will continue whether or not we require transparency, and I therefore counsel the Minister that we can achieve that objective a lot more quickly. We are likely to have elections in that period of time, and various parties could benefit from the opaqueness that will guarantee them greater funds than would otherwise be the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para17">
<a name="stpa_129">I also have concerns about extending the categories of    permissible donors. When the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 was progressing through Parliament, Liberal Democrat Members recognised, in the absence of any similar legislation in the Republic of Ireland, that it would be useful to include Northern Ireland in the ban on receiving foreign donations, because parties that operate on an all-Ireland basis would be able to receive such donations through their offices in the Republic. If the DUP were to put its political headquarters in Dublin, it would have no trouble in obtaining international funds. That point applies to every party, a number of which already do exactly that. <i>[Interruption.]</i> There are, as the right hon. Member for North Antrim has suggested, other, more exotic solutions to the problem, and I look forward to his proposing them in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para18">
<a name="stpa_130">The Liberal Democrats agreed to the exemption of Northern Ireland from those provisions on the express condition that the Government would urgently seek to persuade the Government of southern Ireland to introduce similar legislation, or at least to find some way of excluding parties that also operate in Northern Ireland from their own funding arrangements. Will the Minister tell me whether such discussions have taken place? If they have taken place, the Government have been coy about them. Have the Government actively pursued that matter with the Irish Government? If not, will the Minister explain why we should take seriously the Government&#039;s implicit intention of normalising that important element of funding arrangements for political parties in a part of the United Kingdom, namely the north of Ireland?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para19">
<a name="stpa_131">The Electoral Commission also has concerns about those provisions. In its view:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;it is difficult to achieve openness and transparency with such a regime.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para20">
<a name="stpa_132">The commission has stated that it would like the regime to be clarified on the face of the Bill, and it has accordingly asked for a clear definition of the acceptable tests of Irish citizenship in order for the recipients of donations to check the permissibility of donors. Will the Minister take on board those concerns and table amendments accordingly in Committee? If he is unsure about taking that step, will he make a commitment to hold cross-party talks before the Bill enters Committee, because we would be happy to draft amendments that the Government could then accept?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para21">
<a name="stpa_133">Finally, I shall turn to a matter that other hon. Members have already mentioned, namely the arrangements for the devolution of policing and justice to the Assembly. The Liberal Democrats are a devolutionist party, and it has been party policy for many years to devolve those functions to the Assembly, and I therefore welcome the sections of the Bill that will enable policing and justice arrangements to be devolved in any form chosen by the Assembly. However, given the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1196</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>importance of policing to society, we must be careful about when the functions are devolved, and I support much of what the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) has said about policing in Northern Ireland and the insightful points made by the hon. Member for Foyle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para22">
<a name="stpa_134">We all agree that Sinn Fein should come in from the cold on the devolution of policing and justice and that it must take its place on the Policing Board and accept the current policing arrangements. With some justification, the SDLP and the DUP have criticised Sinn Fein for always asking for more on policing, because Sinn Fein has got quite a lot of what it has asked for from this Government but still says that that is not enough, which is a practice that has tried the patience of us all. The Bill includes arrangements for the full devolution of policing, which can happen only when we are sure that Sinn Fein will not act as the dog-in-the-manger party by bleating that there has not been sufficient change to policing in Northern Ireland. Compromises have been made in response to Sinn Fein&#039;s requirements, and Sinn Fein now needs to compromise in return.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para23">
<a name="stpa_135">The Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended for almost five years. From the Assembly elections in 1998 until the beginning of the current suspension in October 2002, the Assembly went through a start-stop process in which there were various periods of suspension. Even when the Assembly was functioning, there were various crises and resignations involving the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and I accept that it would have been quite wrong to devolve policing and justice functions to the Assembly in such an unstable situation. We cannot allow something as important as policing to be devolved to an institution which does not look durable, because it would be disastrous if policing were in the hands of an Assembly Minister one week and a Minister at Westminster the next. Of all the areas in life for which Parliament is responsible, policing is surely one of the most fundamental. There are some hurdles to overcome, some of which relate to political buy-in, primarily by Sinn Fein.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para24">
<a name="stpa_136">Ministers must be careful what they say about crime. For the Secretary of State to discuss &quot;pure crime&quot; implies a certain naivety about the difference between &quot;proper terrorism&quot; and &quot;proper crime&quot;. In recent debates in this Chamber, I have become annoyed, because Ministers appear sincerely to think that Northern Ireland terrorism should be treated differently from international terrorism. Although the Secretary of State claims to see those things equally, as DUP Members have rightly pointed out, they are treated differently. If anyone thinks that a large proportion of organised crime in Northern Ireland is not directly related to organised paramilitarism in Northern Ireland and that money gained from organised crime does not seep across into organised terrorism, they are dreaming and do not understand how paramilitary funding has taken place in the Province.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-19_para25">
<a name="stpa_137">I counsel Ministers to take a more insightful and circumspect view of how they define crime in Northern Ireland and of how they seek to differentiate it from terrorism. The Government have created that problem by repeatedly describing international terrorism as motiveless, while stating that Northern Irish terrorism has motives that we can understand and negotiate away. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1197</b>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) strongly outlined the problem that we have with clauses 19 to 22, which deal with the devolution of justice and policing. Interventions on the Secretary of State were numerous and perceptive in that respect. These four clauses are mainly technical in nature and, one could argue, cosmetic in purpose. They may prove almost irrelevant to what is actually achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_141">It is right to stress that the devolution of justice powers has already been partly achieved. Many of the functions that were formerly exercised by the Northern Ireland Office are now being handled by the Policing Board, at times in opposition to the attitude of the Northern Ireland Office, be it in dealing with the huge challenges of the Omagh report, ensuring proper handling of intelligence by the police, or creating, for the first time ever, a human resource strategy for the police. Patten&#039;s recommendations have been at least 75 to 80 per cent. implemented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_142">The powers that are being sought already exist. Section 4(2) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 gives the Secretary of State the power to devolve justice. All that the Bill does is make some technical provisions to facilitate that. Only one of those has any real political significance&#151;it allows the Secretary of State to make provision that d&#039;Hondt is not to apply to filling the

<br>&nbsp;<br>justice portfolio in the event that the parties decide to adopt some other method of choosing heads of Departments, such as electing joint Ministers. However, when negotiations on the devolution of justice get under way, the parties might well decide to apply d&#039;Hondt. The provision might therefore be completely unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_143">As many Members have said, it would perhaps have made more sense to consider whether legislation was needed after the parties had agreed the shape of devolution, when the full legislative implications could have been properly and fully assessed. It seems to me and my party that the only reason why it is being done beforehand is to help Sinn Fein to change its position on policing on the ground that it has won some wonderful new legislation on the devolution of policing, despite the fact that devolved policing powers are already in the existing legislation. I do not think that that will succeed, because Sinn Fein has no intention of joining the Policing Board. The Secretary of State&#039;s announcement of a new membership clearly indicates that even the Northern Ireland Office recognises that the probability of Sinn Fein joining in on policing lies at some point in the distant future, if ever.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_144">Sinn Fein says that it needs to take control of the &quot;securocrats&quot;&#151;its term&#151;in the police through the devolution of justice. Yet again, it has missed the point, because at the same time as the Government are legislating on the devolution of justice in the Bill, they are taking away responsibility for intelligence gathering on national security from the PSNI and giving it to MI5. That has been a focal point of contention throughout several Members&#039; contributions. The whispered justification for this is that when one has devolved justice one cannot have a devolved Justice Minister who may be of a particular political party. However, that is not the argument. The issue of who gets intelligence information&#151;the devolved Justice Minister or the Secretary of State&#151;is a separate issue from that of who gathers it&#151;the PSNI or MI5. Clearly, as Patten envisaged, the PSNI will not report to the devolved Justice Minister on national security, but rather to the Secretary of State. However, also as Patten envisaged, the Chief Constable should do the reporting, not MI5.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_145">There are several reasons for that. First, the PSNI has undergone the Patten reforms; MI5 has not. Much of the community in Northern Ireland, be it nationalist or Unionist, has no confidence in MI5 and does not identify with it. That is why it would be destabilising for it to have such an enlarged role. Secondly, as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) said, in Northern Ireland organised crime and subversive activity go hand in hand. Reference was made to the Northern bank robbery. That is why one organisation should be in the lead in monitoring the situation&#151;the PSNI. Giving that over to MI5 carries with it the huge risk that it, like the old RUC special branch, will hog the intelligence and not share it, where it does not suit them, with the police who are responsible for prosecutions. People have got away with murder in the past as a result of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_146">Thirdly, Northern Ireland has a much more accountable informer-handling regime under the PSNI following the Patten report, the Stevens report into collusion with the security forces and other activities, and the Omagh report. Taking intelligence gathering from the PSNI diminishes those changes. Moreover, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1199</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>how can we have confidence that MI5 will operate by the same standards? How can we have confidence, for instance, that Torrens Knight, a convicted sectarian mass murderer, will not again be recruited by MI5? Fourthly, the Patten report explicitly stated that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;the police service must remain equipped to detect and deal with terrorist activity, and for this they will need good intelligence capability.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_147">The regime proposed by the NIO means that Patten is being broken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_148">All that is being proposed at a time when it has been recently revealed that MI5 failed to pass on warnings about the Omagh bombing. Who knows whether that tragedy could have been averted had that warning been passed on? Now, I see that the head of MI5, in whom we are meant to have great confidence, has refused to meet the Omagh families, who suffered such a tragedy at that time. Is that accountability? Is that transparency? Is that Patten?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_149">Just when we have overcome the old RUC concept of the force within a force that was the special branch, the Government seem determined to create a force outside a force. Just when nationalist confidence in the police is growing, the Government are creating a new force that will detract from and perhaps destroy that new confidence. The Government need to reconsider their proposal on MI5&#039;s role in Northern Ireland intelligence gathering. If they continue along this path, our community and the prosecution of crime will be greatly diminished.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_150">I should like briefly to deal with some of the comments that were made in the context of the legislation on fundraising for political parties. Disapplying part 4 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 to Northern Ireland was a logical approach to a specific local problem and circumstances. I hope that hon. Members appreciate that political fundraising in Northern Ireland presents distinct challenges, different from those in England, Wales or even the Republic of Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_151">We have not advanced far enough down the road of confidence. Members of my political party could not and would not make donations to the party if their names were published. They would be fearful for their lives and those of their families and for their businesses. There is no doubt about that&#151;and I am talking about the present day, not past history. Circumstances are changing and Northern Ireland has moved on substantially nearly eight years after the Good Friday agreement, but the residue of a problem remains, namely, sectarianism continues to fester and intimidation persists. In the past, individuals have been intimidated, attacked and ostracised because they are donors to and supporters of a specific political party, not only mine. I could give specific examples, but not on the Floor of the House and not to the embarrassment of the people concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_152">For those legitimate reasons, many people seek certainty that their personal details will be kept private if they donate to a political party. Given the experiences of the past, that is not too much to ask. The contributions are made to a political party and to democracy.

First, we should consider the pro-consular powers that it grants the Secretary of State. I do not impugn his integrity or good intentions, but not only the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

<a name="stpa_160">Let me go back to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury, who speaks from the Front Bench and who made some powerful observations 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1202</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about policing. I am strongly opposed to devolving power over policing to any Executive who have Ministers from a party that refuses to take any part in the Policing Board. If we move towards devolution and a power-sharing Executive, and if we have a Deputy First Minister from Sinn Fein&#151;as the arithmetic suggests that we might&#151;it would be preposterous to give devolved powers for policing to an Executive that included Sinn Fein, if Sinn Fein were boycotting the Policing Board and playing no part in returning Northern Ireland to the normality to which we aspire.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_161">It is incumbent on Sinn Fein to pause for a moment. If it is really anxious to have devolution and to play a part as a constructive democratic force, it must do two things. First, it must totally repudiate any connection with organised crime and urge any of its number still involved with organised crime to disgorge their gains. The same goes for the so-called loyalist paramilitaries&#151;I hate to use that term in this context&#151;although they do not have the political muscle that Sinn Fein has. Secondly, Sinn Fein must co-operate with the Assets Recovery Agency and with the police, and play its proper part in making Northern Ireland a law-abiding community again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_162">If Sinn Fein did all that and, having done so, played a part in the Policing Board, it would not be giving up its nationalist aspirations or its desire for a united Ireland. If, some day, the people of Northern Ireland vote for a united Ireland, so be it. I would not do so because I do not want that. I am a Unionist and I support Unionism. However, I wholly honour the way in which the hon. Members for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell), for Foyle and for South Down approach their parliamentary duties and advance legitimately their proper cause. Their party has joined the Policing Board and striven to bring a degree of normality to Northern Ireland. If Sinn Fein would do the same, it would not be necessary for the hon. Member for South Down to make the kind of chilling speech that he made, with his customary charm and great moderation, a few minutes ago. As long as it is possible for such chilling speeches to be repeated and echoed, we shall remain a long way from the state that we wish to be in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_163">I say to the Minister that I hope that the Government, in their legitimate desire to see devolution restored, will not treat with any degree of preference, or perceived preference, a party that does not play by the democratic rules. I hope that they will not seek to rush things, or to impose or over-use the powers of Orders in Council. I hope, above all, that they will not seek, arbitrarily and    against the wishes of those who have been democratically elected and who play by the democratic rules, to force a date for an election, as that would be perceived as yet another concession to those who are not prepared to come in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_164">Those who are not prepared to come in are not here in the Chamber, but I wish that they were. They will be able to read the report of this debate, and I hope that they will do so. I say to them that the door is open for them to come in. If they want a truly peaceful Northern Ireland for their sons, daughters and grandchildren to grow up in, they must take away the system that obliged the hon. Member for South Down to make the speech that he did this afternoon, and they can do that.

 The Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has certainly been well named. The &quot;miscellaneous provisions&quot; seem to be a smokescreen to hide what the Bill is really about. Its main thrust, and the Government&#039;s main motivation in introducing it at this time, is to deal with policing and justice under devolution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_165">The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) admitted tonight that it is all very well to talk about having Sinn Fein on the Policing Board, and about its members taking part in policing and justice, but there should be no place on the Policing Board for anyone associated with terrorism and with the crime that follows hard on the heels of the terrorist organisations, whether they are the UVF&#039;s nominee, who is now on the Policing Board, or not. Of course, if that had happened to be a DUP man, he would have been kicked off. He would not have seen daylight. He would not have been allowed to eat his bread. I myself, even while a Member of this House, was not permitted to enter Downing street for two years. I was looked upon as a leper and was not allowed in through the door. It did not do me any harm&#151;actually, it did me good. But I am used to the knocks of the House. I am a democrat and I believe that, in the end, democracy will win this battle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_166">There is another thing that I must say, which is that we cannot have in the Government of Northern Ireland those who are still in terrorist organisations, and in fact control, run and dictate those terrorist organisations. I did not lock the door at Stormont. I had nothing to do    with it. Who brought down Stormont? The representatives of the Government and the Secretary of State&#151;he brought down the Stormont Administration. They are the people who brought Stormont down. Why did they do it? Because the terrorist activities of Sinn Fein were quite open and people saw what it was doing.

In fact, we were referred to as Ministers who should not be allowed to be Ministers, but under the terms of the agreement the law said that we could be Ministers. Still people tried to exclude us, but what good did it do? Did it convert Sinn Fein? Did the leopard change its spots or the Ethiopian his skin? Not likely. They became more and more aggressive, and, even today, Sinn Fein has only one word to say, which is that the Democratic Unionist party is calling the shots and keeping it out of government.

We do not see repentance, and it should be a repentance not to be repented of, but it has not come. Therefore, the Bill looks away into the distant future. It is nothing to do with today, tomorrow, next week or Christmas. Does anybody believe that, with the standing of Sinn Fein today in Northern Ireland, it will give up its violence and its terrorism?

The Government&#039;s own commissions said that the police had informed them that the IRA still had guns. We were told all the guns were gone, but no one could say that all the guns were gone because no one knew how many guns it had. There was no inventory and no proper challenge.

 I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) and I have to say that some of his comments about the Bill do not really match the current situation.

<a name="stpa_190">It is surreal to be here today debating the enabling framework for the devolution of policing and justice, at a time when devolution of all the other, much less contentious powers is still proving extremely problematic. Not many people in Northern Ireland think that the devolution of policing and justice to politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly is going to happen any time soon, and nor will anyone in this House who examines the situation realistically and sensibly. People take the view that any devolution that involves Sinn Fein-IRA in the administration of crucial matters such as policing and justice is out of the question.

We are talking about people associated with a terrorist organisation that is illegal under the law&#151;people whom the Dublin Government indicated they would not have in their Cabinet in any capacity, let    alone in policing and justice capacities. The International Monitoring Commission report pointed out that such organisations are still actively involved in intelligence gathering and criminality. Surely the hon.

<a name="stpa_191">The hon. Member for Blaydon said that he regretted the fact that his constituents rejected devolution.

Well, if his constituents had been offered the prospect of gangsters connected with the Mafia and other criminals running the local police force, they might have been even more opposed to devolution than they were when they rejected it.

That has to be the understatement of the year. As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) said, there are considerable hurdles still to be overcome, and we have to face reality. It amazes many of us who represent Northern Ireland constituencies that although we are told time and again that slots cannot be found in the parliamentary timetable for consideration of all manner of important legislation, time can be found to debate the devolution of policing and justice.

<p><a name="st_156"><a name="60313-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Dodds: </b> 
 Of course, the triple lock that the Secretary of State referred to means that it is not just the Government who must agree to the devolution of policing and justice; the Assembly must agree to it by a cross-community vote, and the First Minister and Deputy First Minister must initially agree to it before proposing it to the Assembly. I should be grateful if the Minister indicated when he winds up that the latter element of the triple lock is still in his thinking. I am very happy to say to the hon. Lady that I agree that it is absolutely essential that there be a veto in respect of the Assembly&#039;s cross-community provisions, but my point is that that hardly requires a Bill at this stage. Neither now nor in the foreseeable future is there any prospect of the Assembly voting for such an eventuality, so we are spending a lot of time debating something that is unlikely to happen, as my right hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) said earlier.

<p><a name="st_157"><a name="60313-23_spnew7"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson: </b> 
 Does my hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_158"><a name="60313-23_spnew8"><b> Mr. Dodds: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and this issue, which was fully debated during the election campaign for this House not so long ago, doubtless contributed to the success of our party. We made sure that the devolution of policing and justice could happen only with the agreement of Unionists in Northern Ireland via a cross-community vote in the Assembly.

<a name="stpa_193">I agree entirely with the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) on the attitude that Sinn Fein and any party that aspires not just to run policing and justice, but to be in government, must adopt. They must support the forces of law and order and the administration of justice, and demonstrate such support not just by taking seats on the Policing Board or in the district policing partnerships. We must remember that members of Sinn Fein took their places in the Northern Ireland Executive and still went about their criminality&#151;drug dealing, racketeering, intimidation, murder and all the rest&#151;so that they could be in government and undermine everything that good government stands for. Simply taking one&#039;s seat on the Policing Board or in a DPP is not sufficient in itself. Sinn Fein have to make it clear that they support policing on the ground in practical ways, and that they are giving a lead in their local communities. Anything short of that disqualifies that party and any other party that takes the same view from being in government and from ruling over people in any democracy.

<a name="stpa_194">The recent IMC report&#151;the eighth report&#151;was clear, despite the efforts of some to spin it for their own purposes, about the extent of ongoing criminality and of ongoing intelligence gathering about subversive activity by the Provisional IRA. The Provisional IRA was not alone, because there were references to loyalist organisations and dissidents. We do not wish to gloss over that or set it to one side. We accept that such activity also has to end, but&#151;as has already been made 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1211</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>clear&#151;we are talking about the Provisional IRA because Sinn Fein has the political numbers and the votes to enable it to aspire to government. That is why we are concentrating today and in other debates on the role of the Provisional IRA.

<a name="60313-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_195">From the IMC report, our own sources, the Chief Constable&#039;s remarks and other information, there is no doubt that the Provisional republican movement has a long way to travel before anyone can be certain that it has moved to a permanent and irreversible position and foresworn violence and illegal activity for good. As I said in an earlier intervention, as long as it maintains an illegal terrorist organisation, that will be a strong indication to many people that it cannot yet be described as being exclusively committed to peaceful and democratic means. Why would one need an illegal terrorist organisation, even if it is silent, if one were truly and permanently committed to peaceful and democratic methods? That point has been well made, over and over again, by Michael McDowell, the Minister for Justice in the Irish Republic, and by other political parties there.

<a name="stpa_196">Our party backs the changes in the Bill to the electoral registration process. The decision to move the registration deadline nearer to polling day&#151;11 working days before&#151;is to be welcomed. It is a positive move and brings us into line with the position in the rest of the United Kingdom. It will also encourage greater voter participation and involvement in elections. Many people in many of the communities that I represent in north Belfast turn their attention to the issue of whether they are on the electoral register only when an election is announced. By then, it is too late, and I hope that the change will help to ensure that people who want to vote and are entitled to vote can do so.

<a name="stpa_197">I accept that we need safeguards, one of which is that people who register so late will not be able to apply for a postal or absentee vote. There will be other restrictions, but I make a plea that they should not be too burdensome. If they are, they would negate the change. One of the problems that we had with rolling registration and getting people on to the register after the annual canvas was completed was that some people were called to interview in the electoral office. Some of those interviews were set for the middle of the day when people were at work or had other commitments. They were unable to attend and therefore did not bother to proceed with their application to be registered outside the normal annual canvas. I hope that the Minister will accept that any safeguards should be commensurate with the objective of getting as many people on to the register as possible.

<a name="60313-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_198">The abolition of the annual canvas will save considerable expenditure and it will also mean less chance of people falling off the register by accident, simply through neglecting to renew their application.

At the same time as the hon. Gentleman makes that point strongly here today, the leader of his party&#151;and others in his party&#151;call for parties linked to those paramilitaries to take their place in government. Indeed, we are told that we should rush ahead and call the Assembly together in six weeks. No doubt, the hon.

Sometimes, people need to take a reality check. I have no doubt that what the hon. Gentleman said was right.

 I remind the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman has repeated that line so often that he is beginning to believe it. If he reads the comprehensive agreement, he will find that we made sure, through the provisions that we enunciated and the safeguards that we introduced, that the criminality and paramilitarism had to be over for good. However, his party was prepared to vote terrorists into government at a time when no decommissioning was taking place and criminality was ongoing. That was not even mentioned by his party. He voted for that, so it does not behove him to lecture the DUP on such matters.

That opens up the possibility that what is permissible and legal is defined not by debate, discussion and vote in this House and in the other place but by what is decided in Dail Eireann. Laws could be made that apply to parties in Northern Ireland over which we would have no control. The clause that allows that needs careful consideration in Committee. It is far too wide ranging; it opens up possibilities whereby we are handing over power in this matter to another jurisdiction without any real safeguards at all and without any opportunity to curtail it or to revisit the issue, even within the Bill. That needs to be looked at.

If he is holding up his hand and admitting guilt in this matter, I think he is rather short-sighted. He is providing cover to Sinn Fein, which will be by far the main beneficiary of this provision. Far from helping his own party, he will disadvantage it vis-&#224;-vis Sinn Fein in the long run.

That is something that the SDLP has long campaigned for. The Bill acknowledges our argument that we cannot operate efficiently with two small energy markets on a small island. The creation of an all-Ireland electricity market creates better value energy and power through economies of scale and provides security and diversity of supply, making the island of Ireland, north and south, a better place to do business. I compliment the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) who, during his contribution earlier, raised the issue of wider connectivity within the British Isles and to Europe.

<a name="stpa_205">The energy sector in Northern Ireland faces many challenges. We are far too heavily dependent on fossil fuels, and we need to do much more to encourage the development of diversity and more sustainable energy supply. We need to tackle our global warming commitments more sincerely and genuinely through the reduction of carbon emissions. For many years we have been lumbered&#151;indeed, if I dare use the term, murdered&#151;by badly negotiated contracts for electricity generation. We pay an overcharge of 40 or 50 per cent on the normal market rates. We have that millstone around our necks until 2010, 2012 or 2014 when various guarantees to suppliers come to an end. In recent months, gas and electricity costs have increased substantially throughout these islands, but these price increases are particularly severe in Northern Ireland because they come alongside a draconian 19 per cent. rise in the regional rate and the prospect of water charges. They threaten poverty. Far from poverty, being reduced, particularly fuel poverty, we are now faced with an increase, and increased fuel poverty in particular.

<p>
<a name="60313-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_206">While the development in energy markets is welcome, obstacles of many other kinds continue to impede useful, pragmatic and practical north-south co-operation and partnerships, commonsense partnerships that should carry no political burden or baggage whatsoever. It is my understanding that they are as useful and beneficial to those who see themselves as Unionists as to those who see themselves as nationalists. These partnerships are necessary across a wide range of matters. Some of them are minor, others substantial. They include double-charging&#151;particularly roaming telephone charges where people are charged an arm and a leg to make mobile telephone calls over a distance of a mile or two&#151;and taxation anomalies arising from being resident in one jurisdiction and working in another which create further difficulties. All these matters need to be tackled with a commitment to resolving the problems and removing barriers so that people, goods and services can move throughout the island for the benefit of all.

<a name="stpa_207">That is why the SDLP has published detailed proposals, including plans on transport and infrastructure, suggestions of an all-Ireland research alliance, marketing and investment co-operation and a public safety body. We could perhaps go as far as a joined-up anti-poverty strategy across the island. I could go into other issues, but it would unfair of me to drag on now. I have made the point.

<a name="stpa_208">In Northern Ireland, we have some of the best renewable energy resources in Europe, yet, according to the Carbon Trust, only 0.2 per cent. of the north&#039;s primary energy requirement comes from renewable sources. That is a scandal. The threat of global climate change ensures that we must quickly change the way that we source and use energy. Financial assistance is required. There is some around, but it is not massive and we need to extend it further. There is a desperate need to develop, initiate and innovate around the renewable energy sector on a major scale to ensure that we are not as dependent on fossil fuels and the traditional electricity-based fuels of the past. That would allow Northern Ireland to meet its global commitment by increasing the energy available from renewable sources, reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality and

While I am pleased to see the commitment to renewable energy, legislation should be in place by now for a sustainable development strategy for Northern Ireland. Such a strategy would have broader implications to ensure that all areas of Government policy would meet the needs of today&#039;s society while protecting resources for future generations.

<a name="stpa_209">The SDLP welcomes the decision to review arrangements for electoral registration and elections in Northern Ireland. In the past, electoral fraud has been widespread and in some areas it has skewed or affected election results. Proper regulation of the electoral process is crucial to ensure that as many as possible of those eligible to vote are registered, that elections are fair and that the democratic will of the people is reflected as accurately as possible. More than 91 per cent. of those eligible should be registered; I should like the figure to be 97, 98, 99 or even 100 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_210">In the past, my party has campaigned vigorously for measures to combat electoral fraud and we welcomed the Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. We argued that any measure to target fraud must be carefully monitored to ensure that the citizen&#039;s right to vote and the need to guard against fraud were upheld. The three elections since the introduction of the Act were cleaner and fairer than those held previously. The requirement for individual registration, with personal identifiers, has significantly tightened the electoral register and closed down the fraud that had been ongoing over many elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_211">We welcome the high level of public support for measures to combat electoral fraud. According to recent research, 72 per cent. of people endorsed the changes. However, the SDLP believes that although the proposal to allow some individuals to be registered anonymously because of concerns for their safety is sensible, it should be monitored closely. The Order in Council that will define criteria for qualification for anonymous registration needs to be strict to ensure that it is not open to abuse. The criteria must be robustly applied, so that the process protects only those who are genuinely vulnerable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_212">Although public support for clearer, cleaner and fairer electoral registration is high, the requirement for people to register annually has led to a decrease in the number of people registering; as I said earlier, research indicates that only 91 per cent. of eligible people make it on to the register. Although we believe that individual registration should continue on the current basis, using identifiers, as the strongest safeguard against fraud, annual registration is not required and we support its relaxation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_213">The carry forward of people already on the 2004 register was extremely useful, and allowed many people to vote in elections in 2005 who would otherwise have been denied a vote. It was a sensible move that encouraged significantly higher electoral participation.

<a name="60313-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_214">Withdrawing the annual canvass should enable the electoral office to focus better on groups that tend not to register, especially people living in disadvantaged areas and young people, as well as people who have difficulty in completing forms&#151;of whom there are many more than we realise.

I welcome the proposal for easier registration before an election, but I am concerned that 11 days before polling would not give the electoral office enough time to verify applications properly and could lead to a degree of fraud. A slightly longer period&#151;perhaps 18 days&#151;might be more realistic and responsible, to ensure that only those people genuinely entitled to a vote received one.

However, if they do not make the donation, their building site or bar can be wrecked or the business can be interfered with or undermined in some way.

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="60313-25_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ben Wallace  (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con):</b> 
 I understand why the Government have introduced the Bill and I understand their justification that we must 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1217</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>maintain the momentum of the peace process so that there is lasting peace, but we must be careful that the momentum does not become a rush. Far too often recently, the Government have used maintaining that momentum as an excuse to overlook some of the failures of parties such as Sinn Fein in the peace process. The Government could implement some of the measures in the Bill quickly, but that may not ensure that justice is done and that the process is thorough. I urge the Minister to take that on board. Momentum is one thing, rush is another.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_221">One of the main issues that has been raised throughout the debate is the devolving of policing and justice, which is important. The background is that following the Patten report, certain elements in Northern Ireland were keen to get their hands on parts of the policing service. We should not kid ourselves: the jewel in the crown for Sinn Fein has always been to try to get hold of elements of special branch and the informer network, which decimated the party and helped to force it to the negotiating table. Sinn Fein constantly pushes for that, but it is extremely important that we protect the men and women who gave information that led to the   conviction of many men and women who had committed mass murder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_222">The Government&#039;s solution, and their stated aim, is to remove those elements from the policing service and include them in the security services. One of their justifications for the proposal to remove those people from under the umbrella of the PSNI is that it would reflect uniformity across the United Kingdom. That is not technically correct. Obviously, SO12 in the Metropolitan police is involved in informer and agent handling. The security services have primacy, but they do not necessarily carry out operational actions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_223">The uniformity argument is also undermined by the fact that on the mainland the two organisations report to two Ministers in the same Government. We could end up with the security services reporting to a UK Minister and the Police Service of Northern Ireland reporting to a justice Minister in the Northern Ireland Assembly, with conflict between the two lines of responsibility. I am sure that whoever the justice Minister was, they would like to be informed of security service operations, especially when they entered the realm of police executive action. Therein lies a problem: when would members of the security service want to tell the justice Minister about an operation that involved somebody of their own political persuasion; for example, Sinn Fein?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_224">I urge the Minister to work out the details. One option is, as in the Patten report, to keep the security services in the PSNI, but have them reporting to the Secretary of State. Another option is to consider special provision to allow the security services to have some form of executive power in Northern Ireland. Those are just off-the-cuff suggestions, but these are important details. The strength of the RUC and PSNI special branch was the fact that cases went from intelligence to evidence to conviction in the same organisation. That is one reason those cases were successful.
</p>





<p><a name="st_165"><a name="60313-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 For the benefit of the hon. Gentleman and the rest of the House I refer him to the discussion paper that we published on devolving policing and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1218</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>criminal justice in Northern Ireland. It sets out a range of issues about some of the questions that he is raising. We want debate; we want discussion; we want continued engagement on how to proceed in the event of the triple lock of the Assembly, the Government and this House supporting such devolution.
</p>





<p><a name="st_166"><a name="60313-25_spnew2"><b> Mr. Wallace: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, but some of the answers given by the Secretary of State, such as the uniformity argument, could be defeated in debate. We are often in danger of creating two-tier terrorism: there is international terrorism and there is little, local Irish terrorism, with the IRA as a bunch of boyos who throw a few petrol bombs and are very different from al-Qaeda or the Islamic community. The IRA raised funds and entered into arrangements with Mr. Gaddafi. He is now Mr. Blair&#039;s friend, but certainly when I was in Northern Ireland he was helping to supply the IRA with weapons. The IRA has international reach&#151;it trained with the Palestine Liberation Organisation and even managed a bird-watching tour to Colombia only a couple of years ago&#151;and it is more sophisticated than some other terrorists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_225">The idea that we can treat one group of terrorists differently from another is wrong. The Liberal Democrat Front-Bench spokesman was very clear on that. Many of us, including the party of government, have always accepted that a crime is a crime is a crime. It is not a little local difficulty with a terrorist or a prisoner of war; it is a crime. My worry is that in having this fudge, in an attempt to sustain momentum, we set a precedent by creating two tiers of terrorists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_226">It is very clear that members of the SDLP, for example, are democrats. They have always fought in the hardest environments to uphold the democratic principle. There has been no fudging. Sinn Fein has, on the one hand, entered into democracy and, on the other, spied at Stormont. It will not take ownership of, participate in or even recognise the Northern Ireland Policing Board. That is the crux of the matter: Sinn Fein has, like any other democrat in Northern Ireland, to recognise its duty to policing. We saw Sinn Fein-IRA&#039;s idea of justice following the murder in the Short Strand, when in a statement with regard to the murderers it said, &quot;We&#039;ll kill them if you want.&quot; That is not my type of justice. We should ask them whether they are going to take ownership of this process, which means playing a proper role in the Policing Board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_227">Not so long ago I attended a dinner with a number of serving police officers and licensed released terrorists&#151;I think that that is probably the right term&#151;including one loyalist and one republican terrorist. The opinions that they expressed are not rare, but I was shocked. I asked one whether he thought that he had done anything wrong in murdering someone and his answer was &quot;No.&quot; I asked the other what he felt, and he said, &quot;Well, I have learnt so far in the peace process that violence should not be the first option, only the last.&quot; That was a man who was released on licence. We have to understand that that attitude, that violence is always there and always an option, still prevails.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_228">When Sinn Fein takes ownership of policing and says, &quot;No more,&quot; and perhaps disbands the IRA, that option will be ruled out, certainly for a long period. I would hope that it would be ruled out for ever, but if one studies Irish history one knows that ceasefires have

</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_229">The Bill also deals with donations. Again we have a two-tier element, in that one party in the process is treated slightly differently from another. It is interesting that, under Irish law&#151;a 1997 Act amended in 2001&#151;an Irish citizen, even one living in the United States, can donate money to Sinn Fein. In the five years from 1997 to 2002, Friends of Sinn Fein USA donated $1 million to Sinn Fein&#039;s coffers. That can happen under Irish law because one has only to be an Irish citizen, an Irish corporate body or an extension of a political party based in Ireland. Friends of Sinn Fein, therefore, is allowed to donate, and under new regulations in Ireland it will not have to declare its donation unless it is part of a political campaign. If it is funding Sinn Fein activities other than those in elections, it does not have to be declared.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_230">If we want a fair democratic process, in both the south and the north of Ireland, we cannot have different rules for different groups of people. I am sure that there are well intentioned Irish citizens in the south who donate to the Unionist cause; I do not know how many. There was certainly an attempt to march in Dublin recently. The situation seems to favour one group or party, and that unfairness leads to a feeling of injustice that we are all trying to rule out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_231">It is rather ironic, perhaps, that currently the biggest single donor to Sinn Fein-IRA is Her Majesty&#039;s Government, with the fudge on Short money that we saw not so long ago and allowances being given by this House to a party that does not sit in this House. That is perverse. The hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) referred to the ANC under apartheid in South Africa. I am afraid that the South Africans would think us barking mad for giving so much funding to one particular party at this moment.

We debated the issue with the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Woodward). Rather discourteously, at no stage did he say that, never mind us all having to agree to an amnesty for one more year, this Bill, which I am sure had already been drafted or was in the process of being drafted, would sneak under the wire the extension of the amnesty to 2010.

<a name="stpa_233">The Secretary of State referred to the ninth report of the International Monitoring Commission.

If it is all going so well, why do we need a three-year extension? <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister of State says from a sedentary position that it is for loyalists. I am sorry, but the loyalists should have the same chance as everyone else. They should be told, &quot;There&#039;s your amnesty. There&#039;s your chance.&quot; Most people have tried to decommission. How many years do they want? Loyalist or nationalist, they should get their chance, and that is it.

First, the Assembly must agree; Ministers must agree; and, indeed, I believe that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister must agree. All those things are possible, and we must be careful not to oil the lock so much that it slips open with the most gentle pushing.

In Committee and throughout the Bill&#039;s proceedings in the House, I shall do my best to ensure that everyone is treated the same in the Bill.

<a name="stpa_238">I agree with the SDLP Members, especially the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) in his opening remarks, about anonymity for donations. The reality is that people are intimidated and threatened and their political activities are curtailed. I should like to think that that was not so, but I want the SDLP, not Sinn Fein-IRA, to represent the nationalist cause. That is why I go along with the protections for donors or anyone else in the current regime. We should not forget that the parties must still present their election expenses and their donations&#151;they are just kept confidential&#151;and it is important that any extension may happen in three years time. I will go along with the SDLP&#039;s cries for protection because we must live in the real world.

On his last remark, it is not even just an issue of the intimidation of those who might be donors to political parties in Northern Ireland&#151;the reality is that Northern Ireland is a very divided society, and as soon as anyone is identified as a supporter of one party or another, that person will automatically lose a large section of their clientele.

The Bill&#039;s provisions clearly range from Dan to Beersheba, but the central issue is policing and justice. That was clearly the most prominent issue that the Government had to deal with, and I should describe why they had to do so.

<a name="stpa_246">The Minister talked of a triple lock. I suspect that none of those locks will be opened if policing and justice powers are devolved to Northern Ireland. The Government certainly would not consider that the time is appropriate to hand over the responsibility for policing and justice to the Northern Ireland Assembly, particularly if it included those who are still involved in criminality, according to the Government&#039;s own watchdog on the matter. The Northern Ireland parties in the Assembly would not vote on a cross-community basis for that to take place; nor would the community in Northern Ireland allow it to happen. Therefore, the three locks that the Government say are in place&#151;I will come back to that issue in a moment&#151;would not be unlocked by the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_247">We are talking about what could happen years down the road. Even if the Assembly wanted policing and justice powers to be devolved years down the road, I am told quite reliably, by the Minister&#039;s officials, that it would probably take about two years before they could devolve them. The practical requirements after the Assembly took the decision would take several years to work through the system&#151;enough time, I should have thought, for even the hard-pressed business managers of this place to find time to have this legislation passed. There is no need to deal with the Bill tonight; there is no practical purpose. It is being done for a political purpose&#151;a purpose that is between the Government and Sinn Fein-IRA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_248">I said that I would return to the triple lock. It has changed&#151;it is no longer the triple lock that was in the Government&#039;s proposals for a comprehensive agreement. I have spoken to the Minister privately about the matter, but I think that it is necessary to put it on the public record. When I met him privately, I accused the Minister of being involved in some mischief, and he assured me that he was not. He assured me that the Government would look at the matter and that it was not their intention to depart in that respect from the proposals for a comprehensive agreement. However, the    comprehensive agreement proposals specifically contained another lock, which is not in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_249">The proposed comprehensive agreement required any proposal for policing and justice powers to be devolved in Northern Ireland to be made jointly by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Why is that such an important proposal? It is because even though the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) rightly recognises the advance in the Bill allowing, in effect, a veto for Unionists under the arrangements, regrettably, a cross-community vote in the Assembly does not require a majority of Unionists to be in favour, because one of the triggers for cross-community voting requires only 40 per cent. of Unionists. I do not question the bona fides of the Ulster Unionist party, but the UUP and the Progressive Unionist party could provide that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1223</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>40 per cent., so without the consent of the majority of the Unionist community as represented in that Assembly, legislation could be enacted to have policing and justice powers devolved in Northern Ireland. Two of the crucial locks are absent. Cross-community support in the community itself, which is one of the requirements of the proposals for a comprehensive agreement, would not be provided, and the requirement in the comprehensive agreement for the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to act jointly has been removed. Clearly, such a proposal would not have the support of the largest party in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_250">It is vital that that issue is re-examined. The Minister said that there was no mischief intended by the Government, but I think that if it was not intended by the Government, there is someone lurking in the draftsmen&#039;s department who intends mischief. The draftsmen are extremely careful when looking at the   language of agreements and translating those agreements into legislation. I suspect that it would have been impossible to translate the comprehensive agreement proposals into legislation and simply forget the requirement that the proposal come from the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. I hope that, when he winds up the debate, the Minister will respond to that issue, which many of us consider to be vital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_251">The main point is that in the foreseeable future the circumstances will not exist for policing and justice powers to be exercised in Northern Ireland. Let me make it clear: my party is a devolutionist party. It believes in the widest powers possible being devolved, including policing and justice powers. It wants that to be done with the right modality, at the right time and in the right circumstances, and that can only be when the community has confidence that those powers will be properly exercised. The community could never be satisfied that those powers would be exercised properly when those who would be exercising them are involved in paramilitary and criminal activity.

<p>
<a name="60313-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_252">The reality that we have to face up to is that there is a party in Northern Ireland that is still entrenched in violence and criminality.

<a name="stpa_253">I congratulate the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Siochana on a recent joint effort. Operating on both sides of the border in the sort of security co-operation that we support and encourage, they descended upon a certain individual. I had asked the Assets Recovery Agency when it was going to act against the man, and I have raised his portfolio in the House on several occasions, so I was glad to see the police on both sides of the border take action. The hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams), who never presents himself in the House, says that the man in question is just an ordinary decent farmer who is being punished because he is a republican, but I looked at the list of items removed from that farmer&#039;s farmyard. He had 200,000 in sterling and euro notes and thousands more in cheques. He had 30,000 cigarettes&#151;he is obviously a heavy smoker. He had 8,000 litres of laundered fuel, although I am not sure in what vehicles he was using it. He also had two firearms&#151;I am quoting

The answer is under bales of hay. Hands up everyone who stores their laptop computer under a bale of hay. I do not suggest that there is anything alarming about the fact that that man&#039;s laptop computers were found under a bale of hay, but it must make discovering their contents more worthwhile.

Nor do they have that many cigarettes, that amount of laundered fuel or that number of vehicles&#151;and they certainly do not keep their laptop computers, if they have any, under bales of hay. However, I congratulate the Garda Siochana and the PSNI and I trust that the case&#151;together with several related cases that the ARA and the Criminal Assets Bureau in the Irish Republic are handling&#151;will eventually come through to the courts.

I understand that he has some emotional capital tied up in that agreement. He believes that it is a wonderful document and that, like the law of the Medes and the Persians, it should never be changed. However, the reality is that it failed.

<a name="stpa_256">The hon. Gentleman has not come to terms with that&#151;he is still in denial. He does not realise that the core of the agreement that he negotiated had cross-community support as a key requirement. Without cross-community support, his deal cannot work, and the people of Northern Ireland have moved on&#151;he has not, but they have. They have shown that repeatedly at the ballot box, which is where we encourage people to show their feelings on such issues. They have said that they do not support his agreement, and one of the key reasons for that is to do with accountability. Although the proposals for a comprehensive agreement have not been endorsed by my party, many of them flow from proposals that were made by my party and many others were not the choice&#151;certainly not the first choice&#151;of members of my party.

She said that that was dreadful and that he was a good man, and she spoke eloquently about his attributes. At home, the Deputy First Minister&#039;s car was taken away, his salary was stopped, and his staff and even his mobile phone were taken away. All the emoluments of office were taken away, but people realised that no one else would be elected to his position because they did not have the necessary cross-community support. They therefore said that he did not resign, even though his resignation was announced in the House, his pay stopped, and he was thrown out of his offices and so on. They decided to overturn everything and make him un-resign. If I were the hon.

<a name="stpa_259">The Secretary of State cannot give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking. I heard an undertaking that the Secretary of State will not implement the piece of the comprehensive agreement whereby effectively the two largest parties&#151;the Democratic Unionist party and Sinn Fein&#151;can determine whether Ministers in fact achieve ministerial office. However, the Secretary of State cannot give such an assurance because of the legislation that was encouraged and supported by the hon. Member for Foyle. The Belfast agreement ensures that there will not be any Ministers in Northern Ireland unless those two parties are satisfied, because they must propose the First and Deputy First Ministers. If they do not do so, for whatever reason, the rest of the process does not take place. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman, therefore, that there is a requirement for change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_260">The Belfast agreement structure is based on a mandatory requirement for Ministers to be appointed according to their strength, which runs contrary to the voluntary nature of the appointment of the First and Deputy First Ministers. If it is a mandatory system for all the other offices and every other Minister in every other Department; if it is mandatory for the Committee Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen; if it is mandatory for Committee membership and almost everything that the Assembly does, why is it suddenly turned on its head for the appointment of the First and Deputy First Ministers? If it is a mandatory system it should be mandatory throughout. If it is a voluntary system&#151;and I would encourage such a system&#151;it should be voluntary throughout. Regrettably, however, the hon. Gentleman would deny us the opportunity to have a voluntary coalition. Government could be up and running tomorrow if he were willing to move in that direction.

On the specific provisions in the comprehensive agreement, if the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist party did not vote to show their confidence in Sinn Fein and the DUP members as First and Deputy First Ministers, we would be excluded from office. By contrast, under the Belfast agreement members of the DUP rightly took up ministerial office even while voting against the First and Deputy First Ministers. Sinn Fein members could take up ministerial office while abstaining from the vote on the First and Deputy First Ministers. When those two parties have a chance, however, they change the deal and they deny inclusion on the same basis for anyone else. They have concocted what would be a voluntary coalition between Sinn Fein and the DUP, which would be the only parties in government, because they would vote for themselves.

 Let me make the position clear. When members of my party decided to take up seats in the Executive and operate in silos, as they were entitled to do under the legislation, the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party said that we should not be allowed to behave as rogue Ministers&#151;effectively, Ministers in opposition. We proved that we could do so. If we want to make genuine progress in Northern Ireland, we need joined-up government and collective responsibility. To achieve that there must be a level of trust that does not exist at present. The fact that it does not exist is a reality, and the hon. Gentleman knows that the trust necessary to run the Government in Northern Ireland is not there.

<p>
<a name="60313-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_261">I cannot understand why the hon. Gentleman refuses to accept the reality and, together with us, tell the Government to consider a lower level of devolution. We should achieve the highest level possible under prevailing circumstances so that important decisions can be taken in Northern Ireland, progress can be made and trust built. I should have thought that that was in the interests of the whole community in Northern Ireland. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s approach is one of all or nothing&#151;I think I offended him at the weekend by referring to it as the SDLP&#039;s scorched-earth policy&#151;in which Executive devolution must up and running, with Sinn Fein in harness, otherwise there will be nothing in return. The reality for the people of Northern Ireland, however, is that no one is pressing my party to go into government with people who are still involved in criminality, as the IMC has indicated is the case with Sinn Fein.

<a name="60313-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_262">Leaving aside the general tenor of issues relating to policing and justice, some Members have told the Minister of State that it is essential that he deals with the issue of the triple lock in the comprehensive agreement. My party does not intend to divide the House this evening, although there are issues that we want to examine in Committee. If they are not dealt with satisfactorily, we have the option of voting against the Bill on Third Reading. It would be unfortunate, given that this is an important piece of legislation, if the Minister could not carry the main parties with him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_263">I will touch on some of the issues relating to other provisions in the Bill. First, there is the power that the Secretary of State has given himself to bring forward the date of the next Assembly election. I have some experience in that area because I ended up taking a previous Secretary of State to court over the issue. The case went right through to the House of Lords, where, on the narrowest vote possible&#151;by three to two&#151;a decision was made in the Secretary of State&#039;s favour. On reflection, I am probably glad that that was the result and the Secretary of State is probably unhappy that it was, although at the time we both felt very differently about it. The reality is that if the election had been held at that point, we would not have reached the level that we were then at and the outcome might have been different. However, that is all academic because our level of support has increased even from the last election, so the Secretary of State will not get the opportunity to play that one again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_264">Indeed, it is probably because our level of support has increased since the last election that it is unlikely that the Secretary of State will ever use the provision that he has given himself in the Bill to call an early election. However, if he wants to, my party will be more than happy to get on to the hustings and show that the community still supports our position. It is right that he has the provision. I can envisage circumstances in which it might be better to have an election now and then move on to whatever might be agreed over the months after it has taken place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_265">The provision is useful but, by and large, the problem with this Government has not been to do with calling elections early, but with putting elections off. On every previous occasion, the Government have come to the House, or taken the power themselves, to call off elections so that the people do not have the opportunity to express their views democratically. For a Minister to come to the House and say, &quot;We want to take the power to give the people of Northern Ireland the opportunity to speak&quot; is something that I would encourage. I hope that, at some stage, he uses it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_266">I also want to touch on the extension of the decommissioning period in the Bill. I do not think that there has been too much discussion about it, but the realities are as follows. The Loyalist Volunteer Force started the process by decommissioning a very small number of fairly old and not very usable weapons. That was followed by a gesture. Nobody knows the extent of that gesture accurately, although I do know that, after three such gestures by the IRA, one well-known official&#151;who I will not name because I do not like naming officials in the House&#151;indicated that they would be embarrassed to have published the amount of weaponry that had been decommissioned in those three tranches. Indeed, the process that was then under way, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>whereby the IRA was allowed to have its representatives in Government even while it still held on to its weapons, allowed it to use its weapons to buy concessions.

<a name="stpa_267">When my party became the largest party in Northern Ireland and spoke on behalf of the Unionist community, one of the first things that it said was, &quot;We can&#039;t allow the IRA to continue to have that control. The situation has to be reversed so that it does not get into government until it gives up its weaponry.&quot; The substantial amount of weaponry that was decommissioned came about because people were prepared to dig in their heels and say, &quot;To get into this club, you have to pay your membership. You don&#039;t become a member and then consider how much you&#039;re going to pay.&quot;

<a name="stpa_268">My right hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim (Rev.

The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, led by General John de Chastelain, was unequivocal and said that all the weapons had been decommissioned. The IRA said the same and the Government immediately said the same, too. However, it later transpired that intelligence was available on the matter. The Independent Monitoring Commission reported in its eighth report that it had intelligence that indicated that a significant number and variety of weapons&#151;not just handguns&#151;were still in the possession of the Provisional IRA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_269">The IICD was rushed out to respond and take away the sting from that remark. It said, &quot;Oh well, yes, we have seen that intelligence and as a result of that we have started to investigate.&quot; It made the mistake of telling us how it investigated the matter. First, it went to the Garda Siochana, who said, &quot;In our jurisdiction, we have no evidence of that.&quot; Obviously, because the Police Service of Northern Ireland and MI5 were providing the intelligence, it was clear that it was coming not from the Garda Siochana&#039;s jurisdiction, but from the United Kingdom&#039;s jurisdiction. Having received that reply from the Garda Siochana, a further call was made by the IICD. It went to the IRA and&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;guess what the IRA had to say? It said that it had handed over all its weapons and was shocked and irate that anybody would suggest otherwise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_270">Is it not amazing that the whole basis on which the IICD was able to tell hon. Members and the world at large that all the weapons had been handed over and destroyed was intelligence from the Police Service of Northern Ireland and MI5? They supplied the IICD with the statistics of the weaponry that they believed that the IRA had, which was based on the information that they got from Colonel Gaddafi, when he became our great friend, and informers within the organisation. They believed that they could give an accurate account of the IRA&#039;s weaponry in every category. The IICD was prepared to accept that their intelligence was sound, that they were the people to listen to and that, on the basis of what they had provided, all decommissioning had taken place. However, when those self-same people came back and said, &quot;Hold on a minute; they&#039;ve still got guns,&quot; the IICD did not want to believe them.

<p>
<a name="60313-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_271">Anyone in Northern Ireland who thinks about that for a moment will realise that it is more than likely that the IRA still has weapons. Most people will think that no one should ever have said with the clarity and

<br>&nbsp;<br>certainty of the Government and the IICD that all the weapons had been decommissioned. From the very beginning, everyone in this party believed that weapons were still held out there. We have been vindicated, and it is still the responsibility of the Government and, for that matter, the IICD to pursue the remaining weapons in the IRA&#039;s arsenal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_272">Of course, the IRA will not admit it, but am I not right in saying that weapons were discovered at a farmhouse&#151;I will go no further than that&#151;in recent days? Is it not true that another search was carried out in the Irish Republic and a weapon was found? Where are those weapons coming from if all the weapons of the Provisional IRA have been decommissioned? It is vital that we continue to press for the full decommissioning of all paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland.

I have misgivings about introducing important constitutional measures by way of amendment to a miscellaneous provisions Bill. It does not say too much for Northern Ireland that the way in    which it is to be governed is dealt with by a miscellaneous provisions Bill. It would be more proper if separate, custom-made legislation was brought forward for such measures, rather than bringing them in by way of amendment. I urge the Minister to ensure that priority is given to the provisions for an Assembly, rather than provisions on what might happen when an Assembly is under way and running in Northern Ireland.

I am bitter and jaundiced, particularly towards loyalist paramilitaries. I say that because it was those with paramilitary connections who murdered a young constituent of mine, Lisa Dorrian, over a year ago. On 20 February 2005, she disappeared from a caravan site and she has been disappeared ever since. It is a horrible term to use, but it is accurate.

It is not internal housekeeping. It is someone&#039;s husband, son or brother. It is contemptible. I say that as criticism of the extension of the amnesty period to 2010. I hope that the Minister will have a quiet word with the Secretary of State some time after the debate and remind the Secretary of State of what he said not that long ago.

<a name="60313-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_278">On Wednesday 21 September 2005, the Secretary of State&#151;I do not blame the Minister&#151;said:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;The choice for loyalist paramilitaries is clear: play the political role that you claim as your motive, or face the rigour of the law as the mafia organisations into which you seem to have degenerated.

<a name="stpa_279">Those words were welcome across Northern Ireland. People believed that the Secretary of State meant them. If, as the Government repeatedly tell us, and as the hon. Member for Belfast, East and others have mentioned, referring to the report of de Chastelain&#039;s Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, the republican movement has completed such a significant act of decommissioning&#151;I happen to believe it has and I respect the integrity of the Rev. Harold Good, and of Andrew Sens and his colleagues on commission&#151;if that is accurate, we are looking at the decommissioning of loyalist weaponry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_280">Why in heaven&#039;s name have the Government offered an extension? In light of the Secretary of State&#039;s words about loyalists facing the rigour of the law, why are we contemplating an extension of the amnesty period to 2010? As my father would say&#151;metaphorically speaking, of course&#151;&quot;You should keep their feet to the   fire.&quot; The pressure should remain on loyalist paramilitaries.

<p>
<a name="60313-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_281">Another interesting aspect of this miscellaneous Bill that the Secretary of State did not even mention is the reference to the change in the status of the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to bring that office into line with chief constables throughout the rest of the United Kingdom. For whatever reason, there has been an anomaly for years. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1231</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, if a breach of health and safety legislation occurs, all chief constables, except the Chief Constable of what was the Royal Ulster Constabulary and is now the PSNI, are treated as a corporation sole. That treatment is not available to the Chief Constable, who is personally liable if a breach of health and safety legislation occurs and who must appear in court, which takes up a lot of valuable time and effort. That situation has forced the most senior police officer in the PSNI to sit for hours in court. Will the Minister explain why it has taken so long to bring the Chief Constable into line with other chief constables throughout the United Kingdom by treating them as a corporation sole?

 When the hon. Lady made that point in a Committee considering another piece of legislation, I made a commitment to introduce this provision. As I said at the time, the situation was the result of an oversight, and I am pleased that she is pleased that we have introduced the provision.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_283">The Bill also covers donations to political parties, which other hon. Members have mentioned. I have a particular interest in that matter, because I sit on the Speaker&#039;s Committee on the Electoral Commission. Far be it from me to disagree with the hon. Members for South Down (Mr. McGrady), for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) and for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), but when the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee recently visited Dublin&#151;it was our first foray overseas, which was interesting&#151;I was particularly struck by the evidence from members of the Garda and of the public, who repeatedly referred to the undermining of the confidence in Sinn Fein of the public in the Republic of Ireland following the Northern bank robbery. The theft of &#163;26.5 million from the Northern bank in Belfast had a significant impact on the public in the Republic of Ireland, in that people suddenly realised that the democratic political process in the Republic of Ireland can be undermined when political parties obtain funding from a variety of sources.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_284">I do not like the private funding of political parties and believe in state funding of political parties. Various hon. Members referred to the intimidation of donors, and intimidation is a criminal offence. In Northern Ireland, there is intimidation and extortion, and windows get broken when someone is told to make a contribution by paramilitaries. When the Chief Constable of the PSNI gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in public session, he pleaded for people to come together and report efforts by paramilitaries to use intimidation to try achieve their ends.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-28_para10">

<br>&nbsp;<br>to six months in prison, for a serving or past member, or member of staff, of the Electoral Commission, to disclose any information about a political donation that is reported to them, right up until 2010. This Government have told everyone that they want to be open, transparent and accountable. Indeed, they introduced the Freedom of Information Act 2000. If a serving or past member of the commission gets a request for information under that Act, will it be a criminal offence for them to disclose it? <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) says that it will. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that when he winds up, if it is to be kept secret for such a long time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_286">One of the wonders of the Bill is that its long title includes provision to amend the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Given that we are discussing the devolution of policing and justice, perhaps one such amendment could try to get rid of the hideous and immoral procedure of 50:50 recruitment to the police service. It was part of the agreement that I voted for in 1998 that there be equality of opportunity irrespective of political opinion or religious belief, yet the Government legislated to legalise religious discrimination in recruitment to the police, thereby standing the agreement on its head. I am sure that right hon. and hon. Members from parties across Northern Ireland will enjoy tabling amendments for discussion in Committee and on Report. The Bill deals with miscellaneous provisions, so let us use it to amend those parts of the legislation that has been passed in recent years that we loathe and detest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_287">This is a red letter day not only because we are discussing primary legislation instead of a wretched Order in Council but, for me, because I am one of those who loathe and detest direct rule. That is not a reflection on those who hold the ministerial posts at the present time. The five direct rule Ministers might be nice individuals in their own right but, since every single one of them is a member of the Labour party, which does not organise or field candidates in Northern Ireland, they are completely unaccountable to the people of Northern Ireland. The sooner that direct rule is ended and devolution restored, the happier I will be. All that the Bill does is to devolve to the Assembly the decisions that it will make. When, not if, we have an Assembly again, although it certainly will not be tomorrow, it will not be next month, and it may not be next year, I should like to think that the 108 Assembly Members&#151;of whom I am not one, as I am a rare breed indeed: one woman with one job&#151;will be mature enough to seize the opportunity. That requires the Unionist Members of the Legislative Assembly to decide whether devolution of policing and justice is appropriate and timely and whether, for example, members of Sinn Fein, who wish to have seats on the Executive, have ended their criminality and severed all ties with paramilitary activity. Until they do, Unionist MLAs will not agree to devolve policing and justice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_288">It is therefore a red letter day for extending what can be devolved to the Assembly. I welcome that, but those in Sinn Fein and the republican movement who want policing and justice to be devolved cannot have their cake and eat it. They must join the real world with the rest of us and put all paramilitary activity and criminality behind them. Then we can face the future together. I want that to happen for the next generation, instead of constantly looking over my shoulder.

<p><a name="st_179"><a name="60313-29_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jeffrey M. Donaldson  (Lagan Valley) (DUP):</b> 
 I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate and to follow the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon). I was interested in her closing remarks because she and I were on different sides of the debate when the matter was discussed in no less a body than the Ulster Unionist Council. When I, sometimes in desperation, tried to persuade the party not to go down the road of sharing power with an organisation and party that engaged in criminality, murder, holding on to illegal weapons and so on, I was sadly in a minority at the time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_289">I therefore welcome the conversion of the Ulster Unionist Council to a new policy position whereby it agrees with the view that the Government of Northern Ireland cannot include, in any circumstances, a political party that is linked to a terrorist organisation, that continues to engage in crime and violence and that has not completed the decommissioning of its weapons. I am glad that there is now Unionist unity on that. I sincerely welcome it because it is essential for democratic parties to stand together on the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_290">I also welcome the hon. Lady&#039;s intention to table an amendment in Committee on 50:50 recruitment to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I feel strongly about that and many of the hon. Lady&#039;s constituents, like mine, will have lost out through that discriminatory recruitment policy. Indeed, one of the hon. Lady&#039;s constituents took a case to the High Court in Belfast to challenge the discriminatory policy.
</p>





<p><a name="st_180"><a name="60313-29_spnew1"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman remembers our debates here predicting not only resentment but injustice directly resulting from a measure that was intended to do away with injustice and unfairness. Does he agree that the lessons of the recent past suggest that our scepticism about the policy was justified?
</p>





<p><a name="st_181"><a name="60313-29_spnew2"><b> Mr. Donaldson: </b> 
 I concur with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments. Many people recognise with hindsight that many of the policies were wrong. That is to be welcomed. However, I remind the hon. Member for North Down that the former Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, now Lord Maginnis, first suggested introducing the 50:50 recruitment policy. I was present at the meeting with the Secretary of State when he made the suggestion, much to the surprise of some of his colleagues on the delegation. I note that Lord Maginnis now opposes the policy and that one of his colleagues, Lord Laird, has presented a Bill in the other place to end such discrimination in Northern Ireland. I wish him well with that measure. We will support any amendment to the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to end that discrimination against Protestants in Northern Ireland.
</p>





<p><a name="st_182"><a name="60313-29_spnew3"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman needs to recall that 50:50 recruitment was proposed in the context of retaining a significant number of serving police officers. Many people might have taken a different view of the number of serving officers who were to be retained in the    PSNI if it were not for the guarantee of 50:50 recruitment of new officers. Does he not also 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>





<p><a name="st_183"><a name="60313-29_spnew4"><b> Mr. Donaldson: </b> 
 When I heard the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell) say earlier that the SDLP stood for stability, democracy and peace, I turned to one of my hon. Friends and asked what the &quot;L&quot; in SDLP stood for. I suspect that it now stands for &quot;lunacy&quot;, because it would have been pure lunacy at the time to pursue a policy that reduced the RUC&#151;now the PSNI&#151;to just a small number of serving officers. The hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) will know that the police commanders in his own constituency are crying out for more resources to cope with the level of crime in Londonderry, where there are more attacks on young people every week than in most other places in Northern Ireland, and where there are still no-go areas&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_184"><a name="60313-29_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 Order. The hon. Gentleman is ranging a little too widely. Could we now get back to debating the specific provisions of the Bill?

<p><a name="st_185"><a name="60313-29_spnew5"><b> Mr. Donaldson: </b> 
 Perhaps I was ranging a little wide of the miscellaneous provisions, Madam Deputy Speaker.
</p>





<p><a name="st_186"><a name="60313-29_spnew6"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, while we all want a police service that represents a cross-section of the population, we disagree with the idea that one sort of discrimination&#151;positive discrimination&#151;can get rid of another?
</p>





<p><a name="st_187"><a name="60313-29_spnew7"><b> Mr. Donaldson: </b> 
 I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. It matters not to my constituents whether a police officer is a Protestant, a Roman Catholic or of any other religious persuasion. What matters to them is that, when they need the police, the police are there for them. That is the key to this issue. Without wishing to stray beyond the boundaries of the debate, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would say to the hon. Member for Foyle that reducing the number of police officers is no substitute for recruiting more police officers, regardless of their religion. I welcome the young Roman Catholics who have joined the PSNI, and I hope that they enjoy serving the whole community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_291">On the question of the date for the Assembly election, I have no difficulty with the Secretary of State taking that power. However, it says a lot about where we have got to in Northern Ireland that Sinn Fein-IRA continue to exercise a veto over political progress. That is wrong. Part of the reason behind that, as the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) said earlier, is that the SDLP in particular has given Sinn Fein that veto because it will not countenance any form of devolution that falls short of full Executive power sharing that includes Sinn Fein. That is highly regrettable and plays against the SDLP&#039;s own interests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_292">The reality is that there is no alternative form of devolution on offer at the moment, even though we have expressed a willingness to consider one. We made it clear in our recent proposals that we are prepared to share power with the SDLP at whatever level it chooses, right up to full Executive level. Our bottom line, however, is that we are not prepared to share power in an Executive

<br>&nbsp;<br>with a party that is linked to a criminal terrorist organisation, and that position will not change. The SDLP needs to understand that. Sadly, if this involves an all-or-nothing approach, the result will have to be nothing, for the SDLP and for my party. We will have no devolution if the only devolution on offer to the people of Northern Ireland includes Sinn Fein-IRA in executive positions while the IRA continues to engage in crime and terrorism. I welcome what the hon. Member for North Down said about the UUP&#039;s position on this matter. The SDLP should reflect on where we are and look again at the proposals we have made, as we are willing to look at its proposals on devolution.

<a name="stpa_293">Like the hon.

I am glad that missing from the miscellaneous provisions Bill are the proposals contained in the draft Education (Northern Ireland) Order 2006. Like the hon. Lady, I would like that important matter to be dealt with by primary legislation, but I would rather not have it dealt with by the House at all in its current form, because it will fundamentally undermine our education system in Northern Ireland.

Indeed, there have been recent announcements by the Secretary of State and his colleagues on matters such as education and a massive investment in the infrastructure of education. I hope that he, while on the one hand improving the infrastructure of education, does not, on the other, fundamentally undermine the education system through the education reform order, which I think will do serious damage.
</p>

<a name="60313-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_296">I want briefly to discuss the primacy of the security services in intelligence in Northern Ireland. In an intervention, I asked the Secretary of State whether he shared my concern. In principle, I see the argument in favour of integrating Northern Ireland in the overall United Kingdom intelligence system and we recognise that the threat to this country from international terrorism is as much relevant in Northern Ireland as it is elsewhere in the UK. Indeed, there is evidence that the IRA and other terrorist groups in Northern Ireland have colluded and co-operated with other international terrorist groups, and one cannot rule out the possibility of that happening in future. Nevertheless, I have concerns.

We will also watch out for what the Government do. I hope that, if they are to legislate for further changes to the Northern Ireland Act 1998, they do so by way of proper, separate legislation, rather than through an amendment to this Bill, which would be constitutionally inappropriate.

 We have had a wide-ranging debate. Indeed, the views expressed have ranged from that of the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson), who believed that the Bill was long overdue, to that of the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan), who believed that it was a dog&#039;s dinner.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_300">I want to discuss two issues. The first is the devolution of policing. There have been long discussions about that&#151;about the reasons behind it, and about whether it is realistic. We know the attitude of representatives of Sinn Fein. The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Conor Murphy) and the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams), neither of whom presents himself in the House, have defended criminality along the border, and have howled because the police and the Garda had the temerity to raid farmhouses and seize lorries that had been used to launder fuel. Regardless of whether terrorism is taking place, we must ask whether people with such attitudes to police activity against organised crime are fit to be Ministers responsible for justice or policing, or indeed members of the Policing Board or of local district policing partnerships.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_302">The Minister spelt out a couple of the implications of devolution of policing. The first related to security and intelligence. If policing were devolved, it would be inappropriate for national intelligence to be discussed, and for a Minister at devolved level&#151;especially one who might well have the contacts that Sinn Fein has&#151;to have any access to national intelligence that had been gathered. I think that we should divorce the function of national intelligence-gathering from policing in Northern Ireland.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1237</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_303">Safeguards are needed, though, because of the contacts and links between terrorism and criminality. That issue has been raised time and again. Some of the intelligence gathered on terrorism may well relate to criminal activities. There must be protocols. The police in Northern Ireland must be sure that information will be passed to them indicating that such and such a terrorist, or terrorist group, is involved in criminal activity, so that they can act on that information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_304">There is also the issue of the ability to gather intelligence. As my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) pointed out, it is not just a case of having the resources; it is a case of having the expertise. A large influx of people into Northern Ireland to gather intelligence might well stick out like a sore thumb. It is therefore important for the police to have an input, and I understand that that will happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_305">We heard about the implications of the police finance and the policing precept. I have huge worries about that. It is estimated that within the next two years the Northern Ireland police budget will be in deficit by &#163;70 million, because of the freezing of the amount available. We have also heard of the threat from the Northern Ireland Office that the current number of police officers will be guaranteed only until 2010, after which, if we go down the Patten road, we shall see the end of funding for about 3,200 officers. If the policing precept is seen as a way of filling the gap, that would constitute unjustifiable taxation on the people of Northern Ireland, on top of the various other additional taxes being envisaged, such as water rates, the increase in the regional rate and the handing down of services to local councils that lack finance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_306">The hon. Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell) said that co-operation on energy is one form of co-operation to which no one can attribute political connotations&#151;that it is just a question of practical common sense. My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East has made it clear that where co-operation benefits people in Northern Ireland&#151;as did the recent security co-operation that led to raids in south Armagh&#151;we support it. If the clause on energy and an all-Ireland energy market is going to ensure security of supply, cheaper supply, a better network and a better market, we have no difficulty with that at all. People in Northern Ireland pay more for electricity than they ought to. It is estimated that since privatisation, each household has paid about &#163;1,200 more for its electricity than it would have paid on tariffs applying to the rest of the United Kingdom. So an all-Ireland energy market could well achieve economies of scale, but we need certain safeguards and assurances from the Minister.

<a name="60313-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_307">The supply chain in the Irish Republic&#151;the Energy Supply Board&#151;does not have a good record in delivering power. In Northern Ireland, 76 minutes of supply are lost per household per year; in the Irish Republic, 162 minutes are lost. That is because of a problem with the network, and like much in the Celtic tiger, outside the greater Dublin area one finds serious inefficiencies and defects. We have to be sure that funding for the all-Ireland energy market will not be used to address the ESB&#039;s inefficiencies, especially in border areas, and that that is not the implication of the all-Ireland electricity market.

 The Bill will extend the investigatory powers provided for in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 to Northern Ireland. Actions that aid the work of the Assets Recovery Agency in the Province will certainly be welcomed across the community. People were heartened to hear of the raid last week&#151;in which the ARA and its counterpart in the Irish Republic, the Criminal Assets Bureau, were involved&#151;on a farm, which straddles the border, belonging to a recent IRA chief of staff, Thomas &quot;Slab&quot; Murphy. According to reports in the press, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East said, hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash and cheques were discovered in a hay shed, as well as laptops and hundreds of files and documents. Law-abiding citizens in the United Kingdom, especially in Northern Ireland, could not understand why those so openly flaunting their lawlessness, from both sides of the divided community, appeared for so long to be the untouchables. They seemed to be treated with kid gloves. Moves against Murphy and the criminal godfathers can only rebuild confidence in the political process and the primacy of law and order.

<a name="stpa_311">The hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) talked about what is not in the Bill, and he raised one or two important issues. If I may, I suggest that you and your colleagues, Madam Deputy Speaker, have been correct to allow the debate to stray slightly wider to talk about

<a name="stpa_312">The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), with whom I have shared proceedings on so many statutory instruments, asked why the Bill will create so many more statutory instruments. The hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) said how good it was to be debating primary legislation, and that is true, but the downside is that it will lead to many more Orders. The Government say that they are intent on getting the Assembly up and running soon, but it is rather contradictory to introduce so many important matters through statutory instrument.

<p>
<a name="60313-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_313">The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire also talked about recording people for electoral purposes and he    made a sensible suggestion. There could be an opportunity to send out forms to households, even though it is individuals who are registered, to check that the details were correct. I understand why the system is being changed, and that in Northern Ireland people have to record much more information. However, I discussed the issue in Northern Ireland last week and it appears that people could still slip through the net. The hon. Gentleman made a sensible proposal and perhaps we will discuss it in Committee.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his words about my observations. Does he recall how often Ministers in proceedings on statutory instruments and Orders in Council accept that they are not a satisfactory way to make progress but say that there are so many only because the Stormont Assembly is not operational? Does he see the political contradiction in agreeing that statutory instruments are not the best way to do things but introducing a Bill that will necessarily increase their number?
</p>





<p><a name="st_196"><a name="60313-31_spnew1"><b> Mr. Robertson: </b> 
 Yes, I find it rather odd, which is all I need to say on that point. It does seem to be contradictory. The hon. Member for South Down (Mr.   McGrady) spoke about the difficulty of fund-raising for political purposes in Northern Ireland, which was agreed by most Members who spoke.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_314">My hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) expressed concern about the Secretary of State having power to set the election date. He was also concerned about devolving police powers while not all parties support the police. That point was also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury. It is not just a matter of joining police boards; it is about hearts and minds and providing evidence to the police when crimes have taken place. That has not been the case; we are far from that position and it is a concern.
</p>

<a name="60313-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_315">The right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley), in a typically passionate speech, talked about people connected to terrorism not being allowed to sit on police boards or in government. He said that it is odd to be debating things that will not come about. In other words, we will need the Assembly to be up and running before the devolution of policing. It seems an odd situation for us to be in.

He was very clear that people have to make up their minds. They have to become democratic politicians and give up terrorism for good. He sounded an optimistic note, but I am not sure that it was entirely shared by the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_317">The hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds) made a reasonable and wide-ranging speech. He endorsed calls for all parties to support the police and called for people to give up private armies. He questioned the need for them. He also raised an interesting point regarding donations. He said that whether donations coming from the Republic are legal will depend on Irish law, not our own. That seems to be a strange situation, especially when, as I understand it, money could come from America if it comes through the right channels. I do not think that is in the spirit of the laws that have been passed by this Parliament. There is a legal issue there, and possibly a constitutional one, and it needs to be discussed.

<a name="60313-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_318">The hon. Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell) welcomed moved towards a bigger energy market and said that he would welcome a British Isles market. He called for an increase in the use of renewable energy. There is a point about the energy market. As I understand it, there will not be one regulator for north and south, but there will still be one regulator in the north and one in the south who will attempt to harmonise regulation. We are not moving towards the full position that we have in Great Britain, where we had new electricity trading arrangements that have since changed to BETTA&#151;the British electricity trading and transition arrangements&#151;and there is an internal competitive market that supplies electricity. We are not moving towards such an arrangement because of the need for transparency in Northern Ireland and because the market, even with the south, will not be big enough. It would be advantageous for people in Northern Ireland and southern Ireland if we had that bigger market and a better trading arrangement. We would then see prices fall, just as they fell in Great Britain when that system was introduced here by the Government. This is a complicated area, and I hope that I have expressed my view on it reasonably clearly.

<p>
<a name="60313-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_319">My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) stressed the need to remove violence as an option. He spoke about how some people are talking about it as no longer being a first option, but a final option. That cannot be right either. That is equally wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_320">My hon. Friend also discussed the need to extend the arms amnesty, which the Government say is necessary to take into account paramilitary weapons on the loyalist side. However, we can equally say that there is a need for the amnesty to include the remaining weapons on the republican side; many Members expressed the view that the republican movement has not yet got rid of all its arms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_321">The hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson), in a long but entertaining speech, covered many issues. One of the most interesting was whether it would be possible to get the devolution of policing through when there was a 40 per cent. Unionist vote in the Assembly. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.

<a name="stpa_322">The hon. Gentleman bravely questioned the basis for the agreement in relation to cross-community support. Obviously, the whole agreement is about bringing people from the different communities together, yet that is one of the things that is holding up the process. When the issue of South Africa was raised, the hon. Member for Belfast, North said that it was not relevant, yet in a sense it is, because for South Africa to move on, people had to stop talking about their particular national identity. Rwanda moved on when people stopped saying that they were members of a particular tribe.

Friend the Member for Aylesbury, I condemn violence from whichever side it comes. It must end; there is no reason or excuse for it.

He, too, spoke against 50:50 recruitment.

<a name="stpa_325">I am concerned about the falling number of police reservists, and about the fact that it seems that they will be replaced by community support officers.

<a name="stpa_326">The hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) spoke of the need for safeguards in respect of information gathering when the role of MI5 in Northern Ireland changes. He made the important point that MI5 must be sure to pass on to the police information that the police would regard as helpful. There were reports in the Northern Ireland press recently about one serious occasion when that had not occurred. I do not want to explore that point at this stage, but the issue is real.

<a name="stpa_327">The hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea) suffered, as I have suffered many times in the House, by speaking right at the end of a long debate.

<a name="stpa_328">As my hon.

We want to consider whether the electoral office changes could be slightly better made. Police and justice devolution is a big issue and we also want to discuss the funding of political parties. I want to explore whether more could be done to help to reduce the cost of energy in Northern Ireland and whether renewable energy can be brought in more quickly, because it is being adopted extremely slowly throughout Great Britain.

We want devolution of policing and criminal justice to take place at a point in the future when it is appropriate. The proposed arrangements must be robust, must be workable and must continue to deliver an effective, impartial and independent justice system.

I condemn the use of those weapons and I hope that we will not need to invoke the procedure in the Bill&#151;I hope that action will be taken much earlier&#151;but while those weapons remain we need to      make provision to allow further time for decommissioning.

 With this it will be convenient to discuss Lords amendment No. 22, the Government motion to insist on disagreements thereto and amendment (a) in lieu.
</p>





<p><a name="st_218"><a name="60313-33_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Amendment (a) is largely technical and clarifies clause 5 by adding the words &quot;or be accompanied by&quot; after the requirement for an application for a designated document to include an application to be entered on the register. This is the second time in four weeks that these amendments have returned to the House for consideration, so I hope that I do not need to spend long making the case to reject them yet again. The issue has already been debated, voted on and approved twice by the House. A similar amendment was defeated on Report on 18 October last year by a majority of 32. In our consideration of Lords amendments on 13 February, it was rejected by a majority of 31.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_354">We have always made it clear that the identity cards scheme has been designed as a compulsory scheme for all United Kingdom residents and is eventually intended to become such a scheme. In the second phase of the scheme, it will be a requirement to register and there will be a civil financial penalty regime to tackle failure to do so. We have made it clear, too, that linking identity cards to designated documents is a central part of the first phase of the scheme, allowing a sensible phased introduction of identity cards. Once passports and residents&#039; permits are designated, as British nationals resident in the United Kingdom renew or apply for passports, and as foreign nationals renew or apply for residents&#039; permits, those individuals will be entered on the national identity register and issued with ID cards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_355">Each designation order under clause 4 will need to be approved by both Houses of Parliament under the affirmative resolution procedure. The amendments proposed by the other place would make registration and an identity card optional extras for anyone applying for a designated document. Last week, we began to phase in the issue of e-passports incorporating a facial image biometric&#151;the first generation biometric passport. Once we move to the next phase&#151;biometric passports including a facial image and fingerprint biometrics&#151;anyone applying for a passport must go through exactly the same application process as they would for an identity card, and their personal details and biometrics will be recorded on a central passport database. The data is being collected in any case when

<br>&nbsp;<br>people renew their passport. Merging the two processes will add the statutory safeguards provided by the Bill, such as the creation of a national identity scheme commissioner, to the passport data. The Bill will therefore provide more safeguards for people who renew their passports, but the Lords amendment would remove those safeguards.

 I would be grateful if my right hon. Friend clarified an issue relating to the renewal of passports. The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) said that there is an element of choice, however small, about whether to have a passport. He said, too, that all passport holders can choose when they renew their passport and can do so at any time. The UK Passport Service website, however, suggests that it is only possible to do so if a passport is full, has expired, or will do so in the next nine months. Which statement is correct? If the website is at fault, can it be corrected?

<p><a name="st_220"><a name="60313-34_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me the chance to clarify that point. My understanding is that an individual can renew their passport at any time. If there is an error on the UK Passport Service website, I will deal with that immediately.
</p>





<p><a name="st_221"><a name="60313-34_spnew1"><b> Simon Hughes  (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b> 
 The Home Secretary will know that many people have no objection to the idea of signing up to an international agreement to have a new form of passport with the necessary biometric and other details. However, is the implication of the Government&#039;s insistence on the linkage that there will be a new precondition for any British citizen who wants to have a British passport, namely, that they will also have to accept an identity card? Does that not change the basis on which we were entitled to passports in the past? They were always in theory discretionary, but given to people if there was no very good reason for not doing so.
</p>





<p><a name="st_222"><a name="60313-34_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is correct. What we are saying is very clear and in accordance with the Labour party&#039;s election manifesto, which stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;We will introduce ID cards, including biometric data like fingerprints, backed up by a national register and rolling out initially on a voluntary basis as people renew their passports.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_356">Passports are voluntary documents&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> Well, of course they are. No one is forced to renew a passport if they choose not to do so. That will remain the case once we begin issuing identity cards alongside passports. Election manifestos cannot possibly deal with every detail of an existing policy, but it is clear to me that, in saying very explicitly that the roll-out would initially be on a voluntary basis, the manifesto refers to what has always been the Government&#039;s position, as Members on both sides of the House who have considered the matter carefully should acknowledge. That position is that the scheme will initially be based on a stand-alone identity card, issued on its own on a voluntary basis, or together with a document such as a passport, which is also issued on a voluntary basis. That seems to be clear and unequivocal.

<a name="60313-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_358">The structure that I have described indicates that there are four common sense reasons for rejecting the amendments from the other place: costs, benefits, convenience and security. First, on costs, we want the identity card scheme to provide the greatest benefits at the lowest cost to the taxpayer. The Lords amendments would increase the cost of establishing the scheme because of the greater complexity of handling an optional service that would mean that some people could opt out of having an identity card when obtaining a passport. Moreover, uncertainty would affect the unit cost and thus the fee level for identity cards. That is a serious point. Cost is a factor that has been raised across the House and the Lords amendments make the issue more, rather than less, difficult to resolve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_359">Secondly, there would be an impact on the benefits of the identity card scheme. Reducing the speed of the roll-out of ID cards would slow down the wider benefits such as combating illegal immigration or improving the effectiveness of public services. Thirdly, there would be inconvenience to the public if the Lords amendments were passed. It does not make sense to issue a biometric passport without the accompanying identity card. The process of enrolling biometrics and checking identity for both documents will be virtually identical. The same data will be held in both cases. Fourthly, there is the question of security. We would directly be offering an open goal to fraudsters, criminals and immigration offenders if we said that they could simply choose to avoid being included in the national identity register when they applied for a passport or an immigration document.

We are discussing the relationship between the citizen and the state, and whether it is right for the Government to change that relationship fundamentally by requiring the citizen to do what the state says he must do for its convenience, rather than his. This part of the Bill and the debate that we are having fully describes the difference between, on the one hand, me, my party and our supporters tonight and the Members of the other place whose amendments we are seeking to sustain and, on the other, the Government.

He will not even take questions properly to try to advise us about why he finds the royal prerogative the right means for directing the new Labour concept that each one of us should be numbered, identified and subservient to the state.

We have a right to have it and no Home Secretary should deny it to us unless there is a genuine reason of state for his doing that.

It has digitised facial images of the holder stored on a microchip on the card, so there is no requirement for a central database. Fingerprints will be added at the appropriate time by February 2008. The passport also complies with the United States visa waiver programme requirements. So the argument that we need a compulsory identity card, let alone a central biometric register, is plainly wrong.

<p>
<a name="60313-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_391">We could have done as the Swedish Government have done, and introduced a basic biometric passport with the inclusion of fingerprints at the appropriate time by February 2008 or, in line with the Labour manifesto pledge, introduced a genuinely voluntary biometric ID card in conjunction with the new passport. The Home Secretary suggested earlier that the collection of the necessary information would have been one and the same in either case. This could all have been done on a similar basis to the Swedish model, with the biometric information held on the card rather than on a central database, with all the costs and dangers implicit in that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_392">There is no obligation under any international treaty or domestic manifesto pledge to issue a compulsory biometric ID card. There is absolutely no requirement to roll out from day one what is effectively a compulsory ID card through the issuing of a passport under the false insistence, or disguise, that it is voluntary, and then to do so compulsorily for any number of spurious reasons in future&#151;not least the fraudulent pretext that &#163;1.7 billion will be saved, mainly in the private sector.

<p><a name="st_251"><a name="60313-37_spnew3"><b> Mark Fisher  (Stoke-on-Trent, Central) (Lab):</b> 
 There is a perfectly logical case for compulsory identity cards. If one believes, as the Home Secretary does, that they really will deliver something very important in the fight against terrorism, fraud or impersonation, of course we should have a universal card, and a universal card is only possible if it is compulsory. However, that is not what our manifesto says. It says that there should be a voluntary scheme, and that there will not be a universal scheme for many years. At present, there are no overt Government plans for such a scheme, and it will be rolled out very slowly. Therefore, the benefits that can only really accrue from an ID card scheme will not happen until it is a wholly universal scheme. The whole enterprise is deeply, logically flawed.

<a name="60313-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_406">The Home Secretary has got himself into an appalling semantic tangle. If he is trying to persuade not only this House but the public that the word &quot;must&quot; means &quot;voluntary&quot; and that the opposite is the case, and that what he is suggesting is not what the Lords are suggesting, then he has got himself&#151;as I have in this sentence&#151;into a terrible logical tangle. If we believe in a voluntary scheme, as the Home Secretary and the manifesto say that we do, there is no way that we can reject the Lords amendments. The Lords make it very clear that the scheme is voluntary, not compulsory. By rejecting the amendments, the Government will be opting for compulsion. They should have the courage of their convictions and say that this will be a compulsory universal scheme, but the Home Secretary will not do that. If he is going to nail his flag to the mast of a voluntary scheme, the Lords amendment must be supported.

<p><a name="st_254"><a name="60313-37_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 With the leave of the House, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I should like to respond to this debate. I had not intended doing so, but the use of the word &quot;deceit&quot; by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) provokes me to do so directly. Let me be very clear about the process. The first consultation document that this Government issued on an identity card scheme, in 2002, canvassed the option of a universal scheme linked to passports. When we announced the decision, in principle, in November 2003 to introduce ID cards, it was made clear then that there would be a two-stage scheme. It was stated that the second stage would be compulsory&#151;that it would apply to every UK resident&#151;with a civil financial penalty for failing to register and to obtain an ID card when required.

<p>
<a name="60313-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_407">It was also made clear in November 2003 that during the initial stage, as well as introducing a voluntary plain ID card for those who do not have a passport, the intention was to link the issue of ID cards to that of more secure passports. That is why we stated the following in Cmd 6020, in November 2003:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;By linking the card scheme to widely held identity documents most people will get a card conveniently and automatically as they renew an existing document&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_408">That announcement in principle was put into effect when the Government published the draft Identity Cards Bill in April 2004, with a provision in clause 5(2) requiring an applicant for any designated document to register and to be issued with an ID card alongside the designated document. We were again very clear that in the first stage of the ID card scheme there should be no possibility of obtaining a designated document such as a passport without an ID card. The provision requiring applicants for passports or other designated documents to obtain an ID card was also included in the first Identity Cards Bill, introduced before the election, which was passed by the House of Commons in February 2005 and given a Second Reading in the Lords in March 2005.

<p><a name="st_255"><a name="60313-37_spnew6"><b> Mr. Garnier: </b> 
 Will the Home Secretary give way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_256"><a name="60313-37_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 No, I shall not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_409">After the election, the Bill was reintroduced and, yet again, we made it absolutely clear that once a document such as a passport has been designated, obtaining one would also mean being issued with an ID card. Nobody can claim, as the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey claimed, that our policy has not been entirely consistent on this point from 2002 right the way through. Moreover, no one can claim that in the many debates, in this House and in the other place, there has not been the fullest opportunity to debate these issues fully at every turn.

 Even if one accepts the history of the Home Secretary&#039;s argument, what does he mean by &quot;on a voluntary basis&quot;? What does that mean, in English?

 I have set that out clearly in what I have said, but I shall say it again if the hon. and learned Gentleman wants me to do so. The question, as the hon.

That is the free will that people may exercise in deciding whether or not they wish to have a passport&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is the free will over what they can do and how they can operate.

<p><a name="st_271"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Mr. Campbell]</i></p>



<a name="time_28">
<a name="60313-39_time4"><h5>11.18 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_272"><a name="60313-39_spnew7"><b> Mr. Nicholas Brown  (Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend) (Lab):</b> 
 Truly it is said that no good deed goes unpunished. A year ago, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Budget statement that there would be free bus travel for pensioners. The announcement was widely welcomed and the Treasury allocated some &#163;350 million&#151;a sum of money that covers the cost of the policy. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister chose to distribute that money in such a way that some authorities got more than they needed to implement the policy and 32 authorities were short-changed. In cash terms, by far the greatest losers are the five district councils in Tyne and Wear, with a shortfall of &#163;5.4 million. The problem arises because Ministers chose to use a general formula to distribute a grant that was designed for a specific purpose. There are two related issues that I would like to raise&#151;pensioner travel on the Tyne and Wear metro and pensioner bus travel between Tyne and Wear and the neighbouring counties of Durham and Northumberland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_427">As soon as the problem became clear, strenuous efforts were made to achieve a solution. There have been discussions between officials from Nexus, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Transport. There have been two meetings between the Minister for Local Government and local Members of Parliament, and there has been some progress. A small adjustment has already been made to the distribution formula in Tyne and Wear&#039;s favour. Separately, the Secretary of State for Transport has given Nexus &#163;1.7 million to deal with the potential loss of income for the metro, which Nexus owns, if pensioner bus travel is free but metro travel is not. I wish to place on record my gratitude for the part that the Secretary of State for Transport has played in trying to resolve that issue. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] My hon. Friends are obviously grateful as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_428">Two problems remain. Despite the free pensioner bus travel within counties it is now more expensive for pensioners to travel from Durham to Sunderland or Newcastle. The half-fare scheme covered the cost of the whole journey, but free travel only takes them to the county boundary. After that, they must pay the full fare for travel. Far worse&#151;and this is at the heart of the issues that I wish to raise tonight&#151;Nexus faces a &#163;5.4 million shortfall. The authority must set a budget, and it must tell the five district councils what that budget is. There is little room for further delay.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060313/debtext/60313-40.htm"/>




<p><a name="st_273"><a name="60313-40_spnew0"><b> Mr. Fraser Kemp  (Houghton and Washington, East) (Lab):</b> 
 On the shortfall and the way in which Nexus has handled it, does my right hon. Friend agree that while we must try to find a solution in the final few days, it is imperative that we find a fair funding formula so that Tyne and Wear does not face this problem every year? Those reserves cannot be spent again. They have been spent this time, but they will not be available in future. We need to resolve the problem this year, but we must make sure that we do not face it again in future.
</p>





<p><a name="st_274"><a name="60313-40_spnew1"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is quite right. The Nexus budget for the financial year must cover the shortfall; 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1270</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the authority has no choice but to do so. Nexus has set a provisional budget, which is a combination of fare increases and cuts in secure services. As my hon. Friend has suggested, it is drawing down its reserves to cover half the shortfall. It can only do so once, as those reserves will not be available for drawing down again. We need a solution to this year&#039;s problem, and a permanent solution for future years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-40_para0">
<a name="stpa_429">Students who will be hit by the fare rise think that it is unfair. They are right to hold that view, as Nexus did not intend to introduce a fare rise until the budget shortfall became clear. Pensioners and organisations that represent them are upset too, as pensioners do not want their free travel to be paid for by service cuts and fare rises for others. That point has been made clear to me, and I am quite certain that it has been made to my right hon. and hon. Friends who represent the county. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for the part that he has played in trying to find a solution. Talks are continuing, but I fear that they are doing so in the same way that a fairground roundabout continues in motion&#151;it goes round and round, but it is does not go anywhere.

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown) on securing an Adjournment debate on such an important subject. As he intimated, I have taken a great deal of interest in the matter from the beginning. Like him, I have received representations from pensioners in Tyne and Wear who, for the first time in my 20 years&#039; experience as a Member of Parliament, have said to me that they reject something that the Government have offered: free transport. They do not want free transport at the expense of transport for young people and others who currently receive concessions. Additionally, they do not want free transport at the expense of services, which will also be on the cards unless the problem is resolved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-40_para2">
<a name="stpa_431">My right hon. Friend referred to a possible long-term solution and reminded the House that the matter was initially raised by the Chancellor in last year&#039;s Budget. When the Chancellor announced the scheme, it was widely welcomed, not least by those of us in Tyne and Wear who had concessionary fares, but welcomed the idea of free fares for pensioners. However, we did not anticipate such an unintended outcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-40_para3">
<a name="stpa_432">The long-term solution might well lie in next week&#039;s Budget. Even at this late stage, I urge the Minister to talk to the Chancellor and the Treasury about what that Budget might contain. It might well be that the Chancellor can resolve the problem by introducing a national scheme for free transport, rather than a local one. As I understand it, such a scheme would not cost a massive amount. It would be much easier to administer and would certainly resolve our problems in Tyne and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1271</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Wear. It might also resolve the problems that are anticipated in other parts of the country. The existing scheme is restricted to local government boundaries. A national scheme could be introduced at low cost, so I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to raise the matter with the Treasury in the anticipation that next week&#039;s Budget might bring a resolution to the problem.

 I should start by paying the usual tribute to my right hon.

Members in the Chamber. I have a useful opportunity to explain how we support services via the formula grant. My right hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>vital to the success of the Government&#039;s commitment to sustainable mobility and to people&#039;s ability to retain a high quality of life as their income, health and mobility levels change. Despite the rising number of older driving licence holders, declining driving ability and financial constraints mean that many motorists will have to adjust their driving practices, and probably ultimately give up their car. A high proportion of the older population will be dependent on public transport. However, evidence suggests that many will experience difficulties in using bus and rail services.

<a name="60313-40_para7">
<a name="stpa_436">For the first time, in 2006&#150;07, we have announced two-year grant allocations for every local authority in England. We have put a premium on the stability and predictability of funding, so that councils can plan ahead for better service delivery. The first three-year settlement will be introduced alongside the next spending review round commencing in 2008&#150;09. In the interests of further stability, we have made grant floors a permanent part of the grant distribution system. Floors guarantee a minimum year-on-year grant increase for all authorities and increase local authority confidence in planning for the medium to long term.

<a name="60313-40_para8">
<a name="stpa_437">Tyne and Wear, to which my right hon. Friend referred, has benefited from the extra money that we have provided in recent years to the local authorities, which have invested in improving local services&#151;for example, reducing antisocial behaviour and providing more support for vulnerable people in Newcastle, developing healthy communities in Gateshead, and supporting carers in Sunderland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-40_para9">
<a name="stpa_438">For the 10-year period to 2007&#150;08, we have been able to provide Tyne and Wear metropolitan district councils with an average annual increase in general grant of 4 per cent. in cash terms. For 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08, the grant increases going to Tyne and Wear district councils are &#163;14.7 million and &#163;14.8 million respectively, or 2.8 per cent. in each year, running ahead of current inflation. Additional transport funding for Tyne and Wear has also come through the local transport plan and Challenge funding routes. We have provided &#163;12.9 million for concessionary fares above last year&#039;s grant, and &#163;1.7 million for the Metro transport system.

Friend the Secretary of State for Transport to the Tyne and Wear authorities, mostly in the form of supported capital expenditure&#151;revenue&#151;or SCER, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend knows. The allocations are determined primarily by formulas reflecting transport need and adjusted to reflect the quality of the local transport plan and the progress made in implementing the plan. A single allocation is made for Tyne and Wear, which is distributed among the authorities in accordance with their wishes.

However, this high level of central Government capital support releases local authorities&#039; own funding to support other initiatives in accordance with local priorities.

<p><a name="st_280"><a name="60313-41_spnew0"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for explaining the background to us. Does he accept that for the next financial year Nexus faces a shortfall in the funding arrangements of about &#163;5.4 million? If so, can he give the House an assurance that meaningful discussions are going on in Government to try to resolve that problem? If he thinks the discussions are stuck and that we are not getting any further forward, will he say so, so that we can have the meeting with the Prime Minister that we were promised?
</p>





<p><a name="st_281"><a name="60313-41_spnew1"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I assure my right hon. Friend that meaningful discussions are going on. The Government recognise the real difficulties that the transport executive has in balancing its budget. Last summer&#039;s consultation with the Local Government Association and local councils resulted in general agreement that the distribution of money through the formula is the best way in which to pursue the issue. Indeed, representations by my right hon. Friend and others on the formula grant distribution method show that the needs of his authority, and of Tyne and Wear authorities in general, indicate that there is a shortfall in the ability of the formula grant to distribute money. Discussions have taken place and are taking place with the local authorities, the transport authority and the transport executive to try to resolve that problem. The level of pensioner bus usage in my right hon. Friend&#039;s area is very high, which is why we are continuing discussions with the transport authority and local authorities. My difficulty is that we must treat all local authorities fairly, and I know that my right hon. Friend agrees with that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-41_para0">
<a name="stpa_442">Funding on concessionary fares is supported by the formula grant. My right hon. Friend is aware that the Chancellor added an additional &#163;350 million in formula grant in 2006&#150;07 in order to support the move from the statutory half-fare scheme to a free-fare scheme for all pensioners and disabled people. The funding for those new responsibilities has been added to formula grant in line with a commitment to provide authorities with continued flexibility on the use of their resources.

<p><a name="st_282"><a name="60313-41_spnew2"><b> Mr. Alan Beith  (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</b> 
 Surely the Minister knows&#151;the Government have admitted this&#151;that whereas the total sum might be sufficient to cover needs across the country, the distribution between authorities, including Tyne and Wear and, for that matter, Northumberland, which has different but equally difficult problems, does not reflect the particular needs of those areas.
</p>





<p><a name="st_283"><a name="60313-41_spnew3"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman has made an important point. However, it is also true that local government in general and the LGA in particular support the idea of distributing money through formula grant. Devolution, which involves the distribution of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1274</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>money by local authorities, supports the idea that formula grant is the way forward. The alternative is a specific grant to target individual authorities, but the right hon. Gentleman, his party and the LGA would not support that view. We have a situation in which the distribution of money is based on a formula that inevitably results in winners and losers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-41_para1">
<a name="stpa_443">The Government always face difficult decisions in dividing up a fixed pot of money where there will be, as I have said, winners and losers. We have looked to ensure an equitable arrangement in relation to concessionary fares funding, which involves an arrangement that retains local control for spending as requested by local government, rather than separately distributing the money through a specific grant.
</p>





<p><a name="st_284"><a name="60313-41_spnew4"><b> Mr. Stephen Byers  (North Tyneside) (Lab):</b> 
 The Minister will know that local government makes a number of requests and representations to Government, not all of which are agreed. He said that he wants all authorities to be treated fairly. The consequence of his decision is that Tyne and Wear is being treated unfairly. This debate is being held because we, as Members for Tyne and Wear, find that unacceptable. Yes, we want free travel for our pensioners, but we want it to be done in a way that is fair and just, which is not the case at the moment. What will the Minister do to resolve that situation?
</p>





<p><a name="st_285"><a name="60313-41_spnew5"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend, who knows much better than I do about the problems of distributing money through formula grant, makes a valid point. The Government recognise that the amount of money distributed to Tyne and Wear is not adequate to meet the needs of the scheme as proposed or the current demand for pensioner bus travel in his area. We have moved, through consultation, to ensure that &#163;1.7 million has been allocated to Tyne and Wear through the Department for Transport grant for the metro system. We support the idea of a co-ordinated, integrated transport system in Tyne and Wear, as elsewhere. That money has been granted in recognition of the point that my right hon. Friend makes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-41_para2">
<a name="stpa_444">The Government also have to ensure that distribution is fair among all local authorities. That is why the cost of the statutory minimum half-fare scheme was previously supported through the formula grant settlement. However, many local authorities were providing a service above the statutory minimum for their residents&#151;for example, by extending the concessions across the whole county or by enabling their residents to buy a pass to enable them to travel on buses free of charge. Those extensions to the statutory scheme were not taken into account when allocating formula grant. Some areas already offer free travel&#151;Greater London, the west midlands and Merseyside are cases in point. It was right that those areas, too, should benefit from the extra resource so that council tax payers did not bear the burden of an authority&#039;s prior decision to offer what is now Government policy.

<p><a name="st_287"><a name="60313-41_spnew7"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend makes a valid request. The Government&#039;s approach is to examine the budget of Nexus, the transport executive in the region, to see how we can ensure that the transport concessions that are made&#151;for example, for the student scheme, for the schoolchildren&#039;s scheme, and for the existing concessionary scheme&#151;benefit from the allocation of Government money. We have to ensure that that scheme is legal and that it is fair to other authorities that are arguing that they are losing out. I have to say that none of the authorities that is benefiting from the allocation of money have written to me thanking me for it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-41_para3">
<a name="stpa_445">My right hon. Friend makes a serious point. We must ensure that we allocate the money through formula grant in a fair way and recognise the needs of the particular transport authority. That is why we are examining the way in which we can distribute money through the formula grant and other possible interventions. We want to ensure that my right hon. Friend&#039;s scheme for students, which has led to improvements in the stay-on rate for further education when compared with other areas, continues, and that student and school student travel for buses in his area is maintained and improved. How do we ensure that the unintended consequences of formula distribution of grant do not militate against the social benefits of the schemes that are currently in place for his constituents? That is our task, and the reason for genuinely congratulating him on raising the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-41_para4">
<a name="stpa_446">In developing the approach to grant distribution that we have now adopted, we had the benefit of extensive consultation, both in the official level settlement

</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-41_para5">
<a name="stpa_447">The papers that the Association of North East Councils, which was mentioned earlier, brought to the settlement working group attempted to estimate the cost of moving from an authority&#039;s current position to a free-fare scheme. Inevitably, they could only be estimates. As I have explained, we could not base formula grant distribution only on those measurements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60313-41_para6">
<a name="stpa_448">Instead, we suggested that we should re-weight the existing formula, known as the lower tier environmental, protective and cultural services formula to reflect the characteristics of areas where take-up of free bus travel is likely to be higher. Indeed, in the period between the announcement of the concessionary scheme in March and the consultation process in July and through to December, we took on board the points that my right hon. Friend made and the representations of others. That led to a significant increase in the money to Tyne and Wear.
