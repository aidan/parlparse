 At the moment, of course, it is difficult to estimate what the price of a barrel of oil will be next week, let alone in 2020, as the hon. Gentleman seeks to persuade me to do. Obviously, our Department, while not forecasting oil prices, does publish future price assumptions going forward to 2030. We obviously regularly review these and consult on them, but he will appreciate that the huge increase in the price of a barrel of oil has caught the whole world by surprise and we are in, frankly, difficult and uncharted waters.</p>

 The people of Northampton in particular have been caught by surprise by increasing fuel prices.

 My hon. Friend will be aware that oil prices reached $130 a barrel this week. The projection is that by the end of the year they could be $150 a barrel. Given that there is an irrational indexation between oil contracts and gas, so that gas prices are pulled in train behind oil prices, does he agree that it is time to look at how we decouple gas prices from oil prices? There is no rationality for that indexation. All that it does is make huge profits for the energy companies.</p>

 I rather agree with my hon. Friend that the whole issue in the gas industry&#151;gas production and gas fields&#151;is often, although not always, different from that in the oil industry. That linkage is not rational, but as he knows, because he has great expertise in this area, it is global and is not peculiar to the United Kingdom or Europe. However, we need to work hard to understand that linkage and to see whether there are ways of decoupling it. At a time of huge increases in wholesale prices for fossil fuels&#151;coal, of course, as well as oil and gas&#151;irrational linkages do not help us.</p>

I am conscious that there is a time lag in the data because of the methodology required.

 Further to the point raised by the hon.

That is creating the problem for Royal Mail. Since in order to survive businesses rely on Royal Mail&#146;s ability to deliver the last mile, it is essential that they be forced to pay towards maintaining that universal service. Otherwise, it will fall on the public purse to maintain the service so that we can supply mail across the country, and even to areas such as Orkney and Shetland.</p>

 The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has regular discussions with other Government Departments on matters affecting business. The reform of empty property relief follows the recommendations of Kate Barker&#146;s independent review of land use planning and Sir Michael Lyons&#146; independent inquiry into local government. The aim is to promote the supply of commercial property by providing a strong incentive for owners to re-use, re-let or redevelop their properties. This will improve competitiveness for all businesses that rent premises, including, of course, small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

 It surely cannot be right that, as a perverse consequence of business rating, people had no real incentive to let properties, when many small businesses want them.

I would have thought that the approach that we are taking is good for business. If people cannot let because rents are too high, they should lower them.

 We all know that the public will always oppose post office closures. I want to put on record my thanks to Allan Leighton, the chairman of the Post Office, who considered an application to abandon the proposed closure of Micklegate post office in York. That closure had been approved at three levels of appeal by Post Office managers, but Allan Leighton considered the facts, which members of the public and I sent him, and turned down the closure, and I thank him for that.</p>

 In his earlier response, the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas), said how important the pharmaceutical sector was to the UK economy. Does he share my concern that the actions of his colleagues in the Department of Health in renegotiating the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme halfway through its five-year agreement do little to foster a sense of stability in the UK&#146;s pharmaceutical sector and do much to say that the Government do not support the sector as much as they should?</p>

 No, I do not share the hon. Lady&#146;s view. I welcome the fact that the industry is engaging as effectively as it is with the Department of Health.

Added to that, the deputy governor will be leaving next month and as yet no replacement has been announced. During these times of financial and economic uncertainty, it seems astonishing that the Government should be dithering over those key roles.

There was an informal discussion between my right hon.

With regard to the hearings that the right hon.

She can put questions on the diploma scheme to the Secretary of State for children, families and schools, but there is a phased roll-out. It was always going to be a phased roll-out in order to give more choice to pupils in the qualifications that they seek to take.</p>

The CPS has responded to Her Majesty&#146;s Crown Prosecution Service inspectorate&#146;s important report. It is important not only that there is good working between the police, the CPS and the courts but that files are effectively case-managed.

 My hon. Friend makes a very important point, with which I am sure the whole House will agree. It is important for the public that the House of Commons works effectively, and it is important that Members of Parliament work in their constituencies and in Westminster, so they need a home in their constituency and in Westminster and they need to travel between the two. They also need properly staffed offices to deal with the many requests for help and support that we receive from our constituents and to engage with them on public policy. We need to justify the allowances that are available, in the public interest, to Members, and we must ensure that there is public confidence in that.

May I also draw to the attention of the Leader of the House the parlous state of the consultation process on eco-towns that is going on&#151;or rather, not going on&#151;at the moment? In my own constituency, the Government apparently intend to build a town twice the size of Market Harborough in the middle of rural Harborough, yet we have no idea about any of the details of the proposals from the Department for Communities and Local Government or from the developers, namely the Co-operative Wholesale Society and English Partnerships. This will not do. If the Government are going to build a town of 40,000 people in an area of rural England without any infrastructure and with less than 1 per cent. unemployment, I believe they ought to condescend to be rather more candid. May we have a debate on this as soon as we get back?</p>

 I need to return to an issue that I have put to the Leader of the House before. May we have a debate on Somerset county council and the corruption that is going on there? Yesterday, 24 hours ago, the county solicitor, David Corry, met the resources director, Roger Kershaw, and agreed secretly to move 500 pages from a crucial contract. That contract now puts at risk hundreds of jobs and more than half a billion pounds of public money. The deal with IBM was signed last September, but the details have never been seen by a single elected councillor in Somerset. I am afraid that what has happened has been uncovered and there is now an attempt to suppress the truth. These matters are, unfortunately, outside the remit of the district auditor, so I believe that the Serious Fraud Office needs to be brought in as quickly as possible. This is a cover-up and corruption at the highest level. May we please have a debate to discuss this important matter?</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman thinks that there has been criminal activity, he should approach the police and the Serious Fraud Office. It is not appropriate, in my view, to raise this matter with the Leader of the House and to ask me to bring in the police and the Serious Fraud Office. It is not a good idea for hon. Members&#151;although they obviously have to decide for themselves what they say&#151;to use the privilege of the House to make allegations of corruption in respect of individuals who can be identified. That is really quite a serious matter, which the hon. Gentleman should have referred first to the police and the Serious Fraud Office.</p>

 I am pleased to contribute to the debate. It is an opportunity for Back Benchers to raise issues of concern to their constituents. I shall touch on something that I have spoken about in Adjournment debates, including in Westminster Hall, before, and it is the continuing scandal of the compensation for miners whose health was ruined by exposure to coal dust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80522-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08052282000285">The Government can be quite proud of the compensation scheme, which has paid out nearly &#163;5 billion. Many disabled miners and their families in my constituency have benefited from it. In saying that, however, the shameful side of the scheme is the way in which it has been seen as a pot to plunder by not only greedy solicitors, but also, tragically, greedy former trade unions, or organisations purporting to be trade unions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="80522-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08052282000286">The reason why I raise the relationship between Durham National Union of Mineworkers and Thompsons Solicitors again is that what has happened since the last time I mentioned it in the House is a scandal. It was bad enough that a former trade union charged its former members and even their widows 7.5 per cent. of their compensation and asked them to pay a &#163;20 fee to join as &#147;associate members&#148; of the trade union, but now the organisation has de-listed itself as a trade union and set itself up as a claims handling company, which is what we all thought it was.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80522-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08052282000287">Let me set out the history of the scam, which is what it is. I am glad to say that many former members and their families who have been duped by Durham NUM and Thompsons Solicitors have had their compensation returned after complaints by myself and others. I strongly urge anyone who is still out there who has had money deducted by Durham NUM or Thompsons Solicitors to make a complaint as soon as possible to ensure that they get that money back.</p>

But it certainly is not today. I first raised the issue in a Westminster Hall debate on 23 May 2007 and exposed what was going on. Two individuals, Mr. David Hopper and Mr. Guy, who are president and general secretary respectively of Durham NUM, were getting huge sums from the compensation scheme. The sole source of income of Durham NUM was the 7.5 per cent. that was deducted from people&#146;s compensation by Thompsons Solicitors and passed on to it. I am still asking questions about what they did for that money, but I have never got a satisfactory answer. It is clear, however, that the solicitors confused their role and were acting in the best interests not of their  <br>

clients, but of Durham NUM. That is why the Law Society has been clear in saying that the money needs to be paid back. The two individuals whom I just mentioned are each drawing salaries, benefits and bonus packages of nearly &#163;70,000, and for doing what? Many people would be shocked by that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80522-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08052282000291">If that process was not bad enough, what has happened in the past 12 months is scandalous and is slowly coming out in the public domain. Durham NUM has de-listed itself as a trade union so that it no longer has to submit accounts, which it had to do in the past, to the certification officer, and has set itself up as something called &#147;an unincorporated association&#148;. It is important to get on the record how the situation has arisen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80522-0006.htm_para12"><a name="08052282000292">As I said in my previous speech in an Adjournment debate, the organisation has assets of nearly &#163;5.5 million. For some strange reason, &#163;680,000 of that is in an offshore bank account, and I have never been given a plausible explanation of why that is so. I accept that the &#163;5.5 million-plus that it has may well have been reduced because it has had to pay money back to people, but the union also has assets in terms of Red Hill and other property assets that it owns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80522-0006.htm_para13"><a name="08052282000293">If there are to be major changes in a trade union, we would expect the members to have a say in what happens to those assets, but if I told you, Mr. Speaker, that the decision to de-list the organisation as a trade union was taken by 10 people, including Mr. Hopper and Mr. Guy and, I think, their wives, you would appreciate that there are a lot of angry people out there. Those people have been members of the trade union for years but have not had a say in what happens to the assets. One of the individuals I mentioned chaired the meeting; the other took part in it. They not only have a connection with the change, but have a direct financial interest in what happens to Durham NUM.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="80522-0006.htm_para14"><a name="08052282000294">I have secured the minutes of the meeting, which was convened on 19 March 2007. I was pilloried locally when I stood up and said that Durham NUM was no longer a trade union, but a claims handling company. Lo and behold, that is exactly what Durham NUM set itself up as on 19 March 2007. The minutes need a larger hearing. Lo and behold, who is the solicitor who gave advice to the meeting? It is Mr. I. Walker from&#151;you guessed it, Mr. Speaker&#151;Thompsons Solicitors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="80522-0006.htm_para15"><a name="08052282000295">The minutes say that the meeting was opened and that the president of Durham NUM explained:</p>
<a name="80522-0006.htm_brev2"><a name="08052282000690"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;He and the general secretary had been advised that it no longer met the statutory definition of a trade union as set out in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 because its principal purposes no longer include the regulation  of relations between workers and employers or employers organisations.&#148;</p>
</ul>

I understand that at least two of the people who attended the meeting were women. I am not sure whether women ever qualified for full membership of the NUM; I know that they did in some areas but not in others. Interestingly, one of those attending was a Mrs. C. Guy, no doubt a relation of Mr. S. Guy. A motion was moved by George Simpson and seconded by Alan Johnson, and it was resolved unanimously that the new rules should be adopted.</p>

It is interesting that the individuals whom I mentioned were the only full members. When I asked people who have complained to me whether they were invited to the meeting and whether any consultation took place, they replied in the negative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08052282000308">If there is one core thing about a trade union, it is that it ought to represent the interests of its members. That clearly did not happen in this case. A small group of individuals&#151;some of whom had a direct vested interest in keeping this going because they were getting a blooming good living out of it&#151;were making decisions on the assets and moneys accrued over many years by hard-working former members of the union, many of whom are rightly very unhappy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08052282000309">As if that were not bad enough, what happened next was mind-boggling. It involved retired union members who had been members for many years, including a number of my constituents and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp)&#151;for example, Mr. F. Smith of Newfield in Pelton and Mr. Ron Wilson of Pelaw. One of them had been a member of the NUM for 50-odd years, since he joined as an apprentice. When he went to pay his annual retired member&#146;s fee of, I think, &#163;20, he was told that he could not be a member of the new organisation. The reason was that he had asked for his money back&#151;his 7.5 per cent. Anyone who had the audacity to ask for their 7.5 per cent., which should not have been taken by Durham NUM in the first place, was barred from membership of the new organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08052282000310">Quite rightly, those two individuals and many other former union members across the county of Durham&#151;not just in my constituency&#151;are extremely annoyed. They include Joseph Orrell, who made the front page of the <i> Sunderland Echo</i> under the headline &#147;Sick miners axed by union&#148;. The newspaper used the word &#147;outrage&#148;, and it is an outrage. What annoys me is that people who set up what is basically a claims handling company are wrapping themselves up in proud traditions and left-wing rhetoric, purporting to be socialists and to be representing the poorest and most disadvantaged members of the community, which they are clearly not doing. They are not representative of those people. They did not ask them whether they wanted the new association to be set up. They have established a small club consisting of those with direct vested interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08052282000311">Looking at the rule book, I discovered a technicality whereby retired members should at least have been consulted, which they clearly were not. Another murky aspect of the affair appears in the minutes of the special meeting, and it is something that I have suspected for a long time. The scheme does not have a proud history, given that former trade union officials have been doing deals with claims handling companies. One of those present at the meeting was a Mr.&#151;I presume&#151;A. Mardghum. I think that that is one Alan Mardghum, who used to be the lodge secretary of the Wearmouth branch and is now clearly involved with Durham NUM. He was also involved with an outfit called FreeClaim IDC in Ashington, which was one of the most disgraceful organisations handling claims. In one case, about which I complained to the Law Society, the company took some &#163;3,600 from the compensation awarded to a Mr. Jobe. The relationship between people who seem to flit between different claims handlers while giving the impression that they are representing the interests of the poor and downtrodden is something of a scandal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08052282000312">Some might ask &#147;Why does this matter?&#148; I think it matters chiefly because the money that has been taken away from retired miners and their widows should not have been taken away, but also because a number of very angry miners who have paid in for many years, such as Mr. Orrell, Mr. Smith and Mr. Wilson, feel that they have had no say in what happens to the assets. Those assets are not inconsiderable. The amount held in the disbursement fund is &#163;1.18 million, and the total value of the investments is &#163;3.7 million. The value of the unquoted investments is &#163;863,000, including&#151;this is in the accounts, in brackets&#151;&#163;687.62 in an offshore bank account, or offshore investments. The total cash assets, according to the last return, amount to &#163;5,563,000, which is not an insubstantial sum. There are also the fixed assets, which are not quoted, in the form of the Red Hill property and other property owned by the organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08052282000313">What should have happened to the money? If the organisation was no longer a trade union, it should have followed the example of other unions that have been wound up. The money should have been given to, for instance, the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation, which would at least have reinvested some of the money back into mining communities, and not put it into the pockets of a few individuals&#151;who, since the mines have closed, have had a very good living out of compensation claims for many years. There needs to be an investigation into Durham NUM. I am due to meet the regulator for claims handlers in a few weeks&#151;unfortunately I could not meet him last week&#151;and I shall ask whether some of the issues I have raised can be examined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08052282000314">There are also broader issues to do with how the assets of such organisations are dealt with. I have spoken with the certification officer. To be fair to him, he was very helpful&#151;and privately appalled by what happened, I think. However, he is limited by legislation in what he can do. However, by that one move, Durham NUM has made accounts that were in the public domain every year&#151;even though it was necessary to go round the houses to find them because those involved were quite clever in hiding the salaries and moneys in the accounts&#151;no longer public. Therefore, basically what has happened is that &#163;5 million and the assets of a former trade union have been squirreled away into an organisation that no longer has to produce any public accounts. Many former miners and their families are rightly very angry about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para10"><a name="08052282000315">There should be an urgent investigation into the organisation. Although some people are getting their money back&#151;I put on record again that I welcome that, and I urge anyone who has had money taken to contact the legal complaints service because moneys are being given back&#151;this issue will not go away. I understand that I am being pilloried in certain quarters as the villain of the piece. I am sorry, but if what I am doing is exposing people to proper scrutiny, that is my role as a Member of Parliament. I will take no criticism from people who have direct vested interests and have done very well at the expense&#151;this is what really sticks in my throat&#151;of some very poor individuals.</p>

It is a former mining village, which suffered badly throughout the 1980s and early &#146;90s, and a brand new health centre has been built for it, which will be opened by Sir Bobby Robson. I ask people to come and look at the health centre, as it is a carbon-neutral building and a fantastic example of what can be done in a public building both to provide top quality local health services and to protect the environment.</p>

That campaign has been well supported by many north-east politicians of all parties, including my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell), who cannot speak because of the Whip&#146;s purdah. The campaign is creating some movement, and I pay tribute to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who is now talking to the British Library not merely about loaning us the gospels, but about there being a permanent home for them in the north-east. I also pay tribute to Durham university and the cathedral, which are now actively looking at building a resource and visitor centre on Palace green in Durham, not only as a possible home for the gospels, but to display the university and cathedral&#146;s rich collection of early Christian manuscripts. That would be a great tourist attraction not only for the city of Durham, but for the north-east.</p>

We hear a lot of doom and gloom at present about the economy, but employment levels in the north-east have never been higher. We have some tremendous organisations: Nissan, for example, is taking on 800 new workers and producing cars not only at an efficient rate in terms of this country, but of world-beating class. In the last 10 years the north-east economy has come a very long way. I look forward to working with the new unitary council in Durham&#151;its inaugural meeting is on Friday&#151;to ensure that County Durham is part of the renaissance, both cultural and economic, that is taking place in the north-east.</p>

Sadly, he died earlier this week. Tom was a great advocate for the north-east. If people want to see the good side of trade unionism, they should look at how he worked in partnership with Dr. John Bridge, the CBI and others to form organisations such as the Northern Development Company. That spirit of partnership was there even in the dark days when we were losing heavy industry throughout the north-east. His passing will be mourned by a lot of people in the north-east, and he will be fondly remembered for the contribution he made.</p>

It offers a practical and challenging route to recovery through personal responsibility and social inclusion. I have met many ex-patients over the past few years, and especially in recent months during the trauma of threatened closure. For those who have received the service, it has been life-saving and transforming. It does not only offer patients a way to manage or contain their mental health problems, but provides treatment for those problems and a way for people to restart their lives. Many of them cannot understand why a service that they prize so highly and that has given them an opportunity to realise their potential could be taken away from the many others who might benefit from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para20"><a name="08052282000328">The service treats personality disorder, and it facilitates change in people&#146;s lives. Unlike many other mental health services, it is not simply about the management of the status quo or the containment of the threats that those with mental health problems can pose to themselves and in a few cases to others. Research on the Henderson has shown that its approach reduces acute admissions and interventions by the criminal justice system. The number of people in prison who have severe mental health problems is a blot on our criminal justice system and shows that provision does not adequately meet those people&#146;s needs. The service at the Henderson does offer a way to meet some of those needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para21"><a name="08052282000329">Despite the evidence that the Henderson therapeutic model works, the service has been earmarked for closure and indeed it has already been closed temporarily&#151; as the euphemism has it&#151;pending the outcome of consultation. The Henderson has a 60-year history. Over that time, it has taken from referrals from practically every part of the United Kingdom from Land&#146;s End to John O&#146;Groats. However, in some circles, that history marks it out as old fashioned, out of date and ripe for closure. In truth, the model of care that it offers is a very modern one. It is run on democratic lines, with residents taking personal responsibility for much of the day-to-day running of the service. They make decisions about everything from menus to direct staff involvement in the provision of the service. That is very different from the typical model of mental health services that is still the norm in much of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para22"><a name="08052282000330">A few years ago, the Henderson was even asked to replicate the service in two new units, at Webb house in Crewe&#151;events there may be the reason why the Chamber is not especially well populated with Members seeking to contribute today&#151;and at Main house in Birmingham. Webb house has since closed because of funding cuts, and Main house is struggling to keep its doors open.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para23"><a name="08052282000331">So why is such a successful service under threat? Until 2005, the Henderson was funded by the Department of Health through the national specialist commissioning advisory group. After 2005, funding passed to a consortium of 128 primary care trusts across London, East Anglia and south-east and central England, so many hon. Members will have constituents who have benefited from the service in the past. It has to be said that this was not a consortium of the willing. Within a year of the change in responsibility for the funding of the service, PCT after PCT took the opportunity to pull the plug on funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para24"><a name="08052282000332">As a result, the mental health trust that hosts the service, the South West London and St George&#146;s Mental Health NHS Trust, has been confronted with a growing funding crisis. The clinical need has not changed and clinicians still want to refer patients to the service, but the PCTs are refusing to fund referrals. So the closure is based not on clinical need, but on financial reasons. The NHS and the Minister responsible accept there is a need for tier 4 provision such as the Henderson. Everyone wills the ends, but no one will identify the means to deliver them. The Government&#146;s review of the commissioning of specialist mental health services, the Carter review, found that PCTs are ill equipped for the task of specialist commissioning of such complexity. In a system driven by tick boxes and targets, services such as the Henderson do not fit. So when Ministers say that this is a devolved matter for PCTs and that they  <br>

cannot intervene, they miss the point. Closure is a direct result of the way in which devolution to PCTs was designed by the Department of Health. It is a consequence of policy, not of individual decisions of PCTs. There are no incentives for the complex regional collaborations necessary to commission specialist services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para25"><a name="08052282000333">I hope that the Department of Health will wake up to that fatal flaw in the system before it is too late. Every day the service is closed, the risk is that the clinical expertise will be lost and, far worse, that the lives of those people who could have been helped will not be changed for the better. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House will sign early-day motion 1547 and, if they represent a constituency in the south of England, challenge their own PCT to support the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para26"><a name="08052282000334">The second issue I want to raise involves housing. In March, I joined a determined group of council tenants from the Sutton Federation of Tenants and Residents Associations and councillors of all parties from the London borough of Sutton to present a petition to the Prime Minister. The petition sought to highlight what my constituents and I regard as a stealth tax on tenants. The tenant tax is known in official Government circles as negative housing subsidy. It means that if the Department for Communities and Local Government determines that a council&#146;s rent account will be in surplus, the Government can cream off some of the money. This is money that tenants pay as rent in the belief that it will be used to pay for the management and maintenance of the local council housing stock, and even&#151;dare I say it&#151;of their own homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para27"><a name="08052282000335">In Sutton and Cheam, this year tenants will pay nearly &#163;10 million in tenant tax or, to put it another way, tenants will be paying their rent to the Government until mid-August. Until then, not a penny piece of their rent will benefit them. The Government say that the system of housing subsidy and negative subsidy is there to support areas that need the money more, but it means that families on modest incomes living in my constituency and in many others bear the brunt of that redistribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para28"><a name="08052282000336">What is worse is that the current subsidy regime is headed for a national surplus. In 2001-02, the Government made a net contribution of &#163;351 million. That fell to &#163;252 million in 2002-03, and to &#163;191 million in 2003-04. It is widely believed that the system is reaching a tipping point at which the Treasury will pay out less in subsidy than it receives in negative subsidy from local authorities. At that point, any argument that the negative subsidy is anything other than a stealth tax will fall to pieces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="80522-0007.htm_para29"><a name="08052282000337">Indeed, reports in <i> Public Finance</i> magazine suggest that this year the Treasury could be skimming as much as &#163;194 million off rent payments across the country, and that figure will perhaps rise to &#163;500 million within a decade. Tenants have every right to demand to know what the Government intend to do with that money. They have every right to call it a tenant tax and every justification in calling for it to be scrapped. At a time when the Government are reeling from the consequences of their decision to double the 10p rate of tax, it seems remarkable that they would continue to defend a stealth tax of some of the poorest in our country&#151;that is, many of our council tenants.</p>

Federation of Tenants and Residents Associations, Jean Crossby, about the subject. She is working very hard with tenants in the borough and with tenants organisations around the country to challenge this iniquitous tax. She has pointed out that the Government are failing to engage seriously with tenants as part of the review. For example, I understand that here in London a handful of tenants will be involved in the review process. Surely more must be done to ensure that tenants can have a real say about the future financing of public housing. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will be able to give the House some assurances about the extent to which the tenant&#146;s voice will truly be heard in this process and, at the very least, will pass on those concerns to the Minister for Housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="80522-0008.htm_para1"><a name="08052282000339">Finally, I want to raise my continuing concern about the arrangements we have in this country for the protection of vulnerable adults and older people. Over the past 10 years, I have drawn to the attention of the Government and the House the mounting evidence of the abusive and inappropriate prescribing of anti-psychotic drugs to older people with dementia in care homes. In doing so, I have often outraged some care home owners, but I think that it is right to raise these concerns because it is right to draw attention to the academic research evidence, which is becoming compelling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="80522-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08052282000340">At any one time, about 100,000 older people in care homes are on those drugs, which are not licensed for the treatment of dementia, have adverse side effects, increase the risk of strokes and even bring on premature death. The prolonged use of those drugs on some of the most vulnerable people in our society is nothing less than restraint by chemical straitjacket.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80522-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08052282000341">Change is long overdue. The Department of Health, medicine licensing authorities, the care regulator, the General Medical Council and care providers all have a part to play in rooting out bad practice and protecting the vulnerable. Elder abuse is a serious matter in this country. Government-funded research found that 342,000 people over the age of 66 are victims of one form of abuse or another, including fraud, theft, psychological or emotional abuse, and assault, including the use of restraint. High hurdles had to be clambered over in order to register as a victim of abuse in the study, and many people were excluded altogether, such as those in care homes or those with dementia who live in the community. They were not approached or included in any way in the result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80522-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08052282000342">It must be likely that the study&#146;s figures are a conservative estimate of the scale of the problem and the challenge that we still have to confront. It is a challenge that the Law Commission asked us to confront in 1995. It said that it had no confidence in the adult protection procedures that existed at that time, but although there have been a number of welcome piecemeal adaptations to the system since then, they are not sufficient to meet the concerns that the Law Commission flagged up so long ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80522-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08052282000343">The Law Commission proposed that social services departments should be given powers to protect vulnerable adults similar to those that exist for child protection and a duty to investigate; that powers should be granted for magistrates to issue entry warrants, temporary protection orders and removal orders; and that an offence should be created of obstructing officers acting on behalf of the courts. Rather than acting on those recommendations, the Government chose to go down the guidance route.  <br>

In 2000, they issued guidance called &#147;No Secrets&#148;. The evidence is that &#147;No Secrets&#148; has failed to gain the necessary traction and acceptance in local authorities and other agencies, and as a result its implementation has been piecemeal and patchy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80522-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08052282000344">In 2006, Action on Elder Abuse completed a two-year study funded by the Department of Health on adult protection systems. The report stated:</p>

This has hampered efforts to develop Protection of Vulnerable Adults policies, procedures and systems consistently and coherently. Many of the inconsistencies in practice and procedure highlighted throughout this report can be attributed directly or indirectly to its perceived lack of status, and the lack of priority in the NHS.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80522-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08052282000345">The report went on to recommend that the protection of vulnerable adults be placed on a statutory basis equivalent to that for child protection and domestic violence. The report and its recommendations were produced in March 2006. The fact that the Government funded the research in the first place was welcome, but it took two years for them to come back and announce, as they did in March, that they will have a review of &#147;No Secrets&#148; that will consider the case for legislation. I suppose that that should be welcomed, but it has taken 13 years&#151;and that is not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80522-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08052282000346">When the circumstances surrounding the death of Victoria Climbi&#233; emerged, they convulsed the child protection system and galvanised the Government to legislate and to work with others to drive change in the child protection system. Although no system in which humans are involved will ever be perfect, there has been significant improvement in this country&#146;s child protection system. It should not take a similar shock to the adult protection system to achieve long overdue reform and action. I hope that legislative time will be found to enact the Law Commission&#146;s proposals or similar ones. Thirteen years is far too long to wait.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80522-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08052282000347">In conclusion, the future of the Henderson hospital is in limbo as a result of a dysfunctional funding system. Council tenants in my constituency are paying 37p of every pound of rent as a tenant tax to the Treasury. The frail and the vulnerable are protected by a system found to be unfit for purpose more than a decade ago. The message from my constituents to the Government is that it is time for dither and delay to end. It is time that the Government put those things right. Although I enter into the spirit of things by wishing all colleagues a good Whitsun recess, I hope that the Government will take advantage of the fact that they do not have business in the House next week to reflect on the concerns held by me and my constituents.</p>

as far as I can make out, who represented the voice of Labour from Northern Ireland in Parliament&#151;and not just in one House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80522-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08052282000349">For a long time, the late Billy Blease headed up the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in Northern Ireland in the most difficult times and circumstances. He trod the fine line of trying to bring together people of different traditions in the trade union movement and he did that with great dexterity. For a long time, he served my party&#151;the Labour party&#151;in the House of Lords, despite the fact that the Labour party then foolishly had a policy of not allowing anybody from Northern Ireland to join it. He had to use enormous dexterity to get around that. I want to place on the record my appreciation for the political life and work and work for the trade union movement of Lord Billy Blease, who also passed away recently. The House and those people who worked hard for successful reconciliation in Northern Ireland should acknowledge his great contribution, albeit it was a discreet one.</p>

We are not sufficiently zealous in fulfilling our role of probing those areas that the establishment in this country would not like us to dwell on. I am referring particularly&#151;as I did earlier, during business questions&#151;to our security and intelligence services.</p>

We do not know the parameters of its jurisdiction, as the term &#147;security and intelligence services&#148; is a generic one: does it include the special branch of the Metropolitan police and other forces, or does it involve just MI5, MI6 and GCHQ?

is some parliamentary oversight of the security and intelligence services, albeit not enough? Under the National Audit Act 1983, the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee&#151;who, by convention, is a member of the Opposition&#151;has certain statutory responsibilities for auditing them.</p>

Will he shoot, as it were, a particular fox before it gets up and running? This House is a democratic Chamber, and all sorts of people get elected to it. Among its hundreds and hundreds of Members over many years, there might have been some who were genuinely a subversive danger.

 The answer to the hon. Gentleman is yes, I do accept that, but it is not the issue. The issue is that successive Labour and Tory Prime Ministers have said that there shall not be any parliamentary oversight, and I believe that they have done so because they are weak and craven before the security and intelligence services. The point that the hon. Gentleman raises is addressed in the US Congress, which has a very powerful committee to oversee security and intelligence matters. It does not appoint suspect people, but the pride of Congress&#151;and of this place&#151;is that parliamentary institutions should be able to make judgments of that sort.</p>

 I had not realised that I was going to rattle so many cages today, but I should like to finish my thought process on this point. The fact is that the US Congress, France&#146;s National Assembly, Canada&#146;s House of Commons and Australia&#146;s House of Representatives all address this subject: it is a matter of pride for them. They find ways to ensure that the members of their respective committees are suitable and appropriate, but they are appointed not by the head of the security and intelligence services&#151;that is, by each country&#146;s equivalent of the Prime Minister or the head of the CIA&#151;but by their Parliament or Congress.</p>

 I was going to save the story that I am about to tell for my memoirs. They will be the mother and father of all memoirs, and will actually be interesting. When the late Robin Cook was Foreign Secretary, he had to instruct a man called C to meet the Foreign Affairs Committee.

After a long deliberation by the Court of Appeal, including days when the hearing was in camera and special advocates had to be appointed, the judgment, headed not by a &#147;mere&#148; judge but by the Lord Chief Justice, was conformation that the action of the Home Secretary was perverse. He went on to say that all that having sat in secret for two or three days did was to reinforce his view that the Home Secretary&#146;s action was perverse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80522-0008.htm_para22"><a name="08052282000375">I want to be generous to the Home Secretary. The Home Secretary&#146;s view was framed by&#151;guess&#151;this country&#146;s security and intelligence services, which peddle a line, quite confident and arrogant, that nobody is ever going to question their judgment. However, on this occasion they did, and not just Members of Parliament&#151;including Lord Waddington, Baroness Boothroyd, Lord Russell-Johnston, a former Conservative Lord Advocate and many Members of this House&#151;but a court of the level of the High Court and the Lord Chief Justice of England. That is a slight victory, but when there is the damning judgment that the attitude being pursued by Her Majesty&#146;s Government was &#147;perverse&#148;, that shows the need, in my view, for people to be able to explain their position more fully before the high court of Parliament, and to be accountable for their stewardship.</p>

 No, but I have a parliamentary question down to that effect, and I want to know the parliamentary procedure; I do not want to deny the opportunity of hon. Members in all parts of the House to say what their view is in debates of at least one and a half hours upstairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80522-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08052282000378">I want to trespass into one other area that might get Members salivating. A lot has been said about the Freedom of Information Act 2000, even this morning, but the other side of the same coin is the Data Protection Act 1998. This needs to be looked at in respect of our own interests. There must not be a casual disclosure by this House of information relating to hon. Members in which there is a third-party interest under the Data Protection Act. There therefore needs not only to be time for Members to look at any disclosures proposed to be made; but the House authorities and hon. Members have also to be conscious of the fact that what is put into the public domain should be nothing with which another person outside this House has a legitimate interest and protection in relation to data protection. I am surprised that this issue has not been raised before, and I would be pleased to develop it with Members outside this Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80522-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08052282000379">I say this because I have been the victim of an unauthorised disclosure, under the Data Protection Act, by a Government Department. I have kept mute about this for some time. What aggravated me is that when I found out about it, the Government Department concerned initially treated the matter with some levity, and since then, the people responsible for breaking the law in respect of me&#151;and for a disclosure that included a defamatory statement about me&#151;have been promoted. There have been discussions about beefing up the penalties in relation to data protection, and they should be. My personal experience indicated to me how casual and flippant people can be regarding the reckless disclosure of data when there is no real penalty. The point is true of both the public and private sectors.</p>

 That is a very interesting and valid point but in any event, the existing law places a duty in relation to data protection that is not being addressed by many organisations, both in the public and private sectors. When there is a freedom of information disclosure, the person or organisation making that disclosure needs to be mindful of their other statutory duty and responsibility to people under the Data Protection Act. I have never heard that mentioned during the past weeks and months in relation to the disclosure of Members&#146; expenses and so on, or to the big controversy about a Government Department&#146;s recklessly disclosing data. This is a serious point that we need to address not only in our own interests, but those of everybody else.</p>

 I accept what the hon. Gentleman says, but may I take the opportunity, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to emphasise that I am not raising the Data Protection Act issue in relation to the Members issue? I am using it as an illustration. The fact is that Members in all parts of the House did not raise it when great concern was rightly raised in this House about the disclosure of data by a Government Department. We are too casual about our responsibility as legislators to protect the interests of other people in this regard. Moreover, this is not a matter for us, but if there is disclosure, which there inevitably will be&#151;and, in broad-brush terms, rightly so&#151;of our expenses and interests, there needs to be a reassurance that there is no third-party disclosure. That would be breaking the law.</p>

There is a great deal of concern about files that are kept, for example, and there is no way of reassuring ourselves about this secret part of our state; that needs to be addressed. People may think that I am exaggerating, but I will go on to buttress my argument.

 I have two serious points that I want to share with the House, the first of which I referred to in questions earlier. In the last decade of the South African apartheid regime period, a man called Wouter Basson was the head of the South African equivalent of Porton Down. He was described by journalists writing about the truth and reconciliation commission, in respect of which he had a big hearing, as the Dr. Mengele of South Africa. It is a matter of fact, not conjecture, that he was involved in chemical and biological research, and that he was responsible for the deaths of many people not just in South Africa but throughout the continent and probably elsewhere around the world. For 10 years, he was given access to the United Kingdom. It is not unreasonable for me or any other hon. Member to ask why, and on what basis. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80522-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08052282000390">I tabled a parliamentary question this week asking on what basis Wouter Basson was allowed to come to the United Kingdom, and to have either the ownership or tenancy of a house in Berkshire. The Government&#146;s reply was, &#147;We don&#146;t discuss individual cases.&#148; Of course, I would defend that as a general principle, but it is a matter of fact that that man was involved in serious wrongdoing both in South Africa and internationally. He was an agent of the South African apartheid regime. He was involved in chemical and biological  <br>

weapons. So he must have been in the United Kingdom with the full knowledge and full consent of our security and intelligence services, and I want to know why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="80522-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08052282000391">I also want to know whether there was any ministerial cover for that. If there was not, it is a serious matter, and probably criminality could be involved, because of United Nations sanctions, as well as the United Kingdom law that governed such relationships. If there was ministerial cover, there is even more reason why the House should know. That illustrates how the security and intelligence services will use Ministers to not disclose that which should be disclosed, and I challenge the Government to come clean to the House on the relationship of Woulter Basson and his Project Coast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="80522-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08052282000392">I made a Data Protection Act request to the Foreign Office in relation to myself. I asked a lot of questions about Woulter Basson and Project Coast, and to summarise, the Minister&#146;s replies were broadly, &#147;There&#146;s nothing in this.&#148; Yet when I made my Data Protection Act request, it was disclosed that</p>
<a name="80522-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="08052282000700"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a handling strategy meeting to deal with Andrew Mackinlay&#146;s questions&#148;</p>

Being a diligent Member of Parliament, I inevitably asked the next question, &#147;Who were the officials who attended the handling strategy meeting to deal with Andrew Mackinlay&#146;s questions about Woulter Basson and Project Coast?&#148; And they refused to answer, because the spooks were there. That is the truth, and they know that it was true that there was some illicit, probably illegal, involvement by our security and intelligence services with Woulter Basson and the apartheid regime&#146;s chemical and biological weapons research. So they do not like that sort of question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80522-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08052282000394">The other thing that I want to share with the House&#151;I have hesitated about this&#151;is that I, as a diligent Member of Parliament, take an interest in many parts of the world, and from time to time, as other Members of Parliament do, I meet an official from the Russian embassy, to ascertain the Russian Government&#146;s views. We cannot rely on the British press and media and certainly not on the British Government&#146;s objectivity in such matters. In my discussions, I give such state secrets as &#147;I think that Tony Blair will retire probably in 2007&#148; and my firm prediction that there will be no contest for the leadership of the Labour party. That is the extent of it. If those are state secrets, I plead guilty before the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="80522-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08052282000395">What I learn from meeting a diplomat from the Russian embassy approximately three times a year is what Russia&#146;s views are on a range of things&#151;for instance, the Helsinki accords in relation to the controversy about Kosovo. I learn its views about nuclear missile defence. I suspect that many other hon. Members do that. If they do not, they should, because at least if we understand the other guy&#146;s point of view, we can make a good assessment of how we should probe the Government and what we should be arguing and so on. For example, the British want someone extradited from Moscow, but what has not been told in the House is that Moscow would like some people extradited from London to face courts in Moscow&#151;not a wholly illegitimate claim.</p>

Friend the Member for Bosworth (David Tredinnick). There, a report of great crested newts had to be investigated. I happen to like newts. When I was a child I used to catch them, look at them and put them back in ponds, as I am sure we all did. Now, with the ludicrous bureaucratic nonsense that we have, one needs a licence to handle newts. Did hon. Members know that? A licence to pick up a newt, for heaven&#146;s sake.</p>

Members&#146; money and my constituents&#146; money on a plan to erect fencing to prevent great crested newts being affected by the Earl Shilton bypass. The newts are not rare. If there are 66,000 breeding ponds, how can they be? I could take hon. Members, if they wish, to a place where I could find 10 tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08052282000420">The lifecycle of the great crested newts means that they come out of semi-hibernation in the spring and move to a pond. After they have laid their spawn, in early summer, they move off. Nobody knows where they go. They go up and down the ditches of Leicestershire and elsewhere, and they may be found wherever they feel they want to go. They do a useful job catching slugs, snails and so on. However, the idea that we should spend &#163;1.2 million of taxpayers&#146; money after a newt was allegedly found&#151;none was found after the fencing was erected&#151;is ludicrous. It is a matter of great concern that we should have reached that point. I shall soon introduce a ten-minute Bill about that. I shall also mention bats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08052282000421">I like bats. I went on the bat walk organised by the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) last summer. We did not see any bats around the House of Commons, but never mind&#151;it was very interesting. The fact that disturbing a bat could lead to a fine of X thousand pounds is ridiculous. Of course we should protect bats, but we should balance that with the needs of the human population. I hope we may be able to examine the matter further.</p>

I am bemused as to why the Labour party is undermining the labouring classes, who have only their labour to sell, by introducing a cheap source of labour into this country. Many Labour Members, and perhaps the Government, appear to want to do that, but it undermines the ability of the working classes&#151;if I am allowed to use that expression&#151;to sell their labour. That is what has happened, and that is what my constituents are telling me. In those letters, my constituents tell me&#151;not in British National party fury but in sorrow&#151;that their country has been &#147;overrun&#148; in a way they did not expect. Those people are not racist&#151;well, one or two are, if the truth be known, but most of them are not.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise a couple of issues that concern my constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08052282000432">The movement of housing stock from council control to an arm&#146;s length management organisation&#151;or in our case, Welsh housing associations&#151;is a great concern. My constituents cannot understand why the Government will not allow councils to retain their housing stock and obtain funds to regenerate it. The stated reasons include the public sector borrowing requirement and the effects on the economy, but housing associations are allowed to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08052282000433">There is more need than ever before in constituencies such as mine for affordable rented accommodation. House prices and wages are out of sync&#151;the average wage is around &#163;13,000; the average house price is around &#163;100,000. In many cases, rented accommodation is the only option. As and when council properties move over to a housing association, what quality of maintenance and response to need will that housing association provide? Rumours are flying around that rents increase within weeks of an association taking over housing stock. What review has been carried out of the effectiveness of previous transfers to associations? The issue of rent money being held by the Treasury was raised earlier, and the concern is that money from the sale of housing stock, which has gone on for a considerable time, has not been reinvested in housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08052282000434">On shared equity housing, how long does a house remain a shared equity property? One can own 70 per cent. of a house, and a housing association can own the other 30 per cent., but does such a house always remain a social house, or does the housing association have the right at some time in the future to sell it off at full price? And how do individuals who own part of a house move on? How will they afford to own 100 per cent. of a house? There is a need for social housing, but it must be balanced against an individual&#146;s ability to live and work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08052282000435">When the empty business rates tax was first considered in this House I supported it, but with hindsight I think it has caused considerable problems. A number of business premises in my constituency are empty not because the owner does not want to fill them, but because the economy will not allow that to happen. Those owners must now find the moneys to pay the extra tax. Some individuals have been criminalised&#151;they have even been taken to court&#151;because they cannot afford to pay. I agree that empty properties are not what a community needs for regeneration, but to punish individuals who have done their best to run businesses is not the way to do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08052282000436">In their advance statement about the Queen&#146;s Speech, the Government announced the possibility of their taking over empty and derelict houses and revamping them to sell on. One of the issues that we have discussed locally&#151;I hope that the Government consider this&#151;is empty business premises. Some shops in parts of my constituency have been empty for some years. I have fought to get grants to allow such shops to be returned to domestic dwellings rather than businesses. There is a  <br>

huge need for the reintroduction of grants for revamping business premises and domestic dwellings, and I hope that the Government consider the social and regeneration aspects of that point. When premises, whether houses or businesses, are boarded up, it does nothing for the community or the local economy.</p>

 I hesitate to take up the House&#146;s time by further referring to the issue of Members&#146; private home addresses being published, but this is one of the few opportunities available to me to develop the argument, which I shall do in detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08052282000439">Every hon. Member has a few special skills, some of which are more valuable than others. I have very few special skills, one of which is particularly rarefied&#151;I have an understanding of the way in which extremists&#146; minds work. Were I an extremist, I would be cheering on the freedom of information campaigners who are urging, for misguided reasons, that the private home addresses of Members of this House should be made public in an easily accessible form.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08052282000440">I first learned to be careful about my private home address 31 years ago, when I was involved in a nasty campaign concerning the infiltration of a democratic party in this country by an extremist organisation. It was impossible in those circumstances for my address in the then constituency of Newham, North-East to be kept secret.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08052282000441">A number of things happened in the course of that campaign, including someone tampering with the brakes of my motorcycle, which caused me to sustain a significant injury, and the subsequent hurling of a boulder through my bedroom window late at night. I was fortunate that, as it hit the masonry, only the glass penetrated into the room and on to the bed where I was sleeping, rather than the boulder itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08052282000442">A few years after that campaign was over, I believe that it was the investigative journalist Barrie Penrose who wrote an interesting story in <i> The Sunday Times</i> about a firm of investigators called Detectives (Private) Associates, which had, in part of that campaign, been bugging my telephone lines and making use of the political information. Even if I were not concerned about my personal safety, the case raised the question of my right to privacy to campaign, in what I believe was a democratic way, on an issue that was causing great concern to the political parties of the day. It was causing concern not only to the Labour party, with which I was involved at the time, but to anybody who was concerned about the way in which extremism was trying to infiltrate democratic institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08052282000443">Subsequently, a number of other campaigns involved my dealing with organisations of political extremists at home and Governments of a totalitarian nature abroad. I never doubted that if any of those bodies really set their mind to it and made a special effort, concentrating all their resources on it&#151;they might simply follow me late one night&#151;they would eventually be able to find out where I lived. I did not see that then, and I do not see it now, as a justification for making it easy for anybody to be able to dial up, at the touch of a  <br>

If people are perhaps to know where my constituency home address is&#151;I shall discuss that point in a moment or two&#151;at least my partner is not exposed to nearly the same level of risk. That is because somebody might decide to have a go at me at, or, more likely, send something through the post to, my constituency home address than to my London home address, where she lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para25"><a name="08052282000445">As a result of not only those past campaigns and the experience that I have gained from them, but a recent event&#151;I was involved for five years in trying to build up a case against a career criminal who had defrauded my elderly father of thousands of pounds for building work that had not been completed, and my lawyer advised me that it would extremely unwise for any of my addresses to be made easily publicly available&#151; I decided that I would take on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para26"><a name="08052282000446">I did not do so because, as one might think, I felt myself particularly at risk, although I am particularly at risk.

One would have thought that that was a simple enough thing, but it appears to have escaped the understanding of the Information Commissioner and the judges who have subsequently pronounced, in their wisdom, on those questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80522-0010.htm_para28"><a name="08052282000448">I would almost certainly be able to claim that exemption for myself, but as a result of my experiences, I have felt it particularly important to try to ensure that similar protection is extended to my colleagues, who might not have had my experiences and who might not yet be subject to the same sorts of threats that would entitle them to claim an individual exemption on the same basis as me.</p>

It is not fair to expect Mr. Speaker constantly to have to stick his neck out to defend what the hon. Gentleman previously referred to in another context as the privileges of this House if Mr. Speaker is not made firmly aware of the united opinion of this House when it needs him to defend our privileges or, as some would call them, our rights.

If I were applying an extremist mind to an extremist cause&#151;I like to think that I apply my mind to moderate causes, such as the defeat of extremism&#151;I know what I would do if I wanted to knock this ridiculous proposal on the head. I would buy a large packet of white soap powder and 646 envelopes, and I would then place a quantity of the soap powder in each envelope, together with a little note saying, &#147;Ha, ha. You have just opened a packet of anthrax&#148;, and send an envelope to each of the 646 private home addresses. Of course, people would not have opened a packet of anthrax, but it would take a brave or reckless MP not to take the trouble of immediately contacting the emergency services in case the envelope of white powder really did contain anthrax, as has happened in a case in the United States. </p>

I could not understand how we reached this state until today&#146;s business questions, when the hon.

That is why I have, not at all facetiously, put in freedom of information requests asking for the private home addresses of High Court judges in general. Now that we know the names of the three High Court judges who took the decision, my parliamentary assistant has put in a supplementary request for their details to be made public. The grounds on which those judges came to their decision were that if someone really set their mind to it, it would be  <br>

If somebody wishes to take basic security precautions in respect of their address, it is possible for them to do so. My address has never been on an electoral register, and that is quite legal. Owing to my individual political history, I have explained to the electoral returning officer every time that I would prefer to register under a nom de plume. Anybody can do that. I fill in my electoral registration form with my nom de plume and sign it &#147;Julian Lewis&#148;, indicating that I have used that nom de plume.</p>

I have entered that address into the Google search engine with my name. I have had to fill in various forms with that address&#151;I am talking only about my constituency address, not my London one&#151;but despite that fact, no match comes up anywhere on the internet. If somebody is sufficiently evil-minded about it, they will no doubt now make a point of going to New Forest, East, ferreting around, finding the relevant forms and publishing my address in the papers. I have had to take that calculated risk in putting my head above the parapet and raising the issue at all. Good luck to them&#151;they will just prove my point.

Furthermore, as I said in an intervention, we have not had an opportunity to raise the issues outside the House, because the very people who are determined that all this stuff should be exposed are the media themselves.

I explained to him what I would do, even if I were only an al-Qaeda sympathiser at home or abroad; I have given one example of what I would do, but I do not want to generate too many free ideas for the extremists out there by giving more. However, I could do plenty more things with my twisted mind; I am sure that the extremists do not need my suggestions anyway. The journalist had no answer to any of my points.

 Indeed. Have any words appeared in that particular tabloid putting our side of the case? Not at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80522-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08052282000463">I should like to spend a moment considering what the Information Commissioner, supported by the wisdom of the High Court, proposes that we should rely on. I say it again: there is an exemption through which if a particular MP has a special reason for keeping his or her address confidential&#151;because of a stalker, terrorist or other criminal threat&#151;the address may be redacted. Right, let us think about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80522-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08052282000464">Let us take half a dozen female MPs as an example, and let us imagine that the provisions are about to come in. One of those MPs is being stalked. &#147;Ah! That&#146;s all right,&#148; says the Information Commissioner, &#147;We have catered for that&#151;her address will be redacted.&#148; Fine, so we go to press and the address of one of those half a dozen female MPs is withheld and the other five addresses are published. But hang on a moment&#151;six months down the line, two of the other five suddenly acquire stalkers. What will we do about them? Will we say, &#147;Sorry: general public, please disregard those addresses that we published&#148;? Are we going to say, &#147;Too late now&#151;tough luck.&#148; If we say that, why should the first one to be stalked have had the advantage of not having had her address published, while the others did not? Alternatively, will we say that the lady MPs should be moved and that we will pay for the costs of that? That would involve the public purse, and the issue is supposed to be about the public purse&#151;although it is not, in my humble opinion.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is being very generous. Another issue that occurs to me is this: how are we supposed to know in advance that we are about to become a victim of terrorism? I say that very seriously. At about a quarter to 3 in October 1984, I happened to be in Brighton. I walked through the revolving doors of the Grand Hotel to see whether some friends of mine were still there. I sat down and had a chat. About four to five minutes later, the Brighton bomb went off. I did not know that that was going to happen; if I had, I would have been somewhere else.</p>

 That is why we can see that not a moment&#146;s real thought has been given to the security implications. I am afraid to make the following proposal, because I know the bureaucratic mind as well as the extremist one&#151;even now, I can see the bureaucrats groping madly for the wrong conclusion. My proposal is that if there are any grounds for withholding any hon. Member&#146;s address because they already face a specific threat, that must be an argument for withholding every hon. Member&#146;s address because we could become subject to such a threat at any time because of the nature of our work.</p>

For that reason, I have not only submitted a freedom of information request for the private home addresses of judges to be published, but I have started tabling questions to every Cabinet Minister&#151;I am up to about 12 Departments so far&#151;asking what their policy would be if they received a freedom of information request asking for the disclosure of the private home addresses of senior civil servants, who correspond to Ministers, and middle-ranking civil servants, who correspond to ordinary Members.

 That does not surprise me at all. As my hon.

Effectively, if there are conflicts, there ought to be two separate bodies to fight the corner of each side of the argument, but that is not the case at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80522-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08052282000488">I shall diverge a little more, as I have mentioned the Information Commissioner. I have a chequered history with the Information Commissioner, and I do not have a great deal of regard for the way in which that office has done its job. In September 2004, I was surprised to receive a summons from the then leader of my party, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard). He informed me that although my only speciality in life was defence and security matters, as I hope some of the remarks I have made illustrate, he wished me to take on the role, on a temporary basis, of shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office. I am sure that he will not mind me mentioning it now the election has been and gone. He was quite blunt about it; he was concerned about the way in which the Freedom of Information Act might be applied&#151;he had a lot of foresight on this&#151;when it came into force. Although it had been enacted in 2000, it came into force only on 1 January 2005 and of course the election was due to take place soon after that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80522-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08052282000489">My right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s concern was that the Act lent itself to being used in a politically partisan fashion. It would be possible to release all sorts of detailed information about why previous Governments, who happened to be Conservative, had taken decisions that had led to all sorts of disasters like Black Wednesday, but it would not be possible to get similar information out about the current Government because it was too current, and exemptions would have kicked in concerning the act of government becoming impracticable if current matters were being investigated. My job, which was given to me on a temporary basis&#151;the promise was that I would go back to defence whether we won or lost the election, and I am delighted that it was fulfilled&#151;was to try to neutralise that threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80522-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08052282000490">In the course of doing that job, I did two things. One was to table a lot of questions to a lot of Cabinet Ministers that I knew would be rejected, as indeed they were, and thus when old material was brought out, it became a matter of whether the Act was being used in a partisan way. The other thing was something I stumbled across by accident. I tabled a series of questions to every Department, asking how many confidential or secret files had been shredded in the each of the past five years&#151;in other words, since the measure had been enacted but before it came into force. In several cases,  <br>

<notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2008 : Column 447</b><br>
there was no discernible change and a roughly equal number of files had been shredded in each of those years. However, in several Departments, including some important ones, there had been a massive increase in shredding files. To my mind, that provided at least a prima facie case that something had been going on and that some Departments had decided to make a bonfire of files before they had to open them. I thought that addressing that was surely what the Information Commissioner and the Freedom of Information Act were about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80522-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08052282000493">To my amazement, Mr. Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner, immediately declared that he was unaware of the deliberate destruction of files by civil servants and that Departments were keen to co-operate with him. He said that he would give them all a clean bill of health but that, if I had any evidence that they had been destroying files to avoid the terms of the Act, I should give it to him. Excuse me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I thought that that was his job. I believed that I had established enough prima facie evidence. When an Act is coming into force that requires many files to be opened and there is a pattern that shows files being destroyed steadily and then a sudden massive increase in that destruction, surely that is enough to trigger an investigation. However, he was having none of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80522-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08052282000494">By contrast, determining whether a bunch of Members of Parliament genuinely live in the houses for which they claim expenses shot to the top of the Information Commissioner&#146;s agenda. Only today, he is at the top of the news agenda&#151;it is the same man; he is doing well. I wonder what his home address is&#151;perhaps I will find out. He is initiating an investigation into how the Tory party gave names, voting intentions and so on to some media. Why does he need to investigate that? We know how it happened&#151;a massive mistake was made. All the people who received the information assured everybody that they have destroyed it. Of course, those in the Conservative party who are responsible deserve a severe reprimand for making a stupid mistake. However, why does the Information Commissioner leap on that and investigate it when there is no mystery? When something happened that genuinely mattered, he flunked the challenge. I do not hesitate to say that I have no confidence in the man as an individual and no professional confidence in him. The sooner he is brought before the House, so that he can be subject to some oversight and answer some questions, the better.</p>

Members at the House when they could send them to their home addresses? What shall we do? Are we to institute screening procedures at everyone&#146;s home? Will we save money and do away with the screening procedures here because there is no reason to keep them other than to protect the building, because  <br>

If my address were published&#151;I do not believe that that will happen for the reasons that I outlined&#151;I would arrange for all my mail, personal, abusive and professional, to be rerouted to the House of Commons to be screened before it returned to my home address.

 My hon. Friend is right. I have taken up too much of the House&#146;s time, but I want to mention a final asinine comment by the High Court. If the law was an ass, it has been downhill all the way ever since. There are conventions in the House that we do not attack the judges, but there are also conventions that they should not attack us. They started it and, as I said, I am an Old Testament character.

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08052282000503">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), who spoke with passion from personal experience in a thoughtful and thought-provoking speech. I congratulate him on that. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan), who made an interesting speech, and the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay), who has always entertained us and made us think deeply about the issues that confront us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08052282000504">I am keen to concentrate on several issues that I believe that my constituents would like raised. Through my regular surgeries, meetings and constituency visits, I am well aware of my constituents&#146; views and concerns. However, in the past couple of months, I have been able to talk to many more in canvassing and campaigning during the London elections. We heard at first hand that they feel let down by the Government in so many ways. They feel great disappointment because they are not being listened to. They believe that the Government are out of touch with and unconcerned about the suburbs&#151;my constituency is suburban&#151;and that Labour has let down the suburbs. That was highlighted on all fronts in my area of Bexley and Bromley by the election of 1 May, in which the Conservatives did particularly well and the Labour party did very badly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08052282000505">People in my area are concerned about several major issues, with crime and antisocial behaviour at the top of the list. The NHS is another issue of concern, particularly downgrades, closures and problems with local health services. Another concern is the closure of post offices and the relocation of one of our main post offices into WH Smith. People are concerned about the cost of living, such as the cost of food, which is increasing dramatically, and utility bills. Those issues are having a detrimental effect on the low-paid and on families and pensioners. Of course, taxation is also of concern. People feel that taxes have gone up, but that the standard of public services has gone down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08052282000506">Let me address crime and policing first. I pay tribute to our borough commander, Tony Dawson, who is doing a very good job of endeavouring to deal with local problems in our borough of Bexley, such as antisocial behaviour. The fear of crime is a problem, as indeed is fear of the unknown. People are frightened to go out at night because of the gangs of youths that gather; they fear that they will be intimidated, if not assaulted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08052282000507">Violence against the person has increased across London, but the most important issue is people on drink or drugs, which cause bad behaviour. I am very concerned about that. Figures show that hospital admissions linked to alcohol use have more than doubled in England since 1995, and that alcohol was the main or secondary cause of 207,800 NHS admissions in 2006-07, compared with 93,500 in 1995-96. Those statistics are frightening. I understand that there has also been a 20 per cent. rise in the number of GP prescriptions for the treatment of alcohol dependency in the past four years. The problems of alcohol and drug abuse are causing more antisocial behaviour and crime in areas such as the suburban areas of Bexley.</p>

<i> Evening Standard</i> shows the carnage that took place in Chelsea in relation to the football match in Moscow. However, there were no problems in Moscow. Does my hon. Friend believe that that might have something to do with the proper policing there and the alcohol-free zone around the stadium, which meant that fans could not get tanked up before going to the match?</p>

<p><a name="st_o238"><a name="08052282000509"><a name="80522-0012.htm_spnew4"><a name="08052282001017"><b>Mr. Evennett:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes a powerful point, with which I agree. I passionately believe that we should go back to having a police force enforcing the law, rather than a police service, which the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, seems to prefer in London. We need to look into that. I am confident that there will be a great improvement under our new Mayor of London, because he understands the issues and wants to deal with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08052282000510">I had the privilege of going into one of my wards with the safer neighbourhood team, which has been a great success. I am not here to condemn everything that the Government have done, because they have some good things&#151;just not enough. That is the problem; there has been a bit of complacency. The rolling out of neighbourhood teams and police community support officers has been a good thing. I had the privilege of going out with Ross McKibben, the sergeant of the North End safer neighbourhood team, three weeks ago to see the particular problems in his patch. He and his team have done a good job, but they are undermanned some of the time and they do not work there at weekends, which is a problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08052282000511">The team deals with difficult terrain, but it is doing a tremendous job. I met the PCSOs and the team at the Howbury centre, and we went from there to the Frobisher estate, where residents have complained about the tremendous amount of antisocial behaviour, including problems with drunkenness, drugs, vandalism and damage. Residents feel intimidated, and that is not acceptable. If they cannot live in their homes without feeling intimidated every time they go through their front doors, that is a problem. Society must deal with that problem, and the police, the Government and local authorities, working in partnership, must do more about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08052282000512">Under the Conservative Bexley council, we have had considerable success in the centre of Bexleyheath with alcohol-free zones and attempts to ensure that police are visible on the streets on Friday and Saturday nights, when such problems occur. I pay tribute to the new council leader, Teresa O&#146;Neill, and her team, which continues to work with community police and the borough commander to make sure that Bexleyheath is a much safer environment for people who want to go out on a Friday or Saturday and enjoy a meal, go to the cinema or go for a drink with friends without feeling intimidated or a problem when they come out at the end of the evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08052282000513">Some areas of my borough have improved, but there is an awfully long way to go. We ought to be making it a top priority to have a police force with officers on the beat who can catch criminals, and to have less bureaucracy and paperwork preventing the police from getting out of their police stations and doing the job that they need to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08052282000514">A second area of great concern locally is the NHS, and particularly the hospital reconfiguration that the Government are so keen on. Our local accident and  <br>

<notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2008 : Column 451</b><br>
emergency and maternity services are under threat, and there will be a downgrade at Queen Mary&#146;s hospital, Sidcup, if the Government get their way. I am worried about that because Queen Mary&#146;s is a good facility. Kate Grimes is the chief executive, and the team has turned the hospital around in so many ways, including financially. Also, hospital infections have been reduced, and the throughput of patients has been increased. I visited the accident and emergency unit at the hospital one Friday night, and I saw how dedicated and passionate its team was about serving the community. Regrettably, however, that hospital is threatened with a downgrade, because in today&#146;s society we have to merge. Queen Mary&#146;s is the only non-private finance initiative hospital in the area, so it is easier to curtail the facilities there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08052282000515">That is a worry. People are paying their taxes and they expect good local services. They do not want to have to travel long distances to get the health care that they need. The traffic in our area is often congested because of the suburban roads, which could result in lives being put at risk if the A and E unit at our hospital is closed and people had to go further afield&#151;to Lewisham or Bromley, for example, or to the Queen Elizabeth hospital at Woolwich.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08052282000516">People are really concerned about this issue, not because everyone wants their own little hospital, but because of the practical need for a facility that is accessible not only to the people needing accident and emergency facilities but to those using the maternity services. When young mothers go to have their babies and their check-ups, they want their relatives to be able to visit them easily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08052282000517">A third area of real concern is the post offices. We have raised this issue, along with that of the health service, on many occasions. Our post offices and sub-post offices are being closed, and the service is no longer there for our constituents. The Government always make excuses, but they have reduced the facilities for sub-post offices to be able to provide services, after which the sub-post offices are no longer viable. The real problem is that the Post Office does not listen. It makes decisions purely on financial grounds and then says, &#147;Take it or leave it.&#148; We recently made a good case for our Brampton road post office, which was well used and well located, yet no consideration was given to our arguments and the post office was closed, just as all the others were. That was very disappointing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08052282000518">Our main post office in Bexleyheath was closed and relocated to the first floor of WH Smith. Smith&#146;s is in the middle of the shopping centre and near the bus stop, so one might think that that was not too bad. However, the new post office was upstairs. When I visited it before the move was implemented, I pointed out that the lift was inadequate for pensioners with walking frames and for mothers with pushchairs, because it was too small. More importantly, it regularly broke down. I was pooh-poohed, and the managing director of Post Office Ltd said that there was no problem and that everything was fine. However, the lift broke down not once, not twice, but three times. Finally something is being done about it, but why on earth could not the Post Office and WH Smith have done something before the relocation took place, rather than afterwards? That shows a lack of care and consideration for our constituents and for the services that they need and value. That is  all wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08052282000519">Nobody seems to listen. I know that the Deputy Leader of the House is a very nice person, but she does not listen because she is part of a Government who do not listen. She personally might listen, but then she and her colleagues just argue back at us. Even some hon. Members on her own side supported us when we had a debate on post office closures, which we only just lost. The Government&#146;s own Back Benchers felt exactly the same way as we did. Yet it made no difference and the Government steam-rollers on. I hope that they will get the result that they deserve at Crewe later today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08052282000522">I want also to deal with the whole question of the cost of living. The Government are always on about the consumer price index; indeed, the Prime Minister was an expert at doing that when he was Chancellor. That was the great thing, but it is meaningless for most of our constituents, because many of their weekly costs are not necessarily included in that index, whereas the retail price index was slightly more sensible. We still hear from the Government that inflation is at a certain figure, but for pensioners, those on low pay and my constituents who are not wealthy, the cost of living is much greater than the Government will accept or admit. That is disappointing, as the cost of bread and other foodstuffs has increased quite dramatically. That is why the Government are so unpopular; they do  not listen, and they are in an unfortunate position&#151; local people know that, and they voted accordingly on 1 May.</p>

We have one mainline service going through to London Bridge and the City. There are three lines, but we do not have an underground. From January this year, the cost of travelling from Bexleyheath to London has gone up by 13.5 per cent. No one&#146;s pay has risen by that amount, but taxes, the cost of living and the cost of transport continue to go up. There is disillusionment. The people in my area want someone to listen, and they want a Government who will listen.</p>

residents who have a problem with youths who drink alcohol in the local park where children often play. That affects the quality of life of people living around the area. Alcohol-free zones may well be the answer. Such tools need to be used more effectively, particularly where trouble takes place outside football grounds, for example, often even when there is no football match going on. The antics that some of these yobs got up to last night were absolutely amazing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08052282000526">My hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford mentioned the discontent of different groups of people and the effect of the abolition of the 10p tax rate on the poorest sections of society. A friend of mine phoned me up recently, asking me whether I had heard the Chancellor on the &#147;Today&#148; programme trying to justify what had gone on with the 10p rate, saying that everything would be okay as &#163;120 would be given out to the poorest people. I said that I had heard that. My friend said that the Chancellor attempted to justify why the cost would be greater than originally stated by the Prime Minister&#151;less than &#163;1 billion, when it is now &#163;2.7 billion. The Chancellor said that it was necessary because of food and fuel inflation, which meant that people needed help straight away. My friend said, &#147;Do you realise, Nigel, that the only people who are going to miss out on the food and fuel inflation money are the poorer sections of society?&#148; That was because the &#163;120 simply takes those people back to where they were before the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80522-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08052282000527">The people who benefited from the abolition of the 10p rate and the altering of the 22p rate down to 20p will get an additional &#163;120. They benefited from the Budget and will also get &#163;120 to help them with food and fuel. The poorest sections of society will get not a penny to help them with the inflation on food and fuel that we all see when we go to our supermarkets and petrol stations. It is yet another reason why people get extremely frustrated by the Government not listening and not learning.</p>

He was a former secretary of the GMB and a former professional football player for Hartlepool United and honorary president of the club. I met Tom on several occasions. If ever someone was asked to describe Lord Burlison, they would say that he was hard-working, dedicated, committed and unassuming. That was another thing about Lord Burlison. When I first met him, I referred to him as Lord Burlison. He stopped me, grabbed me by the arm, and said, &#147;Call me Tom.&#148; That was Tom Burlison for you. I know that he will be missed every day by his family, but it will be more poignant when his son, Rob, who recently got engaged, gets married. Everyone who was associated with Tom will miss him too.

We know that, as a result of the huge increase in oil prices recently, he has a windfall of more than &#163;500 million to date. It has been estimated that if the Chancellor were to postpone the 2p increase further, it would cost him roughly &#163;500 million. It is not as if the idea is uncosted.

I had the privilege of going to Dunsop Bridge in my constituency several years ago when BT unveiled the 100,000th public telephone box in the country. It was opened by Sir Ranulph Fiennes. BT chose Dunsop Bridge because Ordnance Survey says that that is where the centre of the United Kingdom would be if we squashed it all together. All the local school children were there, and they were excited by the opening of the phone box.</p>

The life of the batteries is still relatively short, and if a battery is dead, what are we supposed to do in an emergency? It is important that we get at least a proper network of public telephone boxes even if they do not make money. BT has a good community programme and supports a lot of community projects. I would have thought that that would be a tremendous community project. I would not mind if it put in the boxes a message saying: &#147;This telephone box does not make any money. It is part of a community project, sponsored by British Telecom.&#148; I hope that BT will think again, look at the network that currently exists and not take these emergency facilities away from our country.</p>

I suspect that had we held the debate in Crewe and Nantwich, more Members would have been present. However, I want to raise one more issue. We have discussed a good many taxes recently, but I want to talk about aviation duty, with which the Government propose to replace air passenger duty. It will be calculated on the basis of a combination of an aircraft&#146;s maximum take-off weight and a distance factor determined by the geographical band to which the aircraft flies. Aircraft weighing more than 5.7 tonnes and freight-only flights will be subject to the duty. It will be the first time that freight-only flights have been taxed. The duty will be applied to the aeroplane regardless of the type or number of passengers. Aeroplanes carry out phantom flights now and again, and that clearly needs to be addressed.</p>

not quite realise the consequences of the abolition of the 10p rate and the alterations higher up the band scale. I am sure that he did not sit down with his Cabinet colleagues and ask them &#147;How can we hit the poorest hardest?&#148;, although had he done so, he would of course have ended up with the system that he introduced. What resulted from it was an unintended consequence, however; let us be generous to him in that regard at least.</p>

While taxing freight aircraft may seem attractive from an environmental point of view, it seems likely that the economic consequences will be entirely disproportionate. We know why the Government are doing this&#151;it is for environmental reasons&#151;but the unintended consequences will hit the British economy. A balance needs to be struck.</p>

From that meeting I gained the distinct impression that aviation duty would distort the international level playing field for UK freight. It is a logical conclusion that if freight departing from the UK attracts a tax that does not apply anywhere else in the world, businesses will go elsewhere. Manchester Airports Group estimates that aviation duty would damage UK competitiveness on a third of goods traded.</p>

It has been estimated that that would result in thousands more  <br>

lorries on the roads, transporting goods that would otherwise have gone to a regional airport somewhere or other. At Manchester airport alone, at least 1,144 scheduled cargo flights would become commercially unviable or at risk. That equates to about 220 jobs in the north-west region. I have also been informed that for East Midlands airport, which is the UK&#146;s largest pure freight hub, that figure is likely to exceed 850 jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08052282000544">It must be considered that aviation duty has the potential to seriously undermine long-haul development from UK airports, because both freight customers and airlines can reduce their tax liability by taking an indirect route via another hub. That is exactly what air passengers would do, too. Whereas now many people would fly directly from a regional airport to, for instance, the United States of America or the middle east, if the duty for long-haul flights becomes prohibitive they will look to go via Schiphol or Charles de Gaulle to connect with Air France or KLM to fly the long-haul sector from there as that would reduce their tax liability. For a family of four, that liability could amount to a lot of money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para16"><a name="08052282000545">I am asking the Government to take on board the unintended consequences of this tax. Manchester airport also says that it will be turned into an enormous tax collector for the Government. Current air passenger duty costs are about 9p per &#163;100 collected. Manchester airport estimates that with the new tax it would have to collect about &#163;400 million a year on behalf of the Government and that it would cost it many thousands of pounds to start to collect that money. There could be a huge cost to the regional airports, and that could even damage the prospects of remaining in business for those that are marginally viable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para17"><a name="08052282000546">I also want the Minister to take the message back to the Secretary of State for Transport and the Chancellor that another unintended consequence could be that the new tax raises less money than the current air passenger duty as customers&#151;both passengers and freight&#151;will more intelligently work out how to complete their journeys. I understand the environmental reasons why the Government want to introduce this tax, but it is logical if we are to go down this route not to do it alone. Neighbouring countries would benefit from that&#151;as indeed would the rest of the world, because if we start on this course alone the problems will start shifting around the world and people across the globe will act intelligently and start making different choices in air travel. We need to get everyone sitting down to work out how to have a proper aviation fuel tax that everybody throughout the world will implement, so that we can encourage airlines to be more fuel-efficient and do away with all the phantom flights made just to keep slots open. We would also not be penalising the freight industry in this country; doing so would lead to the loss of a number of jobs, as they would simply move to Holland and France.</p>

The consultation has just finished, and the Treasury and the Secretary of State for Transport should sit down and take a look at all the representations. Would it not be far better if they were more intelligent about this and came up with a policy that everybody could endorse and that would not have all these unintended consequences, rather than not listen, not learn, introduce this tax, lose all the jobs, lose a lot of taxation as well&#151;they would not  <br>

 I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate. I want to raise concerns about management practices at Manchester College of Arts and Technology&#151;better known as MANCAT&#151;and in particular to highlight concerns raised by former members of staff. MANCAT is one of the country&#146;s largest further education colleges, and from August it will merge with its neighbour, City College Manchester, and become even bigger. I am concerned that investigations into management practices at MANCAT have been hampered because MANCAT destroyed auditable documents&#151;the National Audit Office is aware of that&#151;and also reached financial settlements with certain ex-members of staff on condition that those former employees signed confidentiality clauses in their settlement agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08052282000549">I have seen several documents, including some in which staff stated that they were under pressure from the college to falsify student attendance registers and other funding-related forms so that MANCAT could claim extra public money from the Learning and Skills Council. One key witness was planning to explain the extent of malpractice at an employment tribunal where she had been in the process of seeking redress for constructive dismissal. Instead, she was offered a financial settlement, to which she ultimately agreed, that was conditional on her signing a gagging clause. She was an administration manager who had blown the whistle in a letter to MANCAT&#146;s governing body. In that letter, she described in detail the active role she had played over three years in systematically falsifying paperwork at the request of MANCAT&#146;s senior management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08052282000550">I am aware of three investigations into MANCAT&#146;s affairs, including ones by the National Audit Office and the Learning and Skills Council. None uncovered evidence of systematic fraud. But while the college denies any wrongdoing, it is hard to see how the public can have confidence in such exercises when potentially crucial paperwork has been destroyed and important witnesses have been gagged through confidentiality clauses in settlement agreements paid for with public money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08052282000551">I fear that such gagging clauses are an all too common feature of employment arrangements when things go wrong. It is something that the Public Accounts Committee has deplored. We are talking about public money and it should not be used to shut people up. Moreover, I question whether such confidentiality clauses are legally valid if fraud, which is a criminal matter, has been alleged. Under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, in the provision covering contractual duties of confidentiality, it states at section 43J:</p>
<a name="80522-0013.htm_brev4"><a name="08052282000721"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Any provision in an agreement to which this section applies is void in so far as it purports to preclude the worker from making a protected disclosure.&#148;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08052282000555">This would appear to be untrue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para26"><a name="08052282000556">The National Audit Office was aware that records had been destroyed, as I discovered on raising the matter in a session of the Public Accounts Committee on 18 April 2007, when the value for money director covering education and skills, Ms Angela Hands, said:</p>
<a name="80522-0013.htm_brev8"><a name="08052282000725"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;They were destroying records, and I would have to check with the Learning and Skills Council, but it was quite swift, the destruction of records. I think it was within a year.&#148;</p>

</ul><a name="08052282000684">
<p>At one stage MANCAT&#146;s external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, were called in after another member of staff, a lecturer at the college, raised concerns about the manipulation of registers in the ESOL department&#151;English for speakers of other languages&#151;which teaches basic English to foreigners. He was sacked by MANCAT, but after starting employment tribunal proceedings for unfair dismissal was paid off on condition that he signed a confidentiality agreement, which he did. PricewaterhouseCoopers discovered something that greatly disturbs me, which was that MANCAT&#146;s funding claim to the Learning and Skills Council was based on a centralised set of student registers that had not been produced or signed by tutors. Someone else had created them. And in no fewer than 36 out of 39 cases which PricewaterhouseCoopers examined in the ESOL department, more attendances were recorded on this secondary system than on the originals. It would defy all rules of probability if that were simply down to pure inaccuracy. It sounds much more likely to have been deliberate manipulation to achieve an apparently higher attendance than took place.</p>
<a name="08052282000685">
<p>In all, the PricewaterhouseCoopers review of documents found 304 discrepancies. Although PricewaterhouseCoopers chose its words carefully, saying that</p>
<a name="80522-0013.htm_brev10"><a name="08052282000727"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the discrepancies do not provide evidence of systematic register manipulation for the purpose of inflating the college funding claim&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para28"><a name="08052282000558">none the less, it became clear that PricewaterhouseCoopers&#146;s dealings with the college were extremely fraught. Indeed, six months later the company resigned as external auditors to MANCAT. The PWC partner involved, Lee Childs, wrote to MANCAT&#146;s principal, Peter Tavernor, telling of strained relationships with senior staff, and stating that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para29"><a name="08052282000559">I have already raised these matters verbally with the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s chief executive, Mark Haysom. In my view, the Learning and Skills Council and, indeed, the National Audit Office should examine the matter further. They should not be content not to challenge gagging orders in the face of such serious allegations. I also suggest that they have taken too lenient a view of the destruction of auditable documents. They could be far more rigorous in examining the affairs of MANCAT. It is important that public bodies do not believe that such behaviour will go unexamined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para30"><a name="08052282000560">In November 2003, the Learning and Skills Council had the opportunity to interview the principal witness after she first blew the whistle in her letter to governors. It knew of its contents long before she was paid off and gagged. Moreover, further details could still be tracked down by the Learning and Skills Council in a detailed statement that would have comprised her evidence at the employment tribunal, much of it corroborated in a statement from an ex-colleague.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para31"><a name="08052282000561">Interestingly, the chairman of MANCAT&#146;s audit committee would have liked an external inquiry but he was overruled by the principal of the college and resigned as a result. It is unfortunate that the Learning and Skills Council allowed MANCAT to conduct an internal inquiry into such serious matters, bearing in mind that senior management were said to be involved. During the inquiry process, the whistleblower said she had learned that the original handwritten documents that she had used to create the falsified records had been &#147;lost&#148;. However, I have seen copies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para32"><a name="08052282000562">Among the documents that I showed Mr. Haysom were a bundle of allegedly falsified student registers that appear to confirm the extent of the operation. They were all in one person&#146;s handwriting and covered a broad sweep of curriculum areas. That suggests that fraud was taking place on an industrial scale. Despite previous inquiries, I believe the public interest has been denied the rigorous investigation at MANCAT that it deserves. The events remain highly relevant both because of their seriousness and because the college&#146;s senior management team has remained more or less intact. Moreover, Peter Tavernor has recently been appointed principal of the new merged super college in Manchester, which will have an annual budget of about &#163;130 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para33"><a name="08052282000563">I am concerned about the ways in which MANCAT has handled taxpayers&#146; money in the past. It would be in the public interest to know how much MANCAT has spent on legal costs and financial settlements involving all the ex-staff who made allegations of irregularities. Moreover, it would be helpful to know what MANCAT&#146;s bill was for legal fees and costs in another hugely expensive employment tribunal that stretched over 16 days. That case, which MANCAT lost, involved all five staff of the trade union education department, whom the tribunal ruled were unfairly dismissed for union activity. In my view, running a college on such costly and adversarial lines hardly equates to good value for money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80522-0013.htm_para34"><a name="08052282000564">In conclusion, I believe there should be a thorough investigation of what appears to be institutionalised fraud at Manchester College of Arts and Technology.</p>

 I thank all the speakers who have taken part in today&#146;s debate. There were not as many Members as there normally are in debates on the Adjournment, but I suspect that that is probably something to do with the fact that some of our colleagues are in Crewe and Nantwich. That fact did not detract in any way from the quality of the speakers, nor from the variety of subjects that were covered.</p>

He also referred to the solicitors&#146; firm Thompsons, and I wish him well in his attempts to get to the bottom of what is an ongoing problem. I suggest that he might consider making a complaint about Thompsons to the Law Society, as it has a special division that deals with concerns about legal practices.</p>

I also hope that she will pass on to that Department his very worrying remarks about the drugs used on vulnerable adults and senior citizens.</p>

The fact that he raised some very interesting points was reflected in the number of interventions that he took. At one point, the number of interventions was so vast that I thought that this debate would continue to the usual 6 o&#146;clock deadline, but fortunately they ceased after a while. May I also commend the hon. Gentleman for his excellent good sense in not supporting the proposal on 42 days&#146; detention about which the Government are bullying everyone else in his party to accept?

I agree with him that, with our hon.

He is certainly making a start by banning alcohol on public transport in London. That is eminently sensible, and it seems absurd that it was not done many years before. My hon.

 My hon. Friend the Whip assures me that the Whips Office has nothing to do with my hon. Friend&#146;s disappearance this afternoon. I am disappointed that he is not here because he linked his concerns about Parliament&#146;s oversight of the security and intelligence services to his concerns about 42 days&#146; detention. I hope very much that when he reads what I have to say in <i> Hansard</i>, he will be persuaded of why he should vote with the Government on 42 days. He may not be aware of the fact that the Lord Chancellor has made proposals in the context of the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill to make a radical change to the way that the security services are overseen and to enable the statutory Committee that does such work to operate differently. In particular, the names submitted in the nomination process will come before the House, before the Prime Minister makes the appointments. That is a significant improvement.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister, who is delivering her speech with great good humour. First, I do not think the Conservative party opposed the winter fuel allowance. Secondly, the point is that the policies are not working. That is why we criticise them. There is increasing fuel poverty, as we heard at DBERR questions only this morning, and immigration is patently out of control, as even the Labour party&#146;s supporters are saying.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is not correct about fuel poverty. There is less fuel poverty now than there was 10 years ago because the Government introduced the winter fuel allowance and lifted 1 million pensioners out of pensioner poverty. That was the group most prone to suffer from fuel poverty. Moreover, the Warm Front programme and the programmes for insulation, new boilers and new radiators are running at an investment rate of &#163;600 million a year. That means that not only are we lifting people out of fuel poverty and saving on their fuel bills, but we are making a sensible contribution to combating climate change.</p>

 I am sorry to take up more time, but a number of hon.

If some bright spark were to collate the constituency addresses, whether as a result of the freedom of information request or any other investigations that they may see fit to pursue, we would be advertising the fact that lots of properties are empty at certain times of the week.

In February, we conducted a national confiscation campaign, which confiscated 40,000 pints of alcohol. However, the hon.

Gentleman made a series of remarks about the cost of living, the interaction between food and fuel prices and the tax system. The tax system is important and concerns all our constituents, so I want to address it thoroughly and seriously. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced changes to the tax system 15 months ago in order to simplify the system. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the basic tax rate is now lower than it has been for 75 years. The offsetting measures that were introduced at that time involved the tax credit system for families with children and raising the personal tax allowance for old-age pensioners. As he knows, that left a large number of people on low incomes who did not fall into either of those categories as losers. As he has said, in the intervening period food and fuel prices have increased. That means  <br>

that the impact of those changes is different from what could have been foreseen 15 months ago, when the decision was taken. The final package that the Chancellor has announced to raise personal allowances for everybody on the basic tax rate was put together because everybody is under this pressure from food and fuel prices.</p>

I shall write to him, however, because, interestingly, the numbers show that the level of revenue coming to the Exchequer from petrol tax is, contrary to popular belief, lower than it was 10 years ago. Prices are increasing not because the Exchequer is, in some sense, being greedy&#151;that is often the characterisation&#151;but because world prices in the oil markets and the international commodity markets are increasing.</p>

It would be easier for us to tackle the issue if the telephone industry were in public ownership, but of course, he belongs to the party that privatised that industry. He also rightly said it is important that we structure aviation duty properly and take an international approach to it. That is why this Government have been very energetic in trying to get aviation and shipping into the EU&#146;s trading system, and those negotiations are ongoing.</p>

He and I served together on the Public Bill Committee that considered what became the Legal Services Act 2007, which was introduced to address the problem. It will address many of the issues that he has so energetically been raising over a long period. It is because this Government are concerned about miners who suffer from respiratory and vibration problems resulting from their work in the pits that &#163;3.8 billion has been spent on miners&#146; compensation.

Friend the Member for North Durham also talked about the development of the economy in the north-east; I agree with him. Sometimes it is difficult for people to see what is going on in the economy. The pattern at the moment is that jobs in large manufacturing companies are disappearing; obviously, that is serious for the people who work in those factories. However, at the same time, other investments, made by small and medium-sized firms, are coming in. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08052282000618">The other significant point is that, as the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform was saying earlier, we now have record levels of inward investment in this country because our business climate is so good for investment from overseas. The County Durham Development Company, for example, shows that in the past decade the county has benefited from 181 separate inward investment projects with employers from the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Ireland, Iceland and Germany. All have put money in, and that has created 6,000 jobs over the same period. I wanted to reinforce my hon. Friend&#146;s points.</p>

 I am pleased to have secured this important debate on the tragic events that took place off the coast of the Isle of Man on 3 and 4 June 2005 and led to the death of Mark Petre, the son of my constituents Geoff and Irene Petre, and of Keith Rice, the son of Brian and Pam Rice. I would like to use this opportunity to extend our condolences to the Petres and the Rices and their families for events that I am sure have had a permanent and distressing impact on their lives. Both men were on the Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel Orangeleaf, and I would like to set out the chronology of the events on those ill-fated days. Before I do, however, I would like to confirm that my office has spoken to the coroner&#146;s office in the Isle of Man, which will be dealing with this case in two days&#146; time. It is comfortable with the debate, providing that I do not insult the coroner or the Isle of Man, and I intend doing neither. Therefore, the coroner has no issue with us debating the matter fully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08052282000624">I understand that the Isle of Man coroner has the power to issue a certificate of finding on Saturday, which is the certificate that the coroner issues following an inquest. That certificate is then forwarded to the registrar of births, deaths and marriages so that it can issue a death certificate and register the death. I understand that once the death certificate has been issued, there is no reason why the Petres cannot claim any death benefit to which they may be entitled following the death of their son. I hope that the Minister can confirm that my understanding is correct, and that they do not face another four years of waiting for the death to be confirmed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08052282000625">Returning to the chronology, RFA Orangeleaf was anchored off Douglas in the Isle of Man in the afternoon of Friday 3 June 2005 for two days&#146; rest and recreation prior to a naval exercise beginning on 6 June 2005. The ship was placed under in-port rules. Shore leave was granted to 21 of the ship&#146;s personnel; they went ashore on the liberty boat from the Orangeleaf at 1800 hours, and returned to the ship by the liberty boat at 2300 hours when shore leave expired. All personnel were accounted for by several of the ship&#146;s officers as they came aboard the Orangeleaf. It is confirmed that alcohol had been consumed by many of the men but all were assessed by the officers in charge as being capable, and none exhibited any sign of concern. The chief officer recalled that Mark Petre and Keith Rice were both coherent and not stumbling around or the worse for alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08052282000626">It is confirmed that, on their return on board, several of the crew, including Mark Petre and his colleague Keith Rice, obtained&#151;in breach of the rules&#151;a final drink from the crew bar because there was an unofficial spare key in circulation that allowed access to bar. Games in the bar area followed, and a wager was made. A third crew member, Ryan Poulton, was also involved, and all three men climbed through the emergency escape porthole on to the port side of No. 1 deck and sat talking on the safety rail under No. 2 lifeboat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para15"><a name="08052282000627">It is suggested that Mr. Rice then challenged Mr. Petre and Mr. Poulton to jump into the sea from under No. 2 lifeboat, swim around the stern and climb back on board via the pontoon on the starboard side. That challenge was declined by both men. At 0014 hours&#151;it was now 4 June 2005&#151;Mr. Poulton received a call on his mobile phone and returned to his cabin to continue that conversation in private, and then fell asleep there. That was the last reported sighting of Mr. Petre and Mr. Rice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para16"><a name="08052282000628">Later that morning, the night watchman checked the ship&#146;s anchor. On his way back to the bridge, he noticed a pair of shoes under No. 1 lifeboat on the starboard side. He reported his finding to the officer of the watch, who advised the chief officer, and an investigation was then started. The captain was contacted at 0110 hours, and at 0156 hours, the ship was called to emergency stations to carry out a full muster of the ship&#146;s company. That muster was completed at 0215 hours and it became apparent that Mr. Petre and Mr. Rice were missing. The chief officer ordered an immediate, complete ship search. A few minutes later, at 0219 hours, the chief officer contacted Douglas harbour authorities and informed them of the possibility that two crew members were missing. The ship search was complete by 0230 hours. The Douglas lifeboat was launched to make an initial search at 0238 hours and, at 0330 hours, a helicopter fitted with infrared search cameras arrived from RAF Valley. A second lifeboat from Port St. Mary was on the scene from sunrise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para17"><a name="08052282000629">The air search was called off at 0804 hours because of awareness about how long people can survive in water. The surface search was suspended at 1206 hours. The coastline was searched using dog teams until 2000 hours and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Fort Austin was anchored off Douglas at 0750 hours and continued to search the inshore waters with her own lifeboat until late afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08052282000630">Mr. Rice&#146;s body was found on 27 June 2005. Until recently, no trace had been found of Mr. Petre. However, a fishing boat recovered a bone, which was subsequently DNA tested and confirmation was received of a match to Mr. Petre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para19"><a name="08052282000631">Two inquests have already taken place into the death of Mr. Rice because his body was found. One took place on 21 April 2006 on the Isle of Man and, to conform with English legal requirements, a further one took place on 30 June 2006 in the north-east Kent district coroner&#146;s court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para20"><a name="08052282000632">It is important to state that, contrary to newspaper reports, the inquests found no evidence that all-day drinking had taken place or that the men had tried to swim round the Orangeleaf. Despite what the newspapers wrote, no evidence of drinking was found. The exact circumstances of the deaths remain unknown.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08052282000633">The Petres were notified on 24 August 2005 that a board of inquiry report had been completed into their son&#146;s death. I tried to secure a copy of that report for the debate, but I was informed:</p>

safety awareness. That recommendation has been implemented, but in what way? I should like an answer from the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para30"><a name="08052282000642">The third recommendation, which related to access to alcohol outside of bar hours, stated:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para32"><a name="08052282000644">On the fourth recommendation, there has been a minor revision to the RFA drug and alcohol policy because it did not cover the unspecified case of a ship at anchor.

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80522-0015.htm_para33"><a name="08052282000645">The fifth recommendation was that command teams should take cognisance of circumstances in which large numbers of crew members have been drinking alcohol ashore and should make such arrangements as they  feel necessary to provide additional supervision and encouragement to avoid inappropriate behaviour when crew members return. Again, that recommendation has been implemented, but in what way? I am sure that command teams are taking cognisance of circumstances in which large numbers of crew members have been on shore leave, but what are they doing as a result of that cognisance? How are they doing things differently?</p>

being aware that such instructions existed. Will the Minister tell me whether that is covered in that recommendation, or whether more work needs to be done on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80522-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08052282000651">The third suggestion involves increasing the frequency of night deck patrols and/or the possibility of making more or better use of CCTV on deck areas at night, or in circumstances in which a significant number of a ship&#146;s personnel have been on shore leave and there might be a need for additional care. Again, that might be an issue that has been addressed by the fifth recommendation, but I would ask the Minister to confirm&#151;in writing, if necessary&#151;whether it was considered and deemed to be a matter that the Government wanted to pursue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80522-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08052282000652">A fourth suggestion was that a crash boat crew should be rested, alcohol free and on standby at all times, and that those boats should be regularly maintained and properly equipped with high-powered, working searchlights. The final suggestion was that the bar keys should be held by an officer, rather than by a rating bar committee member. Again, it is possible that that issue has already been addressed in the third and fourth recommendations. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to these additional proposals&#151;if not now, perhaps later and in writing. I am sure that he will make it clear when he responds to the debate whether that will be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80522-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08052282000653">We are in the fortunate position today of having sufficient time for the Minister to respond in detail to all the points that have been raised. Most, if not all, of those points were raised with him in advance, to give him time to consider his response. Having sufficient time to address serious matters is a luxury that we do not often have in this place. Also, we have confirmation from the coroner on the Isle of Man that there is no reason for the concerns that I have highlighted today not to receive a full and open hearing. I hope, therefore, that when the Minister responds, he will be able to respond fully to all the points that I have raised, and will not feel in any way constrained.</p>

However, a clear indication from the Government that they will implement policies to reduce the likelihood of other families going through the same trauma will go some way towards alleviating their pain. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us such an indication today.</p>

Gentleman has already said, but it is important for a Minister speaking for the Government to do so. As we know, Royal Fleet Auxiliary Orangeleaf was anchored off Douglas, Isle of Man, on the afternoon of 3 June 2005. The commanding officer planned to allow two days of rest and recreation prior to participating in an exercise. As we now know, an incident-free time ashore took place that evening and all the ship&#146;s company had returned to the ship by the time of the last liberty boat at 11.30 that night. Several members of the crew gathered in the recreation area and several dares and wagers were made. Seaman grade 1A, Mark Petre, and leading hand cook, Keith Rice, remained behind in the bar while the rest of the ship&#146;s company retired.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80522-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08052282000658">As the hon. Gentleman knows, during routine rounds, Petre and Rice were subsequently found to be missing. An area search operation with the Liverpool coast guard co-ordinating air and surface assets failed to locate the two men. A body was recovered a few weeks later and was identified as that of Keith Rice, but Mark Petre&#146;s body has not been recovered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80522-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08052282000659">A board of inquiry was convened on 8 June 2005, five days after the event. The president was Captain I. E. Johnson, RFA, assisted by a Royal Navy commander and a civil servant. It reported one month later on 8 July 2005. The board&#146;s primary conclusion was that this was a tragic accident, the balance of probability suggesting that the two were lost, presumed drowned, following a dare to swim around the ship. A copy of the report was given to the Petre and Rice families in August 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80522-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08052282000660">As has already been mentioned, following a written question from the hon. Gentleman, the then Minister of State for the Armed Forces, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr. Ingram), reported to the House on 2 May 2007 that the seven recommendations made by the board had been adopted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80522-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08052282000661">The hon. Gentleman asked specifically about health and safety issues. Of course, the reason why the board of inquiry was established was to ensure that we learned whatever lessons there were. The report included, for example, the recommendation that command teams should make arrangements as they feel necessary to provide additional supervision when large numbers of crew members have been consuming alcohol ashore. As I have said, all the board&#146;s recommendations were accepted in full.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80522-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08052282000662">Although Mark Petre&#146;s body has never been recovered, a fishing boat from Portavogie, Northern Ireland, recently recovered a human bone from the Irish sea, which subsequent DNA testing confirmed to be Mark Petre&#146;s. As a result of that identification, Her Majesty&#146;s Attorney-General, Isle of Man, wrote to the Isle of Man coroner, directing him to hold an inquest, which will take place in Douglas court house this Saturday, 24 May. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand that it would be wrong for me to anticipate the outcome, but I hope that it will enable the coroner formally to confirm the death of Mark Petre and the likely circumstances surrounding this tragic event. The coroner&#146;s certificate of findings will allow the death to be registered formally and a death certificate to be issued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80522-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08052282000663">The hon. Gentleman made specific points about the payment of death benefit retrospectively. Death benefit is a lump sum repaid on presentation of the death certificate. It will not be retrospective, but will be paid to the death benefit nominee, Mark Petre&#146;s father, Mr. Geoffrey Petre. I recognise the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns about issues surrounding the death certificate, which he has made clear previously. The matter has also been the subject of correspondence with the national secretary of the Prospect trade union. The decision not to pay death benefit in the absence of a death certificate was endorsed on appeal, but as I have indicated, I would hope that this Saturday&#146;s inquest will enable us to resolve the issue very shortly.</p>

A similar trophy in memory of Keith Rice is issued annually to the best RFA steward trainee. Mr. and Mrs. Petre made the inaugural presentation of the Petre award on 24 November 2006. Those prizes recognise achievement among trainees, but also serve to remind all RFA seafarers of the many dangers of the sea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80522-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08052282000666">The hon. Gentleman asked a number of questions. I can go into them in a bit more detail because we have enough time, although I apologise if I cannot answer them all.</p>

 I did not necessarily expect the Minister to answer all those questions today. Unfortunately, I am familiar with the way in which Adjournment debates work and Members raising a host of issues to which there is often no feedback. Can I secure an undertaking from him that his staff will go through my speech, pick up the specific questions that I have asked and respond in writing?</p>

 I am sorry if that has happened to the hon. Gentleman, but that is not how I work. I can assure him, as I think my record demonstrates, that I respond to Members on any points that I have not been able to deal with. However, in the time available I can go through a number of the issues raised, but I will come back to him in the near future to deal with anything that I do not answer or which he mentions in any supplementary questions he might have.</p>

The inherent dangers of a man overboard incident should remain the subject of education and safety awareness. That is ongoing, with regular man overboard drills, and exercises conducted as part of a larger continuing training programme. The risk of falling overboard is one of the many risks associated with going to sea and is covered by a comprehensive health and safety regime.</p>

Instructions are in place and are published in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary regulatory document BR875 for the control of ships&#146; bars and alcohol consumption limits both in port and at sea. For ships at anchor, the commanding officer has the discretion, as captain of the vessel, to make a decision to apply the most appropriate rule&#151;ship in port or ship at sea&#151;taking into account all circumstances, for example the prevailing weather conditions.

On the need for written instructions for the duty officer regarding the welfare of personnel returning from shore leave, the duties and responsibilities of the duty officer are contained in document BR875, volume 3.

<a name="80522-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="08052282000743"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Raucous Behaviour on the part of any person is to be tactfully and firmly discouraged, especially at or near the gangway...the Officer of the Day...informs the Duty Senior Officer of any person who, in his/her opinion, is suspected of being drunk or a danger to themselves or others.

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80522-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08052282000675">The point was also made about the need for a definitive assessment of the degree of intoxication. Each ship has at least one evidential breath analyser, and each RFA vessel carries a number of on-board trained operators including duty officers. The RFA operates a drug and alcohol policy, and should a duty officer or anyone else believe that an individual is in breach of the regulation, the person concerned will be subject to an evidential breath analysis. It would be impractical to breath-test everyone returning on board.</p>
