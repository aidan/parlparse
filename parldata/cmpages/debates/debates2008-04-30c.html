 As I made clear, a range of different people from a range of different parties have previously argued the case for biofuels, but it is right to recognise that a range of different causes are affecting the rise in food prices. There has been a drought in Australia, which has significantly affected agricultural production; there is, of course, concern about biofuels; there is a rise in commodity prices, not least in the cost of petroleum, which has contributed to a rise in input costs such as fertiliser; and consideration needs to be given to the operation of the agricultural market. That is why we have continued to argue the case for common agricultural policy reform and why our own Prime Minister made clear to G8 leaders the need for a co-ordinated international response.</p>

 There appears to be conflicting evidence as to whether the immediate challenge that we face is a function of sufficient levels of food but inadequacy of distribution through the market, or a global deficit in food production. That is why we need to consider the approach both of the UK Government and of the European Union, while addressing the immediate humanitarian need and raising levels of agricultural production elsewhere in the world, particularly in Africa, where we have seen a decline in agricultural productivity in recent decades, in sharp contrast to countries such as India where we have seen a significant uplift.</p>

 As I have said, I expect the Gallagher review to examine precisely those issues in trying to discern the contribution of biofuels to sustainability, or to a lack of sustainability. A range of subsidies has been introduced by a range of countries for different reasons to support biofuel production. Research is important to our understanding of the challenge of sustainability, but, as our Prime Minister pointed out in his letter, we also need a co-ordinated international response to ensure that the dialogue is not limited to the United Kingdom but takes place in the other countries that are producing biofuels.</p>

 What my hon. Friend says is right. Educating girls is one of the best investments that a country can make to further its social and economic development and to improve health. We know that women who have been to school have fewer children, which reduces the risks to them of childbirth and makes it more likely that they will be able to access the care that they need. In addition, their children are healthier; for example, they are 50 per cent. more likely to be immunised. I can therefore confirm to my hon. Friend that although we are making very good progress in getting girls into school, we will be accelerating that work through the call to action and the United Nations-hosted meeting in September.

 Progress is being made in the international effort to tackle HIV and AIDS. There has, for example, been a significant scaling up in the level of financial assistance to tackle the epidemic, and the number of people receiving antiretroviral treatment in poor countries has risen from 400,000 to more than 2 million. There is, however, a lot more to do.</p>

 Will the Minister take this opportunity to distance himself from the more weird and wacky groups that are suggesting that abstinence is the only way to combat HIV/AIDS in parts of the world? Will he also take the opportunity to tell the House that as many moneys will go via voluntary organisations and non-governmental organisations as will go through some of the dubious central Governments who operate in the areas most afflicted by HIV/AIDS?</p>

 I can confirm to my hon. Friend that we do not support abstinence-only programmes for HIV prevention, because none of the available evidence suggests that such programmes are an effective strategy for HIV prevention. He raised a point about the valuable contribution that voluntary sector organisations make. I have had the privilege of seeing some of the work that Christian Aid supports in southern Africa, so I take his point about the need for us to continue to work with the voluntary sector. I hope that he will recognise that where we can have confidence in the commitment of Governments to preventing HIV and AIDS, we should continue to help them scale up their ability to tackle AIDS in their countries.</p>

 The reason why the strategy is forthcoming is that there is still work to do on its preparation, so I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a preview of what it will contain. One of the reasons why we included specific targets when we published our previous AIDS strategy in July 2004 was to generate significant new political momentum behind the effort to fight AIDS in general and the AIDS orphans crisis. I hope that he will recognise, from the research that he has done, that political momentum behind the fight against AIDS has increased significantly and that much greater effort is being put into tackling the specific problems faced by AIDS orphans.</p>

We cannot fight AIDS without more health workers&#151;more doctors and more nurses&#151;in-country, and we cannot tackle infant and child mortality without there being more health workers in place.

 We will put this before the House. If I may say so, the head of the Metropolitan police also has some idea of the sophisticated investigations involved. The independent reviewer has been examining all the cases and he is convinced of the need to go beyond 28 days. The Home Affairs Committee looked at the matter and said that there may be a case for going beyond 28 days. Equally, at the same time, the Conservative party, Liberty and the Liberal party have agreed that there might be a case, and they want to trigger the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. If there is a case that some instances will involve going beyond 28 days, surely the right thing for a Government to do is to respect the civil liberties of the individual by avoiding arbitrary treatment, but to take the power that could be triggered again only by the Home Secretary coming before the House. That is the right and responsible way to proceed. We are talking about the security of every citizen in this country.</p>

With the 10p tax rate, it was about trying to pose as a tax cutter. This time, it is about trying to pose as being tough on terror. Everybody knows what is happening.

Unfortunately, on Friday the Conservatives objected to my Bill once again. Will he use his high office to talk to the Department for Work and Pensions and try to get the Bill through, to make sure that people who are disabled during employment will receive employment and be able to contribute to the rest of this nation?</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on introducing a Bill for the employment of the disabled. I also congratulate him on keeping alive the very important idea that every disabled person should have the chance to get employment opportunities in our country. We recognise the importance of helping disabled people into work, we welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s concern and we share his aims and determination to do more. The Government launched the cross-party independent living strategy in March 2008, and we will move forward on that. I will be very happy to talk with my hon.

 Neighbourhood policing has been so successful in London that it is now used in all parts of England.

That is why, under the current Mayor of London, crime has fallen by 15 per cent. and there are 6,000 more police officers and 4,000 more community support officers.

We jealously guard each other&#146;s rights to represent the interests of our constituents in this House, Mr. Speaker, and I am asking you to support my view that the example of the handling of this case by the Home Office would, if repeated more widely, represent a significant and detrimental change to way that we, as individual Members of Parliament, hold Ministers to account for our constituents.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If there is a by-election, we will, of course, all engage in it and fight a robust campaign. Inevitably, that will be the case.

It reduces the opportunity for people to consider whether they wish to be candidates, and for their parties to consider that matter.

Part of the House&#146;s legislative agenda would be determined directly by the ordinary citizen, not just MPs and officials. Bills would be introduced on things that mattered to the people, not merely those that excite politicians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80430-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08043089000204">The Bill is sponsored by Members from across the political spectrum, united in wanting a new kind of progressive politics. We most certainly do need a new form of politics. There is a growing problem with the old Westminster politics. There is a gaping gulf between the political classes in SW1 and the country beyond. My Bill would ensure that Westminster was made more directly accountable to those whom we are supposed to serve. In place of the gentlemen&#146;s club rules that are used to determine what is on the legislature&#146;s agenda, the people would also get to have a say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80430-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08043089000205">To initiate a law, a citizen would submit a written proposal to the Clerk in the Table Office. Just as in New Zealand, the Table Office Clerk could determine the precise wording and rule frivolous or fantastic proposals out of order. Proposals would be out of order if, in the opinion of the Clerk and the Speaker, a similar proposal had been put forward within five years. Once a proposal had been approved by the Table Office, citizens would have 12 months to collect signatures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80430-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08043089000206">In New Zealand, 10 per cent. of voters need to sign up to trigger an initiative. Many western democracies have a right of initiative, including Austria, Italy, Hungary and Lithuania, yet the threshold in such countries has often been set so high that initiatives are rare. High thresholds mean that the popular initiative plays an integral part in the political process in only the United States and Switzerland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80430-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08043089000207">Rather than selecting an arbitrary threshold, under my Bill those six proposals with the most signatures would qualify. Ensuring that each proposal was, in effect, in competition with other proposals would have advantages. It would encourage proposals that were, by definition, able to command widespread support and would favour measures that were inclusive and unifying, and progressive and uplifting, over and above what was narrow and sectional.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="80430-0004.htm_para16"><a name="08043089000208">The half dozen proposals with the most signatures would then be presented to Parliament during the state opening. Having listed those Bills that the Sir Humphrey Appleby types, the remote officials and even, it has to be said, the occasional Minister wanted, Her Majesty would then read out those Bills that the people wanted on the statue book. And what a Queen&#146;s Speech that might be! Perhaps people beyond the Westminster village might want to watch and debate the contents of the Gracious Speech&#151;a speech with purpose, as well as pageantry.</p>

The big debates were about whether and how to decentralise control of the economy, trade union reform, making the Bank of England independent, privatisation and the big bang in the City. Each of those issues was a step towards decentralising economic control. The new political questions of our age will hinge on decentralising control, not of the economy but of politics and public services. This Bill is a small step towards that overarching aim.

 Let me reply to that point, which featured in our Committee debates. We all recognise that with the decline of gas in the UK continental shelf, in the North sea, we will be ever more reliant, as we approach 2020, on imported gas. For energy security, therefore, we need more gas storage.

If, in the end, 10 such stations are built&#151;or the Scots come to their senses and allow some new nuclear build in Scotland so that more than the estimated number of stations are built&#151;the share of the repository costs later on will be lower than they were earlier on.

 Obviously, the time scales are important, and they are likely to be long. It is not possible to say exactly when the geological repository will be built and up and running, but it will be some time hence. When a proposal is made to build a new nuclear station, the more immediate task&#151;I appreciate the difficulties&#151;is to seek to estimate what would be a reasonable share of decommissioning and of the costs in the geological repository.

 There will be a fixed price, which, as I have indicated, will probably not be the same in respect of a station built in the early days as that for one built 10 years later because by then we will know more about the costs of the geological repository. The principle of the fixed price operates in two parts. First, for the purpose of investor confidence, a fixed price will be determined early in the life of the new nuclear  <br>

Secondly, because of the uncertainties about the costs&#151;we appreciate the difficulties in this respect because we may be talking about waste that does not need to be disposed of for 40, 50 or more years&#151;what we are calling a risk premium will be determined. We are adding an extra amount to the fixed price to safeguard the taxpayer.</p>

 Before the hon. Gentleman comes in, may I try to give a fuller answer to the question I was asked about the full share of waste costs? As I said, those costs are directly attributable to accepting new-build higher-activity waste into a geological disposal facility. Added to that is a contribution towards the fixed costs of constructing that facility, which the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) mentioned. That will also involve a significant risk premium to cover uncertainties, and the cost of managing waste pending disposal or transfer for disposal. Separately, operators are also responsible for the full cost of disposing of low-level waste in a disposal facility, and managing that and other waste pending its disposal. We are doing our best to put our principle&#151;that the costs must be paid fully by the operating companies, and that there should be no cost to the taxpayer&#151;into practice.</p>

 I want to ask about practice. Why is the Minister confident that the new clause provides a mechanism guaranteeing that the taxpayer will not be landed with an additional bill, given the notorious regularity of that phenomenon in the case of the nuclear industry? Has he consulted, for example, the Centre for Alternative Technology, which has gone to great lengths to examine the costs of nuclear power and disposal? Has he factored in the cost of reprocessing waste, which may become necessary as uranium becomes scarcer? All those elements may involve a significant cost to the taxpayer if the new clause is not robust enough to ensure that the industry covers 100 per cent. of the cost.</p>

Our position is clear: we are happy for companies to invest in new-build nuclear as long as there is no subsidy, and as long as they are responsible for the full costs of decommissioning and the full long-term costs of disposal of spent fuel and waste. We think that, in return, they should be given a level playing field when it comes to sorting out the planning problems that they have faced in the past, although we do not agree with the Government about the total loss of local democracy in the measures proposed in the Planning Bill.</p>

We also accept the notion of a flat fee and a risk premium, but here the Minister started to make things a little more complicated. The right hon.

At what point does he think the site for the repository will be identified and earmarked for further investigation? There is a fear that not enough progress has been made in that regard. Does he think that a single repository will be sufficient for the disposal of both legacy waste and all waste from a new-build programme? The Secretary of State said recently that he thought there might be twice as much nuclear power in a few years&#146; time. Does the Minister believe that, in the event of a massive expansion of nuclear power, all the waste could be incorporated in a single facility, or does he think that we might need two?

 Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern about the opposite risk?

 That is a valid point.

The Government, however, are being rather coy about their plans on reprocessing. Also, how would this be factored into the costs?

 I welcome the thrust of the new clause.

I now understand exactly what the risk premium will be and also the thinking behind what the Minister has said. However, I know that the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management first recommended that there should be an interim site for the storage of waste, and I presume that the cost of that site would have to be factored into the calculations, and then goodness knows when the longer term depository will be built. The costs and technical challenges of that are huge. That is where the problem lies, because it will be difficult for the Department to calculate what that risk premium should be. It is a bit optimistic to think that we could go back to the nuclear industry and say, &#147;We got it wrong, so can we have some more money?&#148; as I assume that it will have signed various contracts on the arrangements, and it might be a little reluctant to agree to such an approach.</p>

In Committee, we explored the various current costs that the taxpayer is having to pick up from the nuclear installations inspectorate, CoRWM, the potential nuclear financing assurance board, and the big daddy of them all, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The Minister gave assurances that many of those were intended to be covered under the new regime. That is quite a threat to investors, given the cost of the NDA. The net grant-in-aid contribution of the taxpayer to the NDA in 2007-08 is &#163;1.4 billion. That is rising by 8 per cent.&#151;a very good settlement, as many public sector organisations would agree&#151;in 2008-09, and by almost a further 5 per cent. in 2009-10. Therefore, the taxpayer will soon be facing an annual bill of &#163;1.6 billion from the last generation of nuclear power stations. It is brave of the Government to be leading us down the same path a second time. When we listed all the potential costs to the taxpayer, the Minister gave a lot of assurances about which of them were intended to be entirely covered by the regime, but there was one exception: long-term storage and the financial regime covering that, which the new clause addresses.</p>

Member for Wealden has again raised a lot of the questions, many of them unanswered, such as about how the costs can be predicted or divided. For instance, although the new generation of nuclear power stations may, should it ever come to pass, produce radioactive waste in smaller volumes, it may well be much more radioactive and therefore pose new technical challenges that are different from those facing the repository for the current generation of nuclear power stations.</p>

We are seriously expected to sign up to licence fees for a repository for radioactive waste that does not exist, in a location that has not been found, for amounts that we cannot calculate, and all for power stations that might never be built and that no sane investor would touch with a barge pole. This is nuclear fairyland, and the Minister has an impossible task in persuading us that he can provide clarity and reassurance on this matter.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) slightly fell into the trap of citing it, but it has clearly been enunciated by Liberal Democrat Members. I am talking about the myth that the legacy cost is a private liability that was imposed on the public sector and the taxpayer. It was not, because almost all that liability was generated by a nationalised industry, and that public liability has been retained by the public sector. We need to devise a new process and a new structure that deals with a new industry, which will involve private investment and needs to be carefully controlled to ensure that it does not impose a liability on the public sector. That is what the Minister has sought to do through this new clause.</p>

 I cannot speak for what people were told in the 1950s, but that is a relevant issue, which is why we need to get the approach right now. The hon. Gentleman has told us that not going forward with the nuclear programme would be a condition of the Liberal Democrats&#146; involvement in a future Government. He has also said, in effect, that were they to get into power, they would tear up the Climate Change Act, because it will require us to commit to ways of reducing our carbon emissions, and that will almost certainly involve a Labour Government&#151;or, perish the thought, a Conservative Government&#151;building new nuclear power stations. The Liberals will come along at some point saying, &#147;We are not going to have these nuclear power stations any more.&#148; They will thus have to tear up their commitment to the Climate Change Bill, and as the Bill will provide for a legal commitment on the Government, the Liberals would be able to do so only by repealing the legislation once it is enacted.

 Although I do not disagree with the points being raised and in particular with what is being said about the motivation for the original nuclear programme coming from the military, I seek clarification. That programme was state-funded, and a lot of those costs fell to the state. Whether we like it or not, we now have a privatised nuclear sector. It was privatised by the Conservative party, and, as with many of its privatisations, debts and liabilities were written off to make what was being sold more attractive to investors. The enormous liabilities that we have come from that period, which is why my hon. Friends and I are anxious that that does not happen again.</p>

 My right hon. Friend brings me to the point that I wanted to make about the new clause. By introducing it, the Minister has tried to provide the industry with complete clarity about what it will have to pay in order to contribute a fair share of the cost of decommissioning, cleaning up and storing the new capacity that is generated. He has even made it clear that a risk premium will be imposed on the industry, so it will be clear about that. My concern, which I have expressed in a couple of interventions, is that to ensure that he is 100 per cent. confident that the public sector will not face a new liability in the future, he will have to be cautious in estimating the future costs. He will probably also have to be cautious in estimating the number of nuclear power stations that will be built.</p>

I am concerned that we should be able to reassure potential investors that, if it becomes clear in five, 10 or 20 years that they have been charged too much, there will be some process for reducing their costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80430-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08043089000313">If we can provide such reassurance, it will encourage people to come forward early, even though they are bound to be cautious about potential investments, especially if they hear irresponsible comments such as those made by the Liberal Democrats today threatening to overturn a policy that will have been instituted. Investors are bound to be cautious, but we could tell them that we will do the best we can to estimate the costs and, if it turns out that we have completely overestimated them&#151;although there will be a risk premium&#151;we would consider reducing the cost to the investors of storage and decommissioning in the future.</p>

 It is good to get on to something smart, namely smart meters. The issue was of significant interest during our discussions in Committee and in the slightly wider world. I know that many Members of the House have a keen interest in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80430-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08043089000350">During our discussions in Committee, it was clear that both sides of the House were in agreement about the potential benefits of smart meters for both consumers and energy suppliers. The benefits include giving consumers better information to help manage their energy use, providing accurate bills and, potentially, providing easier access to a wider range of tariffs. Smart meters also have the potential to contribute to the future development of the energy services market that many of us hope will be forthcoming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80430-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08043089000351">Of course, smart meters can also facilitate the export of electricity from microgeneration to the grid. For suppliers, the benefits include reduced costs, for example through remote meter reading, accurate billing and the potential to switch consumers between tariffs. All that will in turn translate into an improved level of customer service. However, Members also recognised that a roll-out of smart meters to all energy consumers would be a complex and highly challenging project, which would entail significant costs as well as the significant benefits I have already outlined.</p>

 There is clearly a lot of uncertainty about cost. The figures that the industry comes up with and those that the Government use vary hugely, perhaps by a factor of three. The key source that the Government seem to use is a report by Mott MacDonald. If that has not already been placed in the Library, would the Minister be willing to ensure that it is?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80430-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08043089000354">The Government published our response to the billing and metering consultation yesterday. I know that yesterday was only yesterday, but I made efforts to ensure that certain colleagues knew about that publication so that they might be able to glance at the report. Last week, we published detailed economic impact assessments of the costs and benefits of a domestic and small business smart meter roll-out, having previously published an impact assessment for a roll-out to medium-sized businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="80430-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08043089000355">Before I turn to the Government amendments on smart metering, it would be helpful if I reiterated the Government&#146;s policy intentions as set out in our response to the consultation. Our policy is most easily explained by examining our proposed approach in each of the three customer segments that we have identified: medium-sized business, small business and domestic consumers. Hon. Members who have had the opportunity to study the impact assessments that we published will be aware that there is a positive cost-benefit analysis for proceeding with smart metering for the medium-sized business sector and that the Government have therefore already announced in the 2008 Budget our intention to mandate a roll-out of smart meters to the sector over the next five years. That decision will see about 170,000 electricity and 40,000 gas meters being updated with more advanced technology, delivering carbon savings of around 140,000 tonnes of carbon per annum by 2020&#151;a small contribution to our carbon targets.</p>

However, that analysis needs further testing to ensure that our assumptions fully reflect the complexities of the small business sector. As such, we will be undertaking further work with stakeholders to ensure that our initial positive findings are accurate before making final policy decisions on a small business roll-out.</p>

 I think Ofgem estimates that 8 per cent. of the meter stock is changed every year, and that is not far from the 10 per cent. that is being recommended. In Committee, the Minister said that the costs could be between &#163;10 billion and &#163;20 billion, and he has now brought that down to between &#163;8 billion and &#163;14 billion. That shows great progress. Ofgem also estimates that the meters would cost between &#163;70 and &#163;90 each, so 47 million would cost about &#163;4.5 billion.

the costs at between &#163;8 billion and &#163;14 billion, and I have conceded that we need to do more work to refine those figures. That is something that we need to discuss with industry, but our present analysis does not suggest that there is a net positive business case for proceeding. However, the figures are the result of our initial analysis, and are by no means our final word on the subject. Many of the estimated future costs carry a high degree of uncertainty, and some of the anticipated benefits are challenging to quantify in monetary terms.</p>

We also anticipate benefits for energy suppliers and, in the longer term, for distribution networks. However, analysing in detail the full extent of those benefits and quantifying them is extremely difficult and depends on a number of variables that require further investigation. I suppose that shows that we need more than the back of an envelope to do the calculations on&#151;</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman says, we will discuss feed-in tariffs later, but I thank him for his congratulations. My endeavour now is to answer a question that even he has not yet formulated in his mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80430-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08043089000377">I turn now to Government new clauses 8, 9 and 10, and the consequential amendments Nos. 50, 58 and 59. I want to explain why we believe that they provide the most appropriate legislative route forward, given the context that I have just outlined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80430-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08043089000378">New clause 8 allows the Secretary of State to modify relevant electricity and gas licences, or other documents made under licence conditions, to require or facilitate the installation of smart meters. As I have indicated, our intention is that this power will underpin the roll-out of smart meters to medium-sized business in the first instance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80430-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08043089000379">As is common practice with technical issues in the energy sector, the intention is to specify the detail of the requirements being placed on licensees, and other relevant arrangements, through modifications of licence conditions or other relevant industry documents rather than including that detail on the face of the enabling legislation. Examples of the type of detail that I am referring to would include the specification of the meter, or the speed of a roll-out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80430-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08043089000380">At this stage, we need to maintain flexibility in defining those details, as they could have significant cost implications. Small changes to the assumptions that we make can have significant impacts on the overall costs, as well as on the potential benefits. We need the flexibility to specify these issues in modifications so that we can identify the optimum, most cost-effective roll-out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80430-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08043089000381">The new clause also recognises that smart metering is an issue of significant interest to Parliament. It is also potentially one of major national importance, with direct implications for business and consumers. Usually, the Secretary of State would make this type of modification without further recourse to Parliament. The new clause proposes going further by providing a mechanism for additional parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80430-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08043089000382">More specifically&#151;in addition to the usual requirements for the Secretary of State to consult relevant licensees, Ofgem and any other appropriate persons&#151;new clause 9 requires the Secretary of State to lay the draft modifications in Parliament and allow a period of 40 days in which either House of Parliament may reject them. I believe that that additional parliamentary scrutiny is appropriate and that it will be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80430-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08043089000383">Our amendments will allow the Government to move forward now with smart metering for medium-sized business and, subject to further analysis and informal consultation, to be in a position to act as quickly as possible to roll out smart meters to the small business and domestic sectors, should our final analysis support that. That is the most sensible approach, given the inherent flexibility needed in developing and implementing the licensing and other arrangements in this evolving regulatory area.</p>

 I suspect that the Minister is coming to the end of his speech, and I have been waiting for the answer to the question that I have wanted to ask. Will he say something about visual display units? There has been a lot of discussion about VDUs, and some parts of Government are very keen on them, but it makes no sense to introduce them if domestic customers are going to have access to smart metering in the relatively near future. What is the present view on VDUs?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that question. We have listened to many people outside the House, and they believe that the main thrust must be the development of the more sophisticated smart meter technology.

I believe that these amendments will successfully enable the roll-out of smart meters. They are an important step forward in fulfilling our ambition, set out in the 2007 energy White Paper, to improve the information that energy customers receive about their energy use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80430-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08043089000387">I therefore hope that colleagues in the House will lend their support to these Government amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80430-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08043089000390">We think that the Government should have gone further. We would have liked them to insert a specified time scale of 10 years for the introduction of smart meters across the whole country. However, the fall-back position adopted in Committee was that the Government should table an amendment with permissive powers to avoid the need for primary legislation in due course. They have done that, so perhaps we should give the Minister not three cheers, or two, but one and a half cheers for what he has achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80430-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08043089000391">One day in Committee, the Minister told us that he would be going home to fit his own electronic display device. He said that the EDD was in its box in the cupboard, and that we had shamed him into going home and fitting it that very weekend. We expressed our concern that he might electrocute himself in the process, and we are obviously delighted that he did not do so. Nevertheless, did he summon up the courage to fit it, and has he found the device useful? Many of us share the concern of the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) that VDUs are often almost worse than useless and that they distract from what is a very important debate.</p>

 I said earlier that one of the great advantages of the programme was that it could lead to the end of prepayment meters. One of the reasons that it is so strongly supported by Energywatch is that it could make a massive improvement to the service offered to domestic consumers, especially those in fuel poverty. I should say, as an aside, that it is very sad that the Bill does not address fuel poverty.

 I was rather hoping that the hon. Gentleman was going to address the costs of smart meters. It is not unreasonable for the Government, when faced with the indubitable advantages and benefits of smart meters, nevertheless to address costs seriously. As I said, we need to refine the costs, and we will discuss them with the industry, which will have different ideas. This is clearly a costly national project, so does he not agree that it would be irresponsible for the Government not to pay heed to the costs, not least at a time when our constituents are worried about rising energy bills?</p>

The figures are out there and views have been formed. It should now be quite simple for the Minister, in a short space of time, to reach a decision rather than simply knock the issue into the long grass. That is why the frustration arises. I would not wish to disappoint the Minister by not addressing issues that he would like me to consider, but it behoves the Government to speed up the process.</p>

They want to do more, but they often feel disempowered because they do not know enough and do not have enough information on which to base decisions. We have argued that they should have more information about how much of their energy bill goes on environmental taxes and charges, so that they know what proportion of their bill relates to renewables obligation certificates, the carbon emissions reduction target and the European emissions trading scheme. The Government blocked an amendment that would have allowed that, and we remain disappointed that they do not seem to want consumers to have more information.</p>

If the consumer bought green electricity only, the figure would be zero, but if the electricity was generated from coal-fired power stations or came from elsewhere, a much higher figure would be given. That would enable the consumer to say to their supplier, &#147;I want to switch to a company that will produce less CO2.&#148; The figure will, almost by definition, be a bit of an approximation, as we cannot expect the amount to be worked out to the hour for every consumer, but it would mean that suppliers consulted the people who generated the energy, and looked at the sources from which the power was generated over a period. They would then produce a total figure, which could be divided by the number of consumers. That would give the consumer information enabling them to make an informed choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80430-0009.htm_para32"><a name="08043089000417">Of course, if the measure were taken forward, there are issues that would need to be addressed.

How would energy transported to this country through the French interconnector be assessed? However, those questions do not detract from the valuable contribution that the measure would make to enabling people to make informed choices. We want people to tackle waste and improve the energy efficiency of their homes. We should actively seek to make people do more in those respects, and to make them switch to less polluting electricity suppliers, but at the moment, unless they have a purely green supplier, they simply have no idea of how that is to be done. New clause 16 is a simple measure that would make such a switch possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80430-0009.htm_para33"><a name="08043089000418">We should not say that the measure is too complicated, because Tesco announced yesterday that it would set out the carbon footprint for 30 of its products as a prelude to doing so much more widely. If that can be done for a packet of beans, a punnet of strawberries or whatever is on the Minister&#146;s shopping list for when he sits down to watch the football match tonight, it can be done for electricity bills, too. I hope that the Minister takes that point. On smart meters, I give him one and a half cheers for recognising that a provision addressing the issue should be included in the Bill, but there is still disappointment about the fact that he has not gone further.</p>

think that my hon. Friend the Minister listened very carefully to our debate in Committee and has responded far more fully than I expected him to, so he should get more than one and a half cheers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80430-0010.htm_para0"><a name="08043089000420">I want to reiterate a point that I made in Committee. A smart meter will certainly allow a person to choose between tariffs by providing them with the information that they need if they are to make that choice, but because of the way in which the electricity and gas retailing industry works, they would be making a choice between the tariffs offered by a particular company. If someone wants to change companies, they have to work out who has the cheapest tariff. They may have to go online to the website of a company such as uSwitch and enter their details and information about their energy usage; uSwitch will then tell them which the cheapest energy supplier would be, and the person could then sign up with that company. I do not want to do that in future; I want a smart meter that does it for me.</p>

I do not want to have to do the work any longer. Why should I, when I have a computer built into my energy meter that should be doing that work for me? My question to my hon. Friend is whether the amendments before us go so far as to make that practicable, so that companies such as uSwitch can decide to step into the market and extend their range of products. According to my reading of the amendments, they probably do allow that to happen, but I would like confirmation from my hon. Friend that my reading is accurate, and I would also like confirmation that when the consultation takes place over the next few months, the need for such a service will be taken into account so that energy retailers are not allowed to block the entry into the market of companies that can provide us with such a service.</p>

 I think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s reading is right; new clause 3, which is in the group of amendments that we are considering, and which I hope the Government will accept, provides that the regulations on smart meters must include a provision allowing a smart meter to be a friend in the cupboard, or on the mantelpiece, that facilitates switching for the consumer. The hon. Gentleman might have heard a lengthy advocacy of that exact principle in Committee, and I am delighted to hear that point reflected in today&#146;s debate; I welcome that.</p>

As new clause 8 has the Minister&#146;s imprimatur, we are happy to defer to him, and not to pursue new clause 1, with one reservation: as the amendment paper shows, when we tabled new clause 1, we included a time scale.

things might start to happen. The idea that the clock is ticking is important in the context of climate change. If we are shortly to have binding targets for reaching our 2020 and 2050 climate change goals, another year or two, or five, matters. It is the lack of urgency that disturbs us. Let me read a statement of the Government&#146;s policy:</p>
<a name="80430-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="08043089000679"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Following our consultation on billing and metering, the Government intends to roll forward a package of measures in Great Britain which will change the way in which energy use is communicated to customers.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80430-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08043089000424">One might assume that that came out this week, but in fact it was said a year ago in the energy White Paper of May 2007. The consultation on billing and metering referred to is the previous consultation, and not the most recent consultation or the next consultation. We feel that a line has to be drawn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80430-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08043089000425">I accept that the Government have a trial under way, and there is an argument for saying that we should let the trial finish. However, the statement of May 2007 was written when the trial had barely begun, so it is hard to argue that we need extra time for the trial to run when, over a year ago, before the Government had any clues about how the trial was going, they were already giving undertakings. The Minister cannot have it both ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80430-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08043089000426">As the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) said, the document that was circulated today&#151;we appreciate the help given by the Minister&#146;s office in that regard&#151;says that, in summary, the Government&#146;s plan, in response to the consultation, is</p>

What do they think that they will find out after another six or nine months of dithering that they could not find out in the previous 12 months of dithering? What is the delay? The conclusion of the response to the consultation says:</p>
<a name="80430-0010.htm_brev2"><a name="08043089000681"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Given the complexity of the issues and the number of variables involved, the Government wishes to discuss further...We have therefore published...a consultation impact assessment&#148;&#151;</p>

Perhaps then there will be a period of public engagement, reflection and consideration. Can we not just get on with it?</p>

 Although I go along with the hon. Gentleman in his suggestion that it is important that rapid progress is made between the consultation and the implementation of smart meter technology, his computer analogy assumes that a choice is made within a common operating system. Does he accept that one of the issues in smart meter roll-out must be to ensure that meters are interoperable and interchangeable, and are not the creature of the company that installed them? It is therefore necessary to get that process right.</p>

 I agree that we need interoperability and that we need to get the process right, but I do not see why another 12 months, 18 months or any other period of consultation and dithering will make that any more likely. We know that now and we knew it 12 months ago, so let us get on with setting the common standards to which all companies would have to adhere. Why was Ofgem not asked to do that 12 months ago? I agree with the hon. Gentleman on the goal. I do not understand the delay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80430-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08043089000436">Why is it so important that we get on with the task? We have heard some of the advantages of smart meters, but probably not all of them. One that has been understated so far in the debate is the potential for load shifting. If we are thinking about the difficult question of our future energy supply and security, and a structure that will match the peaks of demand that occur, and potentially thinking about a future when we might, for example, be charging up our cars overnight, the importance of load shifting will become greater and greater.</p>

The cost-benefit analysis of smart meters should take that into account. The benefit would not just be private and personal; the entire public infrastructure would benefit from much greater incentives for load shifting. That has not been factored in sufficiently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80430-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08043089000439">The key is to ensure that the tariffs are right. A set of the fuel poor or vulnerable households or a similar category of people could be identified, and smart metering technology could be used to ensure that they were automatically on the best tariff that the given company offered, or the best tariff. That comes back to the point about switching, to which I shall return.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80430-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08043089000440">Another aspect of fuel poverty and smart metering that we have not thought about is one of the arguments advanced by the companies. When they are told to target the vulnerable, they do not know who the vulnerable are. The Government know who the vulnerable are, and I have suggested in the past that the Government might once a year send a letter to everyone on pension credit, for example, with a certificate that they could show to their energy supplier to claim entitlement to its best tariff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80430-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08043089000441">In the world of smart metering we could go one better. Central Government could simply issue to the smart meter the eligibility switch. In other words, there could be a mechanism whereby, since the meters can receive data as well as send data, they could receive information that the householder was entitled to the social tariff, whatever it happened to be. It is another way in which the fuel poor could be targeted, which we struggle to do at present.</p>

 Smart meters could go one step further and allocate the fuel poor and the social tariffs among the companies, so that all the companies were paying a fair share of the burden of meeting the needs of vulnerable people.</p>

 The companies are certainly not paying a fair share at present, so that is an interesting suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80430-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08043089000444">We have seen the potential of smart meters for load shifting and for alleviating fuel poverty. The climate change potential through CO2 savings has been mentioned, although it is possible to overstate those savings. There is some evidence that there is a one-off shift, but it is slightly less clear that the effect is ongoing. Whatever sort of smart metering we have, we clearly need a visual display that is compatible with a smart meter, rather than a clip-on device, so that people have the best possible and most accessible information about their consumption and about the CO2 emissions to encourage them to think harder about cutting back.</p>

rhetoric and eloquence unencumbered by economics, but there are serious cost issues involved. We are talking about a major roll-out to every householder. We want that to happen, but I do not apologise for the fact that the Government must consider the cost issues. Even the Liberal Democrats must consider cost issues.</p>

So the consumer gets a benefit, the companies clearly get a substantial benefit on billing and so forth, society gets a benefit in terms of CO2 emissions, load shifting and microgeneration&#151;my crucial fourth point, to which I shall return. Bringing that all together, it is hard to see why the Government&#146;s cost-benefit analysis is so at variance with everybody else&#146;s. Given that Government money is not involved, I do not understand what the agenda is or the internal DBERR politics.</p>

 I assume that if there are net costs, as I believe there will be, they will be passed on to the consumer. It may not be public spending, but at a time of rising energy costs we must have regard to that. I am a supporter of smart meters and I predict that they will be rolled out for householders, but we need to refine the costs and see what the difference is between ourselves and industry on those cost estimates. Many of the advantages are, in a sense, hypotheses. We hope behaviour will follow those, but we must ground it in some estimate of net costs.</p>

 Indeed, we need to be realistic about costs. Climate change and fuel poverty are urgent imperatives, and because of the delay, industry is wasting huge amounts of money and passing that on to consumers. The Minister told my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) that over 2 million meters&#151;roughly 5 per cent.&#151;are replaced each year. The further delay between now, when we hoped for a decision, and Christmas, when we might get one, means that another 2 million meters will quickly be obsolete. That is waste as well, which has to be paid for by consumers. I doubt whether the Government&#146;s cost-benefit analysis factors that in. There is a net benefit to the companies, the consumer and the wider society, and the sooner we get to that point, the better.</p>

All that is on hold while we dither about smart metering.</p>

that they will be making regulations about what smart meters must do, new clause 3 proposes that one of those should be to do the shopping around for the consumer. That is what I suggested in Committee and I am delighted that the Minister accepts that principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80430-0010.htm_para25"><a name="08043089000456">I am happy to discuss the fine detail of how that works, whether it involves switching every second or every quarter, and the way that that is finessed. However, the principle of relying on consumers, even with display units, to take the information to the internet seems one step too many for the most vulnerable. The Minister asked me whether the technology was feasible when we debated this issue in Committee. The technology seems self-evidently integral to smart metering; the meters can receive and send data. Once there is interoperability&#151;an essential prerequisite&#151;that will be done in a standard format. The smart meter should be able to go to the internet and check, on the basis of the person&#146;s individual consumption, for the best package and tariff. That seems to be a win-win situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80430-0010.htm_para26"><a name="08043089000457">Rather than there being regulators investigating the industry to see whether it is competitive, why do we not just make it competitive? Why do we not put every consumer in charge? What I suggest is the ultimate in putting consumers in charge and making the companies respond. The companies would have to innovate, because those out of line on tariffs would lose custom dramatically. There would be opportunity for niche marketing, because each smart meter would base its choice on the individual consumer&#146;s actual consumption patterns and firms would have an incentive to match tariffs to people&#146;s actual consumption patterns. That could revolutionise the industry.</p>

That is one of the big problems with the whole presumption that one of the answers to fuel poverty is that poor people should switch. We know that, in general, poor people do not switch. They do not have the information. I still find my fuel bills baffling, and I regard myself as moderately sophisticated on such matters. It is unrealistic to expect the fuel poor to tackle fuel poverty by constantly shopping around online or by any other means. The smart meters could do that for them&#151;and the sooner that they are in place, the better.</p>

sounds wonderful in theory, but the hon. Gentleman&#146;s experience of switching might be different from mine. I am not sure that I would like my meter to change my direct debit or credit card charges. That is the big problem with what the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) has suggested.</p>

The fuel poor do not switch because, as the hon. Gentleman said, they are not familiar with the technology, but if someone is getting a blizzard of different bills from different companies for different sections of their energy use, that would make matters worse. We should not be looking for a brave new world of smart meters that goes beyond what is realistic in respect of what people can deal with. We must bring the issue back to that position.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making a good point. It is exactly why I used as an exemplar an agent such as uSwitch, which is not an energy retailer but acts on behalf of the individual purchaser. In other words, the consumer would pay some money through such an agent, which would deal with such things; their bank account details would not be switched.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80430-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08043089000464">I am looking for the legislation to be permissive, so that when the details get worked out, the necessary agents are in place and the mechanisms for doing the switching are devised, it will be possible, through this legislation, to make those things happen. I do not want us to have to say, &#147;Well, we could do this now, but the primary legislation does not allow it and we will have to wait for another energy Bill to come along.&#148;</p>

 I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, although I am not sure that putting a middle man in the energy market will necessarily make things better. I merely make the point that we should be considering what can realistically be done. I do not often say this, but I agree with the Minister&#146;s approach on this issue. New clause 8 gives a permissive power for the meters to be installed; importantly, subsection (3) gives the power for the technical specifications of meters to be included. That was the point that I made in my earlier intervention&#151;it is vital that, as the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) said, the meters should be interoperative and that different companies do not run different meters that cannot easily switch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80430-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08043089000466">I notice that all the energy companies support smart meters. I have been to many demonstrations of smart meters and seen many press releases and other papers from the energy companies demanding that the Government show leadership on the issue. I understand that there has to be a national roll-out, but the cynical part of me wonders whether the energy companies are seeking to pin the blame on someone else for the associated increased costs. We should be careful about that: smart meters should be a way of helping people, not of raising costs and pinning the blame on politicians for rising energy costs. There is a danger that that could happen.</p>

have an electricity smart meter than a gas one, and I wonder whether we should concentrate on electricity in the first roll-out to get the policy moving and show that the system works. The issue is important because of the many things that smart meters can do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80430-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08043089000472">Smart meters would also mean an end to estimated billing. That is interesting; sometimes, I wonder why the energy companies are so keen on that. I pay for my energy by direct debit, and the company comes along every year and says that for the next year, my payments will be x or y. Obviously, I am out most of the day and there are a lot of estimated readings. We phone the companies or go online to tell them the correct reading; in my experience, whether they take note of that or not is another matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80430-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08043089000473">None the less, the companies come along every year and try to up the direct debits, despite the fact that in my experience people are mostly in credit at the end of the year. That comes back to the need for consumers to show great care in looking at their energy bills and what the energy companies are doing. Basically, there is a lot of overcharging by various means on the part of the energy companies. I would love a smart meter to deal with all those problems and ensure that we pay only for the energy that we use, and at the cheapest possible tariff. However, I have to be realistic. I understand that the roll-out will take time. It is more important that we get the issue right than get it quickly, although we should get it as quickly as possible. Interoperability is the one thing that we must ensure is present when we roll out the system.</p>

recognise that a roll-out of smart meters to all energy consumers would be a complex and highly challenging project, and with one opportunity to get the legislative framework right. Although the Government intend to move forward with smart metering for medium-sized business, we need to undertake further work with stakeholders fully to understand the costs and benefits of smart meter roll-out to small businesses and the crucial domestic sector before coming to a final view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80430-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08043089000476">In the context of the policy approach to smart meters that I have described, I must resist new clauses 1 and 3, which seek to specify in the Bill some of the technical details, including the timing of a roll-out and the functions of a meter. At this stage, we need to maintain flexibility in defining some of the details while we complete our analysis and work with stakeholders to identify the optimum, most cost-effective roll-out. I make no apology for being worried about cost-effectiveness. I believe that this is the best approach as we develop our understanding of this evolving regulatory arena. That is one of the key differences in our approach and one of the reasons why I am resisting hon. Members&#146; new clauses.</p>

Members have talked about our approach, and I have noticed that &#147;dithering&#148; seems to be a favourite word in the Opposition&#146;s political vocabulary. I do not recognise that. Since the energy White Paper, we have undertaken a consultation and published a significant body of impact assessment work. We have tabled an amendment to the Bill, which we are discussing, and we have already announced our intention to move forward for medium-sized businesses. I make no apology for considering the cost-effectiveness of the measure as well as the benefits. I therefore hope that hon. Members will feel able to support the Government new clause and will not press theirs to a vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80430-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08043089000485">New clause 16, in the name of the hon. Member for Wealden, seeks to increase transparency for consumers by requiring energy suppliers to specify on a consumer&#146;s bill the amount of carbon dioxide that has been emitted in the production of the energy attributed to that bill. As the problem of climate change is now a global one, we all&#151;consumers, business and Government&#151;have a role to play. Indeed, much of today&#146;s debate is about how we enable the citizen to become more active in tackling global warming; it is a feature of the next debate, too. A key element of our strategy to tackle climate change is promoting energy efficiency and crucially, as part of that, engaging the individual. Important examples of the Government&#146;s work are the &#147;Act on CO2&#148; campaign by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the fact that two thirds of the estimated savings in the 2007 energy White Paper were as a result of energy efficiency measures. However, we must continue to take action to help consumers to understand the choices that they can make about using cleaner energy and reducing the energy they use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80430-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08043089000486">I support the notions behind new clause 16, but I shall resist it because it would duplicate existing statutory requirements that achieve the same outcome. It might be helpful if we consider this in two parts&#151;electricity and gas&#151;as they are covered by different statutory requirements. Looking first at electricity, in transposing the electricity directive 2003/54/EC the Government laid the Electricity (Fuel Mix Disclosure) Regulations 2005. I am sure that hon. Members remember those quite intimately. Those regulations inserted a new condition into electricity supply licences requiring suppliers to provide information on or with the consumer&#146;s energy bill, and in promotional materials, about the environmental impact of the electricity supplied in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. I hope that hon. Members will therefore accept that the requirement for suppliers to provide the specified information in relation to electricity is already accounted for.</p>

effect, because gas supplied will have the same carbon emissions regardless of who supplies it&#151;that is, 0.185 kg of CO2 per kilowatt hour of gas consumed. The information could incentivise more efficient use of energy by consumers. However, there is already a statutory requirement that has the same effect&#151;the requirement for energy suppliers to provide historical information on consumers&#146; bills to help them to understand how much energy they have used. Since we published the energy White Paper last year, the six major energy suppliers have included historical energy usage data on all consumers&#146; bills. That shows consumers, in graphical form, the amount of energy that they have used compared with the same period in the previous year&#151;something that the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir) might study at his leisure.</p>

Gentleman has raised so well. I rather suspect that we can go further in a cost-effective way, not by trying to itemise CO2 for every constituency, but by sending the consumer general material about carbon emissions, and perhaps reminding them that, as we tackle carbon emissions, extra costs will be incurred through such things as the renewables obligation.</p>

She and the company that she is part of in The Premises studios in Hackney, London, have installed an array of about 18 solar panels on the roof&#151;similar to the array on my home&#151;which generate the electricity that powers the studios. I know that she has written to all of my parliamentary colleagues to say that such action should not just be the prerogative of those in a position to do it as a matter of principle.

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80430-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08043089000507">In this House, we have to ask how we begin to bridge the gap between UK undertakings and where we need to be by 2020, and how we bridge the gap between where the UK is now and the position of many of our international comparator countries. The international picture is this: almost 50 countries have introduced some sort of feed-in tariff legislation. As a result, most of those countries are well ahead of the UK in delivering a proportion of energy from renewable sources. The UK currently delivers about 2 per cent. of its energy from renewable sources. According to the aspirations that have been teased out from the Bill, it is clear that, at best, the UK will reach a position where it might be delivering 5 per cent. of our energy from renewable sources by 2020. We have entered into an EU commitment to deliver 15 per cent. of our energy from renewable sources by that time. It is quite clear, therefore, that we will need a quantum shift in the policy framework to allow the UK to deliver 15 per cent. of our energy from renewable sources by 2020.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful case, but is it not a source of national embarrassment that in order to get an EU average of 20 per cent., the UK has been set a target of only 15 per cent., because we are starting so late and from so far behind? Does that not reinforce his point?</p>

<p><a name="st_o231"><a name="08043089000509"><a name="80430-0012.htm_spnew4"><a name="08043089000979"><b>Alan Simpson:</b>
 It is an embarrassment, and those who have read the Lily Allen letter will recall that it is described as a &#147;national disgrace&#148;. However, we need to remember that 10 years ago Germany started from a similar position and already, this year, it has exceeded its 2010 targets. It now delivers more than 14 per cent. of its energy from renewable sources, and it has made a step-change transition within the same sort of period that we will have to make one. None of those achievements is outside our reach; the question is whether the achievements are outside our vision. Do we have the political will to make the shift?</p>

 I fully support new clause 4. I wonder whether my hon.

I find that sad, because the Government will have it do it anyway. There is a commitment to conduct a review of the microgeneration strategy, and that must report back in six months. During the French presidency, the UK&#146;s 15 per cent. target will be defined. Britain will not be allowed to pay someone else to do the job for us&#151;we must do it ourselves.

The figures from the German Government for feed-in tariff costs last year show that they contribute approximately &#8364;35&#151;about &#163;25&#151;to the average German household energy bill. If we total the current UK intervention measures&#151;the climate change levy, climate change agreements, the renewables obligation, the carbon emissions reduction target, contributions from the energy industry and the emissions trading scheme&#151;they add more than &#163;150 to the average UK household energy bill and deliver next to nothing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80430-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08043089000516">The claims that the new clause will mess up the renewables obligation do not stand up either. We could continue with it and the Minister would be free to return in a year with a scheme that did not intrude on support for developing offshore wind, but allowed for a much more imaginative feed-in tariff system relating to a series of initiatives for decentralised energy provision, without which we almost certainly cannot deliver our eco town or eco city aspirations. None is deliverable without a more serious engagement with decentralised energy and a feed-in tariff system.</p>

responsible for generating capacity of 2 GWe. That is the same amount as Germany delivers every year from its onshore wind installations alone. Our record is not one of dynamic achievement and growth. Indeed, the international assessment and that of the Audit Commission suggests that the renewables obligation has historically been an expensive mechanism for delivering little apart from big subsidies to existing energy companies. To break out of that trap, we need to engage with mechanisms that have a track record of working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08043089000518">My hon. Friend and colleague the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen) pointed out that the Germans have not taken action simply to be ecologically pure, but have also been driven by clear economic self-interest. One of the architects of the German scheme, a politician called Herman Scheer, has twice been to the House of Commons to try to discuss the precise economics with parliamentarians. One can summarise it simply: since the introduction of the feed-in tariff legislation nearly four years ago, Germany has created 250,000 new jobs in the renewable energy sector. That industry has a turnover of almost &#163;25 billion. Germany is considering setting its own targets, which double the 2020 commitments of 20 per cent. of energy coming from renewable sources because it is already well ahead of the game.</p>

I have visited several German cities to examine the operation of feed-in tariff systems. When I asked the mayors what their biggest problem was, they replied, &#147;Keeping up with citizens&#146; demand.&#148; Such is the momentum that, in the previous German elections, not one political party would countenance revoking feed-in tariff legislation because that would have been an act of political suicide. The current joke is that Germans will put a solar panel on anything that does not move. If a dog is asleep in a garden for half an hour, it will wake up with a solar panel on its back.</p>

the political parties but that there had been some trouble with the energy companies. In the previous year, the federal Government or municipal government had to take energy companies to court on approximately 150 occasions for failure to comply with the law. On each occasion, the public won and the energy companies lost. Energy company interests were the most contentious part of the programme. That is a lesson for us in the UK. We have found ourselves too deeply enmeshed in the large-scale corporate interests of a feeding system for the big energy companies, which has not necessarily fed the momentum for change to renewable energy systems throughout the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08043089000524">Fortunately, none of the challenges in Germany about state aid and market distortion was upheld by the courts. The European Court ruled that the feed-in tariff system constituted a perfectly legitimate way to create a dynamic market with a different competitor base. I believe that we must make that intellectual shift.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08043089000525">However, the debate goes beyond traditional terms. The focus has mainly been on electricity generation. Friends of the Earth, the Renewable Energy Association and other non-governmental organisations put a wonderful advert in the national newspapers last week. It tried to capture the contrasts between the UK and Germany through a different perception of our traditional Anglo-German rivalry. It depicted a mythical Euro solar league, with a shoot-out. There was a goal with lots of footballs in the back, an England goalkeeper in a state of despair and a scoreboard that read, &#147;Germany 200, England 1&#148;. That is the ratio&#151;200:1&#151;of installed solar generating capacity between the two countries. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Yes, there was mention of 1966.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08043089000526">If we widen the focus, the comparisons are even starker. We do just as badly in other aspects of the renewable energy sectors. By the end of 2007, the UK had installed approximately 80,000 solar thermal energy units; in contrast, Germany had more than 1 million. By the end of 2007, the UK had installed approximately 1,000 heat pumps, while Germany installed 44,000 heat pumps in 2006 alone. The contrast in solar photovoltaic energy is between around 2,500 solar roofs in this country and 300,000 in Germany. The UK has 150 wood pellet boilers and Germany has 70,000, while the UK has 17 biogas plants and Germany has 3,800. All that has happened relatively recently, in the past three to four years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08043089000527">I want to widen the focus of the debate from just electricity to what we do about renewable heat and renewable biogas. We had a public meeting on that last night. Some interest was generated when it was announced that BERR had a team on heat. <i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ]</i> Eyes watered and people made discreet inquiries about what exactly that meant. That team is looking into the issue.</p>

Essentially, in our system in the UK, the only way someone trying to reclaim methane from waste&#151;whether it be food, farm or animal waste, or sewage&#151;can receive any assistance or recognition is if the waste is converted into energy at the plant. That means that the producers of the energy are left with heat at a remote location and huge infrastructure costs in transmitting heat back into the towns or cities where the waste came from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08043089000529">The Germans said, &#147;Why waste all that effort in creating the ducting for heat? Why don&#146;t we just put it back into the system as gas and allow people to take the credit at the point at which they convert the gas back into energy?&#148; The Germans allow that process to take place at combined heat and power plants that are located in the communities that provide the waste in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08043089000530">The scope for that process is vast. To put it in context, half the food currently produced in the UK ends up as food waste. A study conducted in Germany at the end of last year calculated that if, at the European level, we used food, farm and animal waste, and perhaps even sewage, for the production of biomethane that we then fed back into our gas systems, by 2020 the entire EU could be economically non-dependent on Russian gas. That is the scale of what is possible. However, we have to make the shift, by changing the rules in order to provide the incentives that will at least allow that to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08043089000531">At a time when Centrica is already telling us that it will not be able to control future gas prices, because we now have to buy gas on an international market, which drives prices up, German companies can offer their customers gas prices that will not rise other than by the retail prices index, because that gas is being generated from their waste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para13"><a name="08043089000532">It has also been pointed out that two forms of waste come out of the biogas production process. One is a solid fuel waste, which is a farm-grade fertiliser, which the companies are supplying back to the farms. Again, we should bear in mind that fertiliser prices doubled for UK farmers last year alone. The ability to supply fertiliser back to our farmers has an economic virtue in itself. The second form of waste is a liquid waste, which turns out to be a biofuel. The Germans are using that biofuel to drive the vehicles to collect the waste from people&#146;s houses in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08043089000533">That is the sort of virtuous circle that is unleashed as a result of making that shift. The sense of empowerment in the process is driven by that community involvement. Hermann Scheer made an additional point, to which the Minister and the Treasury ought to show some sensitivity. More than 90 per cent. of investment in the renewables process in Germany comes from individuals, communities, public authorities and the business sector. Why? Because they can all be stakeholders in the process and because they receive payments from it.</p>

 I have indeed looked into the problem. The German biogas plants have said that they need over 91 per cent. purity to meet the purity standards for biomethane. However, they are delivering methane into the system at 95 per cent. purity, so purity is just not an issue. Accessing the system is a relatively minor technical problem. The greater problem is a political problem and concerns whether we should require the system to be open to inputs in the way that the German system is. The key is an acceptance of the need for a progressive shift to decentralised energy systems.</p>

 Is my hon.

However, Anglian Water feels that the renewables obligation certificates system, current arrangements and incentives work against its developing in that way, and that it would need some kind of incentive, of the type described in the new clause, to take that work forward. Such companies, which operate at a bigger level than microgeneration, need some form of incentive to encourage that kind of work, which they want to do.</p>

 I understand that. The problem is that such companies would lose their entitlements to ROCs if they were to put the gas back into the system and take it out where it is needed, yet that is the most coherent way of doing this. There has to be a change of rules.</p>

If they supply the waste, we will pay them for it and convert it back into energy.&#148; That is what the feed-in tariff allows them to do. It allows citizens to become the drivers of the agenda for change. What is more, it delivers change on a scale to which the UK does not even aspire. In Germany, last year, that measure alone delivered 97 million tonnes of carbon savings. That is 10 times the UK&#146;s aspirational target, which we are nowhere near delivering.

than indirectly to get ROCs by generating electricity? Such incentives either already exist under the current RO system or could easily be organised using a feed-in tariff that would apply primarily to microgeneration.

 That is a legitimate point to address. One of the great virtues of the new clause is that it gives the Minister and the Government a year in which to address the specifics. There is nothing to bind the Minister to a particular scheme or set of thresholds. Indeed, it invites him to explore as widely as possible what are the most appropriate ways of dealing with renewable electricity, heat and gas. It is an invitation to come up with the most appropriate schemes. I cannot see why there is a reluctance to engage with that, given that the only commitment that is required is to say that we will come back within a year with something that will deliver change, rather than continually consult on the process.</p>

 Absolutely. It is important to recognise that we should not go down such a damaging path. The displacement of food production from agricultural land for fuel-based production would be disastrous. We can address the issue by managing our waste. For those who have missed that dimension of the issue, it is worth pointing out that when the 2010 EU directive on landfill comes into effect, the UK could end up with a daily bill of &#163;300,000 under our current waste framework, because we have not come up with solutions to deal with our present waste levels. The proposal offers all sorts of ways out of the problem.</p>

 That is a perfectly valid point, but again I would draw colleagues&#146; attention back to the comparison with Germany, where the farmers are part of this process. Some farmers grow crops and have solar panels; some farmers rear livestock and have solar panels; some have set-aside and solar panels. Huge amounts of renewable energy from the sun are thus coming from the farms and farmers of Germany. If we are examining the dynamics of a rural agenda to address both food and energy security, all the lessons in how to do so are there within the feed-in tariff structure that is already in place in Germany.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para18"><a name="08043089000547">Let me finish with this point. The great message that I want the Minister to hear is that all parties throughout the House have stood solidly alongside each other on this issue, inviting the Government and the Minister to take hold of the reins and give a lead in the knowledge that there will be no political division. There should be no political division, particularly around an issue that the Government will in any case be forced to accept within a year. My concern is that I want to be part of a Labour Government who do not have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the present, let alone the future. That is why I ask the Minister yet again to take over the ownership of the new clause and incorporate it into the Bill, to continue the process of taking forward an issue that unites the whole House, and probably the whole country, in a real dynamic that will give us a sustainable energy future.</p>

 I begin by paying tribute to the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) both for tabling the new clause and for the immensely authoritative way in which he introduced it. He spoke about the importance of having Lily Allen and other celebrity endorsement. For many people, however, he is the star of this debate&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] He has been the driving force, putting the issue on the agenda so that it is no longer peripheral but absolutely mainstream to the whole energy debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08043089000549">As the hon. Gentleman said, we need to see the issue against the background of the immense challenge we face. If we are to come close to the European target of getting 20 per cent. of our energy from renewables by 2020, it translates into securing about 40 per cent. of our electricity generation from renewables. That is an immense challenge, but given our overall needs for renewable energy, not just electricity, it is a huge mountain that we have to climb. If we are to succeed, we need every bit of help we can get. It means having onshore and offshore wind; it means exploring the potential of the Severn barrage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08043089000550">On Monday, I was looking at the barrage in La Rance in France to see what lessons we can learn from it. We need to look into biomass, solar, thermal and ground sources, air source and heat pumps, and we need to look fundamentally at microgeneration. Our vision should be to make as many households as possible not consumers but generators of electricity. That is the nub of the whole debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80430-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08043089000551">Ten years ago, the UK and Germany started from the same low base in respect of generating electricity from renewables. Today, whereas we get 2 per cent. of our energy from renewables, Germany gets 8.5 per cent. That was a 1 per cent. increase in just one year in the amount of energy Germany gets from renewables&#151;the same amount that we got over a 10-year period. The key to Germany&#146;s success was the adoption of feed-in tariffs, which helped to drive the programme forward. There should be no doubt that the issue is of interest to more people than just politicians. There is widespread political interest in it, but all the experts in the sector looking at the issue from outside are also pushing in this direction. Today, Terry Barker, director of the Cambridge centre for climate change, which is engaged in mitigation research, and other experts published a letter in the <i> Financial Times</i>. It says:</p>

 My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. There is no specific provision in the new clause requiring that distinction to be made. Some would argue that a feed-in tariff would be appropriate for larger-scale generation. I think that the renewables obligation works well to encourage both kinds of generation and that we could run the two systems side by side, but nothing in the new clause requires such a decision to be made. The aim must be to achieve the optimal combination from different sources of power. In Germany, private individuals and investors are responsible for 90 per cent. of the investment in renewables, and just 10 per cent. of the investment comes from the major energy companies. In this country, the situation is not reversed; it is even worse than that.</p>

 The current system provides no incentive, although there is tremendous enthusiasm. At a meeting that I attended in my constituency recently, about 50 people were asked how many of them generated their own heat and electricity. About three hands went up. When they were asked how many would be interested in doing so, every hand went up. There is an enormous appetite for renewable generation. What is holding people back is the lack of the predictable income stream that could be achieved through feed-in tariffs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80430-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08043089000562">I have tabled a new clause and an amendment. New clause 17 concerns the way in which moneys are looked after. Before the renewables obligation, renewable developments were funded under contract to the Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency. The NFPA continues to operate contracts for existing developments. It auctions the renewables obligation certificates and renewables levy exemption certificates that arise from them, and uses the proceeds to service the contracts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80430-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08043089000563">Over time a surplus has built up, as the value of the ROCs and LECs has exceeded the cost of managing the contracts. Clearly that surplus has been contributed by customers for the purpose of renewables development. At present, however, that money simply sits on the Chancellor&#146;s balance sheet as yet another stealth tax. That was recognised in the Sustainable Energy Act 2003, which provided for &#163;60 million of the surplus to be spent on renewable energy. That funded the grants for round 1 of offshore wind and it has been fully spent. However, some &#163;180 million is currently sitting unused in the surplus account. It could be used to help to develop renewables, especially from market technologies that are further away from development at present, such as marine. The measure I propose would remove the statutory bar that prevents that money from being spent for the purposes for which consumers paid it. It gives the Government an option, but not a duty, to direct that that money is spent rather than treated as a hidden reserve. I hope the Minister will accept it as a step in the right direction.</p>

Indeed, the Energy Saving Trust suggested that by 2050 some 30 per cent. of our total electricity supply could be provided, in one way or another, by smaller-scale generation or microgeneration: by individuals or communities placing the surplus that they have gained from generation in their homes or communities in the grid, thereby adding to the total amount of power available to the general population. We must consider what kind of incentive is the most useful and important in securing that move forward. What will ensure that large amount of renewable generation at all levels, which will ensure that input across a more distributed electricity grid?</p>

That is a different form of motivation from the one that large energy generators thinking of investing in renewables will have at the front of their minds. They will want to know what the market will be like by the time they have considered and completed their investment and taken part in the build, and their investment, whatever it might be, is ready to produce for the market. They will also want to know what the market will be like during the life of that particular investment.

That is due, at least in part, to the security that the renewables obligation gives those installations and to the idea that they will therefore be able to export their product over a considerable period of time with the support of the renewables obligation behind them. As far as large-scale generation is concerned, it appears to me that the renewables obligation has begun to have a considerable effect.</p>

 Moving as rapidly as we would want from the position that the UK was in, for particular reasons relating to the source of its energy supplies and the choices that it made historically about those sources&#151;and therefore the mechanism by which those supplies would be delivered&#151;to where we know we have to get to in the near future with regard to the proportion of energy supply that comes from renewables sources, has been a considerable challenge, and will remain so. It is true that the planning environment has not helped in that process. The Planning Bill will address some of the issues of larger-scale renewable power stations and the Marine Bill, which will be introduced later this year, will provide a single permission regime for offshore generation. So things are changing, and so will the circumstances in which large-scale renewable sources operate.</p>

That represents a substantial change in large-scale electricity supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80430-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08043089000581">There are therefore several different factors affecting the development of large-scale renewable installations, one of which is the nature of the incentive for investment in the first place. The renewables obligation has generally worked relatively well to bring those investment decisions forward. However, the renewables obligation has barely touched microgeneration. As I have demonstrated, it is not a particular incentive for those who are developing microgeneration. A feed-in tariff would be a much better incentive in that area. The issue that we would then have to address, which is central to my concerns, is that we are not in a position to build incentives on a tabula rasa. We have a series of existing arrangements for developing power and the importation of renewable electricity that are based on the renewables obligation. If we chucked all those arrangements out of the window and went for a universal feed-in tariff tomorrow, that would fundamentally disrupt a number of the investment decisions on larger-scale electricity generation. In fact, large-scale electricity generation would be put in reverse.</p>

However, those who install solar photovoltaic panels export all the electricity generated from those panels into the grid, take a feed-in tariff for that and then buy all their domestic electricity from the grid. The perverse consequence of that is the lack of interchange between what those people produce from the panels on their roof and what they consume in their houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="80430-0014.htm_para19"><a name="08043089000585">It seems to me that one of the purposes of engaging in the development of microgeneration, particularly microgeneration that is locally sourced and distributed, is that there should be a relationship between the electricity consumed in the house and that produced by the roof panels. If the system does not connect the two, part of the purpose of such microgeneration is missed. That might be an accidental consequence, but it results from the design and operation of the feed-in tariff.</p>

The question for the House, as it was in Committee, is whether the amendment or a similar one should be left on the table or whether we should go for a vote. In order to ensure that we get things right and undertake the consultation over this summer that was suggested by my hon. Friend, the amendment should remain on the table&#151;it should not be withdrawn and never heard of again.

 I agree absolutely. During the Committee&#146;s evidence sessions, we specifically asked several expert witnesses whether the renewables obligation could continue alongside the introduction of feed-in tariffs, and the consistent view was that it could. Care must be taken with the introduction of such tariffs, but that is why the hon. Member for Nottingham, South has wisely included a provision in the new clause for a 12-month lead-in time. If that is not enough, we are doing something fundamentally wrong. If the Minister accepts new clause 4, he can really start to put his foot on the accelerator, if that is not an inappropriate phrase for a low-carbon debate.</p>

Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and my neighbour, the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who has been a controversial figure today, although he can make many welcome contributions to the green debate. New clause 11 highlights a problem with not only hydro-microgeneration, but the 50 kW definition for microgeneration, which is causing arguments in the wind energy sector. We need a flexible and adaptable approach to renewable energy that recognises real opportunities such as those offered by micro-hydro. It would be wonderful to see a traditional and highly environmentally-friendly form of energy coming back into wider use in a new and modern form, so I welcome new clause 11.</p>

Member for Angus (Mr. Weir), touches on an important issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso).

Indeed, amendment No. 65 appears to be modelled on a Liberal Democrat amendment tabled in Committee. The amendment is designed, as the hon.

The gist of it is that there is an urgent need to dismiss distractions and get on with what really needs to be done. I agree with the hon. Member for Wealden that new clause 4 is the single most important opportunity to ensure that that happens that we are being offered today.</p>

 I will not detain the House long. I have been struck by the fact that, as I am opposed to nuclear power being developed, I face the discipline of having to consider all the other forms of energy that might make up an efficient energy mix in future. I have considered what my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) said about feed-in tariffs; he explained better than I could that they are efficient, help to ensure security of supply, and help to produce a plurality in the energy market that would otherwise not be there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80430-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08043089000612">I am also struck by the idea that if we are not careful we will construct a process that is very much in the hands of big power, whether that is nuclear power or any of the array of providers that will be in place. The process that my hon. Friend outlined involves a democratisation of the argument; I wish that he had said a bit more about that. New clause 4 would bring local people into the process in a different way, and would produce a plurality in the market that could generate efficiency. To people who are interested in competition, I add that it would create greater, better and efficient competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80430-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08043089000613">Some of my hon. Friends are concerned about how the measures fit with the other obligations. As I understand it, new clause 4 says, &#147;Go and consider the issue for 12 months, and come up with mechanisms that produce not conflict but co-operation and collaboration that results in the best of both worlds.&#148; I would have thought that the term, &#147;a third way&#148;, might have been tempting for some Labour Members. The new clause also does other things: it imposes a discipline on us to ensure that what I have outlined happens. I say to my hon. Friends that the review in the summer and the other measures mentioned are necessary&#151;in fact, they should happen in any event; they are just matters of efficiency&#151;but if the new clause is added to the Bill, it will provide the discipline that will ensure that things happen in a structured way. It will give the House the capacity to understand, monitor and control the process, so that it comes back to us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80430-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08043089000614">Let me reinforce the point that the new clause is one way of ensuring that, in future, individuals can understand where they are, in terms of the consumption, supply and generation of electricity, because it allows communities to get involved, as well as individuals. It allows collective capacity; it is not just about an individual putting a windmill on their roof. The measure is about communities, planning, consent, and co-operation. To me, the democracy argument is as important as the efficiency argument.</p>

That was suggested to me by those who were involved in the DOWNVInD programme, which I am told is one of the largest renewable energy research and technology development programmes in Europe. The project is funded by Talisman Energy and Scottish and Southern Energy, with significant contributions in kind from many of its 18 other participants from seven EU countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="80430-0015.htm_para15"><a name="08043089000617">I understand that in addition to private capital, the project received research funding from the European Commission&#146;s sixth framework research and technology development programme, the then Department of Trade and Industry&#146;s new and renewable energy programme, and the Scottish Government&#146;s science and technology development programme. The public sector support for the project was predicated on the observation that offshore wind was an emerging technology confined to shallow near-shore waters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80430-0015.htm_para16"><a name="08043089000618">The DOWNVInD programme was essential to move the offshore wind technology to deeper waters more distant from shore, and was obviously looking to the future of offshore wind.

Special arrangements will apply to projects in receipt of capital grants, but that would mean that if projects qualified for up-banding, they would have to pay back some of the research grant, as proposed new section 32E(5)(a) sets out:</p>

However, the wording means that projects such as DOWNVInD would become subject to the regulations and would no longer be able to get ROCs. They would never be able to move beyond the demonstration stage because they would be unable to produce energy and get the benefit of ROCs.</p>

If they are to produce electricity, they need access to the ROC procedure. However, under the provisions as written, that would not happen. I ask the Minister to reconsider that point and not to put at risk projects such as DOWNVInD and the tidal and wave development project in the Pentland firth. Such projects require the grants to get off the ground in the first instance, but they also need the support of ROCs, as do those involving other renewable technologies.</p>

If the intention behind the new clause is to do away with that discrimination&#151;and I think that it is&#151;I wholeheartedly support it.

I am disappointed because this legislative vehicle has nothing to promote renewable energy, with the exception of the banded renewables obligation certificates, which are welcome. However, that is only one measure, and we need a comprehensive policy framework. New clauses 4, 20 and 21 form part of a proposed comprehensive framework.

However, the ROCs are still expensive to administer and still provide uncertain value; the redemption value of a ROC is not fixed, so there is still investment uncertainty. It is still worth considering feed-in tariffs not only for microgeneration, for which they are clearly the only workable approach, but as a parallel mechanism for larger, commercial-scale generation.

That is not the sole secret of Germany&#146;s success&#151;it is just one measure contained in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act, which also contains many other vital provisions. New clause 20 would carry out the proposed EU renewable energy directive, which is itself based on the German Act. The two most important provisions concern grid access. In this country, we have the bizarre situation whereby 15 GW of totally approved wind generation cannot get access to the grid, and will not get access for many years. That is a totally unacceptable situation that we must do something about if we are getting serious. New clause 20 proposes that there should be guaranteed access to the grid for renewable generators. If that means that the grid needs to be strengthened or reinforced or to have new lines laid, then so be it&#151;the grid operators would have to do that. They would have to raise the capital in the normal commercial way, and Ofgem would have to approve it. That is what happens in Germany, and it works.

That is the provision in the renewable energy directive and the provision that holds good in Germany under the Renewable Energy Sources Act, and that is what new clause 20 would provide. Whichever financial incentive mechanism we use, whether multi-banded ROCs or feed-in tariffs, if we do not have the facility to take the electricity and use it, it is of no value.

They are also technologies that at the moment are commercially difficult because they are expensive, because of their situation and, in the case of wave and tidal stream, because they are emerging new technologies&#151;the first commercial tidal stream machinery has only just been installed. Naturally, such technologies cannot match the cost of other generating technologies at this time. Investment decisions, therefore, will have to be finely balanced. To add 2p or 3p per kW extra in transmission charges could be the straw that breaks the camel&#146;s back, and such investment does not happen.</p>

There is a mechanism for dealing with the matter in section 185 of the Energy Act, and new clause 21 would amend that. Section 185 provides for a power to cap transmission charges and the Secretary of State can do that by nominating one&#151;only one, as the Act is currently drafted&#151;specific zone for the production of renewable energy. However, it may be necessary to have more than one. Subsection (2) of the new clause would replace &#147;a&#148; with &#147;any&#148; so that the Secretary of State has freedom of choice. He can select any of several, or more, suitable areas to which to apply the capping powers. The other deficiency in section 185 is that it contains sunset provisions. The import of three of its subsections is that the capping protection cannot last for more than 10 years. That will not give investors any confidence in commercial stability either. I found that provision difficult to understand at the time, and equally difficult now.</p>

New clause 21 is a further addition, and new clause 19 was not selected but refers to Ofgem&#146;s responsibilities.

 I want to speak about new clause 11, which deals with hydro-microgeneration. Before doing so, let me express my enthusiastic support for the new clause and the remarks of the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson). If the new clause were accepted, it would do some of what I am trying to achieve in stimulating the growth of hydro-microgeneration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80430-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08043089000640">It is frustrating that we appear to spend so much time in this country hugging ourselves, congratulating ourselves and telling ourselves how wonderfully wise, green and environmentally friendly we are and that we are world beaters, when much of the outside world passes us by and gets ahead of us through mechanisms that are available to us if only we would use them. I say to the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) that I see no purpose in agreeing with an amendment and then letting it lie on the table. It should not lie on the table; it should be activated. The Minister would be advised to accept the new clause today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80430-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08043089000641">I do not pretend that hydro-microgeneration is the answer to all our renewable energy problems&#151;of course it is not. It is a small part of the portfolio of renewables that we need. Patently, not everybody has a house on a river with a mill. Hydro-microgeneration will not therefore be a huge contributor, but it is part of the process. I am a great believer in decentralisation and finding small solutions and putting them together to make a big difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80430-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08043089000642">Hydro-microgeneration represents a small but significant part of the renewables market. I had the great pleasure of helping to open a new facility in my constituency last year. Tellisford mill is an old water mill in a beautiful place. Anthony Battersby and his wife Rachel have done a wonderful job in investing in a new water turbine in the mill. They not only provide energy from a renewable source but are socially and environmentally aware in being good neighbours. The mill is not like some renewable energy sources, with which people have a problem. We are considering an old mill, which is being used for the same purpose for which it was used 200 years ago, and that is good. It produces renewable energy for 65 houses, which is good news.</p>

We also have the South Somerset Hydropower Group and the Stour and Vale Hydro Group, which is based in Dorset. Between Somerset and Dorset, more than 100 water turbines provide renewable energy. However, everyone involved in the process says that the difficulty of getting past the existing bureaucracy is such a disincentive that they often feel as though they are banging their heads against a brick wall. I want to illustrate and address those frustrations in my remarks.</p>

 I am pleased to co-sponsor new clause 11. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that another issue that we should examine closely is flood prevention? Much as we need to generate electricity&#151;that is the point of new clause 11&#151;if we get that right, we will also remove the flood risks that will inevitably follow if we do not manage the water properly.</p>

<p><a name="st_o274"><a name="08043089000647"><a name="80430-0016.htm_spnew6"><a name="08043089001022"><b>Mr. Heath:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right. A sensible community would manage a whole river basin in a much more sustainable way than we do now. We are trying to do that in Somerset and some other parts of the country, but that means taking energy from the river, using appropriate storage of water to prevent flooding and using the entire ecosystem in a water basin in the most effective way, so the hon. Gentleman is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80430-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08043089000648">What are the current difficulties? The Minister knows what they are, because I have written to him, as have those who operate the mills, who have also had meetings with his Department and tried to explain the issues. The principal issue is the definition of microgeneration for hydro power. We have mixed definitions of the maximum allowable in microgeneration, but the most effective one, including in respect of the renewables obligation certificate, is a maximum of 50 kW. However, a great number of water turbines generate between 50 kW and 100 kW. I accept that 50 kW is a perfectly viable maximum for many renewable sources; one would need quite a large photovoltaic array on top of one&#146;s house to reach 50 kW. However, that is not a large figure for a water turbine. Indeed, at its best, the technology used in the new water turbines generally produces more than 50 kW.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80430-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08043089000649">We conducted a survey of the 100 or so mill installations that I have mentioned in Somerset and Dorset. That survey could be taken as proving the Government&#146;s point. The majority of those mills&#151;89 of them&#151;generated less than 50 kW and only 13 generated more. However, those 13 generated more electricity than the other 89 put together. If we are interested in getting the maximum yield of renewable electricity, the 50 kW cut-off is absurd.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80430-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08043089000650">Because 50 kW is the cut-off for the double ROC, those who have installed such facilities or who intend to do so have a strange decision: either they run their installation at less than full capacity, in order to keep within the double ROC maximum, or they take a financial loss. What sort of policy nonsense is it to have renewable capacity, but run it at less than full capacity? There is of course an extra financial loss, because the 50 kW maximum is also used for the income tax exemption, so there is a double hit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80430-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08043089000651">The other financial difficulty that many people face concerns the grid connection, which has already been mentioned. I am told that a 400 m connection can cost &#163;16,500. That is a lot of money on top of the initial capital outlay already required. Oddly enough, mills are usually on rivers and are not normally very close to communities; therefore, there is an inherent cost in providing the infrastructure required to run a renewable installation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80430-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08043089000652">The second issue that I want to raise is the licensing regime. It seems that the Environment Agency has never talked to the energy Department, in whatever form it has taken, about what is needed. If one tries to get a water abstraction licence for one&#146;s water mill, one might be told that one needs an abstraction licence, an impoundment licence or a transfer licence&#151;one might even be told to get all three. All that for water that never leaves the river. It goes into a leat, is used by the turbine and is returned to the river. It is nonsense to call that an abstraction, yet all those licences are obligations, dealt with by the Environment Agency, that have to be paid for. One has to apply for them and go through all the bureaucracy that comes with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80430-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08043089000653">There is no consistency in the way that the system is applied. I have two mills in my constituency, one of which I have mentioned. Tellisford has an impoundment licence, while Stowford, which is a little further down the stream, has an abstraction licence. The mills do the same thing, but the Environment Agency is determined that they need different licences, whereas another mill on the same river, Lullington, needs all three licences. Surely, it is not beyond the wit of the Government to devise a single licensing regime for hydro-microgeneration that obviates what I describe, particularly given that water is not being abstracted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80430-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08043089000654">Not only does one need a licence, but one has to report daily on abstraction. No water is leaving the watercourse, but one still has to report to the Environment Agency every day about how much water has been abstracted from the stream into the leat, and how much has passed back from the leat into the river. It is the same amount on either side. That is also nonsense. Each year, from every mill, 365 flow readings go to the Environment Agency, which I doubt is desperate for more work, but that achieves nothing because the same water is going in and out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80430-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08043089000655">Another issue that the Environment Agency is very concerned about is reserved flow, but for all the reasons that I have given, there is no consequence from a mill stream taking water into a loop and then feeding it back into the main watercourse. The stream has probably done that for hundreds of years. That is not a new thing; it was there before the water turbine and will be there after it, but the Environment Agency thinks it an important thing to measure. Interestingly, an Environment Agency officer said to Mr. Battersby, who gave me this information:</p>
<a name="80430-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="08043089000703"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are very good at measuring change, but absolute rubbish at deciding if it matters or not.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80430-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08043089000657">The final subject that I want to talk about is fish. I do not want to be unkind to fish. They are very important, and I do not want to do anything that would be detrimental to the safety or health of the various species. The Environment Agency considers water turbines to be a major hazard to fish, even in a stream that has no migrating species. I understand the need to put facilities in a stream along which salmon or trout migrate and need a passage through a weir or need to bypass a turbine, but not if there are no migrating species. If the weir has been there for hundreds of years, the fish, if they have any species memory, will presumably know that it is there by now, and will use the main river course instead, rather than  <br>

Because of the importance of getting our reforms of the RO right, it has taken some time for the Government&#151;consulting industry and others&#151;to develop the proposals. To ensure that developers continued to contribute new investment in the interim, we made a commitment to allow any projects becoming operational after 11 July 2006, before the banding proposals come into effect, to benefit from the greater levels of support afforded through banding. A tidal power station coming on stream tomorrow would receive two ROCs per MWh when banding comes into effect. There was a significant risk that, without such a commitment, developers would hold back vital investment in renewables while waiting for the increased levels of support to kick in.

It is important for that power to remain in the Bill so that when a banded RO is introduced generators can make a commercial decision on the path that they prefer, while ensuring both that state aid rules are not infringed and that consumers and taxpayers are given value for money.

The text of the first part of this amendment, which relates to electricity, comes from the draft EU renewables directive. Before I start analysing the provisions further, I should make it clear that once the Commission&#146;s proposals for priority access are finished and the directive agreed, these proposals could be implemented in the UK in a number of ways, not all of them involving primary legislation. We need to be careful not to implement something now just because we have the legislative opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80430-0017.htm_para7"><a name="080430114000083">Turning to the substance of the amendment, the first issue is that there is no current definition of priority access. Without a clear meaning of priority access, it would be difficult to avoid uncertainty, which would impact on existing generators and those planning future investments. That could discourage investments and would have serious repercussions on the meeting of our energy needs and targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80430-0017.htm_para8"><a name="080430114000084">The next issue is whether priority access is both consistent with our wider energy policy goals and the best route to accelerate the growth in renewable generation.

reliable electricity system. In this context, we are considering reforms to grid access arrangements as part of the transmission access review with Ofgem, to ensure that the regulatory framework remains fit for purpose in the medium and long term, and to speed up the connection of renewable generation. It is clear from this work that there are ways in which we could significantly improve the connection opportunities for renewable generation. We will set out that analysis when the final report of the review is published in May. However, it is important also to remember that from the perspective of a renewable developer, connection in a reasonable time consistent with the development programme for their project timetable is likely to be more important than whether they have been treated more favourably than other technologies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80430-0017.htm_para9"><a name="080430114000085">On the second part of the new clause, which is not part of the EU directive I mentioned earlier, let me reiterate what I said in Committee: the Government are keen to support and investigate the cost-effective potential of renewable gas to contribute to the UK share of the EU target to achieve 20 per cent. of the EU&#146;s energy from renewables by 2020. Renewable gas, or biogas, is produced by feeding organic material such as food waste, sewage sludge, animal slurries or energy crops into an anaerobic digestion plant, or from the decomposition of organic matter in landfill sites. It is important to remember that through this Bill anaerobic digestion&#151;the biomethane it produces&#151;will achieve two ROCs under the revised and reformed RO procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80430-0017.htm_para10"><a name="080430114000086">By removing the carbon dioxide and other impurities, biogas can also be used to make biomethane. Theoretically, it is possible to inject biomethane directly on to the gas network in the UK, provided that the biomethane can meet the gas quality standards and pressure requirements of the national grid. The &#147;Heat Call for Evidence&#148; invited contributions on the potential of biomethane, the barriers to its deployment, and how best to tackle these. We will be feeding these considerations into our broader work on the renewable energy strategy. Until we have reviewed the evidence about the costs and processes involved in upgrading biogas to biomethane and injecting it into the gas system, we cannot judge what potential unintended or undesirable consequences might flow from the changes to the duties of the Secretary of State and the authority that are being proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80430-0017.htm_para11"><a name="080430114000087">Moreover, we need to look at this matter in the round. We need to assess how biomethane fits with the ongoing work to develop a new renewable energy strategy by spring 2009. That will include looking at all renewable heat technologies and potential support mechanisms, rather than focusing on a single technology, as the new clause does. The kind of market enablement that it would provide thus seems entirely premature, and I ask hon. Members not to press it to a Division.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80430-0017.htm_para12"><a name="080430114000088">New clause 21 proposes changing section 185 of the Energy Act 2004. Section 185 was introduced as a transitional provision to ease the implementation of cost-reflective transmission in Scotland. It allows the Secretary of State to adjust transmission charges in a particular area of the country to help to mitigate any material hindrance to renewables development caused by the charges.</p>

that set time limits on the duration of a scheme adjusting transmission charges, and removing the requirement that only one scheme can be in force under section 185 at any one time. We are in the process of analysing whether there is a case for adjusting transmission charges on the Scottish islands under section 185. Renewable developers also face other practical issues, and that fact, along with section 185&#146;s narrow focus on transmission charges, makes me believe that it is not the right instrument for supporting the development of renewables for the country as a whole.</p>

We did so, first, to introduce flexibility in the timing of our annual energy report and, secondly, to remove statutory requirements that are either replicated elsewhere or are over-prescriptive. I believe it is right that we streamline our reporting requirements to ensure that our report is topical. We need reporting to be sufficiently flexible so as to allow us to exclude less relevant technologies and to include more relevant ones as developments dictate. Our changes facilitate that and, as such, we should retain them as part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80430-0017.htm_para16"><a name="080430114000092">There was some concern in Committee that we were repealing the requirement to report on energy efficiency. Let me reassure hon. Members that that important issue will still be covered in a number of reports produced by Government: under the Housing Act 2004, we are required to report on energy efficiency targets in residential accommodation; we produce the UK energy efficiency action plan, which we will regularly update as required under the EU services directive; and we would also expect to capture energy efficiency issues as part of our reporting on carbon emissions in the annual sustainable energy report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80430-0017.htm_para17"><a name="080430114000093">I hope I can also reassure the House that we will still be reporting on the important issue of security of supply through the energy markets outlook, which is a commitment from the 2007 energy White Paper, and as a result of the duties to report under two EU directives relating to supply of gas and electricity. I remain convinced that those reports will cover the practical information on security of supply in which Parliament and wider stakeholders would be interested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80430-0017.htm_para18"><a name="080430114000094">Our proposals to create some flexibility in the reporting period and cycle were designed to ensure that we could publish a report that was as relevant as possible by timing its publication around the availability of the most recent data. Such an approach would also allow us to join up with the reporting cycle proposed in the Climate Change Bill. I therefore listened with interest to the concerns being raised in Committee that our proposal to introduce flexibility on the reporting period and publication date could raise the spectre of the Government being tempted to use that flexibility to take the opportunity to delay publication of our report in order to obscure bad news. That was never our intention. The Government take the issue of reporting progress very seriously.</p>

The renewables obligation has been hugely successful since its implementation in 2002, adding some 2 GW of  new renewable capacity. Hon. Members sometimes underestimate the momentum now behind renewables in this country and therefore inadvertently talk down the great efforts that have been made by that sector. In addition to the 2 GW that we now have, the renewables obligation has also been the major incentive for the 1.5 GW of renewables capacity that is now under construction, the 6.5 GW that has been consented and is awaiting construction and the 10 GW that is now in the planning process. That amounts to an additional 18 GW of pipeline projects in just six years of operation.</p>

I do not accept the criticism that we have stalled or are moving slowly on this issue. We started from a low base, and Opposition Members can explain that, because it did not occur under our stewardship&#151;although that is rarely recognised in speeches.

We should remember that Germany has benefited from a consistent supportive policy, as the Secretary of State reminded us, since the early 1990s&#151;a period when I had no responsibility for such matters. The consistency of that approach has been a big part of Germany&#146;s success, giving investors a solid base in which to invest. Consistency is important in relation to the renewables obligation, which is why I mention it. Whatever the merits of feed-in tariffs in other countries, we need to consider what will work best in the UK. I know that it is sometimes tempting to go to a country such as Germany and say that everything looks greener, but we need to beware of simple comparisons.</p>

 As far as Germany is concerned, we must remember that the endgame of all the different mechanisms is to reduce carbon emissions. Again, I refuse to accept the simple comparison that suggests that Germany is in a better place than we are&#151;</p>

 I shall explain what I mean, as I want to be helpful to the hon. Gentleman. Per capita carbon dioxide emissions of 9,937 kg in the UK compare with 10,936 kg in Germany, which suggests that something is going right here. Moreover, energy use per capita is significantly higher in Germany than it is in the UK. We have to careful about comparisons, because the endgame is about two things&#151;climate change and energy security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para2"><a name="080430114000124">On consistency, industry representatives have told us again and again that they want the Government to ensure that decisions are implemented as quickly as possible so that investors can rely on a stable and consistent policy framework. We have given that commitment, so the new clause could have an effect opposite to what those who propose it intend. Industry and investors have told us that it would be likely to create uncertainty in the market that would lead to delays in new investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para3"><a name="080430114000125">We are moving forward with reforming the RO. Indeed, the Bill amends the RO to make it sensitive, and it will remain the main policy mechanism for renewable electricity. Any move that threatens to replace the RO would destroy investor confidence and would be likely to result in significant delays to projects coming on line. That could put the delivery of the EU emissions target at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para4"><a name="080430114000126">The Government have also received a clear steer from industry that financial support for large-scale generation is not the main barrier to delivering more renewable energy. We are also working hard, as colleagues know, to address a range of other factors, including the planning system and grid access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para5"><a name="080430114000127">I want to turn now to smaller-scale generation.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Many of us accept that there has been consistency in Germany about the feed-in tariff, and that we have been consistent about ROs, but all sorts of new micro-technologies are being developed and my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) has made a persuasive case about them. The Minister is about to deal with those new micro- technologies, but is he prepared to look at different ways to incentivise that new sector that would not disturb the consistency that he has described?</p>

 As I anticipated, my right hon. Friend&#146;s question leads me into the next section of my argument. It is important, because I sometimes think that there is a bit of confusion in the debate about renewable instruments&#151;that is, feed-in tariffs as opposed  <br>

to ROs. Are we talking about how to incentivise all renewable projects, macro as well as micro, or is the House mainly interested in microgeneration? That is why I now want to discuss smaller-scale generation, which has been the subject of much debate in the media and in this House, especially over the past week or so but also for a longer period of time. I recognise the great support for the early-day motion. I sympathise with, and fully support, people&#146;s yearning for appropriate incentives to encourage the faster take-up of microgeneration. Several hon. Members will know that I have long been an advocate of microgeneration, both in principle and through my attempted practice as a citizen. I have long held the view that if we are to tackle climate change and global warming, there will be important roles for big institutions&#151;the EU, the G8 and the United Nations&#151; big Governments and big corporations. There is also a need for a proper carbon market. However, I have also always taken the view that we need to empower more of our concerned citizens&#151;the recycling generation, if I may call them that, who want to do something about their dwellings and community buildings&#151;to be active citizens on behalf of the environment.</p>

 Let me make some progress before I come back to my hon. Friend&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Give way!&#148;] I do not think that I will, because my hon. Friend is eager to hear my argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para6"><a name="080430114000134">Under the low-carbon building programme, we have made some &#163;86 million available in capital grants to reduce the cost of buying and installing equipment. We have removed the need for planning permission for domestic installations that have little or no impact beyond the host property. People have called for that for some time, and the Government&#151;the Department for Communities and Local Government&#151;have listened. We have also announced double the support for all microgeneration technologies under the RO, once banding is introduced. That support will be maintained after the first banding review of 2013.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para7"><a name="080430114000135">We often hear that the RO is complex, especially for microgeneration, compared with Germany&#146;s feed-in tariff. I understand that there are 500 different feed-in tariffs in Germany, with about 120 to 150 more tariffs being added each year. That is not the simple, straightforward picture that some people assume is the case. However, we are not complacent about the changes required to simplify our RO. In April 2007, we introduced the use of agents within the RO. Since then, the number of microgenerators accredited under the RO has increased by more than 250 per cent. We have simplified the accreditation form, and such forms can now be completed and submitted online.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para8"><a name="080430114000136">Additionally, suppliers are voluntarily, albeit supported by the RO, offering a tariff system for electricity generation from microgeneration&#151;really, a feed-in tariff. For example, Scottish and Southern Energy is offering 18p a kWh to small generators for their electricity that is exported to the grid. However, that is not all. We will launch a consultation this summer on what we should do to increase renewable energy use to meet our share of the EU 2020 target.  <br>

That will cover a broad range of issues and involve collaborative efforts across Government and with business, consumers and the wider community. The proposals will strive for the best value for money for UK taxpayers and consumers. As the Prime Minister explained in November, we want a serious national debate about how to achieve our targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para9"><a name="080430114000137">Some hon. Members will be aware that I announced in Committee that as part of the strategy, we will examine a range of options further to support microgeneration, including a consideration of whether a feed-in tariff might be a better support mechanism than the renewables obligation for small-scale generation&#151;I am thinking of domestic dwellings, community schemes, small civic buildings and small businesses. It would not be right to impose a requirement to introduce a feed-in tariff now without first carefully examining precisely how it would operate, whether there might be better alternatives, and the impact that it might have. We need to be confident that any legislation covers all scenarios and does not impact negatively on existing legislation. In my view, such work can be taken forward only in the wider context of what else we might do to meet our target.</p>

 I had nearly given up. I appreciate a great deal of what my hon. Friend the Minister says. There are lessons to be learned from Germany; one of them is that Germany is still proposing new coal-fired power stations without carbon capture and storage, so it is not all green on the other side of the street. My question is: if a group of people want to come together to set up some kind of community microgeneration, why should we set an artificial cap on the power that the group can generate? I think that he is saying that we would artificially cap microgeneration at, say, 50 kW to preserve the renewables obligation.</p>

 As we saw in the case of micro-hydro, there is always the issue of where one draws the line, yes? [Hon. Members: &#147;Yes!&#148;] I am happy to draw the line under the positive arguments that I am putting forward. <i> [Laughter.]</i> It is nice to amuse the latecomers. As I have said, I recognise that there is a financial gap in the renewable energy strategy, and that there is a need for a new financial incentive. We will look properly at feed-in tariffs&#151;I said that weeks ago; I am not just saying it today&#151;and at other mechanisms for householders and community schemes. I understand the importance of what my hon. Friend says, because renewables should not solely be about big corporations doing things to local communities. We should enable communities to do things for themselves as part of the active citizen agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para10"><a name="080430114000143">I hope that hon. Members are reassured that we are taking the issues seriously. After the renewable energy strategy, we will bring forward appropriate proposals&#151;including proposals for legislation, if necessary&#151;as soon as possible. I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South to consider withdrawing new clause 4 in light of my comments.</p>

<p><a name="st_o315"><a name="080430114000144"><a name="80430-0018.htm_spnew21"><a name="080430114000871"><b>Alan Simpson:</b>
 I have listened to the concerns and arguments that the Minister has put forward. Let me try to address two of his concerns, and then his arguments. The first concern is about the commitment that he has already made to considering the issue of microgeneration. The great difficulty is that there is a whole series of issues that the Government have agreed to consider. For instance, they agreed to look at the 2010 fuel poverty targets. Unfortunately, having done so, they decided that the targets were too difficult to reach, and that we will not meet them, so that commitment will not get us out of the mess that we are in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para11"><a name="080430114000145">Secondly, the Minister expressed concern about the fact that if a feed-in tariff scheme were applied too widely, it could create chaos. He did not mention the fact that he would be in charge of determining how widely the scheme would apply, so the chaos would be his, as is the current chaos. We have to recognise that although good things that are beginning to happen, they are beginning to happen in a country that is at the bottom of the European renewables league. There is nothing in our programme that will allow us to meet the 2010 targets to which we have committed ourselves. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para12"><a name="080430114000146">What we are asking colleagues to vote for, through the new clause, is a commitment on the part of the Government to come back within a year with a framework that sets out how we would introduce appropriate feed-in tariff legislation that applies to the different technologies and to electricity generation, heat generation and the production of biogas. We are talking about a timetable, more than anything else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para13"><a name="080430114000147">Let me explain the significance of the timetable. Last December, our Government sent Ministers to the conference on climate change in Bali. The scientists reporting to that conference said to global leaders that in the next five to eight years we will determine the fate of the generations that will follow. It is what we do in those five to eight years that will determine whether we pass the tipping-point for climate chaos or not. We cannot avoid having to deal with the crises ahead of us, but we do not need to allow chaos to develop. That requires us to act on a dramatic scale now. There is nothing in the framework before the House that will allow us or equip us to take that step. I am asking colleagues from all parties in the House to have the courage to take that step.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para14"><a name="080430114000148">I know that many of us have mentioned the name of Lily Allen during the debate, but I hope she will forgive me if I end with some lines from another singer, Tracy Chapman, who sung:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80430-0018.htm_para15"><a name="080430114000149">Consultations without commitments are as good as none. The House today has the opportunity to make a commitment that crosses party divides, that crosses interests in society, but that unites us in a commitment to deliver something meaningful and sustainable. I hope we have the courage to do so.</p>

debate this afternoon. Many people have been worried about the possibility of a link between childhood leukaemia and electromagnetic fields from high-voltage power cables. As mentioned in Committee, the Department of Health funded the Draper report, which found that children living within 200 m of high-voltage power lines from birth had a 70 per cent. increased risk of developing childhood leukaemia. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Government have received recommendations for action on the matter from the Health Protection Agency, from SAGE, which is the Government&#146;s stakeholder group, and from Back Benchers, who carried out a public inquiry under the direction of my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson). <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

<p><a name="st_o319"><a name="080430114000626"><a name="80430-0019.htm_spnew3"><a name="080430114001339"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b>
 Order. The House really must come to order for the remaining part of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="st_o320"><a name="080430114000627"><a name="80430-0019.htm_spnew4"><a name="080430114001340"><b>Dr. Iddon:</b>
 The inquiry looked at the possible links between childhood leukaemia and EMF from the high-voltage power lines. The passage of the Energy Bill has provided the Government with an ideal opportunity to implement what we regard as precautionary measures to protect children&#146;s health. The Electricity Act 1989 provides the Secretary of State and the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, which is Ofgem&#146;s governing body, with a duty to protect the public from dangers arising from the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity. However, the Act specifies that that duty does not apply to applications for high-voltage overhead power lines. Subsections (1) and (2) of the new clause would remove that exemption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80430-0019.htm_para3"><a name="080430114000628">Electricity companies are subject to strict regulation, which is dominated by pricing factors. They will give only as much consideration to this issue as they are legally obliged to. A statutory responsibility to consider public health when installing new overhead power lines would allow the electricity companies to take precautionary measures and allay the concerns about passing on costs to the consumer. A statutory responsibility might also encourage creative solutions from the private sector concerning ways to reduce and prevent EMF exposure, or even industry voluntary codes on prudent avoidance, which would minimise cost to industry and electricity consumers. The other subsections of the new clause would give the Minister other powers allowing him to protect the public health of young children who live in close proximity to high-voltage power lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80430-0019.htm_para4"><a name="080430114000629">The new clause would mandate the electricity transmission companies to put their new power lines as far away from buildings in which people live or work as possible. Given that a new power line will be built across Scotland shortly and that a major new power line will bring transmission from Scotland to the north of England, the new clause is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80430-0019.htm_para5"><a name="080430114000630">In view of the limited time available, I hope that the Government will give the matter further consideration, if not today, because of lack of time, in the other place. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80430-0020.htm_para26"><a name="080430114000705">The Bill also creates a new regulatory framework for offshore carbon dioxide storage projects.

 No, I do not. However, I agree with the slightly different proposition that the UK is among a small group of lead nations on CCS. If we consider those that take the matter seriously and are pursuing demonstration projects, we cannot include many countries. With Norway and one or two others, we are a lead nation. I made that point earlier when quarrelling with the idea that the German grass is necessarily greener. I am proud that the UK will spend considerable amounts of public money demonstrating the application of CCS. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to put that on the record.</p>

strategy is to support investment, the Government have a responsibility to ensure that adequate protections are in place to ensure that the environment is protected and that the risk of costs falling to the Government is minimised. The Bill strengthens the existing decommissioning regime for both offshore renewables and oil and gas installations. The amendment that the Government have made to that area of the Bill will ensure that our legislation supports an active oil and gas sector in the UK continental shelf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="80430-0020.htm_para32"><a name="080430114000713">We have always been clear that developers and operators of new nuclear power, not the Government, must meet the full costs of decommissioning and their full share of waste management and disposal costs. The Bill provides the new legislative framework to ensure that all operators have in place a funded waste and decommissioning programme before operation of a power station commences. It will be a criminal offence to operate new nuclear power stations without an approved programme in place. To ensure that potential investors fully understand their liabilities, the Government have committed to establishing a fixed price for the disposal of new nuclear waste, which will be based on expected costs, including a significant risk premium.</p>

 Does the Minister not agree, however, that in order to encourage the investment that we need in capacity of all kinds, in both oil and gas and electricity generation, we need low and stable taxes? Is he becoming concerned, as many business people are, that taxes are now rather high, unstable and capricious, and often enforced rather unpleasantly by the Revenue?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman has found a nuclear peg on which to hang a familiar theme. When I talk to commercial operators, I am encouraged to find a great deal of confidence in the UK regime. That is important, given the significant amounts of investment that we will need in the next 10 or so years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="80430-0020.htm_para33"><a name="080430114000716">I am pleased that today&#146;s amendment to the Bill will enable us to add greater transparency to the process, by making it explicit in the Bill that the Government have the power to enter into the fixed price arrangement. The measures in the Bill reflect the fact that fossil fuels will continue to play a role in a diverse energy mix, alongside low-carbon generating options. As such, the amendments that the Bill makes to oil and gas regulation are designed to support ongoing production from the UK continental shelf and to reflect the evolving commercial environment in the oil and gas sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="80430-0020.htm_para34"><a name="080430114000717">Finally, we have introduced an enabling power to underpin the roll-out of smart meters, to medium-sized businesses in the first instance, but potentially to all energy consumers, including domestic customers. The Bill also contains a number of more minor areas of legislation. As a whole, the Bill will improve our regulatory framework and help create the right environment to encourage timely investment in diverse, increasingly low-carbon energy sources. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

The passage of any legislation takes a lot of work. We are grateful for their professionalism and assiduous attention to the way the House works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="80430-0021.htm_para0"><a name="080430114000719">The Bill does not really live up to its title. It has come out of Committee after hours of exhaustive debate, but has been largely untouched by the wisdom of colleagues from any part of the House. There has been a clarification here and a little syntactical tweak there, but it is a pretty thin document that waits to be sent to the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="80430-0021.htm_para1"><a name="080430114000720">The Bill&#146;s lack of scope and ambition&#151;problems that we identified at the start of its passage&#151;reflect a regrettable absence of decision making in Whitehall. There is some evidence of strategic thought, however. In the past 10 years, there have been innumerable White Papers and lots of reports and reviews, but when it comes to taking what the Prime Minister enjoys calling &#147;tough, long-term decisions&#148;, Ministers have mumbled their excuses and hidden from their responsibilities. Creating yet another review or holding yet another consultation might seem like a great listening exercise, but it does not give us the action that we need as quickly as we need it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="80430-0021.htm_para2"><a name="080430114000721">The one thing that we have got out of the Bill is a raft of consultations&#151;no fewer than six&#151;on a series of subjects that we have been talking about and consulting on for years, including microgeneration, decentralised energy and feed-in tariffs, which the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) argued for so persuasively this afternoon. Other subjects for consultation include smart meters, the role of Ofgem and priority access to the grid. Only this afternoon, yet another three consultations on smart meters were announced. There is nothing in that list that anyone in the energy industry finds particularly revolutionary any more. Most of it is quite well known and largely uncontroversial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="80430-0021.htm_para3"><a name="080430114000722">Those ideas have become basic, additional measures that would help the Government to meet their stiff targets on renewables and emissions for 2020 and 2050. I suspect that if we do not put some of them in place right now, today, we will curse our lack of urgency in 10 years&#146; time. It is a great shame that the Government have been unable to find room in what is supposed to be a broad Energy Bill for many of the amendments that have been debated. However, they might be pressed more rigorously in another place.</p>

The Bill is not really an Energy Bill, but a Bill to facilitate nuclear power and create arrangements for decommissioning, all of which is fair enough. When the Government published their White Paper in January, we made it clear that we supported their signal that nuclear power had a role to play in our future generating mix, but we sought particular assurances that there would be no subsidy. We also asked for clarity on the regime for new waste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="80430-0021.htm_para5"><a name="080430114000724">The funded decommissioning statements that will provide financial cover for companies, and security for the taxpayer, seem to be a satisfactory way of proceeding, but we look forward to examining the details with more scrutiny in coming weeks and months.

Despite the Secretary of State&#146;s speeches about the economic benefits of the new generation of reactors, he has remained uncharacteristically tight-lipped on an issue that has equal resonance for the nuclear industry: the potential sale of British Energy. We are on the brink of one of the most strategically important commercial deals of recent years, but as yet we have heard nothing from the Government. There has been no formal statement of policy, no guidance on how they intend to proceed either with the total sale of British Energy or regarding their own share, and nothing on foreign ownership.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I had no intention of interrupting his peroration, but I want to say two things.

Indeed, I wrote to him during the recess, requesting an urgent clarification of the Government&#146;s position before a sale goes through in order to avoid having to endure the embarrassment and confusion of a messy post-mortem thereafter, but I am afraid that the response was bland and unhelpful. We still await a clear public statement of the Government&#146;s principles on this vitally important commercial deal, which will determine the shape of electricity generation in the nuclear sector in the UK for the next 50 or even 100 years.</p>

 Does my hon.

We need to be further down the track of granting permissions so that we can be sure that the new stations&#146; building will be completed before the existing ones have to be retired.</p>

We face an extremely difficult period both in retaining our capacity at a time when we will require a new 35 GW of electricity and in boosting our green industries in order to meet the 15 per cent. renewable energy target that the EU has imposed. The Government&#146;s refusal to take action on the less traditional approaches, particularly on feed-in tariffs, which they have just voted down for microgeneration, will only make life more difficult for them. I imagine that the issue has not gone away and that the other place will want to discuss it in detail and perhaps send the matter back to us. I am glad, however, that the Government have partly seen sense on smart metering, but they are still being timid and I simply do not understand why they wish to play it that way.</p>

The real absence of decisions over the last 10 years has placed us in a very precarious situation. The Bill must not be used as an excuse for further hesitation.</p>

 Having reflected on our consideration of the Bill over the past few months, I find it striking that only a short section of it deals with renewables, although the overwhelming majority of the amendments tabled in Committee and on Report focused on the subject. That demonstrates that the measures on renewables in the Bill do not go far enough. It would have been great if the amendment on feed-in tariffs had been passed today. I strongly suspect that when the Bill emerges from another place we shall see a similar amendment, which we would welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="80430-0021.htm_para11"><a name="080430114000739">Although we have not opposed the banding of the renewables obligation, I think the Minister grossly oversold what has been achieved by that mechanism so far. If it is so wonderful, why has it taken so long for us to reach a point at which we are still so far behind? The Minister said earlier that we were making rapid progress and that we had started from a low base; but we started from a low base 11 years ago, we are still virtually at the bottom of the league table, and the Bill will not enable us to surge up to the place that we ought to occupy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="80430-0021.htm_para13"><a name="080430114000741">On Second Reading, we observed that the Bill was about big energy. It was about paying for nuclear clean-up, about offshore gas storage and about carbon capture. We are pleased that we have been able to improve it at the margins, and we welcome the nod in the direction of smart meters, but the Bill does not provide much more than that. It is a case of &#147;Something will happen at some point, we hope&#148;. We are told that the Government have powers to make something happen within five years.</p>

The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart), who has now left the Chamber, commented that five years ago the Government had said that the issue of carbon capture was urgent. When chided, the Minister said &#147;We are on the brink of some demonstration projects&#148;, seeming not to consider that the elapsing of five years mattered particularly.</p>

 I want to continue the theme adopted by the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb). I was rather encouraged when the Minister began by talking about carbon capture and storage. Great Britain has been given a massive opportunity by the 240 years or so of our energy requirements that lie beneath the surface of this country alone in coal seams, and the ability to extend oil production by up to 25 years. Together those factors could do much to solve our energy security problems, but sadly we have been very timid. The Government&#146;s actions in the Bill have closed down progress on carbon capture and storage. The Select Committee was given considerable evidence of that&#151;some of it as a result of the questions asked by the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)&#151;during its public sessions when we listened to witnesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="80430-0021.htm_para18"><a name="080430114000747">Let me give an example of the way in which the Government have disappointed the pre-combustion lobby. The Centrica-Progressive Energy project at Eston Grange on Teesside is a good example. It proposed an 850 MW integrated gasification combined cycle coal-fired power station with pre-combustion carbon dioxide capture on a brownfield site. Sadly, that has been scaled back now, and the company is reviewing the whole process. A &#163;1.2 million scheme that would have supplied clean power to 1 million homes will not now go ahead, certainly in the form originally suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="80430-0021.htm_para19"><a name="080430114000748">There is an even more vital concern in respect of carbon capture and storage. We have only a small window for enhanced oil recovery in the North sea. That will not take place now. On pre-combustion, we know the technology exists and is being used in various sites throughout the world. It is not quite put together in the way we would need in the North sea, but it is being used. Many North sea fields will reach the end of their working lives between 2015 and 2022, and that poses a massive problem. We will not be able to address it, because the competition has specified post-combustion and only a demonstration model, whereas I am told by experts that a commercial station can be up and running by 2014 if we have the courage to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="80430-0021.htm_para20"><a name="080430114000749">We know that we need to store carbon securely, and that can be done either in oil wells coming to the end of their lives, saline aquifers or old coal mines. What is the advantage of using oil wells in this respect? It is that by shoving carbon down there, we increase pressure and get about 15 per cent. more oil out of those wells. That amounts to up to 25 years of extra oil production. I am told that a 800 MW pre-combustion station will produce 5 million tonnes of carbon per year. One tonne produces three barrels of oil. I need hardly go on  <br>

Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) on carbon capture and storage. The Bill now lays down a joint approach to this, and the Minister said that we are a world leader in CCS but, as has been pointed out, there has been a huge missed opportunity in the pre-combustion market. The Government have gone down the post-combustion route, basically, I think, because they see it as an exportable technology as it can be fitted to coal-fired power stations, but pre-combustion CCS could have given us a world lead in a technology that would have been of huge value to this country. That is a missed opportunity, and I am sad that that has happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="80430-0021.htm_para24"><a name="080430114000756">Earlier this afternoon, I spoke to my amendment No. 1 to clause 36, relating to the renewables obligation certificates banding and the interaction with grants. Although I did not press my amendment to a vote, the issue still gives me great concern. I understood the Minister&#146;s comments about state aid and the need not to give double help to projects, but he seemed to be saying that he was converting what was a grant into a loan. A company going for the high-end market and the high-end developments may receive a grant, but then it would receive fewer ROCs in the future or it would repay some of the grant.</p>

I merely point out that it must be dealt with. The Minister again said that a review was ongoing, and I know that Scotland&#146;s First Minister has held discussions with Ofgem about the matter. I hope that something will come of all that, and that we will finally be given a solution to a long-running problem, which I seem to have been talking about for years.</p>

Given what has happened, it seems that a massive bill is building up, and I suspect that it will affect all United Kingdom taxpayers.</p>

 Thirty years ago, a female child was delivered by caesarean section at Oldham and District general hospital. She weighed 5 lb 12 oz, and her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Brown, named her Louise. Louise Brown was the first child to be conceived using in vitro fertilisation, whose pioneers were consultant gynaecologist Patrick Steptoe and Cambridge research physiologist Robert Edwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para5"><a name="080430114000769">Louise Brown&#146;s birth was a milestone. It marked the culmination of many years of research and trials, and the start of hope for infertile couples all over the world. Given that splendid history, I wonder why, 30 years on, today&#146;s couples up and down the country are still faced with heartache, frustration and depression when access to such groundbreaking and essential therapy is denied by nothing less than the infamous postcode lottery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para6"><a name="080430114000770">I was made aware of the situation, particularly within Dudley primary care trust, when two of my constituents approached me on this very issue. Both those constituents are married to men who have fathered a child in an earlier relationship, yet, despite the fact that in both cases the child lives with their natural mother, and not with my constituent, both women are denied fertility treatment by Dudley PCT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para7"><a name="080430114000771">The Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), will know that a pattern of patchy access to fertility treatment had developed before the announcement by the then Secretary of State for Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid), following the publication of guidelines by what was then the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in February 2004. My right hon. Friend said:</p>
<a name="80430-0022.htm_brev11"><a name="080430114000815"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our immediate priority must be to ensure a national level of provision of IVF available wherever people live. As a first step, by April next year I want all PCTs, including those who at present provide no IVF treatment, to offer at least one full cycle of treatment to all those eligible. In the long term I would expect the NHS to make progress towards full implementation of the NICE guidance.</p>
</ul><a name="80430-0022.htm_brev12"><a name="080430114000816"><ul><p class="tabletext">In providing this NHS service, as with all others, our priority must be to help those in greatest need. That is why I will be asking the NHS to give local priority to couples who do not have children living with them.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para8"><a name="080430114000772">That is an important point. My right hon. Friend continued:</p>
<a name="80430-0022.htm_brev13"><a name="080430114000817"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This will mean that thousands more couples should be able to have fertility treatment on the NHS whilst enabling the NHS to manage this in a realistic way&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para9"><a name="080430114000773">The NICE guidelines on the provision of IVF placed NHS assisted fertility services firmly in the mainstream of state-funded health care. They made explicit reference to clinical criteria such as the effect of age and weight on the outcome of treatment, but no recommendations were made for the use of non-clinical or social criteria in the provision of treatment. Of course PCTs have to balance budgets, decide priorities and commission services within available budgets, as well as balance individuals&#146; needs and access to therapies.  <br>

Unfortunately, that means that across the country many PCTs have developed their own social criteria effectively to ration treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para10"><a name="080430114000774">Recent research on some 100 PCTs shows that 51 do not allow IVF to couples if one of them already has a child. It just depends on where people live. Indeed, one of my constituents was advised by a health professional to join a different GP practice or move over the border into Staffordshire or Worcestershire to improve her chances. What a way to run a service!</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para11"><a name="080430114000775">My constituents and all other infertile women in Dudley are denied the right of access to treatment because of their partner&#146;s previous fertility. Is there any other treatment or branch of medicine that decides on someone&#146;s need or eligibility for treatment by looking at the health or history of their partner? This is akin to someone attending accident and emergency with a broken arm to be told by the doctor, &#147;Yes, your arm is broken, but we&#146;re not going to treat it because both of your husband&#146;s arms are fine.&#148; That is not fair or just. How does it fulfil the guiding principle of the NHS of care and treatment free at the point of delivery and according to need?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para12"><a name="080430114000776">One of my constituents described her feelings:</p>
<a name="80430-0022.htm_brev14"><a name="080430114000818"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;While I am awaiting the decision of the PCT, I see all around me happy mums and dads with new...babies. I know that I should be one of them. I feel that at 38 my chances are slipping by and that the pen pushers don&#146;t care. They want me to appeal and to continue this charade until I am 40 and not eligible. Why don&#146;t I matter? Why don&#146;t they care? I&#146;m now being treated for depression. My husband and I are now so desperate we may sell our house and go private. It&#146;s not right, it&#146;s not fair and they know it.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para13"><a name="080430114000777">The British Fertility Society surveyed NHS fertility treatment across England in 2006. It found that the number of cycles of treatment was increasing, but there were still some significant black holes. Despite the NICE recommendations, some 16 per cent. of clinics reported decreased support from local PCTs. There is still a great disparity, with some PCTs, such as Dudley, offering funding for only one round of treatment and others offering three, although a significant proportion are unable to follow through. There was also little indication that PCTs had made long-term plans to implement NICE guidelines and no reassurance that the full guidance will be implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para14"><a name="080430114000778">The BFS makes 11 recommendations on social criteria for NHS treatment, which include: that waiting times for treatment should be the same as for any other medical conditions; that no woman should commence NHS-funded treatment after the age of 40; that women who are obese must initiate a weight-reduction programme; that single women and same-sex couples should have equal access; and, importantly, that if people have had children from a previous relationship, they should not be excluded from access to NHS treatment. The author of the study, Richard Kennedy said:</p>
<a name="80430-0022.htm_brev15"><a name="080430114000819"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The results of this survey suggest that there is no sense of any long term planning for the provision of fertility services and provide no reassurance that full implementation of the NICE guidance will be achieved as was recommended by the Secretary of State for Health...If we are to see an end to inequity of access across the United Kingdom there must be an explicit plan for the provision of three fresh cycles of IVF and consistency in the  <br>

criteria used for NHS treatment. The criteria we propose, if adopted by all PCTs in England and Wales, would standardise access to treatment. We must use the findings of this survey to pursue the goal of full implementation of the NICE Guideline.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para15"><a name="080430114000779">I know from my recent correspondence with the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), that she is concerned about the situation, as are her colleagues. The Department of Health asked Infertility Network UK, on behalf of the Department, to undertake a project to liaise with PCTs and encourage the sharing of best practice, as well as to ensure that the voices of fertility patients are heard when decisions are made at a local level. Only 151 responses came back from the 303 PCTs. The results showed that 98 were funding only one cycle per couple, 32 provided two cycles and only seven provided the recommended three cycles. Of those PCTs, 50 per cent. do not fund frozen embryo transfer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para16"><a name="080430114000780">Why is it important to get to the magical figure of three cycles? The chance of a successful birth in a single cycle of IVF is estimated at one in four for women under 35, which rises to 50 per cent. with three cycles. Of course, there are less likely to be multiple births when three cycles are offered because couples have three chances rather than one to become pregnant and are therefore less likely to opt for multiple transfer. In turn, that will mean safer pregnancies and births for mothers and children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para17"><a name="080430114000781">Infertility causes emotional distress and pain. The desire to reproduce is part of life. When that process fails couples undergo significant distress, depression and ill health. Relationship failure often follows. They suffer physical and mental ill health and their self-worth plummets. Creating a family is central to the life plans of many people. Not everybody desires a child with the same intensity&#151;it is fundamentally an individual issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para18"><a name="080430114000782">As individuals in a welfare state, my constituents deserve equal and fair access to treatment. The Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter, can help them to achieve this by insisting on the removal of the so-called social criteria, by making a sound commitment to fund both fresh and frozen embryo transfer and, of course, by insisting on full implementation of all NICE guidelines in this case without further delay.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho) on securing the debate and on bringing an important and sensitive subject into the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para19"><a name="080430114000784">People who seek help to have their own family have often gone through a time of great anticipation and preparation, when there was no doubt in their minds that they would have a child together and that it would be just a matter of time. They plan ahead and think that at the same time the following year they will have a child with them. They plan their lives around that thought.</p>

tests that follow lead to an anxious time. The tests might show the cause of the problem, or the cause might remain unexplained. Some couples may conceive a child during that time, but others will not and they will consider various treatments. In many cases, patients may start with the less invasive procedures, and some will get pregnant at that stage. However, for those who do not, treatments such as IVF or ICSI&#151;intracytoplasmic sperm injection&#151;are the next, and last, step. More than 30,000 people in this country will have IVF in any one year, and currently about a quarter of them will be treated on the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o514"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para21"><a name="080430114000786">People with fertility problems who seek help from the NHS quite rightly see fertility provision as an integral part of the service but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge said, some will find that the NHS cannot help them to the extent that they expect. We are working hard to address the issues about access to NHS infertility treatment, and are making welcome progress. I shall update the House about that in a moment, but first I want to deal with the point that my hon. Friend made about the restriction of access to fertility services if a person or their partner has a child from a previous relationship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para22"><a name="080430114000787">My hon. Friend made the point very eloquently that, if a woman has fertility problems, then to refuse to treat those problems because her partner has a child from a previous relationship is to ignore the woman&#146;s own, personal health problem. I recognise the points that my hon. Friend made, as I do the feelings of the women&#151;or men&#151;who are in that position. I also acknowledge the feelings of their partners. If there are anxieties and a feeling of injustice, they may even be sensed by the existing children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para23"><a name="080430114000788">For access to IVF treatment, most PCTs apply the so-called &#147;social&#148; criteria, which means that there will be no IVF for couples who have a child from a previous relationship. Many PCTs say that IVF treatment cannot be offered if a person or their partner has a child from a previous relationship: some say that there should be no children from the current relationship, and others that there should be no children under 16 living with the couple. A very small number of PCTs require one partner to have no children, or say that they give individual consideration to partners with no children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o517"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para24"><a name="080430114000789">The Government are aware that those are not the only access criteria applied by PCTs, but most of the others feature as clinical criteria in the NICE fertility guidelines. They include requirements to undertake a smoking cessation clinic or to lose weight, and so on, but those are clinical criteria set out by NICE and they are applied reasonably consistently across the country. Most PCTs have criteria relating to existing children from a previous relationship but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge rightly said, they are not uniform. Those differences are seen as unfair, and I share her discomfort about them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o518"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para25"><a name="080430114000790">We are therefore addressing the problem in the following ways. We have asked the leading fertility patient support organisation, Infertility Network UK, to develop in partnership with the NHS a standardised set of access criteria that will include criteria for patients who have children from previous relationships. Infertility Network UK is looking at the range of  <br>

criteria in application, and it is aiming to develop a standardised set that PCTs can take into account when planning their services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o519"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para26"><a name="080430114000791">Infertility Network UK will also look at suggestions made by other groups, such as the British Fertility Society. The end result will be a tool that PCTs can use in planning their provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o520"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para27"><a name="080430114000792">Looking at the level of IVF provision in Dudley more generally, I am aware that the PCT offers only one fresh cycle of IVF to those who meet the access criteria. I recognise that patients in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency would certainly wish&#151;and could expect&#151;that provision to improve. A progression from one fresh cycle, the most basic level of provision, to one full cycle of IVF would be a starting point, together with a longer-term plan for the implementation of the full NICE guidelines. In response to my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns, I have asked Infertility Network UK, the leading fertility patient support group, to offer to meet the members of the independent Healthcare Commission in Dudley so that they can make known the views of patients about the level of provision locally, and hear the views of the commissioners. As a start, it may be helpful to give patients a transparent picture of the services that are being funded, so that they might understand why IVF does not at present have a higher level of priority locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para28"><a name="080430114000793">We want further improvements in the provision of fertility services and, to that end, we have started to monitor them. We will publish the results shortly, but even without that survey we know that some PCTs are providing two cycles of IVF or more. It will be helpful to demonstrate that that can be done, and that progression towards the implementation of the NICE guidelines can be achieved. Those PCTs&#146; performance will be held up to public scrutiny by the independent Healthcare Commission in its annual health checks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o522"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para29"><a name="080430114000794">Infertility Network UK has been working with us to improve access to services for fertility patients towards the implementation of the NICE guidelines. As well as developing standardised access criteria, it is working with PCTs to identify and disseminate best practice. The project, which is funded by us, began in 2006 with a survey of provision. It has continued with visits to 16 PCTs that offer a range of provision, and Infertility Network UK will be compiling its findings for dissemination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o523"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para30"><a name="080430114000795">Additionally, we have set up an expert group on commissioning NHS infertility provision. Its membership is drawn from strategic health authorities, primary care trusts and Infertility Network UK. The group is identifying the barriers to the NHS progressing to implementation of the NICE fertility guidelines, taking account of the current variation in provision of IVF and ICSI among PCTs. It is also examining the variation in access criteria and the intermittent suspension of services in some locations. At present, only three PCTs have temporarily suspended services, and all are working towards reinstatement. The group is also working to ensure the production of a tool for PCT commissioners for making decisions on fertility provision to encourage gradual progress towards the full implementation of the NICE fertility guidelines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o524"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para31"><a name="080430114000796">In carrying out its work, the group will take account of the Infertility Network UK project with PCTs advising on next steps and co-ordinating findings on  <br>

good practice. It will also take account of the range of evidence to support the provision of IVF and ICSI, including the health gains for patients and health issues arising from infertility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o525"><a name="80430-0022.htm_para32"><a name="080430114000797">We acknowledge that unacceptable variations remain in the provision of IVF throughout the country. Overall, there is a move towards the implementation of the NICE clinical guideline and general improvement, but there is still progress to be made in several PCT areas and more work to be done, especially on the social criteria to which my hon. Friend drew attention. I  <br>

thank her for doing so, and recognise and acknowledge her concerns. I know that she is seeking improvements in provision in relation to fairness and equity. We share those values. We, too, are seeking to help PCTs to make just, transparent decisions on fertility treatment, which is not a traditional part of NHS care, but in which developments in technology have brought great advances in patient care and high expectations that the health service needs to meet.</p>
