 The review of sex and relationships education has now been completed and the Government response to the review group's report was published on 23 October. The response includes a range of measures to raise the quality of SRE in schools, including our decision to make personal, social and health education statutory. It also includes action to address the key delivery challenges, the most significant of which is to improve the skills and confidence of those who deliver SRE.</p>

 I thank the Minister for that answer. This is a complex and important matter, on which the evidence is quite mixed. Does he share my view, based on some experiences, that many modern schools are more comfortable teaching about biology and the plumbing and, rightly or wrongly, experience more difficulty in teaching about relationships? What can be done practically to prevent lop-sided education from being given to children?</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is important that young people are taught about sex within a moral framework and within one that teaches about relationships. That is one reason why I was persuaded by the arguments of the review group that we should make PSHE statutory. In primary schools, the focus should particularly be on relationships and their importance so that there is a proper setting for going on to talk about the sensitive matters around sex.</p>

 My hon.

 As well as dealing in school with sexual relationships, we need to look at general and social relationships with adults. Has the Minister had the chance to look at the details of the Barnardo&#146;s survey of 2,021 people, which shows that 54 per cent. of adults believe that children are starting to behave like animals and that 45 per cent. believe that children merit the adjective &#147;feral&#148;? Unless the survey was drawn entirely from the <i> Daily Mail </i>readership, can the Minister think of any other reason for such a distorted view of young people in this country?</p>

 I am aware of that report and the reporting of it in the media today, but I have not had a chance to study it in full because of preparation for consideration of Lords amendments later today. I share the concern that I think was expressed by Martin Narey, the chief executive of Barnardo&#146;s. In my experience&#151;there is considerable evidence to prove it&#151;the vast majority of young people are responsible: they are more likely than any other age group, for example, to volunteer in our communities. We should do everything that we can to ensure that we provide positive images of young people to counteract the stereotype that sometimes comes across from certain parts of the media.</p>

 Does the Minister not accept that the more sex education we seem to have had, the more unwanted and teenage pregnancies we seem to have had, and that more sex education is not the answer and that perhaps less or even no sex education might be better? Moral upbringing should be the responsibility of parents, not teachers, and if we really want to tackle this problem it would be much better to look at the benefits and housing allocation systems than throw in more sex education for pupils in schools.</p>

The number of unwanted teenage pregnancies fell by 12.9 per cent. in this country between 1998 and 2006, but it is still too high in comparison with the numbers in other western European countries. In European countries that create, through schooling, an environment that makes people happier and more confident about discussing sex and relationships at home, we see the rates of unwanted teenage pregnancies fall.</p>

We are investing &#163;332 million to 2011 specifically to increase music participation.

 It is too easy to forget the contribution that parents of children with autism make, and I cannot speak highly enough of the parents who set up the Spectrum club in Newbury. However, it runs only up to the age of 15 for children with autism, and it is trying to work with West Berkshire council to extend provision to cover the crucial years between 15 and 18. I would be grateful to know what the Minister can do to encourage provision in this key area, so that these children can continue to improve so dramatically that they can go on to achieve at university and beyond.</p>

Would it not be a better start to providing support for children with autism if in place of highly adversarial, costly and stressful tribunal referrals, the Government instead promoted special needs mediation, involving parents, local authorities, independent educational psychologists and other professionals, in order to come up with agreed educational needs profile plans to help the children most and soonest by providing multi-agency support, not multi-agency buck-passing?</p>

 As my hon. Friend knows, I hate to disagree with him, but I have every confidence in the job that Ofsted is doing. It has an enlarged brief; it is responsible for inspecting a wide range of settings, not just schools. That might explain why the cost of running Ofsted has gone up. Post-inspection surveys of head teachers show that 96 per cent. of schools agree that inspections identified the right issues for improvement, and 83 per cent. agree that the benefits of the inspection outweigh any negative aspects. The outgoing schools commissioner has not, to my knowledge, ever worked for Ofsted; he certainly does not do so at the moment, and it is not proposed that he should go on to do so.</p>

 The Minister will be aware that CAFCASS reports often play a vital role in influencing court decisions, but is she aware that aggrieved parties have no right of complaint against CAFCASS, and that there appears to be little, if any, accountability?

There is an issue to do with consistency of practice in different regions, and it is being addressed through the improvement programme. However, if the hon.

The national challenge programme launched in June aims to raise standards in schools where fewer than 30 per cent. of pupils achieve five or more good GCSEs, including English and maths, and we have announced the next phase of our secondary school improvement strategy, &#147;Gaining Ground: Improving progress in coasting secondary schools&#148;.

 The Secretary of State has rightly pointed out that after the Victoria Climbi&#233; tragedy, Haringey should have been an exemplar authority for child protection. I am sure that he will agree that the Government should show exemplary energy in pursuing concerns about child protection in Haringey. Six months before baby P died, Ministers received a warning letter from a former Haringey social worker. It was passed to the Commission for Social Care Inspection, which held a meeting in which Haringey council promised speedily to improve its policies on safeguarding children. Two weeks later, responsibility for inspecting child protection passed to Ofsted. What steps did Ministers, Ofsted or anyone in the Government take to ensure that Haringey lived up to its promise to improve child protection?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his support for the review into Haringey social services that I instigated last Wednesday, and for giving me notice that he would raise the issue today. I sent him and other Opposition spokespeople a copy of my letter to Lord Laming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="81117-0003.htm_para5"><a name="0811176000137">A letter came from a lawyer for a former employee of Haringey, which went to the Department of Health. It was passed to the former Department for Education and Skills. It was not seen by Ministers. It was handled in the normal way through official channels. At that time, a reply was written to the lawyer to say that Ministers could not be involved in a particular employment case and that the right way to take the matter forward was through the social care inspectorate. That was done by the lawyer, and that process was followed up by a meeting in which the inspectorate confirmed that it was content that things had been done properly by Haringey in that case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="81117-0003.htm_para6"><a name="0811176000138">On the wider issue of Haringey social services, there was a review in 2006, and a further review by Ofsted in 2007, which gave a good report. It did not look at the particulars of the legal case; it looked at matters more widely. An investigation is now going on because I have sent the inspectors in. They will report to me in two weeks&#146; time, and I will take whatever action is needed to ensure that children in Haringey are safe.</p>

 I am sure that the Secretary of State appreciates that this is a question about the inspection regime. We know that in March the inspectors said that Haringey had to improve, and that in October Ofsted said that Haringey&#151;and this was just after baby P had died&#151;provides a good service for children. That report was based mainly on paperwork and desk research, and the author of that report was a former employee and colleague of the director of children&#146;s services in Haringey. Is the Secretary of State satisfied that the systems for inspecting child protection are sufficiently robust when that can happen?</p>

Gentleman said, gave a good report. It did not involve inspectors&#146; reports and visits to Haringey&#151;that was not the nature of the investigation. I have now called the inspectors into Haringey to see what needs to be done, and to see whether the issues that emerged from the serious case review are being properly implemented. I want to ensure that there is proper accountability and that we are doing whatever it takes to make sure that children in Haringey are safe. That is the right way to proceed. I will proceed in the right way, and we will ensure that everything is done to make sure that children in all parts of the country are being properly protected.</p>

 On 22 October, we said that we would examine the operation of local safeguarding children boards, including independence and the conduct of serious case reviews.

In my view and that of the children&#146;s Minister, independence is a better way of proceeding.

 We obviously welcome the current investigation into the tragic events in Haringey. However, is not it already obvious from the evidence in the public domain that an inquiry that takes place over a period of just two weeks will be inadequate in getting to the bottom of the issues? Is not it clear that we need a public inquiry to establish exactly what happened in Haringey and why the lessons of the 2003 report have not been learned?</p>

 I asked for an urgent inspection from Ofsted, the Healthcare Commission and the constabulary. I said that &#147;urgent&#148; meant that I had to have a first report in two weeks. If they judge that they need more time to prepare a second report, that is fine, but I want action in two weeks and that is why I have set the timetable. The right thing to do is to examine what happened&#151;the management failures, the problems of process and how that led to the wrong judgment, it seems, being made about the safety of the child. As I said, I am going to do that properly. I will wait for the inspectors and then act on the basis of their first report, which will come to me on 1 December.</p>

Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman), gave earlier, will the Minister tell us exactly what she is going to do to improve the statementing process so that parents believe that it is on their side, rather than designed to defeat them? In doing so, will she avoid the words &#147;best practice&#148;, &#147;facilitator&#148; and &#147;engaging&#148;, which she used earlier? She should just tell us what she is going to do.</p>

 I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman objects to the words &#147;best practice&#148;. I would have thought that we should all be using best practice. Indeed, I believe that schools and local authorities should be looking at it. I have already stated that the Lamb review is looking into how we can get parents&#146; confidence in the statementing system. We have 10 innovative projects under way throughout the country, so that we can find different ways of getting parental confidence in the system. I would have thought that the hon.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I am sure that the whole House will join me in sending our profound condolences to the family and friends of the three servicemen killed in Afghanistan in the past few days. They were Marines Neil Dunstan and Robert McKibben from the UK Landing Force Command Support Group, and Colour Sergeant Dura of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles. We owe them and all those who have given their lives in conflict a huge debt of gratitude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0811176000157">I should like to make a statement on the Washington summit on financial markets and the world economy. This was the first ever G20 leaders&#146; summit, which I attended this weekend with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In just over six months, the world has seen a 40 per cent. collapse in global share values, while global financial institutions have written off losses approaching &#163;1,000 billion dollars and world oil prices have peaked at nearly $150 dollars a barrel and then sunk 60 per cent. We have seen a fall in global expectations for growth in the world&#146;s industrialised countries from 2.5 per cent. in 2007 to below zero for 2009, with all the impact that that has on families and businesses and all the worries about mortgages, jobs and family security in Britain and around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0811176000158">What is making this a fully worldwide crisis is that in recent weeks a problem that started in America has extended to emerging markets and developing countries, some of which are facing bankruptcy. These unprecedented global events call for unprecedented global action. While the economic problems of the 1970s created the G5 and then the G7, it is right that for the first time leaders from developed, emerging and developing economies, which are responsible for 85 per cent. of global growth, met and agreed on the urgency of common and concerted, and where appropriate co-ordinated, actions to address the financial and economic crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0811176000159">To put the long-term challenge in context, in the next 20 years it is expected that the world economy will double in size. This will mean a doubling of opportunities for British business and new opportunities for British workers and families. However, to make the transition to, and secure the benefits of, an open and inclusive globalisation, we have to deal with three other consequences that that brings. Those are, first, the need for restructuring of industries and services, not least resulting from the rise of Asia; secondly, increased competition for resources as long-term demand for oil, food and commodities from the newly emerging economies threatens to outstrip supply; and, thirdly, now that we have global flows of capital, the need to ensure a global framework for financial services as a precondition for prosperity and security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0811176000160">As epitomised by the sub-prime crisis, which started in America, at the root of the banking crisis was a failure by banks to manage risk, to understand increasingly opaque and complex financial products and to make transparent a developing shadow banking system&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

<p><a name="st_o98"><a name="0811176000162"><a name="81117-0004.htm_spmin1"><a name="0811176000557"><b>The Prime Minister:</b>
 Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0811176000163">In Washington, we agreed first of all fundamental reform of the way the financial system is supervised around the principles that Britain has been promoting. They are greater transparency, responsibility, integrity&#151;to avoid conflicts of interest&#151;better banking practice and international co-operation. That includes establishing international colleges of regulators; bringing transparency to tax havens by including them within the scope of the financial system; convergence of accounting standards; reviewing executive compensation schemes that encourage excessive and irresponsible risk-taking; full disclosure of toxic assets; and reform to end conflicts of interest in credit-rating agencies. We set a clear timetable, tasking our Finance Ministers to prepare immediate measures for implementation by 31 March, and to report back on progress with the full action plan at the next meeting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0811176000164">The summit also agreed that the recapitalisation of the banking system was the right course of action. The action that we have taken in the United Kingdom to buy shares in banks has now been followed in every continent of the world, and guarantees have been introduced to allow banks to raise the money needed to continue to support the real economy, as they must, through lending to businesses and families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0811176000165">We agreed that, against the background of economic conditions worldwide, a broader policy response was needed immediately, based on closer macro-economic co-operation. Importantly, we made it clear that, within our commitment to fiscal sustainability, the broad and international policy response would need to encompass both monetary and fiscal policy action. Although it is for independent central banks to make their own decisions, we recognised the importance of monetary policy to the restoration of growth. Some contended that it was impossible to cut interest rates in Britain for fiscal reasons, but, in fact, the Bank has now, in two successive months, made two cuts worth in total 2 per cent. and the Government have stated clearly that there is scope for further action. A measure of the level of international co-operation that has already resulted is the extensive currency swaps put in place between central banks and the co-ordinated cut in interest rates across Europe, Asia and America a few weeks ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0811176000166">Crucially, and for the first time, our Washington statement agreed a broad and concerted international macro-economic policy response in fiscal policy, meaning measures to support families and businesses now. First, we agreed that fiscal policy has an essential role to play alongside monetary policy in sustaining demand, with quick-acting measures to encourage a rapid impact with help for households and businesses. Secondly, we agreed that the benefits of fiscal policy action will be greater for each country if all countries can act in a concerted way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0811176000167">This imperative is shared internationally. In recent days China, South Korea, Australia and Germany have joined other European countries, including Spain and France, in considering new fiscal stimulus packages. The European Union has already said that the flexibility in the stability and growth pact to recognise exceptional and temporary conditions will be used. President-elect Obama has already stated that a new fiscal stimulus package in the United States is both necessary and urgent. Most previously published forecasts have assumed  <br>

the absence of co-ordinated fiscal action, but the downturn can be shorter and less deep if Britain takes action, and if that action is matched elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0811176000168">It is for individual countries to make their own announcements, as we will do in due course, but the more co-ordinated the action, the greater the benefit to each country will be. I believe that the emerging consensus across the world&#151;from the International Monetary Fund itself, from Governments of left and right, and from political parties, with only a few exceptions, in developed and developing countries&#151;is that we should take rapid, co-ordinated and concerted action through the use of budgetary measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0811176000169">Over the past year, the central problem facing the global economy and the UK economy was inflation, driven by a sharp rise in international commodity prices and allied to a credit crunch, which left fewer options for Governments. This year, the reality is the sharp falls in commodity prices that are now taking place, while the credit crunch is leading to contractions in bank lending. The risk in this new environment is not stagflation but the impact on the economy of close-to-zero inflation at the time of a downturn, so it makes sense for Governments to support interest rate cuts with fiscal action. That is giving real help to families and businesses now, and I believe that, in addition to the announcements already made, we will see in the next few weeks many countries following with expansionary measures founded on that agreed international position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0811176000170">The third central message of the summit is that in taking action, we must resist all forms of protectionism. These threaten to slow down and eventually to stall world trade, thus denying us the benefits of one of the great engines of new growth. So, uniquely, all nations signed an agreement that over the next 12 months, they will resist pressure and refrain from raising new barriers to investment and trade. The key to confidence in open trade is, of course, the signing of the world trade agreement, on which talks have stalled since the summer. We cannot allow that impasse to continue, and I welcome today&#146;s new agreement&#151;following Saturday&#146;s summit&#151;to work towards a ministerial meeting in December. To ensure that the trade round is truly a development round that benefits the poorest countries, it will be accompanied by an agreed $4 billion aid-for-trade programme for infrastructure in developing countries. In discussing the issues facing poorer countries, the summit reaffirmed the importance of meeting the millennium development goals&#151;an importance of applying the same common purpose to the challenge of alleviating poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0811176000171">Some have argued that as long as the trade talks remain deadlocked on specific issues, no deal can be agreed, but the G20 was explicit about the action that we have to take: for the first time we have instructed our Trade Ministers to agree, by the end of the year, the outlines needed for a successful conclusion to the Doha agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para13"><a name="0811176000172">Finally, the G20 leaders have also agreed that the next summit will allow us to review, and to make decisions on, the wholesale reform of the international economic architecture&#151;built in 1945 but no longer adequate for the challenges of 2008. In agreeing on the need for reform, we also set down the agreed changes that we believe are already essential: a greater voice and  <br>

representation for emerging and developing countries; an urgent expansion, with broader membership, of the Financial Stability Forum; and, better identification of vulnerabilities and anticipation of potential stresses, with swifter action in crisis response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0811176000173">The International Monetary Fund&#146;s ability to assist countries facing problems as a result of the current shock depends on its reserves of $250 billion. We welcome the announcement from Japan to lend up to $100 billion, but that may not be enough, and we agreed to review the IMF&#146;s facilities to ensure that it has the flexibility to give countries the help that they need. The World Bank agreed that it would make new commitments of up to $100 billion over the next three years to protect the newest, the poorest and most vulnerable countries, and $30 billion of new facilities specifically to help address the problems faced by the private sector, including recapitalising banks and providing trade finance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0811176000174">At this unique moment in our economic history, we are seeing the world come together to find global solutions to what are the global problems that we face. Over the next few weeks and following consultation, Britain, as the incoming chair of the G20, will lead the preparations for the next summit, working alongside past and future chairs. We will set out the schedule of events, meetings and papers that will take us to the next conference, the date and venue of which will be announced next week. In the run-up to the conference, we will monitor, following the recapitalisation of banks, the barriers to the resumption of funding, because this summit and the meetings that will follow are about the real challenges of everyday life: the need for people to have confidence in the banks that hold their savings and their mortgages; and, the need to know that everything is possible is being done to help them in their jobs. We pledge that with national and international action together&#151;real help in difficult times&#151;we will take people fairly through this downturn. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

 I join the Prime Minister in paying tribute to Colour Sergeant Dura and to Marines Neil Dunstan and Robert McKibben, who were all killed in Afghanistan. As the Prime Minister said, they were serving our country, and we honour their memory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0811176000176">Everyone welcomes the fact that the summit was of the full G20, involving countries such as Brazil, India and China. It discussed the immediate response to the recession and proposals for the longer term. I shall start with the longer-term reforms. On trade, after so many false dawns, does the Prime Minister believe that this time there is a real prospect of agreement on Doha? On financial reform, there are the Basel accords, which govern bank lending. For a year, we have been arguing that the rules should be made counter-cyclical, but does the Prime Minister agree with me that international action should be combined with action at home, such as the debt responsibility mechanism that we have proposed for the Bank of England to call time on debt? On international institutions such as the IMF, does the Prime Minister agree with me that genuinely sharing global leadership with countries such as India and China means giving them a larger say in how these organisations are run?</p>

warned Britain last year that household debt was rising rapidly, that our financial institutions were vulnerable and that, as a result, we faced a potentially severe impact. In future, will the Prime Minister listen to these warnings?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para18"><a name="0811176000178">Next there is the failure of the regulatory system, particularly concerning credit rating agencies and complex derivatives. The G20 rightly talks about the importance of co-operation, but can the Prime Minister be clear about what is actually proposed? It does not mean detailed international regulation, but international co-operation over regulation. The G20 communiqu&#233; rightly states explicitly:</p>
<a name="81117-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="0811176000392"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Regulation is first and foremost the responsibility of national regulators&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para19"><a name="0811176000179">It is quite damning about national failure. It says&#151;this is the communiqu&#233; that the Prime Minister signed up to&#151;that</p>
<a name="81117-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="0811176000393"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;some policy makes did not adequately appreciate and address the risks building up in financial markets, keep pace with financial innovation, or take into account the systemic ramifications of domestic regulatory actions.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0811176000180">For the past 10 years, the Prime Minister was the economic policy maker in Britain, so what responsibility does he take for those failings here?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para21"><a name="0811176000181">I turn to the recession, about which the Prime Minister makes two claims. The first claim is that Britain&#146;s economic situation is all imported from abroad. He has said that it started in America so many times that it is starting to sound ridiculous. Can he answer this&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;It&#146;s true.&#148;] If it is true, he is going to have to answer this question. If Britain is so well prepared, can he explain why the IMF believes that the British economy will shrink faster next year than any major economy in the world? Can he explain why the European Commission says that we face a deeper recession next year than anywhere in the EU except for Estonia and Latvia? Far from being well prepared, Britain faces a deep recession. Is that not why in the past few months our currency has fallen more sharply than any major currency and more sharply than ever before in our recent history?</p>
<a name="81117-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="0811176000394"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A weak currency arises from a weak economy which in turn is the result of a weak Government&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="81117-0004.htm_para24"><a name="0811176000184">The Prime Minister&#146;s second claim is that there is universal support for a fiscal stimulus paid for by additional borrowing. Yet of the 3,500 words in the G20 communiqu&#233;, just 21 were about the fiscal stimulus, and they included the condition that the stimulus should be &#147;appropriate&#148; and &#147;conducive to fiscal sustainability&#148;. The real international consensus is that only the countries that have been fiscally responsible are best placed to act now. Is that not why the OECD recommended a fiscal stimulus for those countries that had consolidated their public finances?

In Britain, our Prime Minister used the good years to build up the biggest budget deficit in the industrialised world. Is that not why, in Britain, more discretionary borrowing now, without knowing where the money is coming from, is bound to mean higher taxes later? Is that not what the Employment Minister admitted last Tuesday? Is that not what the Chancellor admitted last Wednesday?

Let us be absolutely clear about what this means: borrowing &#163;30 billion now will mean an income tax bill for the average earner of nearly &#163;1,500 later. Everyone knows the Prime Minister is planning a Christmas tax giveaway, but tax cuts should be for life, not just for Christmas. We need real tax cuts, not Labour tax cons.</p>

Would not that be fair? The right thing to borrow for is not short-term cash bribes, but long-term capital investment in infrastructure that the country needs in any case.

 The Minister for Schools and Learners gave a disappointingly short introduction to the motion. I hope that he will have a chance to explain the motion to the House. It relates to the fee-charging provisions in what is now clause 97, which enables Ofsted to charge fees for inspections of schools in the independent sector. The explanatory note to the Bill as originally drafted says:</p>
<a name="81117-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="08111713000070"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government intends to use the power...to set fees for inspections that are no higher than is necessary to recover some or all of the costs associated with the inspections.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="81117-0007.htm_para1"><a name="08111713000014">As the fee recovers costs and no more, there was no need for a Ways and Means motion to be passed by the House. The memorandum of delegated powers, which the Government published at the same time as the Bill, said that the clause</p>
<a name="81117-0007.htm_brev2"><a name="08111713000071"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;extends the power currently contained in s164(9) of the Education Act 2002 to require payment of inspection fees.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="81117-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08111713000015">The aim of the power is to limit the burden of inspection of independent education institutions on the public purse. Lords amendments Nos. 81 and 151, passed in another place, went further than that: they changed the wording of the clause so that it is now possible for the fees charged to exceed the cost of the inspection. That potentially changes the nature of the fee so that it is closer to a tax. That, of course, is why a Ways and Means motion is now necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="81117-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08111713000016">Lord Adonis was uncharacteristically opaque about the reasons for these changes when he introduced the amendments in another place, saying merely that they</p>

 The motion in the name of my right hon.

It carries forward and extends provisions already in place in the existing legislation.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 42</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="81117-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08111713000020">As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said, amendment No. 81 will enable the Government to carry out their stated policy aims in relation to fees for the inspection of independent educational institutions. I think that this is the explanation that he is after. We propose that an annual inspection fee will be paid by all independent educational institutions, which will spread the cost of an inspection every three years, and that fees may be charged in advance of the inspection. One or more fees may be charged in relation to an individual inspection. That will allow for a fee to be paid each year where an inspection takes place every three years. This approach replaces the inspection fee system whereby schools were expected to pay their fee either in a lump sum immediately after inspection or in two instalments. Allowing institutions to spread the cost will help small institutions and those with limited budgets who may struggle to pay under the current system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="81117-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08111713000021">The annual fee, which we expect to be paid in October each year, will be calculated on the basis of the head count contained in the preceding annual return. Pupil numbers may fluctuate upwards or downwards, which means that in some cases the cost of the inspection may not reflect the fee paid. However, fees will be recalculated every October to take account of the latest available pupil numbers taken from the January annual return. That will minimise any under-charging or over-charging. In effect, the explanatory notes are right, but there is that small margin for error. It would not be practical to look at pupil numbers more than once a year for the purposes of setting that year&#146;s annual fee, as the January annual return is the only source of pupil numbers. I know that the hon. Gentleman is a great champion of reducing burdens on independent schools.</p>

<p><a name="st_o173"><a name="08111713000022"><a name="81117-0007.htm_spnew5"><a name="08111713000100"><b>Kelvin Hopkins (Luton, North) (Lab):</b>
 Does my right hon. Friend agree that independent schools already get a very generous subsidy from the taxpayer through tax benefits arising from their charitable status?</p>

<p><a name="st_o174"><a name="08111713000023"><a name="81117-0007.htm_spnew6"><a name="08111713000101"><b>Jim Knight:</b>
 My hon. Friend must be careful to be fully cognisant of the whole range of independent schools, not only those that might be members of the Independent Schools Council, for example. The Charity Commission is ensuring that independent schools that have charitable status are earning it, and I am happy to see the difference that the new head of the commission is making in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="81117-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08111713000024">There may also be a very small number of cases in which an institution, having paid fees in advance, closes before the periodic inspection takes place. Amendment No. 81 contains a power that will allow fees paid in such cases not to be refunded. This policy is to prevent institutions from exploiting the system by temporarily closing before an inspection is due. If refunds were made, institutions could then apply to re-register and pay only the initial registration fee, which we propose would be &#163;500. In the majority of cases, that sum would be considerably lower than the fees refunded. There would be nothing to stop an institution continuing to exploit the system indefinitely if refunds were allowed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="81117-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08111713000025">I should reiterate that overall we intend the use the powers in order to set fees that are no higher than is necessary to recover some or all of the costs associated with inspections. I hope that with that clarification the House will be happy to approve the motion.</p>

 I would like to speak first to amendments Nos. 1 to 23, and 38. I welcome the careful scrutiny that the Select Committee on the Constitution gave to the Bill. I also welcome the Committee&#146;s detailed and helpful comments on duties on employers, related sanctions and rights of objection and appeal. The enforcement powers that local authorities have in relation to employers will be used only as a last resort, and would always be preceded by informal engagement with the employer. We will also consult employer organisations to develop clear guidance for employers to ensure that they fully understand what is expected and do not risk facing enforcement action. However, should enforcement provisions need to be used, the Government agree it is important to be absolutely clear that employers have rights of objection and appeal.

They ensure that any regulations setting the amount of the financial penalty that a local authority can impose on an employer who has failed to comply with their duties would be subject to the affirmative procedure, except where those regulations reduce the amount of the penalty. The Committee recommended that the affirmative procedure would be needed only for the first use of the regulation-making power, and for any subsequent regulations that raised the amount of the penalty by more than inflation. However, as it proved difficult to link the provisions to inflation in this way, we have gone beyond the Committee&#146;s recommendation and proposed the affirmative procedure for every use of these regulations, except where they reduce the amount. I am grateful to the Committee for its careful scrutiny and constructive recommendations.</p>

to participate, and that the duties to check that a young person is in education or training and release them to attend should apply, to ensure that young people can participate in the necessary learning. But, as is the custom, it would not be appropriate for local authorities to have powers of enforcement against this House or the other place, so the amendments clarify that the provisions in chapter 3 relating to enforcement do not apply.

We think it important that duties on employers on either side of the border should be the same if the participation age is the same, so that the system is easy to understand and potential burdens on employers are minimised.

For employers, the punishment for not complying with the Bill&#151;that is, for not providing training or time off for training&#151;is a civil one, whereas the punishment for the 16 or 17-year-old who does not participate is a criminal one. It is the fact that the Bill seeks to criminalise young people that has raised so many concerns. We all share the aspiration of increasing participation in education or training to the age of 18, but how will it help a young person if he or she sets out on their career saddled with a criminal record?</p>

The county courts are very used to dealing with rent and money issues affecting 16 and 17-year-olds.

and not criminal sanctions. The enforcement system for employers is not criminal. It culminates in a financial penalty that is recoverable through county courts, in which employers have the opportunity to present things from their perspective having used the right of appeal, if they so wish. That is appropriate, and we will discuss in a minute whether or not the measures for young people are appropriate. In essence, as the hon.

 I welcome this second group of amendments that were made in the other place and I believe that we therefore have a stronger, fuller and better Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="81117-0008.htm_para14"><a name="0811176000350">Amendment No. 40 enables a local authority to enter into learning and support agreements with young people. In a learning and support agreement, the local authority would agree to provide support and learning activity, and the young person would agree to comply with certain requirements. The young person must be involved in the process of identifying their needs and the best way to address them, and in negotiating the requirements that they in turn agree to stick to. That something-for-something approach is the model for our activity and agreement pilots aimed at 16 and 17-year-olds who are not in employment, education or training&#151;or NEET&#151;the evaluation of which will report fully later on in the year. Early signs are very promising that it is an effective approach to which young people respond positively. When we debated learning agreements in this House, I always said that they were best practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="81117-0008.htm_para15"><a name="0811176000351">Contracts or agreements are also widely used by voluntary sector organisations, such as Banardo&#146;s and Rainer, in their programmes to support young people&#146;s transition back to formal learning. The idea is popular with young people. Learning and support contracts serve to emphasise that both the local authority and the young person have responsibilities, and I hope that the House will support the amendment.</p>

clause 44, all the requirements about the description of education or training in the notice apply as they did to the original notice. So the education or training must satisfy the central duty to participate, be suitable for the young person and so on.</p>

The amendments would ensure that the amount set in regulations for the financial penalty to be given to a young person could never exceed the maximum fine that a young person could receive in a youth court, which is currently &#163;200. We have already said that, in practice, the financial penalty for young people would be significantly less than that figure, and I am grateful to the Committee for its careful scrutiny of the Bill.</p>

If a young person fails to participate, a local authority must engage with them, find them an option that suits them and help them to take up learning again. Even after enforcement action has been formally started, there will be a process of administrative sanctions, support and dialogue with a young person before they can reach the youth court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="81117-0008.htm_para19"><a name="0811176000355">I remind the House that the local authority needs to engage with the young person and offer them appropriate learning and support. If that is not taken up, a formal offer will be made, followed by an attendance notice, and if that does not work, the matter will go to the attendance panel. In turn, if the young person still fails to engage after that fourth stage, a fixed penalty notice will be issued by the local authority to avoid the need to enforce the matter through the courts. If the young person then fails to pay the fixed penalty notice, there is a right to appeal to the attendance panel. It is only then, if the attendance panel agrees with and confirms the need for the notice, that the matter goes to the youth court. That is at the end of a very long process with many stages, and if a young person re-engages in learning or has a reasonable excuse at any one of those stages, all enforcement action will cease.</p>

 The Minister says that if the young person goes back into education, all enforcement action will cease. Does that mean that they could continually engage with the enforcement process and go back enough to return to ground zero again?

 Naturally, we are concerned about mick-takers, so the process would not go all the way back to the beginning. In the end, the matter would come down to the judgment of the attendance panel, at the points at which I have described it working. If someone came back before the panel pretty rapidly and its members felt that they were a mick-taker, the panel would want to move pretty rapidly through the rest of the stages. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman in respect of such individuals.</p>

We are satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure that that will not happen to those aged under 18, and custody will not be available to the youth courts in respect of defaulting on the payment of a fine. Furthermore, we do not believe it is realistic that, in practice, any court would impose a custodial sentence for non-payment of a level 1 fine on someone more than 18 years old. However, the amendments would achieve greater certainty on that point and remove even the theoretical possibility of the situation occurring by transferring from the magistrates court to the county court the enforcement of a fine imposed for that offence only once the individual concerned had turned 18.</p>

We have said that the review would be completed by 2016, allowing it to examine experiences of the first cohort to be required to stay until they were 18 years old. The review would also be chaired by someone who was independent to ensure that it was robust. The purpose of the review is to make sure that the support and enforcement system achieves what we want it to do&#151;make sure that young people participate so that they can achieve, progress and reach their full potential.</p>

Those with such experience believe that if such young people were stigmatised or criminalised they could become entirely disengaged and impossible to re-engage in the education process. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned, the Prince&#146;s Trust waxed eloquent on that subject. I take this opportunity to wish His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales a happy 60th birthday; without him, there would not have been a trust to give the evidence that so informed our consideration and in the end persuaded the Government to change their mind.

Furthermore, when I pressed him closely on that, he acknowledged that there would always, notwithstanding that seductive offer, be a certain number who played truant. Truancy is at its highest level for 10 years, as the Minister must know. The percentage of half-days lost to truancy across all schools last year rose, and was higher than at any time since the Government came to office. Recently, they dropped their target to cut truancy, as he will know. We are therefore still concerned about the recourse to fines and youth courts, which should be a last resort.</p>

The Minister will want to make these matters perfectly clear, and we want his concession to be laid before us in the fullest detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="81117-0009.htm_para1"><a name="0811176000371">The first point concerns the scale of fines. The Minister has been helpful today, and the explanatory notes state in this respect that fines will be defined around the standard scale for summary offences at level 1. It would be helpful to have some feel for what that is. For the record, it would be useful to take this opportunity, in the House, to put some numbers to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="81117-0009.htm_para2"><a name="0811176000372">Secondly, the Minister will know that in Lords amendments Nos. 27 to 31, 173, 178 to 180, and 211, we deal with fine enforcement. It is clear that</p>
<a name="81117-0009.htm_brev1"><a name="0811176000431"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;failure to comply with an attendance notice without reasonable excuse&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="81117-0009.htm_para3"><a name="0811176000373">will lead to further action. Again, it would be helpful if he defined &#147;reasonable excuse&#148;. It may be a standard legal definition or particular to this area of law, but it would be helpful to put the matter on the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="81117-0009.htm_para4"><a name="0811176000374">On the agreements that are to form part of the relationship between Connexions and young people dealt with in amendment No. 40, it would be helpful if we knew more in relation to young people with particular needs. I have in mind young people with special educational needs who may have a statement. Needs are defined in the Bill, as I understand it, but what about SEN and what about young people who may be particularly disadvantaged in making such agreements, and in so doing enabling themselves to comply with the law? Will the Minister say a word about that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="81117-0009.htm_para5"><a name="0811176000375">I leave the Minister with those few words and questions. It is good news that the Government are gradually coming around&#151;they certainly are not kicking and screaming; as we saw today, there was far more elegance in the Minister&#146;s performance than that&#151;to our point of view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="81117-0009.htm_para6"><a name="0811176000377">Let me deal first with Lords amendment No. 40, which introduces what the Government now call learning and support agreements. Those agreements sound remarkably similar to the learning and support contracts that my party sought to include in the Bill, and which I believe have Conservative support. I would be interested to hear from the Minister what was convincing about the learning and support agreements that was not similarly convincing in respect of the learning and support contracts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="81117-0009.htm_para7"><a name="0811176000378">The Minister will recall from earlier discussions on this issue, to which we returned on a number of occasions, that one of our concerns was that there should be an alternative to being in education and training for young people who really needed support for a period, perhaps on account of mental or general health issues, family issues and so forth. The Minister included some of those issues in a letter to me, which helped me to anticipate the Government&#146;s thinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="81117-0009.htm_para8"><a name="0811176000379">Will the Minister clarify precisely when and how the learning and support agreements will be used? Our hope all along was that they could be used in place of education and training in circumstances where it was difficult, because of other problems, to get a young person to engage in education and training. I am still somewhat unclear from Lords amendment No. 40 about the precise circumstances in which the learning and support agreements could be used. Subsection (4) of the new clause set out in the amendment states:</p>
<a name="81117-0009.htm_brev2"><a name="0811176000432"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The learning and support agreement must include provision (whether or not in the form of a learning and support condition) relating to the young person&#146;s participation in education or training.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="81117-0009.htm_para9"><a name="0811176000380">Does that mean, as I fear it may, that the learning and support agreements are to be used only to support a young person who must be in education and training at the same time as engaging in the agreement, or does the Minister envisage the possibility of a young person, with the agreement of the local authority, being in a learning and support agreement that provided the sort of support necessary for going into education and training, but before formally engaging in the education and training that were previously a condition and requirement of the Bill? Clarification on that point would be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="81117-0009.htm_para10"><a name="0811176000381">We also welcome the Government&#146;s attempts to avoid the custodial option for young people against whom enforcement action is being taken under the Bill.

That might seem a somewhat modest achievement, but we hold out the hope that the review may cause the Government at least to rethink if serious problems come to light in the policy of applying criminal standards to young people for failing to comply with education and training requirements. The explanatory notes suggest that, as the Minister indicated earlier, the report is to be made in 2016, but I may have missed some detail that clarifies that that is a certainty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="81117-0009.htm_para12"><a name="0811176000383">I note, however, that the proposed subsection (2) set out in Lords amendment No. 32 states:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="81117-0009.htm_para14"><a name="0811176000385">The amendments fall a long way short of what we would really like to see in the Bill, but they are welcome concessions none the less, and we hope that after the Minister has spoken we shall be able to welcome them even more warmly.</p>

 This is indeed a controversial set of amendments. Of course we all want to improve the life chances of 16 and 17-year-olds, but it is best to do that by means of inspiration and the creation of opportunities for them, rather than by means of compulsion. There are enough ways in which youngsters in that age group can get into trouble without our creating yet another. That smacks of unnecessary interference in people&#146;s lives, bigger government and the nanny state. I am surprised at the attitude of Opposition Front Benchers to the amendments, and also at the lack of interest in them; very few Members are present to debate them.</p>

We have heard little about how we will prevent the youth courts from becoming bottled up if that happens. The Minister said that very few cases would end up in the youth courts, but we have heard such undertakings in this place before, and quite the contrary turns out to be the case when the laws are rolled out. We have not been told how, in the last resort, the payment of fines will be enforced. Unless a sanction is enforceable, it will be meaningless. As was stated by both Front-Bench spokesmen, there will be micky-takers in the system.</p>

However, Essex county council is closing one of them, and is allowing the borough council to sell the school playing field so that hundreds more houses can be built.

We are now in the 12th year of this Labour Government, and one would hope and expect a Labour Government to put resources and effort into raising opportunities for those with least, but instead there are now more than 1 million young people in the 16-to-24 age group who are not in employment, education or training; that means that more than 1 million young people are missing out on either work or training.

It has failed them in terms of vocational educational opportunities, for instance. This year&#146;s big new measure is to do with diplomas, but just 0.5 per cent. of the cohort have taken advantage of it, and there is a real risk that it will fail. Apprentices are the other key area of opportunity for people who have not succeeded as they might have wished in academic pursuits. The Government claim that the number of apprenticeships has increased from 75,000 in 1997 to 250,000 in 2007. The Minister for Schools and Learners is nodding, and that statistic would suggest excellent Government progress, but the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee reported in June 2007 that</p>

Instead of pressure being put on the education system and local authorities to deliver in a way that captures the imagination of these young people, the young people who have been let down are to be pursued so that they face a bureaucratic nightmare that can lead to fines, criminalisation and stigma.

 We have a compulsory school leaving age, and it is compulsory for people under the age of 16 to go to school.

 It is extremely helpful to have those details supplied on the record. I asked the question so that the Minister could do just that.

 As an experienced Member of the House, the hon. Gentleman will know that notions of reasonableness are very common in legislation. It is important, I think, to leave flexibility for courts, attendance panels and so on to interpret reasonableness in the normal way.

 I apologise for interrupting the Minister again, but he has helpfully said that SEN might provide the material for a reasonable excuse.

 The agreement, as it is an agreement, would be personalised. It would be individual to that learner and be in accordance with their needs. If their needs were set out in a statement of special educational needs, the learning and support agreement would clearly have to reflect that. I hope that that is helpful.</p>

I would say to him&#151;the point reflects again on the subject of young people with special educational needs&#151;that the process, in the end, is more important than the document. I think everyone agrees that is important that there is negotiation and that the young person is involved so that both parties&#151;the commissioner of the education in the form of the local authority and the recipient of that learning and support&#151;understand the deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="81117-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08111721000042">Our amendment puts emphasis on what has to happen, while my recollection of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment was that there was more emphasis on signing the document. I know that that distinction appears to be like dancing on the head of a pin, but it is quite important. The hon. Gentleman asked whether we would use the document before enforcement, and whether enforcement would never be used when a person had unmet support needs.</p>

 The nub of it was whether the learning and support agreement could be an alternative to education and training for a period of time or whether it had to take place at the same time as the education and training requirement is provided.</p>

 I think that it is possible for a local authority, if someone has particular support needs, to sequence things so that those support needs are addressed. For example, if someone was suffering from addiction and it would clearly be impractical and inappropriate to compel them to try to take part in some kind of learning until the addiction problems had been dealt with and treated, the learning and support agreement could specify the sequence of support followed by learning. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman. I referred in my opening remarks to activity agreements, and to some extent they reflect that scenario.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="81117-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08111721000045">The hon. Gentleman asked about reporting. I think that I said that that would happen by 2016, so that is the time scale. I also said that we wanted to be able to reflect on the experience of the first year, so we are saying that there would be a report in 2016. He asked whether anything would stop a fundamental review following that review. Clearly, the review would be open-minded, and so if things were found that did not work, we would have to set out how we would put them right.</p>

I am sure that he will excuse me for a relatively brief response because the arguments have been put time and again. The costs to which he referred are in the impact assessment, which was updated after the Bill&#146;s passage through the other place, so he can read up on them. Although the economic costs of raising the participation age over and above 90 per cent. are about &#163;766 million annually per cohort, the total economic benefit is projected as more than &#163;1.5 billion for each cohort of young people to whom the measure applies. In essence, the calculation of a net economic benefit of &#163;2.4 billion for a &#163;766 million cost is at the heart of why we are introducing the measure so I reiterate the point. It substantially enhances the life chances of a young  <br>

If we do not make that decision, when will we reach the position of close to 100 per cent. participating? That is what young people need. Those who do not participate are the ones who most need to participate. It is a basic issue of social justice that the most disadvantaged are the most unlikely to participate. If we are not serious enough to support compulsion, when will that participation happen? With all due respect, I put it to the hon. Gentleman and to his friend, as he described the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart), that unless they are serious about compulsion and unless they support these enforcement measures, it ain&#146;t gonna happen for the young people about whom the hon.

The hon. Gentleman tried to talk down diplomas, a bit like his hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), but we have deliberately started on the basis of quality, not quantity. The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness and I had a discussion in the Corridor a couple of weeks ago about whether he had time to see diplomas being taught and learned. At that point, he had not had time to do so. I do not know whether he has had time since then to see how excited young people are and how much teachers enjoy teaching diplomas, but I commend him to do so. We look forward to the numbers studying diplomas expanding on the basis of quality until the entitlement in 2013.</p>

Among 16 to 18-year-olds, whom the Bill particularly addresses, the number of NEETS is falling, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness welcomes that.</p>

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), because I know of his passionate interest in the subject. I think that I have responded to the points that have been made. I hope that the House will support the amendments made in the other place, but clearly it is up to those who feel passionately that we are doing the wrong thing to vote against them.</p>

 This group of Government amendments to chapters 1 and 2 of part 4 of the Bill put into effect the commitment made in another place that the Government would no longer seek to move responsibility for the registration, regulation and monitoring of independent educational institutions and non-maintained special schools from the Secretary of State to Ofsted. As Lord Goodlad would put it, it is a case of audi alteram partem, I think. This elegant three-point turn is a demonstration of the desire felt by my noble Friends and me to respond to reasoned argument during the passage of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="81117-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08111721000069">The Government have decided to implement the change to the Bill through a large number of amendments to part 4, rather than by deleting part 4 it in its entirety and relying on the regulatory regime for independent schools set out in chapter 10 of the Education Act 2002, and on the regime for non-maintained special schools set out in section 342 of the Education Act 1996.</p>

for independent schools. The change also offers the opportunity to ensure that protections are in place for children in the growing independent part-time sector. As part of that, part 4 makes a number of drafting and policy improvements. To take one example, the Bill introduces new appeal rights for proprietors of independent educational institutions and non-maintained special schools against decisions by the regulator, such as any decision to refuse an application for initial registration from a new institution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="81117-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08111721000072">The amendments in this group fall into three broad categories. The vast majority of them affect the three-point manoeuvre in respect of the transfer of functions from the Secretary of State to the chief inspector. Many of them simply replace the words &#147;Chief Inspector&#148; with the words &#147;Secretary of State&#148;. Others make consequential changes; amendments Nos. 59 and 60, for example, replace the power for the chief inspector to inspect an institution when an application for approval of a material change is made with a power for the Secretary of State, as the registration authority, to direct the chief inspector to carry out such an inspection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="81117-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08111721000073">The second set of changes brought about by the amendments do not relate to commitments made in another place. Amendments Nos. 131, 138, 162, 164 and 196 are minor and technical amendments to change the tribunal that will hear appeals against decisions made by the Secretary of State, and in certain cases, justices of the peace. Clause 110(5) states:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081117/debtext/81117-0011.htm"/>


<a name="81117-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="08111721000204"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;&#146;the Tribunal&#146; means the tribunal established under section 9 of the Protection of Children Act 1999&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="81117-0011.htm_para0"><a name="08111721000074">However, since the original drafting of the Bill, the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, which we discussed earlier, has come into force. That Act consolidated the appeal and tribunal landscape, and regulations made under it will set out revised arrangements for tribunal hearings, so that appeals brought by proprietors of independent schools&#151;and, through this Bill, proprietors of independent educational institutions and non-maintained special schools&#151;will be heard by the health, education and social care chamber of the first-tier tribunal. I know that that answers one of the questions that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was bound to ask. The amendments will ensure that appeals are brought to the appropriate tribunal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="81117-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08111721000075">The final set of amendments in this group&#151;Nos. 150 to 152&#151;put in place transitional arrangements to enable a smooth transition between the existing regulatory regime, set out in chapter 10 of the Education Act 2002, and the new regime in the Bill. Amendment No. 150 ensures that any actions commenced under the current regime can continue, unaffected, when the new legislation comes into force. That will avoid duplication of effort and ensure that standards are not put at risk by new proceedings having to be started against institutions that are not meeting the statutory requirements. Amendment No. 151 ensures that the 2,400 or so existing independent schools do not have to be re-registered when the Bill becomes law, and it allows the Secretary of State to waive inspection fees so that institutions are not required to pay fees twice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="81117-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08111721000076">Lastly, amendment No. 152 ensures that directions prohibiting unsuitable people from participating in the management of independent educational institutions can be carried forward, as are any appeals, or reviews of directions, that are in progress.</p>

 As the Minister said, the Lords amendments reverse the provisions in the Bill that transfer registration and regulation of independent schools from the Department for Children, Schools and Families to Ofsted. That is welcome. We argued against that transfer in Committee, and my noble Friend Lady Morris continued the battle in another place. Her powers of persuasion were obviously much stronger than my own and resulted in the amendments tabled on Report in the other place that we are now being asked to agree to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="81117-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08111721000079">The policy behind the provisions in part 4 that sought to make the transfer have been fraught with error and poor policy making right from the start, even during the consultation process. The regulatory impact statement said, erroneously:</p>
<a name="81117-0011.htm_brev1"><a name="08111721000205"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Independent schools will benefit from only dealing with Ofsted.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="81117-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08111721000080">However, half of independent schools are inspected not by Ofsted but by the Independent Schools Inspectorate. The ISI inspects schools that teach about 80 per cent. of pupils educated in the independent sector, so those schools will not deal only with Ofsted. That is an extraordinary factual error of understanding that no doubt contributed to the original decision to move the registration and regulation of independent schools to Ofsted. The original consultation document was also materially wrong. It stated at paragraph 2.23 that the reason for the transfer</p>
<a name="81117-0011.htm_brev2"><a name="08111721000206"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;has been prompted by the transfer of boarding school and children&#146;s home registration and regulation to Ofsted from CSCI &#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="81117-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08111721000081">the Commission for Social Care Inspection&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="81117-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08111721000082">That is wrong, too. Ofsted does not register or regulate boarding accommodation&#151;that stays with the Secretary of State. What transferred at that point from CSCI to Ofsted was the inspection of boarding provision. Again, this is not a minor drafting error&#151;it goes to the root of the Government&#146;s understanding of how these activities are carried out, and it undoubtedly led to the policy that the Minister is now seeking to reverse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="81117-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08111721000083">The ISI and the Independent Schools Council were strongly opposed to the transfer. They have very good relations with the Department&#146;s officials in the independent education and boarding team&#151;they are able to pick up the phone to them when issues arise, and that has worked well for many years. They also feel strongly that the role of inspection should be separate from that of registration and regulation, particularly as there may be disputes over how an inspectorate interprets the regulations with which they are checking compliance. Given that there was no credible policy imperative driving the change, the only reason left was that of efficiency, or alleged efficiency.</p>

That is partly down to the powers of persuasion of my noble Friend Lady Morris and partly due to the Government&#146;s mistaken belief that a U-turn in the other place is less noticeable than one here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="81117-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08111721000090">These Lords amendments take out a large proportion of part 4 by replacing the words &#147;chief inspector&#148; with &#147;Secretary of State&#148;, and they constitute a large proportion of the amendments that we are discussing. They do not remove all of part 4, however, which will dismay some people, particularly those who teach their children at home. Part 4 gives a definition of an independent educational institution because the Government wanted to ensure that a small number of independent schools that provided only part-time education were properly regulated. Through parliamentary questions and confirmation by the Minister during the debate in Committee, such provision turned out to be just four schools.</p>

In Committee, the Minister confirmed that the four institutions that he intended to be caught by the clause were Tyndale academy, Kids Company, Headstart Early Learning Centre and The Children&#146;s Garden. It is rather alarming, in terms of competence of policy making and administration, that the Government now say that that figure is not four but 1,100.

 This brief debate was an opportunity for the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) to make the points that I thought he would make about our small change of heart in this policy area. I am grateful for his warm comments on my noble Friend Lord Adonis. Naturally, as the Minister with responsibility for the Bill, I discuss with Ministers who have responsibility for other policy areas&#151;such as independent schools&#151;debates in the Commons, so the words of the hon. Gentleman and those of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) were not in vain during those debates because I reported their comments to my noble Friend. I justified the policy at the time, and he made the decision in the Lords, having listened to further debate, that the case for change was not as compelling as we previously thought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="81117-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08111721000099">The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked about home schooling and part-time providers, who are mostly engaged in alternative provision. We respect the right of parents to educate their children at home if they so wish, and as I said a number of times in Committee, the family home is not an educational institution and will not fall under the definition of institutions regulated under the Bill. Children educated alone by a parent at all times, regardless of location, will be regarded as those receiving home education and there would be no need to register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="81117-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08111721000100">Given that all children are entitled to learn in a safe environment, the state has a responsibility to make sure that minimum standards are met if they are not supervised by their parents so that they learn in safe premises, where child welfare and protection standards are met and where their education meets minimum standards. Where home education takes place in a pooled setting, and the child&#146;s education is not supervised by the parent, it is right that such provision should be registered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="81117-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08111721000101">The hon. Gentleman asked about part-time providers, and his recollection is right. When we initially took the Bill through the Commons, we were talking about four part-time providers. The work we then did through a telephone survey&#151;it is not desperately authoritative&#151;over the summer reinforces the need for registration. We spoke to just under 50 local authorities following the &#147;Back on Track&#148; White Paper about alternative provision and found that there may be up to 1,100 providers that need to register. I stress to the hon. Gentleman and the House that the figure is up to 1,100 providers&#151;I estimate the figure to be between 130 and 1,100. It was not the most authoritative survey, but that figure reinforces the need for some sort of regulation. It is clear that the likely size of this educational sector makes it more, not less, important that coherent statutory standards are applied to those providers. The 135,000 young people each year who are not educated in schools comprise some of the most vulnerable in society and it is right that the settings in which they are educated should be properly registered and regulated.</p>

out of, or been excluded from, mainstream education, local authorities have been using whatever providers they deem fit to provide alternative provision for those young people.

 I agree with my right hon. Friend about the need for registration, but is the lack of state provision in special establishments the result of closures in the past, when we rushed too quickly for an all-inclusive approach to education for children who need special education in special establishments?</p>

 I am not sure that it is a result of a rush to closure or that we need to enter into the debate on inclusion for children with special educational needs. Such alternative provision is often required for those with behavioural problems; there would obviously be a high percentage of pupils with SEN, but the principal issue relates to those whose behavioural needs could not be dealt with in mainstream education, meaning that some other form of provision had to be commissioned.</p>

 I am digressing somewhat from the debate, but I wanted to make a point that I have made before to my right hon. Friend. Would it not be sensible to look seriously at the idea of local authorities forming consortiums that could provide specialist establishments in the public sector for children with very special needs, given that almost all of us have come across such children?</p>

 My hon. Friend follows such matters closely, and he will know that as a result of the White Paper we published this year, we have focused a lot more on these issues. We are interested in innovative approaches to improving provision, and we want to raise the overall quality of provision for those young people. It is precisely because of the measures we are taking to raise the participation age that we must not give up on any young person, even when they have made mistakes. We are ensuring that local authorities commission the right provision to get those people back on track.</p>

 Does not the debate reveal that a coach and horses has been driven through the Minister&#146;s policy? The White Paper, &#147;Back on Track&#148;, to which he referred, was published in May 2008. At that point, I understand that he had no idea that local authorities were using 1,100 private sector alternative education providers, but he had already formed what he thought would be the policy to improve alternative provision in local authority areas. In his letter of 4 September, he said that his telephone survey was carried out between early June and early July, but he had already formulated his policy in May, before he acquired that crucial piece of information about alternative education in this country.</p>

Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) raised some issues about transitional provisions and the amendments that deal with them. The new clause that amendment No. 150 would insert are intended to provide for the seamless continuity of the law, a phrase that my hon. Friend used about actions begun but not completed under the existing regulatory regime. The purpose is to prevent unnecessary delays and complications in dealing with on-going cases from arising. Clause 151 contains a power to make specific transitional provisions, if necessary. A specific transitional provision would trump the general continuity provision in amendment No. 150.</p>

We are therefore committed to publishing a central list of all independent schools that are registered as being specially organised to provide for children with special educational needs, as the Independent Schools Council has requested.

 The amendment is about school admissions. Whenever a new code on school admissions is issued, it must be consulted on first.

Regulations made under that social security legislation define a &#147;local authority&#148; by reference to the Social Security Administration Act 1992.

The vast majority of comprehensive schools have between 10 and 21 per cent. of pupils on free school meals. Simply moving children around so that every school has the national average of 14 per cent. of pupils qualifying for free school meals would not make the slightest difference to the quality of education in those schools.

 I want to speak briefly about admissions, which concern me and, I am sure, many other hon. Members. I agree with the Opposition spokesman about the importance of leadership and a school&#146;s ethos. He is absolutely correct. In my constituency, we have some first-rate schools and some first-rate head teachers doing a wonderful job, often with children who have some disadvantages, such as speaking English as a second language and other factors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="81117-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08111721000152">I would argue, however, that the problem arose because of the Conservatives, who introduced the idea of parental choice. That led to hierarchies of schools, from schools with a concentration of the less able, as it were, from poorer backgrounds to schools with the most able, from middle-class, academic backgrounds. That has happened in my constituency, as it has surely happened elsewhere too, and it has not helped. It has been socially divisive and has also meant that schools with a high proportion of those from disadvantaged backgrounds can easily say, &#147;It&#146;s not the teaching or the leadership; it&#146;s just the children in our schools.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="81117-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08111721000153">I do not accept that argument for a moment, but if schools had balanced populations within them, we could draw genuine comparisons between them. If every school had the same range of pupils and if one school was doing well and another badly, we would know that that was to do with what was being done in those schools. The problem arose from the idea of parental choice and the hierarchy of secondary schools in particular, which has arisen in my constituency and many others throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="81117-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08111721000154">There are other issues to do with admissions that I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will consider. I am sure she is aware not only that people want to be admitted to what are seen as the target schools, but that sometimes schools are over-subscribed. For instance, there is a shortage of sixth-form places in my constituency. Some youngsters, particularly those who arrive late, over the summer, find it almost impossible to find a sixth-form place, because there are not enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="81117-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08111721000155">I hope that my hon. Friend is looking into how we can ensure that that lack of provision does not arise, so that every child, at whatever level, but particularly at sixth form, can study the subjects they choose and with good-quality teaching in a nearby establishment. That concern has arisen in my constituency and I am sure that there are other hon. Members in a similar situation. I therefore hope that my hon. Friend will look into those problems, too.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) that we want every school to be a good school and that leadership is important. There is still some way to go, but the Government have already gone a long way on that. One of the ways that we have done so is by providing leadership training and by funding schools better, because pupils will generally study a bit better in better buildings&#151;the important thing is staff and ethos, but buildings help, too. However, I live in a deprived part of the country, and if the hon. Gentleman thinks that input into a school does not affect output, which seemed to be the import of his remarks, he is living in a very different world from me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="81117-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08111721000157">The hon. Gentleman decried the need to change the admissions code so frequently and I entirely agree with him. It is most unfortunate that we have a complex admissions code and that it keeps being revised. However, the driver for those changes is that some schools&#151;a minority, but a significant minority&#151;keep trying to get round the admissions code. That point is not based on anecdotal evidence, such as that which he produced about how good one academy in London is; it is based on a survey that the Government conducted to find out whether schools were complying with the admissions code. Surprise, surprise, that survey sadly found that too many schools, albeit a minority, were not complying with the code. The Government are therefore unfortunately in the position of either letting schools ignore the admissions code or enforcing it and closing the loopholes that a minority of schools seek to find within it&#151;</p>

 We have had an interesting and wide-ranging debate, which you acknowledged in your remark, Madam Deputy Speaker. I would like to place it on record that we certainly want all schools to be good schools. That is the aim of the Government. However, we also want a fair admissions code. Indeed, we are amending the admissions code in the Bill to protect looked-after children. I would hope that the objections to revising the admissions code, which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) raised, do not extend to not helping looked-after children. We all acknowledge that they have a tough time and that we should do all we can to ensure that they have decent school provision.</p>

We measure those against each other so that, to use a phrase that I have probably overused today, we can share examples of best practice&#151;a phrase to which the hon.

Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) and the Special Educational Consortium to discuss their concerns. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their helpful comments. My right hon. Friend mentioned to me earlier that we can perhaps consider these measures as the Blackpool amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="81117-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08111721000172">The amendments allow regulations to be made to determine the maximum length of time that a pupil can be required to attend off-site provision. It has always been our intention that governing bodies would be able to require pupils to attend off-site provision only for as long as is reasonable and necessary for the purpose of improving their behaviour. We intend to ensure that that is the case by making regulations that provide that governing bodies may not require a pupil to attend off-site provision for a period that goes beyond the end of the school year in which it is imposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="81117-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08111721000173">We will also set out in regulations that a review must take place within 30 days of the requirement being imposed, and every 30 days thereafter while the pupil is attending off-site provision. We intend to impose an obligation to have regard to guidance, and to issue guidance that will emphasise the need to pay particular attention to pupils with special educational needs. That guidance will set out expectations that an assessment will be undertaken to examine what can be done to improve their behaviour in schools, and how their needs are being met, before an off-site referral is considered. It will also recommend a pre-placement meeting involving the parents, the head teacher, a governor and a local authority representative.</p>

I also express my thanks to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools and Learners, who was particularly helpful and constructive in the discussions that we had. As the Bill passes into law, will these issues continue to be considered, and will the efficacy of the regulations be kept under review?

emotional and behavioural difficulties is the one that has grown most rapidly in the past decade. More of them are statemented than in previous years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="81117-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08111721000178">Clause 138 gives the school governing body the power to direct a registered pupil to attend any place outside the school premises for the purpose of receiving educational provision that is intended to improve their behaviour. As the Minister told us, it has always been the Government&#146;s intention that any such direction would be a short-term measure only. Lords amendments Nos. 168 and 169 make that absolutely explicit in the Bill. It appears that the virtuous flexibility that the Minister for Schools and Learners advocated with such vehemence the last time that I asked for something to be put in the Bill persuades him less on this occasion. It seems that the Government are therefore likely to agree with the Lords amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="81117-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08111721000179">My questions deal with what I believe could be unintended consequences of the amendments, although I acknowledge their advantages, which were well identified and articulated by the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) when we debated the matter at an earlier stage. However, the amendments might prevent off-site education that extends beyond the end of a current academic year for those with behavioural problems. We believe that although the measure would not necessarily prevent permanent exclusions, it would prevent a head from sending a pupil to a referral unit or special school under clause 139. It might fetter the discretion of heads and, in so doing, weaken the resolve to tackle poor behaviour in schools. In the end, it could be beneficial to children with behavioural problems to spend more time outside their normal place of education, perhaps in a specialist school staffed by teachers who are experienced in providing the kind of help and support that children in such circumstances need. There is a risk that the amendment will have the unintended or unforeseen consequence of disadvantaging children of that type.</p>

 I acknowledge the thoughtfulness with which the hon. Gentleman has presented his case, both in Committee and tonight. Is he concerned that in some cases, referrals of children in the circumstances he described are currently to pupil referral units? In some cases&#151;I am choosing my words very carefully&#151;those units may not be adequate to the purpose of achieving the behavioural changes that the pupils need.</p>

<p><a name="st_o263"><a name="08111721000181"><a name="81117-0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="08111721000293"><b>Mr. Hayes:</b>
 I acknowledge that this is a complex area, and the problem is that when we speak of such matters, by necessity we tend almost to speak in more general terms than the individual cases warrant. Behavioural and emotional difficulties are, by their nature, varied and complex, and the needs of the children concerned often require sensitive and highly skilled handling by the best possible professionals. The hon. Gentleman is right; I do not think that anyone, from any part of the House, could argue with their hand on their heart that such service is always delivered&#151;despite the best intentions. He is therefore also right to say that we must be cautious about those referrals, their length and their character.</p>

with a child, in both their interests and those of the whole school community, is to exclude them permanently, rather than send them to a specialist school or a pupil referral unit for an extended period, that could be an unintended consequence of the amendments, which we broadly support, with the caveat that I know the Under-Secretary will deal with using her customary skill in the next few moments.</p>

Earlier, I spoke supportively about the Prince of Wales, who has done such good work with the Prince&#146;s Trust in dealing with some young people in great difficulties, and I described him as the greatest living Briton. Of course, I did not include in that estimation Her Majesty the Queen, who is in her gracious nobility beyond such estimates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="81117-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08111721000186">I shall say a few words about behavioural difficulties for some pupils, because there is a range of behavioural difficulty. Some pupils require special education in a special institution, but the great majority require temporary removal from a classroom, so I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to give as much support as possible, not so much to exclusion from the school, but to providing inclusion units within schools. I have seen them operate very successfully in my constituency. When they are run well by the right people, they work extremely well, but we should not force teachers to deal with unruly or difficult pupils, whatever their problem. They may have serious home difficulties or emotional problems, but the teachers should not have to deal with that; the pupils should be sent fairly quickly to a unit in the school. I have seen the inclusion units operate in my constituency to very good effect, but they need permanent, long-term funding; they do not need time-limited funding, which was the case with one such unit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="81117-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08111721000187">The techniques are simple: pupils can be referred to such units for a few days or perhaps one or two weeks. In one school in particular, they are required to arrive at school half an hour after all the other pupils, and to leave half an hour after them so that the referred pupils do not get mixed up with other pupils. The pupils have that degree of separation, and their reward, when they return to class, is to be able to mix with their friends and to come and go with them at the usual times. All sorts of techniques can be used on a graded basis, and they can help with pupil behaviour, but overall, we need good leadership in schools, the right ethos and a calm and controlled atmosphere, which has been missing for too long from too many of our schools. I have seen schools operating absolutely brilliantly in my constituency, and I should be happy for any hon. Friend to visit them any time.</p>

the amendment would mean that we could not go beyond the end of one academic year, there would be nothing to prevent the school from starting the process again in the following academic year. We do not want the process to be renewable, and that is why we say that we have to start the process all over again. Reasons would have to be given, as would the same two days&#146; notice, and we are not saying that the behaviour that occurred in the previous academic year could be a reason for placing a pupil in off-site provision during the following academic year. That is why there must be continual review, and also why I do not believe that the amendment would encourage head teachers to go for permanent exclusion.

It is important to note that the amendments refer only to the assessment arrangements within the national curriculum. The amendments do not seek to change any other part of the national curriculum after the start of the school year, because that would create unnecessary burdens on schools and necessitate changes to the careful planning of teaching and learning that would already have taken place.</p>

 As the Minister said, the Secretary of State announced that from summer 2009 children would not be required to take key stage 3 tests. The amendments were introduced on Report in the Lords to make technical changes resulting from that decision. Lords amendments Nos. 170, 181, 182 and 209 refer to the removal of the obligation on schools and local education authorities to implement the assessment arrangements in schools.</p>

 It is a pity that the Minister does not spend more time thinking about the children who have fallen back in English and maths than he does thinking about what my hon. Friend has said in Westminster Hall. My hon. Friend has been absolutely consistent in championing the cause of schoolchildren in this country, in his advocacy of higher standards and in his determination that the methodology in schools and the approach taken by teachers should maximise the chances of every child in this country.

These early years are among the most important in education; it is a tragedy that thousands of 14-year-olds have a reading age lower than 11 and that more than 40,000 young people leave school at 16 functionally illiterate and/or innumerate. Many of those young people fall into unemployment and delinquency, and they certainly fall into disengagement.</p>

 I seem to be rising only to welcome U-turns from the Government this evening, and I cannot let this particular one pass without comment. As the Minister said, there has been not one U-turn, but a double U-turn on this issue. One has come from the Conservative party, which, as the Minister rightly said, was praising the key stage 3 tests as the most important just days before it welcomed their abolition. That will teach the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) not to be so honest and straightforward in how he answers questions in future.

That raises the subsidiary question of whether the Government anticipate any further U-turns on key stage tests&#151;perhaps a further amendment to the manner of key stage 2 tests. There is also the related issue of when the Government will clarify the nature of the key stage 2 tests in 2009. Will the Minister say something about both points when he responds?</p>

Like me, the Minister may have seen correspondence from publishers a large proportion of whose business was producing key stage 3 test documents for schools. They were less than amused by the very short notice given of this year&#146;s change in relation to the key stage 3 test.</p>

over the spring and summer, we would not want a change at such short notice to be an example of how the testing regime should be changed in future?

As the Secretary of State said in his statement, we think it important that there is an independently assessed national measure of performance that allows parents and us to judge the performance of primary schools. That function is performed in another respect by GCSEs, but in respect of key stage 2, if there are any changes, those will be informed by the expert group set up under the leadership of Sir Alasdair Macdonald, the head teacher from Tower Hamlets.</p>

We want to build on that now to ensure that all schools are consulting their pupils, as a minimum, on certain core aspects of school life. We know that more than 95 per cent. of schools in England already have school councils, which means that they are fulfilling this new duty.

That &#147;may be&#148; is therefore permissive.

If the Secretary of State may prescribe what the governors do, my understanding is that anything &#147;may be prescribed&#148; down to the last jot and tittle or the last comma in the running of a school. I hope that that is not the Government&#146;s intention&#151;I would appreciate my right hon. Friend&#146;s reassurance on that, particularly with respect to hiring and firing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="81117-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08111727000084">I may be misreading the provision, but it seems to me that under what would become section 29A (2),</p>

It seems to suggest that the school must, on any number of issues that may be prescribed under subsection (4), consult every pupil in order to find out whether they have a relevant view or not. If the pupil does have a relevant view, the governing body, in exercising its functions pursuant to the regulations, must decide how much weight to give to it. How does it discover whether pupils have a relevant view or not? One assumes that the governing body has to ask them.</p>

If my interpretation is correct, everything in a maintained school is covered&#151;including hiring and firing. I understand the desire to make pupils feel included, particularly if we are going to move to compulsory education or training up to the age of 18&#151;that means we are dealing with near-adults whose views should be taken into account; indeed, it is important to take account even of primary school pupils&#146; views through school councils&#151;but how much weight we accord those views, particularly when it comes to hiring and firing, can be an immensely delicate matter. I thus seek my right hon. Friend&#146;s reassurance that the Secretary of State, in making regulations under proposed new section 29A(4), will not include issues of hiring and firing in them.</p>

Any good school has to have proud pupils; otherwise, it is not a good school. Proud pupils are those who like to take part, insofar as they can, in discussing with their teachers and others the running of the school. That is fine.

Nine times out of 10, anyone who goes into any school nowadays and asks what the head wants of Government will be told &#147;To be left to get on with the job and run the school as I would wish to run it with my colleagues and my governors, without interference&#148;.</p>

That is not entirely the fault of the present Government; the previous Conservative Government were also guilty of passing too many laws, in relation to health as well as education. We saw the absurdity of that tonight when we were discussing earlier amendments. It became clear that part of an Act that was passed in 2006 was effectively being repealed by this Bill although it had never been brought into force.

I hope that the thoughtful and sensible words of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West will ensure that we enter the same Lobby&#151;if, that is, the Government persist with the amendments. It would be far better for us to disagree with the Lords and, while encouraging schools to have their councils and other forms of consultation, refrain from putting pupils into the driving seat and introducing the utter absurdity of involving them in what the hon.

It is the quotation from his favourite principal of his favourite school, which he mentions frequently. I refer to Mossbourne academy in Hackney, which the hon.

 This is the point, is it not?

 Surely the issue, as Lord Elton put it, is whether there is sufficient flexibility in the amendment.

The hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) was rightly anxious for the responsibilities to consult with the student body not to become too onerous. I have no doubt that he has read Lords amendment No. 171, which is framed in very modest terms. It suggests that the governing bodies should invite the views of pupils and consider them.

<p><a name="st_o305"><a name="08111727000105"><a name="81117-0015.htm_spnew6"><a name="08111727000608"><b>Mr. Laws:</b>
 We all note the clear divisions in the Conservative party between the views expressed in this place and another place. I simply draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to the view of his noble Friends that there is enough flexibility in the amendment to allow for his concerns. He will also know that on 11 November Baroness Morgan put on the record in another place the specific areas in which there would be a requirement on schools to consult in different ways with pupils, and those certainly excluded issues such as staff appointments&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am sure Members would not want to bring the discussion of this amendment to too early a close.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="81117-0015.htm_para22"><a name="08111727000108">I also invite Members to take reassurance in one other respect. The significance of the amendment will be heavily dependent on the regulations that are brought forward by the Minister on this point, and it will be quite possible for the Minister to make sure that they are drafted in such a way as to ensure the flexibility that all Members would wish for. I hope the Minister will be able to confirm that when the regulations are brought forward, they will embed the flexibility that all Members of this House want, and that ensured there was unanimity on this amendment in another place.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has made the case very well, and I do not need to detain the House for long. We have yet another U-turn from the Conservative party. It is not quite as rapid a U-turn as that which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) made on standard assessment tests, but it is extraordinary: Baroness Verma, who led for the Opposition  <br>

 A little earlier, when I walked into the Chamber, I was overwhelmed by the pleasure that Members displayed on seeing me. I think that it had something to do with the earliness of the hour and the opportunity they would have to get on with other business on behalf of constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08111729000005">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of health care in my constituency and in the wider borough of Sutton, and my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) hopes to contribute to the debate if he can. I shall start with some geography. Although my constituency is called Sutton and Cheam, the area known as Worcester Park makes up a large part of it. Many of my constituents feel that because it is not included in the name of the constituency, it is often overlooked. I wish to ensure that that is not the case in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08111729000006">There are real concerns about the quality and accessibility of primary, acute and mental health care in the London borough of Sutton and in particular in my constituency. I wish to raise five issues with the Minister in this debate. The first is the need for an early decision on the funding for &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148; in general, and the new patient block at St. Helier in particular. The Minister will know from meetings that we have had that this issue is close to my heart and of considerable concern and interest to my constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08111729000007">Secondly, I want to talk about the future governance arrangements for the Epsom and St. Helier trust and the constituent parts of that trust. Thirdly, I want to draw attention to the shortage of GP cover in the Worcester Park part of my constituency. This has been an issue for some time, which is why I am mentioning it tonight. Fourthly, I want to register some concerns about mental health services and their development&#151;or lack of it. Finally, I want to raise the future of the Sutton hospital site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08111729000008">&#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148; is a programme that has been worked up by the local acute trust, Epsom and St. Helier, the Sutton and Merton PCT, Surrey PCT and others over the last five or six years. A great deal of time and taxpayers&#146; money has been spent on endless rounds of stakeholder engagement, citizen juries, consultation, strategies, plans, designs, the redrawing of those designs and&#151;of course&#151;consultants, to little apparent effect over the last 10 years. Although &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148; is the current programme, there have been previous exercises with various titles, including &#147;Investing in Excellence&#148;. All those programmes have attempted to grapple with problems such as providing more health care outside general hospital settings and in the community, to bring more health care, diagnostics and other treatments closer to where people live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08111729000009">Many of us welcome such ideas, but it is also recognised that long-overdue investment is needed in the general hospital at St. Helier. I say that many of us recognised that, but not all of us did, and part of the reason why the process has taken so long is that that view was not generally held for some considerable time. As a result, we have had much to-ing and fro-ing over where a new  <br>

general hospital might be built. I am pleased to say that we now have a conclusion, which is that it should remain where it is, at St. Helier, and that that is where the investment is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08111729000010">For the period 2004-08 more than &#163;4 million has been spent on the &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148; programme. That money has not built anything, but it has produced reams and reams of paper. So far, it has not delivered anything. We will never know how much was spent on the abortive work on &#147;Investing in Excellence&#148;, because as the trust said in reply to a freedom of information request,</p>

We do not know whether all that consultancy related to these programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08111729000012">As a result of all these delays, while Kingston, St. George&#146;s in Tooting and even the Mayday hospital in Croydon have seen investment, St. Helier has sat perched on the hill overlooking south London, with paint peeling, marking time, waiting for a future.</p>

 My hon. Friend is correct: we have seen investment in a much-needed fountain at the front of the hospital. I am sure that it has been uplifting to the spirits of many of our constituents who have passed through its doors, although they would probably have preferred to see investment in the buildings.</p>

 Residents in Croydon obviously have a real interest in health care in the constituencies of the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) and for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), who have been conscientious about raising these issues in the House. Is not the problem that we have seen uncertainty about health provision in that part of south London? Now is the time to invest, but the only investment in St. Helier hospital will be in Ferguson house. In many ways, perhaps because of the university and training hospitals elsewhere in London, our area suffers from a lack of investment. Our residents in Croydon and Sutton therefore end up being short-changed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o315"><a name="08111729000016"><a name="81117-0016.htm_spnew6"><a name="08111729000072"><b>Mr. Burstow:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes some fair points about the limbo that the health service in the London borough of Sutton has experienced for some time. At long last, however, the local NHS has come up with a plan that has secured the support of the joint overview and scrutiny committee, which comprises elected members from Merton, Sutton and Surrey, and local residents and local MPs, including the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh). That plan has been submitted as an outline business case to NHS London. The plan includes a brand new, state-of-the-art building that will replace Ferguson house and will house the majority of the hospital&#146;s wards and clinics. It also sees the establishment of a network of local care centres&#151;formerly known as care hospitals&#151;throughout Sutton and Merton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08111729000017">The investment at St. Helier in the new patient block is the keystone of the plan. Without it, the plans collapse, because they do not support the weight of the logic that drives them. Without that plan, my constituents will not get the 21st century health care to which they are entitled. What is urgently required now is a green light from the Government&#151;in the first instance, from NHS London and then from the Department for Health and the Treasury&#151;to fund the &#163;140 million cost of the new building. I fear that further delay could be fatal to the future of our general hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08111729000018">My second point concerns the future governance arrangements for Epsom and St. Helier hospitals. The trust is consulting on a range of options, including maintaining the status quo of the current arrangements for Epsom and St. Helier, and the possibility of an amicable divorce between the two hospitals. Having seen a succession of chief executives struggle to make the trust function as a single effective entity, I am convinced that a de-merger is the right way forward. Straddling the Greater London boundary, the trust finds itself pulled in at least two directions: south to meet the needs of north Surrey and north to meet the needs of Sutton and Merton. It is constantly being pulled by two strategic health authorities with different agendas, trying to meet the different aspirations and needs of different populations. It will always find it difficult to meet those aspirations as one corporate entity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08111729000019">Epsom and St. Helier was created by something of a shotgun marriage in 1999. At the time, the Department of Health saw the need to try to stabilise the financial situation in both trusts&#151;particularly, as I understand it, in the Epsom Health Care NHS Trust, as it was at the time&#151;and drove the change to a speedy conclusion. It certainly did not benefit from as much external scrutiny as local overview and scrutiny committees would give such changes today. The legacy of that shotgun marriage has been a decade of paralysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08111729000020">De-merger would allow a St. Helier NHS trust, as it would become, to focus on meeting the needs of residents in Sutton and Merton, delivering long overdue investment in services and infrastructure. My only concern, however, is that a possible de-merger could derail investment at St. Helier and the implementation of &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148;. My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington and I have sought reassurances from the Epsom and St. Helier trust that that would not be the case, and we have heard warm words of encouragement. The trust believes that it would not undermine anything within the outline business case that has been submitted. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me on that point. If we can secure the future of St. Helier and see the roll-out of &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148;, that should create the necessary space to concentrate on other deficits in local primary care and mental health services in the Sutton area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08111729000021">That brings me to my third point. I have for some years now been dealing with constituents in Worcester Park who have experienced serious difficulties in obtaining access to a local GP&#146;s list. Indeed, I understand that constituents moving from the Sutton part of my constituency to Worcester Park often beg their GP to let them remain on their books for that very reason.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08111729000022">Worcester Park could be described as a GP desert. When one crosses the Kingston and Sutton boundary, one will find no GP practice until one hits the London  <br>

road. I believe that it is time that Sutton and Merton, as a primary care trust, took up its responsibilities to ensure a fair distribution of GP provision across the area and actively engaged with local residents in Worcester Park to gauge the true level of local need and to meet it appropriately. The trust has continued to argue for too long now that there is no problem, despite all the anecdotal evidence, the evidence from my mailbag and the views of some GPs in the area who have identified the problem. I hope that the Minister will encourage the primary care trust to take on that challenge and to engage with the local population on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08111729000023">My fourth point relates to mental health. Again, reorganisation of mental health services in south-west London and sometimes weak health care leadership&#151;particularly in the past&#151;have left mental health services in the London borough of Sutton suffering from under-investment. There has been a lack of investment in developing supported living and supported employment and in building capacity in the private and voluntary sectors to provide a more diverse and appropriate community-based set of services for people with mental health problems and learning disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08111729000024">A consortium of south-west London primary care trusts is on the verge of consulting on plans for acute provision that might lead to the loss of beds at the Chiltern wing on the Sutton hospital site in my constituency and their possible transfer to remote locations at either Tolworth or Springfield in Tooting. I do not support the loss of acute beds in the borough. I think that that would be bad for patients and for their carers and families. I strongly believe that the opportunity should be taken to break down the stigma around mental health by co-locating mental and physical health services on the same sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08111729000025">Community mental health services could be co-located with local care centres. Indeed, that is suggested in the outline business case that has been submitted. The opportunity should similarly be taken to consider the possibility of locating acute mental health beds separately but on the St. Helier site. That should not be lost sight of in the necessary drive to get an outline business case signed off for the new patient block at St. Helier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08111729000026">Finally, question marks remain over the future of the Sutton hospital site. If &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148; moves from theory to practice, and we start to see its implementation, that will leave a question mark hanging over the future of the Sutton site after 2016. That seems some way away, but my constituents feel that they need to know with some certainty that there are clear undertakings and processes surrounding how that site&#146;s future will be determined. They regard NHS land as precious, as I do. Once it has been built on&#151;particularly once houses are built on it&#151;it is lost, which means that the huge opportunities are lost. Before it is lightly disposed of, the site&#146;s potential for future use by both the NHS and social care in my area should be actively explored. I hope that the Minister agrees that my constituents should have a chance to have their say in the future use of the site, to ensure that it meets local health care needs and addresses the running sore of spill-over parking on residential roads around the site.</p>

Too much time, energy and money has been absorbed getting to this point, but we are here at last. Much now hangs on an early green light for the outline business case for St. Helier and for &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148;. Those proposals unlock the opportunity to deal with mental health and primary care, and I hope that the decision can be taken soon.</p>

 First, I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) for arriving two minutes into his speech. I had anticipated that we would reach this point at 10 o&#146;clock, so I had to hot-foot it in from my constituency to be here in time for the debate. I thank my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para26"><a name="08111729000030">It is incumbent on my hon. Friend and me to confirm that there is some good news in Sutton. I am pleased that in Wallington, at the Shotfield health centre, we can see major works under way with lots of scaffolding. Significant progress is clearly being made and, in the next 18 months or so, we will see a large, new, purpose-built, fit-for-purpose health centre. It will replace the health centre that my family have used, which is completely inadequate at present. That will be a fantastic, positive and modern development and I want to praise the GPs for the way in which they have worked with local residents, local residents&#146; groups and local councillors to come forward with a scheme that is acceptable to everyone locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="81117-0016.htm_para27"><a name="08111729000031">I also want to take this opportunity to praise Carshalton Fields surgery, which organised a vocal campaign on the issue of polyclinics, expressing support for continuing to operate as a local family practice.

It is clearly beginning to have an impact both in the primary care trust and the acute trust. I do not know whether my hon.

That is a positive development.</p>

 I take that point, Madam Deputy Speaker. In the context of the pressures, we have to take cognisance of the need for relevant services across south London. Close to the constituency of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, and just over the border of Carshalton and Wallington, Purley hospital has not been able to be rebuilt either. As in the example of Mayday, there is a need to move it to the gateway site in central Croydon rather than its being in north Croydon.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He encourages me to stray slightly beyond the borders of the London borough of Sutton, which I am loth to do. I am sure his constituents have noted his intervention in the debate and the significant points he has made on their behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08111729000038">I have a couple of not such good news stories. A point was raised with both my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam and me by one of his constituents about the standard of care received by her elderly relative when she was in St. Helier hospital. Apparently my hon. Friend&#146;s constituent was asked by nurses whether she lived locally and when she confirmed that she did, she was asked to go home and get some pillows for her relative as there was a shortage in the hospital. Given that the funding the Government have provided the NHS has increased to the extent it has, which we admit, why is it still the case that some of the basics&#151;the fundamentals of care&#151;have still not been addressed as we would like? The constituent described the care received by her elderly relative in hospital and it is not something that any of us would feel comfortable about if our relatives had experienced it. I cannot refer to the case in more detail because I have not checked whether my hon. Friend&#146;s constituent would be happy for me to mention anything more specific. None the less, some of the fundamentals have not been addressed.</p>

As he said, it could delay proceedings further, but what is more fundamentally dispiriting is that it is a recognition of the fact that the trust never succeeded in getting the Epsom and St. Helier hospitals and their consultants to work together effectively.</p>

It relates to the Henderson hospital, a matter that my hon. Friend and I have discussed with a succession of Ministers for months, if not years&#151;it is ongoing. The fundamental issue, which has not been picked up by the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Corby (Phil Hope), who has most recently responded to us, is that an assessment of the effectiveness of the therapeutic model at the Henderson has still not been carried out. The Government say that they have looked  <br>

at whether there has been replication of the model&#151;there has&#151;yet the proposal is to cancel or abolish it without anyone having looked at whether it is effective. The Department of Health say that the therapeutic model has not proved itself because there is no evidence and that, because there is no evidence, we have to get rid of it. However, if anyone had been able to obtain some evidence, it might have confirmed that the therapeutic model was perfectly viable and the right approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08111729000041">I may have surprised the Minister with that point, but I hope that he can write to my hon. Friend and me to confirm that when the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence considers at an international level the appropriateness of models such as the Henderson, it will look at the Henderson and identify hospitals and communities internationally that are doing similar things. That will confirm once and for all whether that type of therapeutic approach for people with personality disorders can work. At the moment the work has not been done, so it would be entirely wrong for the Government to get rid of that therapeutic model. The Minister may say that he is not responsible for that work, but I am sure that he would like in-depth research into the effectiveness of the model. I conclude on that point, but as my hon. Friend said, I hope we shall hear good news about the &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148; project and that the team&#146;s proposal will be endorsed by NHS London, the Department of Health and eventually the Treasury so that the development can take place.</p>

Gentlemen&#146;s constituents are receiving better health care than ever. Waiting times are at record low levels, life expectancy and other health outcomes are higher than they have ever been and with more than half the hon. Gentlemen&#146;s GP surgeries now offering extended hours, it is easier to see a GP in Sutton than ever before. The latest annual report into NHS performance by the independent health watchdog the Healthcare Commission said that both the primary care trust responsible for organising services in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency and his local hospitals have improved on their performance of last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08111729000044">As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, however, health care can never stand still. With advances in medical technology and treatment, the NHS has constantly to examine how it can best provide services to meet the needs and expectations of the public. There is also, as he understands and acknowledged in his speech, a long history to the debate over the best way to organise services in south-west London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08111729000045">We are now at the stage where proposals have at last been agreed, as the hon. Gentleman also graciously acknowledged. The proposals are supported not only by all the PCTs and acute trusts in the area that have an interest, but by the local Members of Parliament, with whom I have had discussions about the issues on a  <br>

number of occasions in the past, and they have been unanimously supported by the local overview and scrutiny committees&#151;the local government representatives who scrutinise local health proposals and, if they feel the need, object to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08111729000046">The local needs, local health review launched jointly by Epsom and St. Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust and the London strategic health authority will consider whether there are better ways of managing the two hospital sites, as the hon. Gentleman outlined, and better ways for the trust to meet the diverse health needs of his local communities. It will look at how it can ensure that patients access better services locally, and that the trusts continue to improve standards of care and meet their statutory obligations, while recruiting and retaining adequate staff and maintaining their continued professional development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08111729000047">The review is not exclusive to the trust and the London SHA. It involves three other partner organisations: Sutton and Merton primary care trust, Surrey PCT and the South East Coast strategic health authority. The organisations should be commended for working together in an effort to reach a workable solution that should meet the needs of the populations that they all serve; that is not always easy, when local considerations come into play. The local needs, local health review will be run by a project board, which will be made up of executive and non-executive directors from the five partner organisations and chaired by the London SHA. A project team of senior managers from the partner organisations will support the project board. The team will be led by a project director, who will report directly to the trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08111729000048">It is hoped that the project board will meet in December for the first time. One of its first tasks will be to engage staff and volunteers in the review process to ensure that their concerns and views are taken into account. The project board should be in a position to deliver a formal report by the end of spring 2009. That should allow sufficient time for the review to take place, while the uncertainty surrounding the future of the two hospitals is resolved as quickly as possible. Of course, I understand the desire of the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam and for Carshalton and Wallington to make rapid progress, but I hope that they understand that it is important to get things right, rather than move quickly to make changes that one might later regret.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08111729000049">As the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said, the &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148; strategy is linked with the plans for Epsom and St. Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust. The strategy is led by Sutton and Merton PCT, in partnership with Epsom and St. Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust. Its aim is to reshape the whole health service in Sutton and Merton, so that it provides better quality health care, designed around the needs of local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08111729000050">The programme proposes to create integrated health care services, based in a number of local care centres that are supported by a local acute hospital that provides core secondary services. The outline business case, referred to by the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam and for Carshalton and Wallington, was submitted by Sutton and Merton PCT to NHS London on 23 October. It is a complex programme, comprising a number of projects, the largest of which, as the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam acknowledged, is the &#163;152-million first  <br>

phase of redevelopment of St. Helier hospital. Other projects include local care centres in the following locations: Nelson hospital, costing &#163;19 million; St. Helier hospital, costing &#163;15 million; and Wilson hospital, costing &#163;10 million. There will also be an intermediate care centre on the Wilson hospital site, costing &#163;12 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08111729000051">In total, the projects for which approval is sought from the SHA have a capital value of &#163;208 million. In addition to the suite of projects that I have just outlined, there are a further two&#151;a local care centre at Wallington and an urgent care centre on the St. Helier site&#151;with a combined capital value of &#163;18 million. As I am sure that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will appreciate, the assessment of all those projects has to be thorough, and the analysis must be robust. Capital advisory staff at the London SHA will collate responses and questions from the project board, and they will be sent to the PCT and trust in December. Subject to satisfactory responses by the trust and PCT to the questions raised, NHS London will take the case through its approval process in January 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08111729000052">Assuming that all goes to plan, and the proposals are approved by the SHA and my Department, the proposed timetable is as follows: the Wallington local centre should open in 2011, the Nelson and Wilson local care centres and the Wilson intermediate care centre will open in 2013, and the St. Helier local care centre and phase 1 of the site redevelopment will open in 2016. That timetable allows time for the development of detailed plans for final approval, the production and approval of full business cases for each element of the project, including Treasury approval for the St. Helier site, and the construction and commissioning of the buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08111729000053">The hon. Gentleman reminded me of his interest in a possible fifth local care centre, to be sited on the Sutton hospital site. I understand that the PCT is in preliminary discussions with the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust about possible options for the development of a different type of health facility on that site. Again, I hope that the hon. Member will appreciate that all the interested parties want to make sure that the proposals meet the needs of the local community, and that we provide first-class, sustainable services in surroundings that are fit for purpose and represent the modern, high-quality NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para15"><a name="08111729000054">The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington will have to forgive me; I was not briefed on the issue of the Henderson hospital site. However, I will ensure that he gets a response on the subject from my fellow Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Phil Hope), who is responsible for mental health matters.

 I beg the hon. Gentleman&#146;s pardon. I am sure that he will encourage his constituent to make a formal complaint, if they have not already done so. We have an independent, robust complaints system in place, and it is important that Members of Parliament encourage constituents who have such cases to take it up, not least  <br>

because hospitals&#146; performance is judged not only on the number of complaints that they receive, but on how they respond to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08111729000057">The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam also raised the issue of the provision of mental health services, and mental health beds, in his constituency. The London SHA informs me that the number of mental health beds has gone down in his area, as investment in community services has risen across west London. That pattern is replicated across the country. The four PCTs in the five boroughs served by the South West London and St. George&#146;s Mental Health NHS Trust have recently started work on a joint strategic plan for in-patient services across all care groups. That includes plans for Sutton hospital and mental health in-patient services. Sutton and Merton PCT is leading on that work, which is likely to lead to consultation on a range of options in the spring of 2009, with decisions expected next summer. Those options are likely to include some that retain mental health beds in Sutton and others that transfer them to other boroughs. I encourage him to be closely involved in that consultation process so that he can be reassured that his voice is heard.</p>

<p><a name="st_o324"><a name="08111729000058"><a name="81117-0017.htm_spnew6"><a name="08111729000081"><b>Tom Brake:</b>
 Could the Minister confirm on the record that he would expect accessibility of mental health services to be just as important as accessibility of other health services? The whole proposal, &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148;, is about making general health services more readily accessible to local people, and that must also be the case for mental health services.</p>

<p><a name="st_o325"><a name="08111729000059"><a name="81117-0017.htm_spnew7"><a name="08111729000082"><b>Mr. Bradshaw:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right that any organisation of services has to take access into account, and national guidelines will be laid down to ensure that that happens. However, the decision as to how best that is done on the ground is taken by the local health service. If there are fundamental and comprehensive changes to how services are organised in any particular area, it is open to him, or to the local councillors in that area, to raise objections through the overview and scrutiny and independent reconfiguration process, and I encourage them to do so if they are concerned about it. As the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam knows, the issues to do with the provision of these services are for his local health trust to resolve, and I encourage him and other hon. Members with an interest to engage in that process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08111729000060">The hon. Gentleman raised a problem in part of his constituency about density as regards the provision of GPs. I will have a word with the primary care trust about that, but I urge him to maintain the pressure on it. It is important that PCTs take GP access seriously to ensure that no members of the public are disadvantaged by a shortage of GPs in a particular area. As I am sure that he will appreciate, overall investment in primary care, as in all health services, is increasing year on year. That is the responsibility of PCTs, which will now be measured and ranked, not least on how they provide these services to deliver them in a proper and fair way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="81117-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08111729000061">I hope that this debate has gone some way towards reassuring the hon. Gentleman that the proposals for Epsom and St. Helier, and for local care developments as part of &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148;, are moving forward. NHS London has advised me, in response to another question that he raised, that &#147;Better Healthcare  <br>

One does not depend on another, the first being about service development and the second being about organisational management arrangements. The local needs, local health review should have no significant impact on any aspect of &#147;Better Healthcare Closer to Home&#148;. I am meeting the chief executive of NHS London tomorrow, and I will ensure that she is aware that this debate has happened.
