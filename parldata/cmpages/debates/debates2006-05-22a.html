Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b> I am sure
that the whole House will join me in sending condolences to the
families of Private Joseva Lewaicei and Private Adam Morris, who were
killed on Saturday 13 May north of Basra city. Our thoughts are also
with the soldier injured in that incident, with the two soldiers who
were injured in the incident at the weekend in Basra, and with their
families.</p><p><a name="06052329000056">Although
insurgents continue to pursue a policy of violence and intimidation
with the aim of disrupting the political process in Iraq, the majority
of attacks are confined to four of the 18 provinces. However, their
efforts have not precluded the formation of a new Government of
national unity in Iraq. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said
this morning, that is a huge step forward which deserves international
support. In Basra, and across Multi-National Division (South-East),
despite recent tragic events the security situation remains relatively
calm.</p><p><a name="06052329000057"><b><a name="06052329001885">David
Taylor:</b> As my right hon. Friend said, Adam Morris, a
19-year-old soldier from Hugglescote in north-west Leicestershire, was
killed by a roadside bomb near Basra nine days ago along with a
colleague from the Royal Anglian Regiment as they travelled in a Land
Rover protected only by composite fibreglass. As well as extending deep
condolences to Adam&#146;s family and friends, the House will endorse
the <i> Leicester Mercury </i>letter-writing campaign to boost the
regiment&#146;s morale. Does the Secretary of State agree that a
large majority in both the United Kingdom and Iraq want an early
withdrawal of foreign troops? Does 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1184</b><br>he think that partition is necessary to prevent the country from
descending further into an anarchistic
hell-hole?</p><p><a name="06052329000058"><b><a name="06052329001886">Des
Browne:</b> May I first commend my hon. Friend for his support
not only for his constituent&#146;s family, but for the Royal Anglian
Regiment? I met members of the regiment in Basra last week, and I can
reassure him, his constituents and, indeed, his local newspaper, that
the morale of those soldiers was very high. In my short time in this
job I have been struck by how often our forces meet our expectation,
whatever adversity they face, that they will maintain the highest
standards not only of morale but of discipline, application and duty.
On the meat of his question, it is of course our ambition and intention
to remove our troops from Iraq, but we shall do so in the proper
context, which has been set out on numerous occasions at the Dispatch
Box and involves the nature of the threat, the capacity of Iraqi forces
to provide security for their own people, the capacity of their
Government both at national and provincial level to govern, and our own
ability to respond to support the Iraqi Government&#146;s ambitions.
I can say no more than that in support of our position in
Iraq.</p><p><a name="06052329000059"><b><a name="06052329001887">Andrew
Selous:</b> Does the Ministry of Defence believe that the
missile that downed our Lynx in Basra on6 May was sold by
Russia to Iran, and has the Army asked for any extra resources to deal
with the current attacks against it?</p><p><a name="06052329000060"><b><a name="06052329001888">Des
Browne:</b> The hon. Gentleman will know&#151;I made my
position clear in my statement to the House after the Lynx helicopter
crash&#151;that I will not speculate on any aspect of that crash, as
a board of inquiry and an investigation are under way. Given the nature
of that investigation, it would not be helpful to speculate at the
Dispatch Box about the way in which the helicopter was brought down
until it is concluded. That is my position, and it would not be helpful
to be drawn into further speculation.</p><p><a name="06052329000061"><b><a name="06052329001889">Mr.
David Winnick (Walsall, North) (Lab):</b> Does my right hon.
Friend agree that, whatever views one took about the original invasion,
there should be total condemnation of the so-called insurgents who
carry out, day after day, the most horrifying crimes against the Iraqi
people? Should not the newly elected Government in Iraq accept the fact
that our troops cannot remain there indefinitely? They should
concentrate on the task before them, bearing in mind, as I have said,
the fact that there will come a time when our troops must
leave?</p><p><a name="06052329000062"><b><a name="06052329001890">Des
Browne:</b> My hon. Friend would do well to reflect on the
words of the new Prime Minister of Iraq, who spelled out clearly the
priorities of his Government for the economy, security, militia and the
provision of governance, at both national and provincial level, for the
people of Iraq. It is politics that will resolve the issues that face
the people of Iraq. My hon. Friend is right that whatever the motives
of those who seek to use violence&#151;whether they are insurgents
or, as I was advised in the south-east, those who, in the absence of a
central Government, are positioning themselves 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1185</b><br>economically or politically to take advantage of that
situation&#151;there is now a Government of national unity in Iraq,
and in the words of others who have spoken on that today, there is no
reason now for those insurgencies to continue. The destiny of the
people of Iraq is in their own hands. We are all working towards a
situation where, in terms of security and governance, the Iraqi
Government will be able to look after their own people and there will
be no need for the continued support of multinational forces. Until
that time comes, we have a duty to continue to support that
Government.</p><p><a name="06052329000063"><b><a name="06052329001891">Bob
Spink (Castle Point) (Con):</b> The right hon. Gentleman will
have heard the Prime Minister&#146;s words this morning about an exit
strategy for our troops in Iraq. Can he give the House some
detail&#151;for instance, about the length of time it might take for
our troops to finish training the Iraqi security forces, so that they
can then be brought
home?</p><p><a name="06052329000064"><b><a name="06052329001892">Des
Browne:</b> When I visited Maysan province and in particular
Camp Sparrowhawk last week, I was struck by the level of competence of
the 4th brigade of the 10th division of the Iraqi army. That is my only
personal experience of their competence, ability and determination to
take command of the security situation, but even that observation was
informed by other, more experienced military people who were in my
company, who were able to point out to me what I ought to be looking
for in relation to that competence. I am not able at this stage to say
when those forces&#151;army and police&#151;will be capable of
looking after their own security, but very experienced military
personnel who serve in our forces in the south-east of Iraq tell me
that they have made significant progress towards that objective over
the past year or so. They also tell me that in three out of the four
provinces for which we have responsibility in south-east Iraq, progress
in governance and security is well
advanced.</p><p><a name="06052329000065"><b><a name="06052329001893">Andrew
Mackinlay (Thurrock) (Lab):</b> May I take the Secretary of
State back to the carefully crafted reply that he gave a few moments
ago to the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)
about the inquiry that is to be held into the loss of our troops as a
result of a missile? Will he assure the House that the inquiry will
cover the source of that missile, rather than just the incident itself?
That is what I felt the Minister&#151;unintentionally, of
course&#151;tried to avoid. We want an assurance that if intelligence
and information are available it will be disclosed at the inquiry and
subsequently made public, and that the inquiry&#146;s remit will
cover
that.</p><p><a name="06052329000066"><b><a name="06052329001894">Des
Browne:</b> I did not seek even to confirm in the House that
the helicopter had been brought down by a missile. If anything I said
may have inadvertently led people to believe that I was imparting that
information to the House, I did so in error, but I do not believe that
I did. As I told the House when I made my statement last Monday, when
the investigation is concluded the board of inquiry report will be
published, to the extent that it can be. Until then, I will not be
drawn into any speculation on any aspect of the investigation. I, as
the Secretary of State for Defence, do not direct the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1186</b><br>investigation. It is conducted according to a set of rules that apply
and have applied for a significant time. It will be conducted
independently of any direction by Ministers, it will be conducted
appropriately, and it will report on the issues that it thinks are
relevant to the matters before
it.</p><p><a name="06052329000067"><b><a name="06052329001895">Dr.
Julian Lewis (New Forest, East) (Con):</b> May I associate the
Opposition with the Secretary of State&#146;s condolences to the
families of those who lost their lives on active service in
Iraq?</p><p><a name="06052329000068">Does the
Secretary of State accept that, time after time at the Dispatch Box,
his predecessor stated that it would be absolute folly to say anything
about timetables for withdrawal other than when the job is done? Does
he endorse that sentiment, and, if so, will he use his best endeavours
in the Cabinet to put an end to the stream of articles and leaks that
imply that withdrawal is on the cards, so that the Prime Minister can
leave a legacy as a peacemaker? We do not want the Prime Minister to
leave a legacy as a lethal version of the grand old duke of
York.</p><p><a name="06052329000069"><b><a name="06052329001896">Des
Browne:</b> When history considers the contribution of my
right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to conflict resolution in a number
of theatres around the world, it will significantly record that he has
made a major contribution to peace in a number of parts of the world. I
am not aware of any leaking of articles or briefing about a timetable.
What I have sought to do, as indeed did my predecessor, is to give some
clarity to the conditions that will need to be fulfilled before it will
be appropriate for our forces to withdraw, first, part of the way, and
then fully from Iraq. Like my predecessor, I have sought not to put a
timetable on that, because I do not think that that would be in the
interests of either the people of Iraq or the security of our own
forces who are serving in Iraq, often in dangerous
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06052329000070">I
fully agree that there needs to be some clarity in the description of
the process, and I think that that is clear and that most people
understand what the conditions need to be, but it is appropriate, when
there is progress along that direction of travel, for that to be
reported to the House. During my visit to Iraq, those whom we charge
with the responsibility of making such assessments on the ground
indicated that in a substantial part of Iraq for which we have
responsibility significant progress has been
made.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052329000043">Defence Sector (West

Shropshire, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend, who has been fully
determined in pursuing a range of issues, some of which have played to
his advantage, although not completely in the way in which he sought.
He listed a range of events. If on assessment they remain or are built
on, that will be good news. If we have to make a decision that, in the
interests of defence, we co-locate headquarters or rationalise to
ensure that we make best use of resources, I am sorry but I will have
to give him bad news&#151;but I will do that at the time that I make
my

Pritchard (The Wrekin) (Con):</b> Given the skills, dedication
and commitment of Defence Logistics Organisation workers in Shropshire
and the potential co-location to the south-west, is it not incumbent on
the Ministry of Defence to have an open, transparent and fair
consultation process? If so, why has the Ministry of Defence already
purchased the building in Bristol that is being investigated by the
Auditor
General?</p><p><a name="06052329000076"><b><a name="06052329001902">Mr.
Ingram:</b> Just because it is being investigated does not
mean that it is wrong, and the hon. Gentleman should not pre-judge. As
has been explained before, the property was purchased as a piece of
developmental work, looking at possibilities for the co-location of
headquarters. Had we delayed purchasing the property when we had the
opportunity to do so and then decided to so co-locate, it would have
cost us more money. This is a judicious piece of positioning. It does
not mean that that will be the final conclusion. I take exception to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s approach on openness and transparency. I
have met him and others, and I will continue to do so. We operate
openly and transparently in arriving at decisions and explain them
afterwards in consultation with the trade unions and staff interests. I
am sorry that he takes a different view, but I would not have thought
that that was based on his
experience.</p><p><a name="06052329000077"><b><a name="06052329001903">Mr.
Ian Austin (Dudley, North) (Lab):</b> It is not only west
midlands defence sector jobs but aerospace engineering and training
excellence that make the case for locating the defence training
contract at Cosford so strong. The region&#146;s universities are
intrinsically involved in Cosford&#146;s work, and there are
fantastic transport links, including the M54 and a direct rail service.
I invite the Minister to visit the west midlands to see at first hand
the fantastic opportunities that Cosford offers the

question with a response, given the subject matter. He has asked about
rotary lift, which has nothing to do with heavy lift. We plan to hold a
competition to find a new medium-lift helicopter to meet our
medium-term needs, and it will proceed in due course. In the meantime,
we must examine our capacity and capabilities on rotary lift, and we
are considering whether Puma and Sea King helicopters can be modified
or refurbished for short-term use. We are also exploring how we can get
more out of existing Merlin and Chinook helicopters and the feasibility
of leasing aircraft. We are aware of the issues that must be addressed:
there may well be a short-term solution, but there will be medium-term
and long-term solutions, too, which means significant investment in our

made to the calming of the situation after the Lynx crash. There had
been other evidence of the improving capability of the Iraqi forces in
their contribution to the referendum and to the security of the general
election in December last year. From our point of view as a Government,
we will continue to offer the Iraqi Government support on a bilateral
basis, but it will of course be for them to decide what continuing

malevolent purposes. The capacity to deal with that in the area for

lack of a proper relationship with the provincial council in the

the day after the horrific crash of the Lynx helicopter. Last week, I

is bearing fruit? My hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and
Sheppey (Derek Wyatt) cited the example of the downing of the Lynx,
where the Iraqi security services were able to take control of the
situation very soon
afterwards.</p><p><a name="06052329000095"><b><a name="06052329001920">Des
Browne:</b> My hon. Friend speaks from some experience. Let me
emphasise to hon. Members who have visited our forces in Iraq to see
the position there that our troops on the ground greatly appreciate
that. Sometimes they believe, for whatever reason, that their work and
achievements are not fully appreciated in the United Kingdom, and it is
helpful when parliamentarians take the time and trouble to go and see
for themselves.</p><p><a name="06052329000096">The
capability of the Iraqi police force in particular has recently
improved significantly. That is substantially down to those who have
trained them. A significant representation of police officers from
throughout the United Kingdom is involved in that, and I have no
hesitation in paying tribute to their work. I rely on those
people&#146;s assessment of the improvement in the Iraqi police
force, and not on my observations, in reporting any improvement to the
House.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1191</b><br>

Adam Holloway (Gravesham) (Con):</b> If he will
list the security tasks being undertaken by the UK armed forces in
support of the Afghan Government.

Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b> Our armed
forces undertake a range of tasks in support of the Government of
Afghanistan through the international security assistance force, the
coalition and bilateral arrangements. Those are aimed at helping to
create a secure and stable environment in which the rebuilding of the
country can
proceed.</p><p><a name="06052329000099"><b><a name="06052329001923">Mr.
Holloway:</b> Why are our armed forces still planning to
conduct joint police patrols when the police in Helmand province are
wildly corrupt and, as yet, unreformed? To what extent is the Secretary
of State encouraging President Karzai to use the detailed coalition
intelligence material that we possess to support the prosecution of
major drug traffickers with close political
connections?</p><p><a name="06052329000100"><b><a name="06052329001924">Des
Browne:</b> I say to the hon. Gentleman, who I know takes a
significant interest in those matters, through not only his membership
of the Defence Committee but his recent experiences of visiting
Afghanistan, that I appreciate his informed interest. I reassure him
that, in our communications with President Karzai, we encourage rooting
out corruption, wherever it may be in the structures of the Government
of Afghanistan. I have no personal experience of that, but the reports
that I receive from my Cabinet colleagues who have met President Karzai
are that he is a ready interlocutor on such matters.</p><p><a name="06052329000101">The first part of the question
was about patrolling with the Afghan police. Just as in Iraq, the
process of our engagement with the Afghan police means that we can
identify their training needs, improve their performance and help to
root out the sort of behaviour that the hon. Gentleman identifies as
unacceptable.</p><p><a name="06052329000102"><b><a name="06052329001925">Mr.
Brian Jenkins (Tamworth) (Lab):</b> Will my right hon. Friend
send a clear message today from the Government to the Taliban, who
watch and read European media, that NATO will not be a soft touch when
it takes over from the Americans? Will he also send a message to our
European colleagues to ensure that the rules of engagement that they
allow their troops to use remain robust and that any attack on NATO
forces will be met with strong resistance and
retaliation?</p><p><a name="06052329000103"><b><a name="06052329001926">Des
Browne:</b> I have every confidence in our NATO allies and
their ability to carry out the tasks that they have accepted in the
various parts of Afghanistan to which they have deployed. I have enough
concern about my responsibilities without directing those who are
responsible for delivering those tasks and in whom I have
confidence.</p><p><a name="06052329000104">However,
I agree with the first part of my hon. Friend&#146;s question. A
strong message is being conveyed, not only to the Taliban but to others
who are engaged in violence in southern Afghanistan where deployment 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1192</b><br>is taking place, that we will meet violence with a robust response when
necessary to protect not only our troops but Afghan troops who are
deployed in that area to deliver security to
it.</p><p><a name="06052329000105"><b><a name="06052329001927">Dr.
Vincent Cable (Twickenham) (LD):</b> The original
parliamentary statement said that the Afghan deployment was to be for
three years, at a cost of &#163;1 billion. Now that Ministers and
commanders are talking about being there for the long haul, what are
the Government&#146;s working assumptions about the length of time
and the cost
involved?</p><p><a name="06052329000106"><b><a name="06052329001928">Des
Browne:</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that, in the
Defence Select Committee&#146;s report on the supplementary
estimates, a request was made for a breakdown of the &#163;1 billion
cost so as to give Parliament some information on how the money was
being spent. In response to that request, the MOD produced such a
breakdown. The hon. Gentleman will know, as I do from my previous job,
that we make plans for public spending for three years at a time, at
the most. I believe that the role of our troops in Afghanistan lies at
the heart of his question, and there is significant clarity about that
role. I also accept, however, that we will not be able to deliver the
outcome that we hope to deliver within a time scale of three
years.</p><p><a name="06052329000107"><b><a name="06052329001929">Chris
Bryant (Rhondda) (Lab):</b> The geography of Afghanistan
dictates that helicopters will be absolutely essential to delivering
secure outcomes on the ground. However, there have been rumours that
the military have been asking for more helicopter support than has been
made available. Will the Secretary of State comment on those rumours?
Is he absolutely confident that the people on the ground in Afghanistan
have the helicopter support that they
need?</p><p><a name="06052329000108"><b><a name="06052329001930">Des
Browne:</b> I have no intention of commenting on rumours.
However, I can say to my hon. Friend that the deployment of our total
resource&#151;including troops on the ground, and attack and support
helicopters&#151;is based on the advice given to the MOD by people
with experience of such troop deployment. I am satisfied, because they
have told me specifically that they have the necessary resources to
carry out the task in hand.</p><p><a name="06052329000109"><b><a name="06052329001931">Dr.
Liam Fox (Woodspring) (Con):</b> The Secretary of State will
be aware of last night&#146;s attack on Panjwayi, a known Taliban
stronghold. He will also be aware of the changing security situation in
southern Afghanistan, where more than 200 rebels have reportedly been
killed in the past two weeks during the fiercest fighting since the
fall of the Taliban in 2001. The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
predecessor confirmed that our troops were engaged not in
counter-terrorism but in counter-insurgency where we may have to strike
first. Are the Taliban considered to be terrorists or insurgents, for
the purposes of our mission in
Afghanistan?</p><p><a name="06052329000110"><b><a name="06052329001932">Des
Browne:</b> I do not think that it assists the definition of
our task to categorise a group of people in one way or another. The
role of the international security assistance force in Afghanistan,
particularly in 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1193</b><br>regard to our deployment to the Helmand province, has often been stated.
Indeed, its role and tasks are described on ISAF&#146;s website. In
summary, we are there to support the provincial reconstruction team.
Our focus will be on assisting the Afghan Government to create the
security that provides the space for reconstruction. Clearly, the local
environment is complex, as the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question
suggests, with narcotics, criminality, the Taliban and tribal rivalries
all present. The House should be in no doubt, however, that our forces
have the capability and the freedom to do what is required to safeguard
the reconstruction effort in that challenging environment. The hon.
Gentleman is correct to say that there has been a recent increase in
violence, but that response was to be expected from those insurgents
and other elements in southern Afghanistan who wish to resist the
deployment of ISAF troops to the area.</p><p><a name="06052329000111"><b><a name="06052329001933">Dr.
Fox:</b> That answer will do nothing to dispel the fears that
the mission in Afghanistan is less than clear. In a recent written
answer, the Secretary of State&#146;s predecessor said that
the</p><a name="06052329001777"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Taliban have been
encouraging Afghan farmers to grow opium poppy and offering protection
to farmers against eradication of their poppy
crop.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 4 May 2006; Vol. 446, c.
1812W.]</p></ul><p><a name="06052329000112">There is clearly a risk
that the counter-narcotics measures taken in Afghanistan will push
farmers into the arms of the Taliban, and that that would undermine the
whole mission. Obviously, to avoid that, alternative incomes must be
made available, and the cost of that is likely to increase as the
destruction of poppy crops increases. Can the Secretary of State
therefore explain why the Secretary of State for International
Development has said of alternative livelihoods:</p><a name="06052329001778"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The forecast spend for
this year is in the region of &#163;45 million and we hope to
maintain similar levels of funding in future
years.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 27 February 2006; Vol.
443, c. 53W.]</p></ul><p><a name="06052329000113">What
implications does that statement have for the progress of
counter-narcotics operations?</p><p><a name="06052329000114"><b><a name="06052329001934">Des
Browne:</b> The answer is that those projects will be
conducted differently in different places. Some of the projects will
require significant investment at the outset to build the
infrastructure required to enable local capacity to deliver such
alternative livelihoods. I do not know the detail of the timeline of
that expenditure, but &#163;45 million will make a significant
contribution towards offering alternative livelihoods to those engaged
in the growing of poppies and other related activities. Of course, I
should add that we are not the only people who are making contributions
to fund alternative livelihoods in Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06052329000115">The suggestion at the heart of
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is perfectly correct: unless those
who are currently involved in poppy cultivation can be engaged in other
activities that will provide a livelihood for them and their families,
we will not be able to turn them away from that production. The focus
of our forces in Helmand province is therefore clear: to create a
security situation that will allow us to do just
that.</p><p><a name="06052329000116"><b><a name="06052329001935">Paul
Flynn (Newport, West) (Lab):</b> In spite of the courageous
professionalism of our troops, the poppy 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1194</b><br>crop in Afghanistan this year is likely to be at a record high. Are we
not on a mission impossible that has already led to increased violence,
will certainly drive farmers into the hands of the Taliban and could
lead us into a British Vietnam? Surely a practical alternative would be
to divert poppy crops into the manufacture of diamorphine, of which
there is a world shortage.</p><p><a name="06052329000117"><b><a name="06052329001936">Des
Browne:</b> That specific alternative was considered in detail
and rejected by those who have experience in such areas. However, the
development of democratic control of Afghanistan is at the heart of our
mission, because that will prevent Afghanistan from ever again becoming
a training ground for international terrorists. While we have had
success in the northern and western parts of Afghanistan, the southern
part poses a much greater challenge. At the heart of that challenge, of
course, is our ability to retain the consent of the people of the south
by providing them with practical examples of how proper governance,
security and alternative livelihoods can offer a stable and better
economic future. I believe that that is a noble cause, which deserves
the support of both sides of the House. For as long as I have the
responsibilities of Secretary of State for Defence, I will continue to
support those troops whom we have asked to perform that role and those
others whom we have asked to deliver reconstruction projects.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052329000047">Civilian

Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Mr. Adam Ingram):</b>
The defence industrial strategy clearly highlighted the importance of
research and technology as a vital enabler of our national defence
capability. As such, research and technology was embedded throughout
the strategy. The chapter on &#147;technology priorities to enable
defence capability&#148; draws together the critical underpinning and
cross-cutting technologies that need to be sustained in the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06052329000133"><b><a name="06052329001949">Mrs.
Dorries:</b> The defence industrial strategy clearly stated
that the technology advantage we enjoy today is the result of past
investment, and warns that we are now in danger of falling behind our
allies and even the emerging economies. Why, then, have the Government
halved spending on research and development since 1997, cutting it from
&#163;900 million to &#163;450 million?</p><p><a name="06052329000134"><b><a name="06052329001950">Mr.
Ingram:</b> The hon. Lady should go back to those who advised
her, and find out when the curve started to go down. There were
significant cuts in research and technology investment in the 1990s,
under a Conservative Government.</p><p><a name="06052329000135"><b><a name="06052329001951">Mr.

Ingram:</b> Yes, we have been in office for nine years, and we
have now established a defence industrial strategy. It must deal with
some difficult timelines in, for instance, ensuring that research and
technology are specific to defence needs and secure value for money and
the desired outputs. It must also take account of the role of the
innovative sector and of small and medium-sized enterprises, which
would argue that they have been neglected for too long. There are some
key, core capabilities in that sector, which are sometimes bypassed.
Those capabilities should be identified, and the barriers
lifted.</p><p><a name="06052329000137">The important
point is that out of the criticism is now coming something of
substance. Expenditure is being stabilised, and the plan is to raise it
in line with inflation in the coming years. Meanwhile, a review will be
undertaken&#151;it will report at the end of the year&#151;to see
whether more needs to be done. So, although we may collectively have
taken decisions that, overall, have not been to our benefit, we are
addressing that issue and the hon. Lady should thank this Government

to accept that under this Government, essential expenditure on R and D
has halved. In addition, he will know that the head of the European
Defence Agency has called for 20 per cent. of the EU nations&#146;
defence research spending to be spent collectively. How much of the
UK&#146;s already reduced research budget does the MOD intend to
spend in this way? Who will own the resulting intellectual property?
Will this move not endanger our relationship with the United States?
Will it not serve, moreover, to undermine a key principle of the
defence industrial strategy to which the Secretary of State put his
name&#151;that we need to maintain certain key capabilities in the
United Kingdom&#151;or is the real truth that this is just further
evidence that defence policy is now seen by the federalists as the best
vehicle for securing the united states of

has welcomed the defence industrial strategy. That is not to say that
it is completely fixed or that everyone is in total agreement, but
trade unions and industry have welcomed it, and the reason why is that
we have not previously had a clear exposition of the way forward. What
are our future horizons? What type of equipment are we likely to need,
and what are the industry&#146;s core capabilities to provide it?
What research do we need to undertake to underpin all this? We have
embarked on a close examination of these issues, and as I said to the
hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) in answer to her
original question, there are some very tight timelines to work to. We
have to get this right, but such carping from the sidelines does not
accord with the view of industry or the trade unions, and it certainly

the best armed forces in the world, one has to recruit the best

Territorial Army was 16,000 for 1999-2000 and last year it was only
8,000. We are working on the issue. Times are challenging, but we have
to find innovative ways to recruit and retain military personnel, and
we continue to do
so.</p>

the most significant difference between what we seek to do in

have a capacity to bring to bear on their own citizens, and with a

years, by how integrated the TA is with the regular forces. It is
impossible to tell them apart in terms of training, commitment,
professionalism, dedication to task and their willingness to defend the
interests of this country. The TA is a formidable body of men and women
no matter where it serves&#151;whether Basra, which my hon. Friend
mentioned, Kosovo, Bosnia, Afghanistan or elsewhere. Wherever we post

Telic and from Afghanistan was that individual specialists were
returning not to a unit, base or barracks but to their normal
job&#151;or sometimes not&#151;and isolation was causing them
problems. We have embarked on a complete examination of the provision
of that support. I mentioned my visit to the Desert Rats; they operate
a system known as &#147;home rat&#148; for families left at home,
not just in Germany but for TA families too. The proposals for our new
mental health care initiative offer another good example of how we are
addressing the issue. We have learned some valuable lessons about

questioned closely about the matter, but he neither confirmed nor
denied that the merger would take place within 24 months. Now we hear
that there may have been a drafting error in the written statement,

Cohen (Leyton and Wanstead) (Lab):</b> On a point of order,
Mrs. Heal. We have some very quirky practices in the House, one of
which has brought about the collapse of amendments to the Bill in
Committee. A number of hon. Members wanted to table amendments, but
because the House rose very early at about 1.30 pm on Thursday those
amendments were not tabled and could not be selected.</p><p><a name="06052329000174">I wanted to table amendments on
the Wednesday, but they needed to be tidied up and put in the right
place. I had constituency duties on the Thursday morning, and by 2
o&#146;clock, when I said that they were ready to be tabled, the
House was not sitting so they could not be tabled. They are therefore
not eligible to be considered, despite the fact that they are important
amendments. I am particularly aggrieved by that, although I do not
blame the Clerks&#151;it is because of the quirky nature of this
muddle. My amendments would have been tabled as starred amendments, so
they would not have been selected, but they would have at least
appeared on the amendment paper. I had five amendments, and I would
have very much appreciated them being recorded in the official record.
One of them, for example,
said:</p><a name="06052329001780"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Clause

remind him that the Bill was reported from the Select Committee at the
end of April. Although the business finished early last Thursday, I
would have thought that from the end of April&#151;I am not giving a

was not timetabled. It is an incredibly complex Bill, with 378 detailed
clauses and many aspects to it. I had to obtain a quite detailed
briefing from the Library on several of those aspects. In those
circumstances, it is reasonable to believe that even if such amendments
are not taken, because they are starred they should appear somewhere on
the official record. I want my amendments to be on the official record
in some way because the issues that I attempted to raise are important.
I ask you not to give me a negative answer, Mrs. Heal, but to find some
arrangement whereby my amendments are on the official record, even if
they cannot be taken. I wish to raise them as a point of order and
mention them so that they are on the official record. Will you give me
the opportunity to do that?</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1204</b><br><p><a name="06052329000177"><b><a name="06052329001986">The

earlier
timetabling.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001854">3.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06052329000192">There has been
a natural tendency for those with military experience to engage in past
debates on military subjects more thoroughly than others. At times,
those of us without military experience have felt that our views have
somehow not been valued as much as theirs. However, despite the fact
that some of us have taken a separate view from large sections of the
House in previous debates, especially on military action, we all come
to such debates with empathy and respect for those who serve in the
military.</p><p><a name="06052329000193">Let my put
on the record my family experience. My father served in the Army in the
second world war. One of my uncles served in the RAF and another served
in the Navy. On my mother&#146;s side, my grandfather served in the
first world war and my great-grandfather served in the first world war
and the Boer war. We thus come to the debate with a shared experience
over generations and a respect for those who serve in the military for
what they do and the essential role that they play in securing the
safety of this country. We also come to the debate following
discussions with serving personnel and those who are no longer serving.
Such people have had experiences in Northern Ireland, the Falklands,
the Balkans and, more recently,
Iraq.</p><p><a name="06052329000194">I tabled
amendments Nos. 8 and 9&#151;perhaps a bit more expeditiously than my
hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead, but with only hours to
spare&#151;because I wanted to encourage a debate about desertion.
When the Bill was introduced, it was presented as a non-contentious
tidying-up exercise that was largely to do with legalised drafting to
consolidate existing laws. However, it was also argued that the Bill
would give us the opportunity to update laws that applied to those
serving in the military and civilians associated with military
activity.</p><p><a name="06052329000195">Clause 8,
however, does not update existing law. It translates almost exactly the
existing threat of life imprisonment for those who refuse to
fight&#151;those who desert&#151;from past law into new law.
However, it also extends that threat to those who refuse to participate
in the occupation of subjugated countries and territories. Clause 40
again translates existing sanctions into new law by threatening those
who incite others to desert with life
imprisonment.</p><p><a name="06052329000196">The
threat of life imprisonment in such circumstances is little short of
barbaric. My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) has
tabled new clauses 1 and 2, which relate to what happened during the
first world war. At that time, we deprived people of their lives for
desertion by shooting them at dawn. Through the Bill, we are
maintaining the deprivation of life by threatening to imprison people 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1206</b><br>for the rest of their lives if they refuse to engage in military
activity or the occupation of a foreign country. I thought that we
would have moved on from the last century and that we would have the
opportunity to abolish that sanction by updating our
legislation.</p><p><a name="06052329000197">I also
thought that we would have learned more about why people desert from
our experiences of the two world wars and, more recently, of the
Balkans and Iraq. In many instances, people desert due to fear about
the threat to their lives and safety and because of trauma. Many such
people are in absolute panic. In particular, due to the debate about
the casualties of the first world war through the shot-at-dawn
campaign, I thought that we were developing a more sympathetic
understanding that we did not need to use such barbaric
sanctions.</p><p><a name="06052329000198">There are
others who refuse to fight based upon conscience. We have had that
debate in this Chamber on a number of occasions when deciding whether
to send our troops to war. We are able to exercise our right of
conscience. I remember the debate about Iraq and our heavy discussions
about the theory of just war and whether Iraq was a just war. I thought
that we had extended that right of conscience to military personnel.
</p><p><a name="06052329000199">I appreciate that
there is a system under which people can claim to be conscientious
objectors. From the evidence from the Peace Pledge Union and others
that was provided to the Select Committee that considered the Bill, it
is clear that that system is not regulated within statute. It is a
procedure, but it is not within this legislation, which was meant to
update and to consolidate the processes of law controlling issues
around desertion. I thought that, eventually, it would control the
processes for the exercise of conscience.</p><p><a name="06052329000200">While taking evidence, we
discovered that military personnel were not adequately informed not
only of their right to exercise their right of conscience, but of the
processes themselves. The position was outlined in the Select Committee
by the Peace Pledge Union. That brought forth a memorandum from the
Ministry of Defence, which at least explained the process, even though
it had not advertised it in any leaflets or in the practical advice
given to serving personnel. The rejection of the process of an armed
forces federation to assist those who wish to exercise their right
undermines their ability to access the procedures themselves. I hope
that later, in a debate on a new clause, we may accede to the request
to strengthen the right of representation for serving military
personnel.</p><p><a name="06052329000201">I do not
believe that this part of the Bill is a tidying-up exercise. I believe
that the Bill is really about the war in Iraq. We are aware that the
number of absconders has trebled since the invasion of Iraq. There has
been an increase in the number of soldiers questioning Government
policy about that invasion, an increase in the number of soldiers
questioning the morality and legality of the occupation and an increase
in the number of serving personnel speaking
out.</p><p><a name="06052329000202"><b><a name="06052329001998">Harry

for his support for my point of order earlier, which came over somewhat
awkwardly&#151;my point of order, that is, not his support for me,

clause applies to Iraq. My understanding is that we have not declared
anyone an enemy. I know that a war on terror has been announced, but
can he cast some light on who is an enemy in these circumstances? It is
said that there are insurgents and terrorists. We know that British
soldiers have died. Why cannot the Committee be told who actually is
the enemy? Why cannot it be legislated for in some
way?</p><p><a name="06052329000204"><b><a name="06052329001999">John

of an enemy has enticed the Government to include in clause 8(3) as a
relevant service</p><a name="06052329001784"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;military occupation of a foreign
country or
territory.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329000205">Without
definition of an enemy, service during an occupation of another country
is sufficient to qualify as desertion if one withdraws from that
service and refuses to participate in that action. I believe that
legislation of that sort will fail. No increase in the severity of
punishment will prevent servicemen and women from speaking
out.</p><p><a name="06052329000206">Many have paid
their respects&#151;as I have, too&#151;to serving personnel for
the bravery that they show and their professionalism in carrying out
their duties, but I also want to salute those who have had the courage
and bravery to exercise their moral judgment, and those who have
followed their conscience and said no to fighting. They have not
supported the occupation and they have refused to serve. I pay tribute
to Ben Griffin from the SAS, who said to us last week that he was not
willing to support, in his professional life, the invasion of Iraq and
the immoral and illegal war in Iraq. I also pay tribute to Flight
Lieutenant Malcolm Kendall-Smith, a person of conscience who is in a
military prison as a result of refusing to serve in Iraq. Their views
should be respected. They, and others who come forward in future,
should not be threatened with life imprisonment. History will be their
judge, as was the case with the first world war. The people who opposed
that barbarism were, in fact, sane and courageous. History will judge
individuals who stood up and refused to fight in Iraq, or to support
the occupation, to be heroes.</p><p><a name="06052329000207"><b><a name="06052329002000">The

that members of the armed forces should exercise their conscience at

it is under a UN mandate, and no matter that assistance is being

without leave. We are threatening someone who refuses to serve or who
goes missing, whether as a result of fear, trauma or conscience, with
life imprisonment. As I said, people who stand firm on the right of
conscience will be judged the real heroes, as they made a judgment
about Iraq and, I believe, provide an example to us all in the exercise
of conscience, no matter what the

maximum penalty. If we set a minimum penalty, he could make his case,
but the measure is required to cover all eventualities. The historical
background that he gave illustrates that point. No one has greater
admiration or affection for the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew
Mackinlay) than me, but the campaign that he has waged on first world
war executions overlooks many inconvenient facts. I was privileged to
be briefed on the issue by a retired Air Force officer, who spent a
year or two going through every one of the 260 folders that survive
from the 300 original folders. He examined the background, and he
established that there was a total of 3,000 cases: 90 per cent. of
executions were refused on appeal. Among the small number of
executions, there appear to be a few cases in which there was a genuine
injustice. I shall cite an example of a case for which most hon.
Members would accept that a sanction of some sort was appropriate. A

position.</p><p><a name="06052329000222">As I
understand it, the 1955 Act set out a two-tier system&#151;punishment
of up to two years for desertion and another sanction, life
imprisonment, for more serious cases, defined as desertion from active
service. The definition of active service referred to occupation of a
foreign country, so the reference in the Bill is nothing new. That Act
was superseded by the 1971 Bill, which removed the lower sanction
because of the situation in Northern Ireland, since the definition of
active service could not be applied to deployment in another part of
the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06052329000223">Under the
present system, the maximum sentence for desertion is up to life
imprisonment. The Bill in its present form is an improvement because it
reverts to the 1955 position, by introducing a two-tier system. There
will be the possibility of imprisonment up to two 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1210</b><br>years, but the other sanction&#151;rightly, in my opinion&#151;is up

hon. Friend&#146;s position on Iraq. It is not one that I share, but
I credit him with being consistent and forceful in his arguments for
it. As I said, the reference to occupation of a foreign country was
part of the original definition of active service. Therefore, I do not
see any great change there, but I understand why there may be concerns.

specific campaign such as the one in Iraq. I am grateful to my hon.
Friend, but he knows that we disagree on that. The important point is
that if people have agreed to serve in Her Majesty&#146;s armed
forces, there must be some sanction or control over their actions. My
hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington referred to those who
were shot at dawn during the first world war. I shall seek to catch
your eye later, Mrs. Heal, to speak on that matter, with which I have
great sympathies, but there is a great difference between a conscript,
who has no choice over going to war, and those who take the conscious
decision to join Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces. Without some kind
of sanction, how would one operate in any circumstances? We cannot have
armed forces who pick and choose when and where they

he has moved the amendments. I have some sympathy with where he is
coming from, but I find myself unable to support them. They do not have
quite the effect that the hon. Gentleman maintains, and it is just as
well that they do not. I sympathise with him in that I, like him,
opposed the Iraq war, and because in almost any circumstances that I
can imagine the penalty of life imprisonment would be way over the top.
Like him, I take the view that the arrangements for armed servicemen to
claim conscientious objection are not working in practice, whatever
they may say in theory, and like him I think that other shortcomings of
the Bill result in a failure to address some of the grievances and
points raised by people to whom both he and I will have
spoken.</p><p><a name="06052329000235">The hon.
Member for Hayes and Harlington is mistaken in two regards. First, as
other hon. Members have said, the existing legislation already includes
the potential penalty of life imprisonment for anyone who deserts while
on active service overseas. Although subsection (3)(c) does not add
anything to the body of law, the hon. Gentleman is mistaken in
suggesting that it somehow constitutes a toughening of the law, because
servicemen who desert while on active service overseas can already go
to a general court martial, where they face possible life imprisonment.
Secondly, given that clause 163 leaves in place the maximum potential
penalty, the amendment will not achieve the objective that the hon.
Gentleman explained at the
outset.</p><p><a name="06052329000236"><b><a name="06052329002018">John
McDonnell:</b> The Bill was presented as allowing the updating
of service law, which gives us the opportunity to rid ourselves of some
of the punitive punishments in existing law, one of which is life
imprisonment. I would welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s views on
clause 40, which also introduces life imprisonment for incitement based
on actions undertaken under clause
8.</p><p><a name="06052329000237"><b><a name="06052329002019">Nick
Harvey:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right on that particular
issue. It is just as well that the amendment will not have the intended
effects. If British servicemen were to carry out perfectly legal
actions overseas, such as actions agreed by United Nations resolution,
and were to conduct themselves entirely in accordance with
international humanitarian law, it would be a serious matter if someone
were to up sticks and leave, because, as the hon. Member for
Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1212</b><br>Flello) has said, it would endanger others in their units. That should
not be viewed as a small offence and I do not think that a maximum
two-year sentence would be adequate in such
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06052329000238"><b><a name="06052329002020">Mr.

Existing statute allows a sentence of up to life imprisonment. I
understand the point made by the hon. Member for Hayes and
Harlington&#151;that the Bill might have been an opportunity
completely to modernise the legislation&#151;but I do not accept the
argument that the Bill makes the situation worse. Although some have
pointed out that including subsection (3)(c), which concerns an
invasion of foreign territory, on the face of the Bill is profound, I
do not believe that it will change the existing law. Although I
sympathise with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Hayes
and Harlington, the amendments will not have the effect that he seeks,
and I think that it is as well that they do not, because it would not
be desirable to reduce that serious offence to an offence that carries

sentence for which, under clause 9, must not exceed two years. Indeed,
he could have referred to disobedience to lawful commands, for which,
under clause 12, the sentence is not to exceed 10 years. There is a bit
of cherry-picking going on whereby the military authorities, or perhaps
the Ministry of Defence, can pick and choose which sentence they want
to apply to those who use the illegality of the war in Iraq as their
defence. In the end, they could still use clause 8, which provides for

opposed the war. I spoke in almost all the debates about it and was
contacted by many members of Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces who had
serious concerns about the action that the Government proposed to take.
I respected those views, which they did not reach in the height of
battle. They volunteered for service under the Crown and, whatever we
think about the war, it took place, and the majority of those who had
serious concerns made them known before they were deployed in theatre.
They did not desert their posts at the height of battle. My advice to
people who approached me was that members of the armed forces who
opposed the war should make their opposition known before they were
deployed and went to the front, that they should certainly not desert
their mates while they were there and that, if they did, I believed
that serious consequences should
follow.</p><p><a name="06052329000256"><b><a name="06052329002034">Harry

circumstances, in which they have witnessed some of the atrocities,
which have certainly been against the law, and seen the
Attorney-General&#146;s statements to the Cabinet, which were
revealed bit by bit. It is not unreasonable for people, such as Flight

I should like to repeat the question that the hon. Member for

have two issues running at the same time here. I apologise to the
Minister. I will come back to the point that he has made in a moment.
One of my colleagues has just drawn to my attention paragraph 62 of the
explanatory notes to the Bill, which
states:</p><a name="06052329001792"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
maximum sentence for desertion is generally two years&#146;
imprisonment. But the maximum is life imprisonment if the offender
deserts when on service, or under orders to go on service, of the types
described in the second bullet above, or if his intention is to avoid
such service.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329000279">However, a
stricter distinction is needed in relation to those who, as the hon.
Member for Portsmouth, South said, put lives at risk in the heat of
battle. That issue must be distinguished from that of those who say
that the Iraq war is illegal under international law and who exercise
their conscience and personal responsibility in that regard. The fact
that we are having this argument shows the muddled way in which the
clauses have been defined and worded and the lack of proper
consideration of them; otherwise, we would not be having this dispute
about what the provision means. The Government should therefore accept
the amendment, so that the life sentence for the second category to
which I referred is withdrawn.</p><p><a name="06052329000280"><b><a name="06052329002049">Jeremy
Corbyn (Islington, North) (Lab):</b> I was interested in my
hon. Friend&#146;s point about legality. If, for example, someone had
deserted in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, when, clearly, there
was no UN

state of war, would it be correct to discipline that
person?</p><p><a name="06052329000281"><b><a name="06052329002050">Harry
Cohen:</b> In a sense, the point is made. In an earlier
intervention, I made the point that international law is as important
as law, and that should apply. This Government and Parliament have put
a lot of personal responsibility on people to comply with the law. If
they do not, the punishments are increased. Therefore, they must
examine the law and international law as it applies in military terms.
The punishment should therefore reflect that personal responsibility.
As has been said, a life sentence is inappropriate.</p><p><a name="06052329000282">As to who an enemy is, the
Minister&#146;s intervention, in which he said that the situation is
like it always has been, just will not do. In the second world war, we
had a clearly defined enemy, which was referred to as an enemy. Now,
even al-Qaeda is not referred to as an enemy in legislation or in what
has been laid out in Parliament. Things have therefore changed
considerably. If we are to apply such emphasis and impose such strict
sentences on the basis of having an enemy, let us at least declare a
war in the traditional way, so that we know who the enemy is, and so
that people are clear about that. Otherwise, the enemy can change from
day to day. In Iraq, is the enemy al-Qaeda, or is it nationalists? Who
exactly is the enemy in Iraq?</p><p><a name="06052329000283"><b><a name="06052329002051">Mr.
Watson:</b> If my hon. Friend does not want to read clause
367, which contains the tight definition of an enemy, let us make it
more simple; it is the people who are shooting at our

Cohen:</b> As my hon. Friend says from a sedentary position,
that could easily be the Americans in many cases. I am happy if the
Minister wants to include in legislation the definition that anybody
who shoots at our forces is the enemy. That is not in the legislation
at the moment. If we are going to go to war and put such burdens on
people, we should be explicit about whom the enemy is in any given
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06052329000286">Subsection (3)(b) refers
to</p><a name="06052329001793"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;operations outside
the British Islands for the protection of life or
property&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052329000287">Does that
cover Iraqi lives and property? Are they covered, or are they usefully
ignored? Are we talking only about United Kingdom lives and property,
or not? I am waiting for the Minister to intervene on that. After all,
the Government claim that we are there on a legal basis. They claim
that we are there according to the will of the United Nations,
protecting Iraqi lives and property, although the property has been
ripped off to an enormous degree and more than 100,000 lives have been
lost. It is interesting that the Minister remains silent on that. That
in itself could give people to ask, as a defence, what lives or
property they were actually defending.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1218</b><br><p><a name="06052329000288">The third paragraph, which was

one more point, about the Nuremberg trials. When people said as a
defence that they had been acting under orders, although their actions
had been deemed illegal under international law, we said that that was
not a defence. We said that they had to exercise personal
responsibility. Now people are exercising personal responsibility.
People like Flight-Lieutenant Malcolm Kendall-Smith have looked at all
the information that has dribbled out. He said that the war was illegal
as far as he could see, that Kofi Annan had said it was illegal and
that personal responsibility dictated that he should not take part in
it.</p><p><a name="06052329000295"><b><a name="06052329002058">Mr.

although the House voted for it. The occupation, however, is sanctioned
by the United Nations Security Council, and is at the invitation of the
democratically elected Government of the country, whatever we may think
about that. Whatever the events of a couple of years ago, surely the

illegal occupation. People should exercise, and have the right to
exercise, their personal responsibility. The punishments that we
include in Acts of Parliament should reflect their right to do so; they
should not be excessively harsh. The punishment of imprisonment of up
to life imprisonment is exceptionally harsh and should be removed from
the Bill. I urge the Liberals and everybody else to come off the fence
and oppose
it.</p><p><a name="06052329000301"><b><a name="06052329002064">Patrick
Mercer (Newark) (Con):</b> It is a great pleasure to follow
the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen); we are used to
hearing his lengthy speeches. I salute the modesty with which the hon.
Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) spoke and the due
deference that he paid to the members of his family who have served in
the armed forces. He approaches the amendment with a great deal of
principle and thought. However, I think that I speak as the only person
in here who has commanded a battalion, faced the prospect of
operations, disciplined soldiers, and encouraged them to go on
operations and, indeed, to face the enemy.</p><p><a name="06052329000302">I do not wish to come the
barrack-room lawyer, but there is a degree of confusion about the
points that we are addressing. Desertion is an extremely serious
charge, and if you do not mind, Mrs. Heal, I shall address most of my
comments to my personal experience in the Army, which are equally
applicable to the Navy, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines. As a
lieutenant-colonel commanding a battalion of infantry, it was my job to
deal with soldiers under the Army Act 1955. I had to deal with the
charge of desertion, under the auspices of the 1955 Act, once in my
two-and-a-half years commanding the largest battalion in the British
Army, and twice on operations. I had to deal with absence
daily.</p><p><a name="06052329000303">Some of the
soldiers serving in Tidworth, where I had 950 soldiers mainly
drawn&#151;lucky devils&#151;from the counties of Nottinghamshire
and Derbyshire, would frequently &#147;go abo&#148;, as the
vernacular has it. In other words, they would go absent. They would
exercise their personal freedom and choice, and, by golly, they paid
for it. They were charged, if necessary, under the 1955 Act, and they
were dealt with under various sections, but usually section 69. For
periods of absence, they were dealt with by means of anything from a
serious

days. Such a period of imprisonment was the only one that I could
regularly impose.</p><p><a name="06052329000304">From time to time, soldiers
would absent themselves&#151;go absent&#151;and go, usually, to the
large conurbations. I, as a furious commanding officer with a furious
adjutant, would say, &#147;Charge this man with desertion.&#148;
The advice that we received was, &#147;Absolutely not. Do you realise
what desertion means?&#148; Having had 20-odd years experience as an
infantry officer, I knew precisely what it meant. The guideline was
that a soldier had to have been absent for more than 112 days and to
have destroyed his identity card. That was the rule of thumb that we
used before that soldier would appear in front of me to be remanded for
trial by court martial. It was not a case in which a humble
lieutenant-colonel could have become involved. The charge of desertion
was extremely serious, and very serious penalties went with
it.</p><p><a name="06052329000305">I say to the hon.
Member for Hayes and Harlington that unless one has served in a
battalion, or on a warship or an air station, one does not understand
the problem that officers face in trying to deal with soldiers, airmen
or sailors daily. They are a rumbustious and difficult lot. They decide
from time to time that they are going to exercise their personal
freedom and drink too much, fight, go absent and so on. However, in my
experience, things change enormously when that battalion is warned for
operations.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001858">4.45

absent themselves before a battalion goes on operations. In my
experience, not many absent themselves for reasons of cowardice. Many
absent themselves&#151;I continue to use that phrase, rather than
&#147;desert&#148;&#151;because they cannot get their heads round
the difficulty of being abroad for six months, the potential dangers or
domestic problems. Only once on operations did I have a soldier who
absented himself in the face of the enemy, and he was not charged with
desertion.</p><p><a name="06052329000307">Flight-Lieutenant
Kendall-Smith was not charged with desertion: he was charged, I
believe, with being absent, or with a similar charge within those

officer and say, &#147;Enough is enough.&#148; I had similar
instances, and I like to think that I dealt with them with fairness,
kindness and compassion. I like to think that those are the watchwords
of the commanders of our armed forces and that they deal not just with
their own men, but with the Queen&#146;s enemies using the same rule
of thumb.</p><p><a name="06052329000311">Let us not
talk about desertion. Say a trained sustained-fire machine gunner, who
carries the maximum firepower of his platoon, decides to absent
himself&#151;if he decides that he will not face the enemy, but would
rather let down his mates&#151;and that turns into desertion. I fear
that we need to have the power to charge that man with desertion. The
sentence in clause 8 is not a minimum sentence, but a maximum sentence.
It has not been applied readily over the past several years. The plain
fact is that if that man&#151;it is, let us face it, likely to be a
man&#151;deserts from his unit, the punishment he faces from the men
whom he let down will be administered in the back streets of Nottingham
or Mansfield and military law probably needs to be in place to protect
him from those whom he has let down.
</p><p><a name="06052329000312">We need to have a
penalty for desertion. The Bill would make military law stronger, but
the amendments would do nothing to help the soldiers, sailors and
airmen, and the officers who have to discipline them. In fact, the
amendments would undermine discipline. I understand and respect the
political points that have been made by Labour Members, but they are
not applicable in this case. We run the risk of confusing an extremely
important
issue.</p><p><a name="06052329000313"><b><a name="06052329002067">Chris

concept of &#147;enemy&#148; is quite well-defined. Clause 367, on

disagree with amendment No. 8, which was proposed by my hon. Friend the

subsection (3) would have meant that during the occupation of Germany
and Italy at the end of the second world war somebody could have
deserted with

this ethically right or wrong?&#148; My experience of the armed
forces is limited&#151;it is nowhere near that of the hon. Member for

met countless soldiers of varying ranks with extremely well-developed

<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1223</b><br>I honestly do not think that it is, for the very important reason that
desertion is not just about the individual soldier or officer; it is
about the collective; it is about responsibility one to
another&#151;again, an essential part of the training of a soldier or
an officer&#151;and it is vital that we do not send out a message
that completely undermines that
concept.</p><p><a name="06052329000325">My experience
is that members of the armed forces today have an extremely developed
sense of conscience and that they are encouraged to develop that sense
of conscience, but it does not lead in just one direction. Conscience
can lead, and I believe in the vast majority of cases has led, people
to join the Army and to say, &#147;Yes, here&#146;s a series of
operations that I want to contribute to on behalf of my country, but
also for the greater good.&#148; Whether we are talking about Bosnia,
Afghanistan or Sierra Leone, there is a whole series of different
interventions where people are going not because of some economic
conscript situation that might apply in other parts of the
world&#151;they are not conscripts in any sense&#151;but because of
a sense of conscience and a desire to make their contributions to the
world. So it feels as though amendment No. 8 is rather old-fashioned;
either it is trying to fight the first world war again and deal with
how people were treated when they deserted then, or it is trying to
fight a war about a debate that was held in the Chamber some time
ago.</p><p><a name="06052329000326">The final reason
why I wholeheartedly oppose the amendment is quite simply that I
believe that it would undermine the House. It effectively says that, in
some circumstances, a soldier or an officer or a member of the other
armed forces could desert, despite the fact that this country, through
the House&#151;its elected representatives&#151;had decided that
the war was legitimate and legal, and I do not think that we should go
down that
route.</p><p><a name="06052329000327"><b><a name="06052329002072">Mr.
MacNeil:</b> The Bill benchmarks draconian penalties for going
absent without leave, which could occur in accordance with conscience
due to the orders that the soldier was given. We must remember that
orders vary according to the actions that Governments might want to
take as a result of their international alliances. The proposed penalty
is the maximum that has been benchmarked in our society. Indeed, if we
went back to the days of world war one, we would have the ultimate
penalty. Subsection 2(b) refers to someone
who</p><a name="06052329001799"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;intends to avoid any
particular service or kind of
service&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329000328">that is
the nub of it&#151;because he or she does not agree with the
Government of the day. If we go back perhaps to 1930s Germany, a
reasonable law could be passed by a reasonable Government; but, years
later, we might not have a reasonable Government, and we would still
have on the statute book a law that criminalises an awful lot of
people.</p><p><a name="06052329000329">It is argued
by some soldiers that they are entering into forms of bonded labour for
a period of years. They volunteer before action; surely, they have the
right to volunteer after action and not in any way to be subject to
life in prison. We have the concept of just war, and importantly, we
have the Nuremberg principles of the 1950s, which placed a
responsibility on each person engaged in a war to assess for themselves
exactly the orders that they receive.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1224</b><br><p><a name="06052329000330"><b><a name="06052329002073">Dr.

draconian for a new Bill for modern armed services. The Committee could
have had a reasonable discussion about that point. However,
unfortunately, amendment No. 9 does not say, &#147;Life imprisonment
is a bit draconian. Let&#146;s have a reasonable discussion about
what would be a more appropriate and modern sentence for
desertion&#148;&#151;which, as the hon. Member for Newark
eloquently and movingly explained, is a serious offence. The amendment
would reduce the sentence to two years, although that is the same
sentence that applies for going absent without leave, which is a
completely different offence that is treated with a different kind of
seriousness. The amendment thus effectively precludes us from having a
reasonable debate on whether the sentence of life imprisonment, even
though it is only a maximum sentence that is rarely applied, is,
perhaps, rather archaic and somewhat
draconian.</p><a name="06052329001770"><p>Amendment

up again the old debate about the Iraq war, although, as my hon. Friend

we stand on the issue.</p><p><a name="06052329000361">I congratulate the hon. Member

action by our armed forces, is legal when this place&#151;the
House&#151;accepts a proposition that we should send our armed forces
into harm&#146;s way to fight on our behalf. They then have a clear,
legitimate duty to uphold what they have signed up to do, which is to
fight on our behalf, following a request from a democratically elected
Government. Others, me included, may feel that the Government misled
the nation on the pretext for going to war. However, that does not
excuse members of the armed forces from obeying a direct order from
Parliament that puts them in harm&#146;s way.</p><a name="06052329001771"><p><b><a name="06052329002097">Jeremy

I believe to be an illegal war in Iraq. Surely the issue is the

not been sustained in the case of

to themselves and to the nation. The hon. Members for Rhondda (Chris

the Members who support the amendment know how many members of the

many have been sentenced to life imprisonment and how many have served
more than 10 years in prison for the act of desertion. Not a single

there is any evidence to support the claim that a huge phalanx of

receiving end when someone deserted their post, and if their action
took our lives or the lives of our comrades, would we honestly not
expect anything more than a slap on the wrist or a two-year sentence
for an individual who chose to disregard their responsibilities to the
unit, let alone their responsibilities to the country?</p>

<p><a name="06052329000367">The Bill gets it right.
Parliament should not allow any ambiguity in the way in which members
of the armed forces can interpret their responsibilities, as that would
be manifestly unfair to the men and women who daily put their lives on
the line. It would be unfair to suggest that they can pick and choose,
as they cannot do so. The hon. Member for Newark explained with a great
deal of eloquence how the unit would dispense its own version of fair
and just punishment if a colleague acted in such a way. I do not wish
to suggest for a minute that that is correct, as military justice
should be seen to be fair and should be administered
properly.</p><p><a name="06052329000368">Members of
the armed forces should not be left in any doubt about the consequences
of their actions. A sentence that may be for life is exactly that.
Every court in the land has discretion in the determination of most
sentences. I was concerned about the sentences meted out today to the
three men who killed the young black lad in Birmingham last year. The
judge recommended 25 years, but I am sure that if I was the parent of
that young boy, 25 years would not be anything like long enough. We
must judge these things on what we would expect if our sons and

He is 150 years out of date. We now have international law and his

confuse the Committee&#151;but it is he who is wholly confused about

there are currently, or have been in the past 10 years, British armed
forces engaged in an illegal action. No international court anywhere
has found any member of the British&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> The
international court of public opinion is a different matter from the
court of law about which the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead

they have the backing of the country for their actions, and that they
are engaged in lawful business.</p><p><a name="06052329000371">We have had soldiers in Sierra
Leone, Bosnia and several other parts of the Balkans, Afghanistan and

conscientious objectors. We would also know because we regularly meet
members of the armed forces.</p><p><a name="06052329000372">I met somebody who was

what the Government had asked him to do, but went and did his duty,

was not in a position to cherry-pick the missions that he served on. He
did his duty. He could, as he said to me, have opted to leave the armed

has run through the debate? The debate on amendment No. 9 in particular

whether there should be specific, defined parameters for the

about the existence of the offence.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1231</b><br><p><a name="06052329000377"><b><a name="06052329002106">Mr.

possible for such an occupation or war to be illegal if the Government
of the day have made the democratic decision that it is a legal and
justifiable war, but that is deeply wrong. International law and the
United Nations and its conventions define the distinction between the
circumstances in which a war is unavoidable and the circumstances in
which a country has the right to defend itself. But it is not true that
any Parliament in any country can make a war legal, and that includes
our own Parliament, just because it decides that it should be legal. In
the case of the Serbian Parliament&#146;s decisions in respect of the
war on Bosnia, we said consistently that we did not care that the
Serbian Parliament had decided that it was a legal war for its own
purposes; that was not the view of the international community. It is
deeply dangerous for any Parliament to go down a path that says that if
it decides that a war is legal, that makes it legal. That is not the
framework set by the international community on the legality of
international wars after the second world
war.</p><p><a name="06052329000380"><b><a name="06052329002108">Mr.

war.</p><p><a name="06052329000381"><b><a name="06052329002109">Alan
Simpson:</b> I accept that, but I am saying that the argument
about a war being legal just because we say it is legal is a dangerous
path for this Committee to be led down, and it is not relevant to
amendment No. 9. What is relevant is to question the legitimacy of the
Committee setting a parameter of life imprisonment to the penalties for
a refusal to obey an order in relation to desertion, when the guidance
notes say:</p><a name="06052329001804"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the

whether it should be appropriate in this day and age, in this Bill,

Committee should express a view about whether we are willing just to
nod through a presumption that the rationalisation of existing
sentencing powers should be the maximum limit of life imprisonment, and
it is important that the Committee should say no on
that.</p><p><a name="06052329000385"><b><a name="06052329002112">Mr.

that the amendment does not account for the other end of the spectrum;
it does not make the distinction between the much less serious offence
of going absent without leave and the much more serious offence of
desertion. In giving the same penalty for absence without leave and
desertion, the amendment completely fails as a piece of law to make a
very important distinction. Regardless of what happens at the top, what
about what happens at the
bottom?</p><p><a name="06052329000386"><b><a name="06052329002113">Alan

legitimacy and the legality of orders given to them. I do not for one
moment assume that in an army manned by volunteers any of the young men
and women who volunteer do so in a fly-by-night way, which is a deeply
disrespectful presumption. When people decide to give themselves an
extended weekend, the circumstances are different from when people
consciously decide that they are no longer prepared to serve in a
particular conflict or occupation. I accept that such people must face
the consequences of their actions within a disciplinary court process,

with the orders that they have been given, they can represent their
views to their commanders in a responsible way. Those who choose to let
down their comrades by simply going absent and then deserting need to

Simpson:</b> Let me come back to the hon. Gentleman with the
current information about penalties and figures. As regards his
comments about Labour Members not coming up with figures about the
sentencing of those tried and imprisoned for desertion, that is not for
lack of trying. Some of us have been trying for several weeks to get
that information out of the Ministry of the Defence or the Library, but
it has not been possible to obtain it. I understand from some of my
hon. Friends that members of the Defence Committee also tried to obtain
it but were unable to do so. That is not an act of negligence on the
part of those who are trying to make a different
case.</p><p><a name="06052329000394">One of the
things that was distinctly different in relation to the trial of Major
Florian Pfaff in Germany was that although he and other members of the
armed forces had to go through the court martial, at the end of that
process they had a right to appeal to a civil court. The civil court
overturned the court martial judgment on the major that resulted
initially in his demotion. The arguments that he used were entirely
about whether some of the orders that he was given were illegal orders
relating to the preparation of weapons systems for use in the war on
Iraq. Even the German civil courts were unable to question that, but
they were able to rule on whether the major clearly, legitimately and
conscientiously held those views. On that basis, they ruled in his
favour.</p><p><a name="06052329000395">Nothing of
that type is proposed for inclusion in this framework for our own armed
forces. When Flight Lieutenant Malcolm Kendall-Smith attempted to use
similar arguments about refusing to serve in Iraq, believing that the
orders were illegal, he was told that he was not allowed to have that
considered because the Attorney-General had ruled that it was legal. He
was not allowed to ask whether the Attorney-General had made that
ruling before he knew that there were no weapons of mass destruction,
that no uranium was coming into Iraq for enrichment, or that there was
no prospect of the UK being under threat and targeted within 45
minutes. None of that was challengeable.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1234</b><br><p><a name="06052329000396">We should be using this
opportunity to open out the legitimacy of rights to contest decisions

on refusal to serve in an occupation, which refer not to a legal
occupation but merely to an occupation. Members who say that that is
not specific to Iraq or to any particular existing conflict are right.
We need to be clear about our interpretation of this. Are we saying
that irrespective of whether a conflict is legal, a refusal to serve
should carry with it the prospect of a sentence of life
imprisonment?</p><p><a name="06052329000397"><b><a name="06052329002120">Mr.

10-year sentence. Desertion&#151;that is, abandoning one&#146;s
colleagues&#151;can carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Refusing to go to Iraq counts as disobeying orders, and the maximum

years.</p><p><a name="06052329000398"><b><a name="06052329002121">Alan

discussions on the Labour Benches about the interpretation of different
clauses. It is clear that even those who support the wording as it
stands recognise that there is considerable scope for confusion in
interpreting the provisions. The guidance notes do not necessarily
support what the Under-Secretary says. The Government have several
opportunities in the Bill&#146;s remaining stages to table amendments
to clarify the matter. However, it is important that we recognise the
rights of serving men and women in the conflicts in which we have
placed them. The point at which one crosses from legality to illegality
is far from clear.</p><p><a name="06052329000399">We
currently say that the occupation of Iraq is under a legal mandate of
the United Nations. However, what do we do when, following the recent
incidents in Basra&#151;the part of Iraq in which the United Kingdom
is operational&#151;Mohammad al-Waili, the Governor of Basra, said
that British security control prevented the provincial government from
purging the security forces of militia members? That was evidenced by
the fact that Iraqi security forces had to defend UK troops against
attacks by Iraqi civilians. It is understandable that serving personnel
in those circumstances start to question the point when we cross from a
legal mandate to an illegal occupation.</p><p><a name="06052329000400">Our proposal does not give
people a get-out-of-jail card. It does not mean that they can take
whatever action they like, depending on the state of the weather or

desertion applies only if someone leaves a conflict. However, many
thousands of people, including women and children, are killed in air

primarily not other soldiers. The second world war was probably the
turning point in that regard. In modern wars, there is much more
collateral damage&#151;that is the modern phrase; it really means
civilian casualties&#151;than killing of combatants. It is therefore
perfectly legitimate that our serving personnel should have a right and
a duty to exercise their judgment about the point at which the
threshold is crossed. That does not meant that they should walk away
from their decisions with no consequences, but we need to define
different parameters.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001862">5.45

punishment is a maximum of seven and a half years&#146; imprisonment.
In Poland, refusal to perform military service or to carry out a task
inherent in such service is punishable by a range of sentences, from
six months to five years&#146; 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1236</b><br>imprisonment, or up to three years in wartime. That is the tariff system
that is applied by other countries in the EU, and against which we
ought to be measuring the revision of our own armed forces
legislation.</p><p><a name="06052329000411"><b><a name="06052329002129">Mr.
Jones:</b> That is exactly what the Bill is doing. At the
moment, the maximum penalty for desertion is life imprisonment. Clause
8 will bring that down to a sentence of up to two years for general
desertion&#151;that is, desertion in peacetime or from a UK
base&#151;and up to life imprisonment for deserting when deployed on
operational duties. So we are changing the law, and it will be better
than the tariff that my hon. Friend has just cited for France, for
example.</p><p><a name="06052329000412"><b><a name="06052329002130">Alan
Simpson:</b> I would be happy for the Government to come back
with a proposal for an improvement on the French
system&#151;</p><p><a name="06052329000413"><b><a name="06052329002131">Mr.

Simpson:</b> Clause 8 does not represent an improvement on the
French system. It will mean that officers serving on the front line who
can see at first hand what is happening&#151;unlike us, who simply
have to read the reports that are presented to us here&#151;could
face substantial charges. It is incumbent on the House to say that such
charges are inappropriate to the world in which modern warfare is being
conducted, and to the expectations and rights of those young men and
women who have volunteered to put their lives on the line in the
service of this country.</p><p><a name="06052329000415">Let us take a step back from
the debate for a moment. Over the past couple of weeks, there has been
a huge fuss about the Home Office releasing people who have a track
record of murder or rape. People who have committed criminal offences
such as those can get early release from prison. To enshrine in the
Bill the prospect of life imprisonment for a refusal to kill seems to
make a nonsense of the ethical responsibilities that Britain should be
carrying in the modern
world.</p><p><a name="06052329000416"><b><a name="06052329002133">Mr.
Gerald Howarth (Aldershot) (Con):</b> We have debated this
matter for about an hour and a half, and I am bound to say that Eric
Forth would have approved of Parliament holding the Government to
account in this way. I therefore make no complaint about the time taken
to discuss these matters. Indeed, we have had an extremely good
debate.</p><p><a name="06052329000417">I should like
to pay particular tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Newark
(Patrick Mercer), who undoubtedly brings real experience to the House
and is prepared to share it with us. We should not take his advice
lightly. I should also like to pay tribute to the hon. Member for
Rhondda (Chris Bryant), who is unfortunately not in his place at the
moment. This was perhaps the only time that I have entirely agreed with
everything that he said. That will probably do him more damage than me,
but still&#151;</p><p><a name="06052329000418">I
also salute the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello) for
his interventions. Both he and the hon. Member for Rhondda demonstrated
the value of the armed forces parliamentary scheme, whose tie I happen
to be wearing today, in case the Minister had not noticed. Their
contributions, as well as those of 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1237</b><br>others who did not mention that they had taken part in the armed forces
parliamentary scheme, illustrate the great benefit that that scheme
brings not only to Members of the House but to the armed
forces.</p><p><a name="06052329000419">I also
welcome the Minister to his new position and congratulate him on his
post. He has had something of a baptism of fire in having to deal
straightaway with a 300-clause Bill, which has a huge amount of detail.
We wish him well, and I am trying to assist him. Clearly, the fire is
coming at him from his Benches rather than from the Liberal Democrat
Benches, and it is certainly not coming from the Conservative
Benches.</p><p><a name="06052329000420"><b><a name="06052329002134">Dr.

who piloted the Bill for four months? I am led to believe that he was
about to make that point, and I am sure that I shall endorse what he
was going to say in criticising the Prime Minister for sacking the
previous Minister.</p><p><a name="06052329000423"><b><a name="06052329002137">Mr.
Howarth:</b> I am extremely grateful to the hon. Member for
Colchester (Bob Russell), who represents another important garrison
town&#151;almost as important as Aldershot&#151;for mentioning that
point. Having welcomed the Minister, I was indeed going to pay tribute
to his predecessor, the hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), with whom
I have had an extremely interesting and constructive debate on the
Bill. I thank him for the efforts that he made to ensure that we were
as well briefed as we could be on the implications of the Bill, and I
salute him for that. As this is a moment of salutations, I also thank
the Bill team, whose presence we are not allowed to acknowledge in the
Chamber, but no doubt the message will get to them that they have also
been extremely helpful in relation to getting this legislation right,
which is of great concern to all Members of the House.</p><p><a name="06052329000424">On the amendment, I also pay
tribute to how well the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John
McDonnell) moved it, with great dignity and honour, save for the slight
disagreement drawn to our attention by the hon. Member for Portsmouth,
South (Mr. Hancock), on which I think that he is right. Nevertheless,
the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington made his case in a coherent
and restrained way.</p><p><a name="06052329000425">It is claimed that the
desertion clause has been rewritten to punish those who refuse to serve
in Iraq with life imprisonment. The amendment seeks to remove
&#147;occupation of a foreign country&#148; from the categories of
desertion, and removes the punishment of life imprisonment for the most
serious classifications of desertion. The desertion clause has not been
rewritten to cover those who refuse to take part in the occupation of
Iraq, as I am sure that the Minister will also tell the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1238</b><br>House. It does not increase the punishment for desertion to life
imprisonment; it reduces the maximum penalty for most desertion cases
by reintroducing a two-tier classification of desertion that takes us
back to the position under the 1955 Act, as the hon. Member for North
Durham (Mr. Jones) pointed out. That Act included two tiers of
desertion. Less serious forms of desertion, including desertion while
in the UK, were punishable with a sentence of up to two years&#146;
imprisonment; the more serious form, desertion while on active service,
carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Occupation of a
foreign country was included in that more serious form, and the hon.
Member for Rhondda pointed out the importance of having that provision
in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06052329000426">In 1971,
new armed forces legislation amended the desertion offence and ended
the two-tier punishment for desertion, counting all forms of desertion
together, with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The reason for
that change was the situation in Northern Ireland, which, as Northern
Ireland is in the United Kingdom, was not covered by the definition of
active service. However, desertion to avoid serving in the Province was
considered just as serious as desertion to avoid active service. Little
changed in the everyday application of the punishment for desertion,
and the punishment continued to reflect the seriousness of the
offence.</p><p><a name="06052329000427">Therefore,
the Bill merely reinstates the two-tier provisions of the earlier Act.
It includes a lower tier of less serious forms of desertion, with a
maximum sentence of up to two years, and includes the equivalent of
desertion while on active service, with a maximum punishment of life
imprisonment. The only difference between that and the earlier Act is
that the Government have removed the term &#147;active
service&#148;. They have included the provisions and definition of
active service from the 1955 Act in the Bill. The Government have
therefore reduced, not increased, the maximum sentence for the lower
forms of desertion. They have taken the armed forces back to the
position under the 1955 Act. They have not included foreign occupation
because of Iraq; it is nonsense for the awkward squad to make that
claim. Desertion while occupying a foreign country has had a punishment
of up to life imprisonment for the past 50 years.</p><p><a name="06052329000428">Mention has been made of two
high-profile recent cases. The first was that of Flight Lieutenant
Kendall-Smith. He was jailed for refusing a direct order. He was
punished not for his conscientious objection but for his failure to
obey an order. He was court-martialled for disobeying a direct order to
report for pre-deployment training. His claim that he was acting on
principle has no legal basis, and his sentence rightly reflects
that.</p><p><a name="06052329000429">However, Ben
Griffin, the SAS conscientious objector, did not refuse a direct order,
and nor did he desert. While he was on leave, he told his commanding
officer of his objections to the war and, through the existing
procedures, left the Army. That was a perfectly honourable course of
action for a volunteer soldier to take. He decided that, in all
conscience, he could not obey the order. The hon. Member for North
Durham is again right that this country is extremely fortunate that
those who make up our armed forces are not automatons but have a highly
attuned sense of 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1239</b><br>morality and are extremely sensible and decent people. Mr. Griffin took
a principled decision. He did not make the fuss that the chap in the
Royal Air Force made.</p><p><a name="06052329000430"><b><a name="06052329002138">Mr.
MacNeil:</b> On a small point, Ben Griffin&#146;s words and
reasons were:</p><a name="06052329001805"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I didn&#146;t join
the British Army to conduct American foreign
policy&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052329000431"><b><a name="06052329002139">Mr.
Howarth:</b> Whatever his reasons were, he took an appropriate
course of action that was open to him and ceased to be a soldier
without all the grandstanding that Flight Lieutenant Kendall-Smith
undertook. He proved that somebody who has a conscience and feels that
that military service, which he was commanded to undertake, was
incorrect, has a means to avoid that without all the histrionics and
without breaking the law. That is what Ben Griffin
did.</p>

<p><a name="06052329000432"><b><a name="06052329002140">Harry
Cohen:</b> Ben Griffin also told <i> The Sunday Telegraph
</i>that he had witnessed dozens of illegal acts by US fighters who
viewed Iraqis as &#147;sub-human&#148;. He said:</p><a name="06052329001806"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I saw a lot of things
in Baghdad that were illegal or just
wrong.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329000433">The hon.
Gentleman places great emphasis on desertion while on active service,
and saying that that warrants the highest sentence is almost like an
ultimatum. Ben Griffin talked about the Americans, but if someone
witnesses in their troop such illegal acts and civilians being
killed&#151;not enemies, but what we call collateral
damage&#151;what is the remedy, if they are not to take part in such
acts, other than to desert? Surely the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
distinction is a false one.</p><p><a name="06052329000434"><b><a name="06052329002141">Mr.
Howarth:</b> There is a whole system of military law that is
designed to ensure that those who break the law in the fashion that the
hon. Gentleman sets out are brought to account. Indeed, a number of
cases are currently before the authorities for that precise reason.
With that intervention, I am afraid that he blows his case straight out
of the water.</p><p><a name="06052329000435">Serving
in Iraq is neither immoral nor illegal. As the hon. Member for Hereford
(Mr. Keetch) said, that war and the subsequent deployment there are
illegal under neither United Kingdom nor international law. The
deployment in Iraq is supported by United Nations resolutions, and the
Attorney-General has reported that the United Kingdom&#146;s actions
in Iraq are not illegal.</p><p><a name="06052329000436">Let me remind the Committee of
an interesting moment, when the Chief of the Defence Staff&#151;then
Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, now Lord Boyce&#151;specifically asked on
behalf of every serviceman and servicewoman under his command, that is
everyone in uniform, whether the war was legal. He obtained that
assurance from the Government. He was right to obtain it on behalf of
all who served in Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces, and from that time
onwards every person in Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces was
protected.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001863">6
pm</h5><p><a name="06052329000437">Perhaps the
Minister will be able to confirm that it is unlikely that the maximum
sentence would ever be 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1240</b><br>imposed, and that the most serious punishments would relate to desertion
from one&#146;s post and putting the lives of one&#146;s comrades
in danger in the way described by my hon. Friend the Member for Newark
(Patrick Mercer). I am sure we all agree that it is absolutely right
and proper for us to ensure tonight that in such cases a suitable
punishment is available. It would be a dereliction of our duty to
protect our armed forces if we removed the possibility of life
imprisonment for desertion in the circumstances outlined by my hon.
Friend and alluded to by others. I therefore hope that the Committee
will reject the amendment and support the Bill as it
stands.</p><p><a name="06052329000438"><b><a name="06052329002142">Mr.
Watson:</b> I thank the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr.
Howarth) for his kind words. I must say that when I walked into the
Chamber and saw the massed ranks of the socialist Campaign group of
Labour Members ready to do battle, for a split second I felt like
deserting my own post; but my commanding officer sitting on my left, my
right hon. Friend the Minister of State, stiffened my resolve, as he
would then have had to respond to the debate.</p><p><a name="06052329000439">The debate has been very
informative. The speech that I will pick out is that of the hon. Member
for Newark, which was incredibly well-informed and orotund; the
argument moved on much further following his contribution. It has been
a debate about definitions, and I am anxious to clear up the
misunderstandings over the changes that we have made to the offence of
desertion.</p><p><a name="06052329000440">Clause 8
preserves the offence of desertion, but makes two important changes to
the existing offence. I shall describe them in a moment. Under the
clause, a serviceman deserts by absenting himself with the intention of
never returning to duty, or by absenting himself in order to avoid
relevant service. &#147;Relevant service&#148; is defined
as</p><a name="06052329001807"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;actions or
operations against an enemy...operations outside the British
Islands for the protection of life or property; or...military
occupations of a foreign country or
territory&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052329000441">The
definition essentially reflects the definition of active service in the
current service discipline Acts. Those are the most critical and
potentially hazardous duties for service personnel, so the offence is
all the more serious when the intention or effect of the
serviceman&#146;s actions is to avoid that relevant
service.</p><p><a name="06052329000442">Amendment No.
8 seeks to redefine &#147;relevant service&#148; to exclude
operations outside the British Islands for the protection of property
or military occupation of a foreign country or territory. Amendment No.
9 seeks to reduce the maximum sentence for desertion to two
years&#146; imprisonment in all cases&#151;equivalent to the
maximum sentence for absence without leave, as was pointed out by the
hon. Member for Newark.</p><p><a name="06052329000443">I listened to the arguments
advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John
McDonnell), and I think that they were put honestly and coherently,
but, frankly, I disagree with him. Under existing provisions, the
definition of desertion refers to going absent with the intention of
never returning to duty, going absent to avoid any service overseas, or
going absent to avoid service when before an enemy. All those attract a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1241</b><br><p><a name="06052329000444">That definition includes going
absent to avoid a posting to Germany, training in Canada or a
detachment to Cyprus, as well as the types of relevant service that I
have described, simply because it involves service overseas. Under the
existing law, if a soldier avoids a short posting to Germany with his
unit because he is having trouble with his girlfriend and wants to sort
things out, he is in theory guilty of desertion&#151;carrying a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment&#151;even if he intends to
return to duty.</p><p><a name="06052329000445">Our
first change is to restrict the offence to exclude that unfairness. It
will not cover any service overseas, only relevant service. Our second
change is to reduce the current maximum sentence of life imprisonment
to a maximum of two years, except when desertion is to avoid relevant
service. Under the current law, the maximum is life imprisonment in all
cases.</p><p><a name="06052329000446">Members will
appreciate that the operations involved in &#147;relevant
service&#148; are of the greatest importance. When such operations
are involved, every member of the forces must have complete confidence
in the other members of his unit, not least because the operations are
dangerous and demanding. Those who avoid such service increase the
danger to their colleagues, and damage morale. In a disciplined
fighting force, that is totally
unacceptable.</p><p><a name="06052329000447">Even in
the days of compulsory military service, the law reflected the
particular seriousness of avoiding such service. It is, if anything,
even more serious in a professional volunteer armed force for there to
be a distinction between types of dangerous service of the kind
proposed by my hon.
Friend.</p><p><a name="06052329000448">I hope that I
have explained to my hon. Friend what we are trying to do in clause 8.
I hope he will accept that the scope and definition of the offence is
new but far less severe than it was before, and that the true position
is the reverse of what he has
asserted.</p><p><a name="06052329000449"><b><a name="06052329002143">John
McDonnell:</b> I was expecting a brief debate, as clause 8 is
one of nearly 300 clauses, but I am pleased with the level of the
debate in which we have engaged. I want to focus on the constructive
elements that we can take from it. For the record, I also want to
establish clarity.</p><p><a name="06052329000450">My
hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) said that amendment
No. 8 was old-fashioned, relating to the first world war rather than to
modern military service. The Bill was intended to be a modernising
piece of legislation. What concerned me was that it translated the life
sentence threat from existing legislation on sanctions to the new
legislation.</p><p><a name="06052329000451">I accept
the pedantic&#151;no, the constructive&#151;point made by my hon.
Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) that the reintroduction
of the two-year limit gives us some flexibility. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon) said, it moves us towards
a graduated tariff approach. I agree with him that we could have had a
better debate about that. The debate on clause 8 did not feature in the
pre-legislative scrutiny Committee, and has not arisen in the House
until now.</p><p><a name="06052329000452">My first
objection to the clause is that it is not modernising legislation; it
simply translates the life 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1242</b><br>sentence from earlier legislation. As for my second objection, I respect
the views that have been expressed&#151;along with many others today,
I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) for
bringing to the Chamber his professional experiences on the
ground&#151;but we should look again at the process for dealing with
conscientious objection. The process that the hon. Gentleman described,
as he has seen it, is not the process described in the evidence
submitted to the Committee by the successor to the original
consultative body, the Peace Pledge Union, which is meant to advise the
Government on these matters. Its view is that the conscientious
objection process as it stands is not accessible, does not give
adequate information to individuals who wish to gain access to it, and
therefore undermines the process
overall.</p><p><a name="06052329000453">The third
issue, on which there is some agreement across the Committee, is the
issue of severity. I think there is a general view that life
imprisonment is currently the exception. I thought that we heard
earlier from the Liberal Democrats that they did not support the
inclusion in this clause of the sanction of life imprisonment. I should
be grateful for clarification.</p><p><a name="06052329000454"><b><a name="06052329002144">Nick
Harvey:</b> I said at the start of the debate that in almost
no circumstances could I envisage life imprisonment being a suitable
penalty. I agreed with the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr.
Simon), who said earlier that we should have debated a provision that
brought the life sentence punishment down to an intermediate level. Had
there been such a provision, I could have supported it, but as we have
heard, the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington
would shift us toward a two-year sentence.</p><p><a name="06052329000455"><b><a name="06052329002145">John
McDonnell:</b> Best to end when one is winning.</p><p><a name="06052329000456">The message for the Government
is that a significant body of Members in Committee, regardless of
party, believe that life imprisonment is a disproportionate sanction in
such cases. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I said that a significant body
agree; there will of course be others who disagree. I am not asking for
consensus&#151;yet.</p><p><a name="06052329000457">The discussion has centred on
the argument that this is a modern, volunteer and professional Army. My
hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) said that if it was
a conscript Army, that would be a different matter altogether and life
imprisonment most probably would not be appropriate. There is no
difference between us, and if we ever move toward a conscript Army, we
will need to debate the matter, because I agree that such a sentence
would not be appropriate. However, a modern, volunteer, professional
Army should not be motivated by fear of the sanction of life
imprisonment, either.</p><p><a name="06052329000458">This legislation fails to show
a modern understanding of why people desert. They desert because of
fear or trauma, or out of conscience, and we should accept that. We
should not penalise them with life imprisonment; we should accept that
it is a disproportionate sanction, not the appropriate one.</p><p><a name="06052329000459">It has been argued that we
cannot allow individual soldiers to exercise a right of veto over
action, but the reverse is the case.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1243</b><br><p><a name="06052329000460"><b><a name="06052329002146">Mr.

McDonnell:</b> Let me finish this point. In human rights
legislation, we require individual soldiers to exercise their own
judgment as a duty. Mention has been made of Nuremberg, but this was an
issue before then, and it goes well beyond Nuremberg. There is a duty
placed on each of us, as individuals in a democratic society&#151;but
in particular on soldiers and members of the military&#151;to
exercise judgment about whether what we do is right and lawful. I
reiterate the point that, whatever debates take place in this or any
other Parliament, they do not override that individual duty.</p><p><a name="06052329000462">Amendment No. 8 clarifies the
situation concerning military occupation. More importantly, amendment
No. 9 emphasises the fact that life imprisonment is a disproportionate
sentence that does not relate to the reality of a modern Army&#151;an
Army that is based upon volunteers and professionals, and which, as we
all agree, is in most instances motivated by moral courage. Such an
Army should not be motivated by, or threatened by, fear of such a
sanction. On that basis, I shall press amendment No. 9 to a Division.
However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p><p><a name="06052329000463"><i> Amendment, by leave,

Gerald Howarth:</b> I want to raise only a small technical
point that has arisen since our lengthy discussions in the Select
Committee. I want to express some of my concerns, and those of others
involved in flying activity, about the clause. The provision
states:</p><a name="06052329001808"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A
person subject to service law commits an offence if...he flies an
aircraft so as to annoy or be likely to annoy any
person.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329000941">We can all
conceive of a great many people who would consider any form of flying
as an annoyance, so the number of prosecutions could be extensive. In
the Select Committee, I was assured that no such prosecution would lie
unless the conditions set out in paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection
(1) applied, in particular that the person flew recklessly or
intentionally to
annoy.</p><p><a name="06052329000942">It is important
that the Royal Air Force has protection for its low-flying training,
which is critical so that our pilots can be trained to carry out the
operations that they have undertaken with such spectacular and
conspicuous gallantry and effectiveness. If they cannot fly low without
the risk of arraignment, the provisions are not right. I am assured by
people well-versed technically in such matters that RAF pilots are
safe.</p><p><a name="06052329000943"><b><a name="06052329002614">The
Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b> They are safe
from
prosecution.</p><p><a name="06052329000944"><b><a name="06052329002615">Mr.
Howarth:</b> We have it from the lips of the Secretary of
State so I hope that message will go out to all RAF
pilots&#151;</p><p><a name="06052329000945"><b><a name="06052329002616">Mr.
Jeremy Browne (Taunton) (LD):</b> And the Fleet Air
Arm.</p><p><a name="06052329000946"><b><a name="06052329002617">Patrick
Mercer:</b> And the Army Air
Corps.</p><p><a name="06052329000947"><b><a name="06052329002618">Mr.
Howarth:</b> Indeed. I can assure my hon. Friend that I am
about to speak at greater length about the Army Air
Corps.</p><p><a name="06052329000948">An ex-military
aviator&#151;a soldier of 35 years standing, who is now the airfield
manager at Middle Wallop, but has 5,000 hours as a helicopter pilot in
the Army Air Corps&#151;has drawn to my attention an anomaly in
paragraph (b), which deals with punishments. An officer guilty of
causing an annoyance by flying can be punished only by loss of
seniority or by a fine, but a non-commissioned officer may be sentenced
to two years&#146; imprisonment. As many Members know, the pilots of
the Army Air Corps are predominantly NCOs, as was the case in the RAF
during the second world war, although not nowadays. It has been
suggested that the penalty for a proven offence may discriminate
against NCOs in the Army Air Corps. Can the Minister comment on that? I
realise that that may be difficult as he is new to his
post.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1248</b><br><p><a name="06052329000949"><b><a name="06052329002619">Mr.
Watson:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his eagle-eyed
egalitarianism. Perhaps I could describe the clause, which preserves a
long-standing offence whose effect remains unchanged. It operates where
a service pilot flies an aircraft in such a way that he annoys, or is
likely to annoy, any person but he could reasonably have avoided doing
so. Intent, recklessness or negligence by the pilot in relation to the
annoyance caused must also be
proved.</p><p><a name="06052329000950">Unlike the
offence of low flying, the annoyance offence can be committed where the
pilot is flying the aircraft in accordance with regulations and in an
authorised flight plan. For example, the last RAF prosecution, which
was in 1996, involved a pilot who was authorised to fly low in a
particular area. He flew over his parents&#146; house several times,
allegedly, and understandably, causing annoyance to their neighbours.
The offence is considered to serve a valuable purpose in deterring such
conduct, which might bring the services into disrepute with the general
public.</p><p><a name="06052329000951">I recognise
the point that the hon. Gentleman makes. If it is an issue, perhaps we
can revisit it in another place if we have to do
so.</p><p><a name="06052329000952"><b><a name="06052329002620">Mr.
Howarth:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
sympathetic view. He said that in addition to the annoyance there has
to be an intentionally reckless or negligent aspect. It is important
that it is understood that those conditions must apply,
too.</p><p><a name="06052329000953">I am grateful to
the Minister for his willingness to look at the point relating to the
Army Air Corps. Perhaps it could be considered when the Bill goes to
another

Gerald Howarth:</b> The clause deals with the inaccurate
certification of equipment. We are concerned that the Government have
not looked adequately at the discrepancy in the application of the
offence between the Navy and the RAF on the one hand and the Army on
the other. The Bill makes it an offence to certify inaccurately naval
and air force equipment but not Army equipment.</p><p><a name="06052329000958">My hon. Friend the Member for
Salisbury (Robert Key), who raised that point in the Select Committee,
apologises for not being at the debate. He is not in the Chamber for
good and bad reasons; the good reason is that he has had the operation
that he has wanted for many months. I am sure that all Members will
wish him a speedy recovery and highly increased mobility. I suspect
that he may be watching our proceedings so we can convey those good
wishes instantly.</p><p><a name="06052329000959">In

37.]</p></ul><p><a name="06052329000960">He clearly wanted to hand
that task to the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, the hon. Member
for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson) as an opening coup, so that he
could deliver some satisfaction to the Opposition. I hope that the
Minister will consider that point.</p><p><a name="06052329000961">If we do not encompass Army
equipment as well, someone who fails accurately to certify an
air-to-ground missile could be put on a charge, but someone who fails
adequately to certify a ground-to-air missile would not have committed
an offence. It is a small point; but, none the less, as we are
reviewing all the legislation in this respect, we ought to take the
opportunity to try to sort it out if that is
necessary.</p><p><a name="06052329000962"><b><a name="06052329002622">Mr.
Watson:</b> Yes, I read the transcript of that debate, and it
is something of an ankle pass. Let me describe the clause. It will
preserve the offence that is contained in the service discipline Acts.
The offence is committed where a person who is subject to service law
makes or signs a relevant certificate without ensuring its accuracy. It
is not necessary that the certificate contains a mistake; it is
sufficient that a person makes or signs it without ensuring its
accuracy. The purpose of the offence is to promote a systematic and
thorough approach to safety checks. A relevant certificate is one that
relates to any matter that affects the seagoing or fighting efficiency
of any of Her Majesty&#146;s ships or one that relates to any of Her
Majesty&#146;s aircraft or any aircraft material.</p><p><a name="06052329000963">In relation to aircraft and
aircraft material, there is no equivalent to the seagoing or fighting
efficiency test that is applied to ships, because ships fulfil a wider
role than aircraft, such as providing domestic accommodation for naval
personnel. As a result, many checks connected with a ship are the
subject of certification but are not safety-related. It would not be
appropriate to catch such wider, non-vital checks under this offence,
which is intended to promote and ensure safety. Given the particular
role played by aircraft, all certificates produced in relation to them
and their material fulfil a safety
function.</p><p><a name="06052329000964">To turn to
the point about land-based vehicles that was made by the hon. Member
for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth), the clause will not extend to other
land-based types of equipment. Safety, promoted by a system of regular
checks, is clearly very important in relation to such equipment.
However, the implications of inaccurate certification in respect of
ships, aircraft and aircraft material are viewed by all three services
as being so crucial that a specific and separate offence continues to
be
merited.</p><p><a name="06052329000965"><b><a name="06052329002623">Mr.
Gerald Howarth:</b> There is a hint of complacency in that
answer, especially as I raised the issue of missile technology. Let us
take, for example, a Rapier battery or a multiple-launch rocket system.
Those are very complex bits of kit, and they can do just as much damage
as a missile launched from an aircraft. As an 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1250</b><br>aviator, I understand the importance of accurate certification of
aircraft and their components and, to a certain extent, naval vessels,
but there is a clear case that some of the equipment that the Army has
in its arsenal today is of equal sophistication and equal lethality,
and the result of the inadequate or negligent maintenance of that
equipment can be just as devastating as negligence in respect of naval
and RAF equipment. So I should like to ask the Minister to look at that
again. Given that we are reviewing the whole law that relates to
military discipline, I can see no case to leave out the Army. I am
afraid that I am not persuaded by what the Minister has said. I do not
intend to press the clause to a vote, but I am not really convinced at
the moment.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001865">6.45

Cohen:</b> Clause 54 relates to some of the other clauses that
we have dealt with, but it gives me the opportunity to ask about
children in the armed forces, by which I mean those under the age of 18
and how they will be dealt with under the Bill. We have just considered
offences that may be dealt with at summary hearing. Indeed, clause 50
deals with the jurisdiction of a court martial. Clause 54 deals with
charges that may be heard summarily only with permission or by a senior
officer, and some of those charges will apply to the category that I
have referred
to&#151;children.</p><p><a name="06052329000974">International
law&#151;in particular, article 1 of the convention on the rights of
the child, which entered into force in 1990,
states:</p><a name="06052329001810"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For
the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being
below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the
child, majority is attained
earlier.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329000975">We are one of
the 192 countries that have signed that treaty, which came into force
in May 2000, and we ratified the protocol on 24 June 2003. That
protocol sets 18 as the minimum age for direct participation in
hostilities, and my first question is whether that is the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1251</b><br>case with under-18s in our armed forces. Can they be involved
hostilities? [Hon. Members: &#147;No.&#148;]
I want to get a clear answer on that, because it has an important
impact not just on an earlier debate but on the way that under-18s are
treated. Presumably, if the hon. Members who shouted no are right,
under-18s will not be subject to clause 54, which is all about being
dealt with summarily by a senior officer. However, I should like to
hear an explanation of
that.</p><p><a name="06052329000976">Before under-18s
come into the armed forces, parental consent is supposed to be obtained
from parents or legal guardians. Consent must be given freely by the
youth and the parent or legal guardian, but are there any special
arrangements for orphans or those who have been in care, or are they
not accepted into the armed forces? I should like an answer in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06052329000977">My next
point&#151;I want to make four points in all, and this is my
third&#151;is whether there is complete equivalence between the way
that under-18s are dealt with under court martial arrangements and in
civilian criminal courts. I should like to get an explanation of that,
because it is important that there should be a degree of equivalence. I
note that there can be a period of detention and training followed by a
period of supervision and I welcome that. That should be under the
auspices of the armed forces. However, there is a quirky bit in the
law. The Library tells me that if an offender breaches his or her
supervision requirements upon release from custody, that can be dealt
with only by a civil court, not a service court. I wonder why that
quirky element exists. If the supervision is laid down by a court
martial, it should be undertaken by the same people. They seem the
obvious people to undertake that supervision. The Library also tells me
that there are arrangements for those under the age of 15 who are
persistent offenders. That is an interesting point. How do the armed
forces deal with persistent offenders? Will they be subject to clause
54 and will a senior officer become involved in those cases?</p><p><a name="06052329000978">My last point relates to the
most serious offences, such as murder. In a civilian context, a judge
would have a say, but we have a funny arrangement whereby the Secretary
of State also has a say on terms of imprisonment and how those people
are dealt with. That seems to apply to youths who commit offences of
that sort, even though they are in the armed forces. I seek
clarification on that.</p><p><a name="06052329000979"><b><a name="06052329002627">Mr.

to answer my hon. Friend&#146;s many specific points. The clause
provides that eight further criminal conduct offences can be dealt with
at a summary hearing, but only if the commanding officer has permission
from a higher authority or is an officer of at least two-star rank. The
eight offences are listed in part 2 of schedule 1 and include, for
example, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and possession in a
public place of an offensive weapon. Those offences cannot be dealt
with summarily at present by Army and RAF commanding officers. The
requirement to obtain higher authority permission before those charges
can be heard summarily means that an officer senior to the commanding
officer in the chain of command will always be involved in the decision
to hear those more serious charges summarily.</p><p><a name="06052329000986">To answer some of the points
that my hon. Friend raised, jurisdiction over civilian children will
not be affected by the clause, although those children who have their
parents&#146; permission to sign up at 16 and beyond will be. We
obviously try our utmost not to put in the front line those who are
under 18. I will have to write to him about the point that he made

making the point that, just because someone has not served in the armed
forces, that does not mean that they cannot understand them. I could
not agree more&#151;the last thing that I want to do is to try to set
myself up as someone who can lecture. All that I can 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1253</b><br>do is bring my rather dated knowledge to bear on our proceedings. I
salute the contribution of the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr.
Jones), who has spent a great deal of time on armed forces matters
without any previous service experience, although I disagree with him.
Briefly, clause 116 attacks important relationships at unit level
across the three forces. I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I
limit my remarks to the Army, because that is where my experience lies.
The rank of lieutenant colonel and its equivalent in the other forces
is crucial, as commanding officers have powers at their disposal that
are the acme, limit or horizon for the private soldiers, seamen and
airmen who serve under them. To attack that relationship is to diminish
those powers and take something terribly important away from the way
our armed forces are asked to do their
business.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001866">7.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06052329000996">It is worth
pausing for a moment to think about the circumstances that surround our
armed forces in Iraq. It would seem that it is unique&#151;a new
theatre of operations; that counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism,
peacekeeping&#151;call it what you will&#151;are something new to
our forces; and that this is not conventional war. However, precisely
these conditions pertained in the 1960s and early 1970s before the
armed forces got heavily involved in Northern Ireland. They were the
anvil on which the Army Act 1955 was founded and subsequently amended
to work at unit
level.</p><p><a name="06052329000997">We have heard
about the commanding officers welcoming the proposed changes to the
Army Act or to military law generally. That is as may be. I was never
faced with very serious crimes committed on active service, but I had
some extremely difficult crimes to deal with inside barracks, and I
would have loved to be able to say, &#147;Nothing to do with me,
youth. You&#146;ve got to go now into the military justice system and
I don&#146;t have to make a decision about you, Private
So-and-so.&#148; That would have been great; I would have loved it.
It would have been a cop-out for me as the commanding officer. But that
attacks precisely the relationship between the private soldier and the
commanding officer of his
unit.</p><p><a name="06052329000998">Let us bear in
mind what we are talking about. The bulk of kids fighting in Iraq
today&#151;they are kids&#151;are aged about 181/2 or 19. They
come, for the most part, from very difficult circumstances. I was
interested to hear earlier how the House regards these fine upstanding
individuals and their ability to make decisions. They are fine
upstanding individuals, but by golly, they come from difficult
backgrounds, for the most part. It was my experience that they needed
every bit of leadership, guidance and protection that their officers
and non-commissioned officers could provide for them.</p><p><a name="06052329000999">That is why the regimental
sergeant-major, standing outside what we called commanding
officer&#146;s orders&#151;in other words, a commanding officer
acting as a magistrate inside barracks or on operations&#151;would
say to a private soldier, &#147;Are you guilty?&#148;, to which the
private soldier would generally say, &#147;Of course I&#146;m
guilty. I daren&#146;t say I&#146;m not.&#148; Clearly, that is
nonsense. It was up to the commanding officer to say, 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1254</b><br>as a soldier came in front of him to get summary justice, &#147;Look,
son, you are now in front of a court of law. Just because you&#146;ve
gone through your platoon commander, your company commander and now
your commanding officer, that does not mean to say that you are
necessarily
guilty.&#148;</p><p><a name="06052329001000">The
private soldier depends on the commanding officer to be his advocate,
his leader, his protector. The private soldier who is sleeping for four
hours a day in two two-hour bursts, who one minute is being shot at by
well armed terrorists and the next is expected to dish out food aid or
whatever to injured and hungry civilians&#151;that man requires a
lieutenant-colonel or his equivalent also to have had four hours sleep
that day, also to be operating in conditions of 100 Fahrenheit,
and also to be required to carry a 60 or 70 lb set of
webbing.</p><p><a name="06052329001001"><b><a name="06052329002636">Mr.
Simon:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for sharing with the
House his experience, which is genuinely insightful. I ask this in a
spirit of inquiry, rather than as any kind of rhetorical point-scoring.
He spoke about a cop-out. Can he explain why the commanding officer
must dispense justice, rather than just guarantee
it?</p><p><a name="06052329001002"><b><a name="06052329002637">Patrick
Mercer:</b> That is an extremely good intervention and a fair
one. The commanding officer does not always need to dish out justice to
the soldier, but he needs to examine rigorously every case before him
involving any soldier, sailor or airman under his command. If he does
not do so, he is failing the often simple souls who require that
officer to give them that protection.</p><p><a name="06052329001003">That is what worries me so much
about the idea of a service policeman being brought into the equation
at such an early stage. I reiterate the point that I made to the hon.
Member for North Durham. It would be a foolish commanding officer who,
in the event of almost any other than a routine offence, did not
quickly get legal advice and call in the Royal Military Police special
investigations branch for their
guidance.</p><p><a name="06052329001004"><b><a name="06052329002638">Mr.
Hancock:</b> Hon. Members are right to recognise the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s experience and the usefulness of it. Is he
suggesting to the Committee that for the type of crimes outlined in
schedule 2, a commanding officer would be able to make a judgment,
after a police officer&#151;a service officer or a
civilian&#151;had had time to investigate the crime? How would the
commanding officer have the time and the means to carry out the sort of
investigation that would be needed for some of those
crimes?</p><p><a name="06052329001005"><b><a name="06052329002639">Patrick
Mercer:</b> Again, that is an excellent intervention. The
Trooper Williams case underlines
it.</p><p><a name="06052329001006">I take the point
that the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry) made
earlier. As far as Trooper Williams was concerned, the commanding
officer was his god. He was his figurehead of leadership, justice and
everything that happened inside the 2nd Regiment, Royal Tank Regiment.
If we attack that relationship, two things happen. First, the private
soldier&#151;lance corporal and so on&#151;feels that there is no
longer an umbrella of protection given to him by a man whom he knows 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1255</b><br>personally, who, within the constraints of rank, is a personal friend,
and who has probably served with his father, his uncle or other people
from the same area&#151;Portsmouth, Newark or
wherever.</p><p><a name="06052329001007"><b><a name="06052329002640">Mr.
Kevan Jones:</b> I am still trying to follow the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s logic. If, in his experience, to which I defer, and
in the experience of his colleagues, in a serious case, the commanding
officer would refer to the law and bring in the SIB, what is the
problem with what is being
proposed?</p><p><a name="06052329001008"><b><a name="06052329002641">Patrick
Mercer:</b> The problem is simple. The commanding officer must
have the power to say, &#147;No. There is no case to answer. I have
listened to what the legal authorities have to say, and in my judgment,
as commanding officer, this soldier should not be prosecuted. This
should go no further.&#148; On the other hand, he may be in a
position to say, &#147;Absolutely. This is beyond my powers to deal
with.&#148; Ultimately, he must have that sanction; otherwise the
measure cuts away at the fundamental relationship between officer and
soldier.</p><p><a name="06052329001009"><b><a name="06052329002642">Mr.
Jones:</b> The hon. Gentleman has just proved my point. Is he
suggesting that in a very serious case, the judge and jury, even after
a police investigation, should be the commanding officer? Is not the
problem&#151;I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was still a
member of the Defence Committee when we considered the Deepcut
deaths&#151;that excluding independent oversight at an early stage
led to problems later? If the angel commanding officers whom he
describes bring in investigators and legal authorities as a matter of
course, what is the
problem?</p><p><a name="06052329001010"><b><a name="06052329002643">Patrick
Mercer:</b> Of course commanding officers are no angels. Of
course their judgment is faulty. The problem will not arise in
peacetime circumstances in barracks such as Deepcut, Tidworth and so
on. In those circumstances, I agree that there is time for the Royal
Military Police and others to be used to the proper extent. On
operations, there is no time. On operations, one is driving hard
against an enemy. We are not talking about the overthrow of the Third
Reich. We are talking about peacekeeping operations where, one minute,
one is face to face with the enemy, at bayonet length from the enemy,
and the next minute one is trying to dress his wounds and give out food
to his wife. It is in those circumstances that the commanding officer
must have that sanction, where he can use his judgment. If he does not,
the fundamentals are
attacked.</p><p><a name="06052329001011">On my second
point, I ask for the Minister&#146;s earnest consideration. The Army
works on the principle of mission command. A commander takes an idea,
decides what he wants to do, apportions missions to his subordinates
and gives them the necessary resources. Unless the subordinate says
that he does not have the necessary resources, the mission is entirely
up to the subordinate commander. Part of that, particularly in these
circumstances, means that the subordinate commander, in this case a
lieutenant-colonel, must have the legal powers to deal with his
soldiers in the difficult circumstances posed by places such as Iraq.
If the commanding officer cannot deal quickly, effectively 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1256</b><br>and legally with the soldiers under his command, to all intents and
purposes a very important strand of tactical doctrine, namely mission
command, is taken away from
him.</p><p><a name="06052329001012"><b><a name="06052329002644">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I want to pick up on the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point that Trooper Williams looked to his commanding
officer as his god, but the fact remains that he was let down, because
he was then put into the civilian system. That is the point that this
measure seeks to address. For precisely the reason that the hon.
Gentleman gave about civilian judges and juries having no idea what it
is like in the heat of battle, that is the last thing that we want our
armed forces to have to do, as every soldier, sailor and airman to whom
I spoke said. We are not talking about getting leave from barracks; we
are talking very serious offences here. The hon. Gentleman referred to
snap decisions, but it is not healthy that snap decisions should be
made in such serious cases, which could end up in the civilian
courts.</p><p><a name="06052329001013"><b><a name="06052329002645">Patrick
Mercer:</b> I agree. This sounds like a snap decision, but it
is not. It will not be the sort of decision that the commanding officer
takes off the cuff. We are not saying that from his tank turret he
says, &#147;Yes, Trooper Williams, not guilty. Get out of it.&#148;
It does not happen like that and it will never happen like that. I do
just wonder though why current practices, particularly on operations,
have not been enshrined in the Bill. I believe that Opposition
amendments were tabled that would have enshrined what happens at the
moment&#151;that the commanding officer, as often as possible, would
refer to legal authority. Why cannot such practices be introduced to
the Bill, so that the important relationship between private soldier
and commanding officer is not attacked?</p><p><a name="06052329001014"><b><a name="06052329002646">Mr.
Simon:</b> Again in a spirit of genuine inquiry, can the hon.
Gentleman give a concrete example of a case where this will go wrong?
Can he give us an example of what that will look like? So far, it seems
nebulous and hard to get hold
of.</p><p><a name="06052329001015"><b><a name="06052329002647">Patrick
Mercer:</b> I cannot, but I will hypothesise. Serving at a
generally lower tempo of operations than what is going on inside Iraq,
one of the warrant officers, second class, under my command, not, I
hasten to add, from my cap badge, but from the Royal Military Police,
attempted to murder his interpreter in the Serb republic. As his
commanding officer, the case was referred to me. I immediately
understood that it was a schedule 2 case, which had to be dealt with. I
could not possibly say, in the circumstances, whether I should or
should not have dealt with it. I immediately passed that on to the
relevant legal authority. Had we been involved in a pursuit of the
enemy at that stage, had we been involved in circumstances such as
those in Iraq, I would have wanted the power to hand, so that I could
reassure the private soldiers, lance corporals, under my command, that
they would always be protected by someone whom they knew who understood
the
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06052329001016"><b><a name="06052329002648">Mr.

Mercer:</b> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman has not quite
understood me. What I am saying is that in a high tempo operation,
where things go wrong, and they will, the commanding officer must be
able to carry out an investigation, take the advice that is to hand and
deal with the matter as it faces him. If he does not, it will be very
difficult for the private soldier under his command to continue to
trust him.</p><p><a name="06052329001018"><b><a name="06052329002650">Mr.
Touhig:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made an important
contribution to the debate throughout the day from his experiences, but
drawing on his experience, if at the height of an engagement there was
an incident, perhaps such as the one he describes, would he not then
ensure the success of the operation, the protection of his soldiers,
and so on, and then get the matter investigated at a more peaceable
time when it could be thoroughly considered, rather than take a
decision in the way that he seems to be implying he would take one
now?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001867">7.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06052329001019"><b><a name="06052329002651">Patrick
Mercer:</b> It is a hard question to answer, but I am doing my
best to answer it as honestly as I can. I have never been in
circumstances where there is a pressing series of operations, one after
another, against a determined enemy, with pauses out of the line where
one needs to deal with this sort of discipline. But my father and my
grandfather did. They faced such operations. Neither was a commanding
officer, but they were infantry majors, and they felt the need to be
able to use summary powers to deal with similar serious offences. That
was a long time ago. I can imagine circumstances where the commanding
officer at a high tempo of operations will need those powers. If I may
put the point to bed, those powers are important, they will rarely be
used, but when they are used, as in the case of the commanding officer
of 2RTR, they should not be
challenged.</p><p><a name="06052329001020">My final
point is that the relationship between a regimental commander, of
whatever cap badge, and the police, is always difficult. It is
difficult for people who have not served to understand the feeling of
the regimental family. The regimental family is the building brick upon
which the army is built. No matter what assaults are being made on that
system at the moment, the fact remains that the battalion, 600 to 900
men, know and understand each other. Up until the new reforms that have
been introduced recently, battalions could guarantee that they all came
from the same territorial area. To introduce the Royal Military Police,
or their equivalent, into the chain of command at this stage, is to cut
away at the authority and trust that subordinate commanders have in
their commanding officers. It will be a detrimental move if the Royal
Military Police, or their equivalent, the service police, are used in
preference to the commanding officer, who, as has been said, will
always refer to the legal authorities. That injures the regimental
relationship&#151;
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1258</b><br>the same relationship as on a warship or an airfield&#151;and I ask
the Government to think carefully about the matter and to take it no
further.</p><p><a name="06052329001021"><b><a name="06052329002652">Mr.
Benyon:</b> As is the way of things, my points have been
eloquently made by my hon. Friends the Members for Canterbury (Mr.
Brazier) and for Newark (Patrick Mercer), so I shall be brief and make
just one or two further points. I am very concerned about the
implications of the clause and the effect that it will have on the
relationship between a commanding officer and those who serve
them.</p><p><a name="06052329001022">The hon. Member
for North Durham (Mr. Jones) made a good point about gangs of lawyers
following our forces wherever they go as part of operations as being a
perception that is not borne out in reality. I shall not stand here and
pretend that there is an office of Matrix Chambers opening up in Basra
and that our troops will constantly be harassed under human rights
legislation. Nevertheless, we have to accept that we live in a much
more litigious society, and our troops going on operations are daily
faced with a greater threat of litigation. We know that untoward
advances have been made to people in an area such as Basra and we have
to be extremely careful about how we protect our forces in that
context.</p><p><a name="06052329001023">Clause 116 is
important in the context of alleged crimes committed by soldiers.
Commanding officers understand more than anyone else the context in
which an alleged offence may have occurred. I will not go through the
details of the Trooper Williams case, because it was discussed at great
length in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06052329001024"><b><a name="06052329002653">Mr.
Kevan Jones:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that society
has become much more litigious, which is sad, but clause 116 will
protect both the commanding officer and the accused. If the special
investigations branch is involved from an early stage, evidence will be
gathered and the facts will be established. That means that the
commanding officer cannot dismiss a serious charge, which could lead to
accusations of a cover-up or make it difficult to gather evidence to
establish what
happened.</p>

taken out of my hands.&#148; A good commanding officer will feel that
his position and his relationship with the people who serve under him

of my hon. Friend, and my experience of the armed forces is even more
dated than his. As a platoon commander in a rifle regiment on
operations in Northern Ireland, I represented the views of one of my
soldiers to my company commander when that soldier committed a military
offence, and I stood in at the hearing at which the charge was put and
a punishment was meted out. As a company second in command, I
represented my company commander at hearings with the commanding
officer when people under my command had committed more serious
offences. Clause 116 would impose a glass ceiling, which would mean no
responsibility for commanding officers if a crime is serious
enough.</p><p><a name="06052329001030"><b><a name="06052329002659">Mr.

all times. If some dodgy squaddie who has murdered an old lady turns up
in the commanding officer&#146;s office and says, &#147;I&#146;m
sorry governor, I have just murdered an old lady&#148;, the
commanding officer would not say, &#147;Don&#146;t worry Hughes, I

the concerns of Conservative Members by pointing out that there would
be a positive and important link between the role of the commanding

Private Clegg, who shot a woman at a roadblock and was convicted

judgment was overturned only after two appeals, but if the case had
been considered in a military context from the beginning, it might well
never have gone to

convicted of a murder that he did not commit. He went to prison as a
criminal and served a sentence with some of the most hardened criminals
in this country. That case has haunted me, and it will continue to
haunt me so long as clauses such as this continue to come before this

116 is all about the actions that occur after the service police or
civilian police have carried out an investigation, and the list in
schedule 2 covers everything from treason to murder to child abuse to
child pornography. Are hon. Members really arguing that the commanding
officer should be able to carry out such investigations? I would urge
those Members who have not done so to read the report by the Surrey

genuine complaints by members of our armed forces about abuse that they
suffered, including serious sexual assaults, which were never
investigated by the service police or by the civilian police. The
Surrey police were extraordinarily critical of the chain of command
that allowed such serious allegations to go
unchallenged.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001868">8
pm</h5><p><a name="06052329001041">I understand
that when this was discussed in Committee, colleagues supported the
view that the commanding officer should be informed about
investigations into schedule 2 offences. I think that he has every
right to be informed, but not for him then to be able to make a
judgment on whether the case should be pursued. One would imagine that
if a police officer, whether service or civilian, was investigating
something as serious as a crime outlined in schedule 2, they would have
sufficient evidence to be able to take the case further. There is
clearly an obligation placed on the investigating officer that they
must have substantial evidence to take the matter
further.</p><p><a name="06052329001042"><b><a name="06052329002666">Mr.
Brazier:</b> The hon. Gentleman and I served together for a
long time on the Defence Committee, and I know of his close interest in
and family connections with service matters. He mentioned areas such as
child pornography which are a long way away from the
serviceman&#146;s job. Does he accept that in crimes such as a
shooting under very difficult and uncertain circumstances, the
commanding officer has an insight into that which an investigatory
team, who have perhaps come out of an air-conditioned office, will not
necessarily
have?</p><p><a name="06052329001043"><b><a name="06052329002667">Mr.
Hancock:</b> I cannot imagine any set of circumstances in
which a soldier, or any other service personnel member, was accused of
discharging a weapon in such a way that somebody was killed or injured
that would not involve the commanding officer, who could not be left
out of the loop in the initial investigations that would have to take
place. The problem in Iraq is that there are insufficient military
policemen to be able to help our service personnel to perform some of
their duties. People who have been there recently, including some of
our colleagues in this House, will tell us that.</p><p><a name="06052329001044">The hon. Member for Newark
(Patrick Mercer) was good enough to recognise that until 1970, the
situation was governed by a different style of soldiering and chain of
command. Ireland changed that because of the type of confrontation that
was faced daily by our armed forces over those 30-odd years. There were
always going to be very difficult circumstances when weapons were
fired, people were killed and soldiers were prosecuted through the
civilian courts or action was taken through the military courts.
Ireland was never going to be an easy situation.</p><p><a name="06052329001045">The Bill provides a much
clearer definition of the way in which these matters will be resolved.
I believe that clause 116 is helpful. There was a situation in my
constituency that involved naval personnel and civilian personnel
working for the Navy who were all, to one 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1262</b><br>degree or another, charged with offences relating to child pornography.
The civilian was punished quite severely, while the service personnel
were dealt with through the chain of command and virtually got away
with a warning, in respect of almost identical crimes. That case has
gone to the desk of the Minister, because, rightly, the civilian
involved felt that he had been treated differently.</p><p><a name="06052329001046">I am not wedded to the idea
that the chain of command is always right. It does not end with the
Chief of the Defence Staff. There is a chain of command above
that&#151;the political bosses at the MOD, under whichever party, who
set the parameters. The Bill is not driven by the views of the Chief of
the Defence Staff, but by the need to reform armed forces legislation
to bring it into the 21st century and to deal with the way in which
service personnel should expect to be dealt with. The chain of command
is by no means perfect, as the hon. Member for Newark was generous
enough to admit. It cannot be right for us to say that we are wedded to
it under any circumstances. If any individual in our armed forces has a
serious allegation under schedule 2 being pursued against them, there
is a duty and a responsibility for that to go further, and for it not
to remain in-house and within the command structure. Anything short of
that would enhance the public&#146;s perception of the armed forces
being treated differently, and that cannot and should not be the case.
This is about is having a level playing field so that everyone clearly
understands that if they are investigated for a schedule 2 offence, it
will not stay in-house but will go straight to the civilian authorities
or to the Crown Prosecution Service.</p><p><a name="06052329001047"><b><a name="06052329002668">Mr.
Kevan Jones:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is not
just about a level playing field but about, first, giving the accused
protection in terms of knowing that the alleged crime is being
investigated properly and that the evidence has been gathered; and
secondly, that if the prosecution goes ahead it is based on the
evidence that has been collected near to where the crime was committed,
whereas, if the case had been dismissed and reinvestigated later on,
things might have been
lost?</p><p><a name="06052329001048"><b><a name="06052329002669">Mr.
Hancock:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. I am sure that his
remarks are borne out by the hours of evidence that he took in the
Armed Forces Bill Committee and in the Defence Committee. We have had
that explained to us time and again. The Minister of State, who is in
his place, has a lot of credit coming his way for genuinely
believing&#151;I am sure that his new boss and the former Secretary
of State share the same view&#151;that the duty of care is to our
serving personnel and to their families, as well as to the victims of
crimes that are perpetrated by members of the armed forces. It is not
an exclusive club whereby the military only look after their
own&#151;their duty of care goes way beyond that. That is what this
clause of this much-needed Bill gets to the heart of, and the House
should not be prevailed upon to go along with voting against its
standing

military are able to be their own judge and jury.</p><p><a name="06052329001051">The Surrey police report was a
lesson that we can allow things to go unchallenged only for so long. It
was a rather cosy coincidence that it was put forward so strongly that
that all the issues were dealt with properly under the chain of
command. It was obvious to the Surrey police that many of the men and
women who gave evidence to them felt that they had been manifestly let
down by the god of the commanding officer or the ability of the
commanding officer to see through a fictitious allegation. Sadly, many
of our armed forces men and women felt badly let down in that
situation. The Bill will give them greater hope that there will be
equality under the law and in the law as regards our armed
forces.</p><p><a name="06052329001052"><b><a name="06052329002672">Mr.

contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer),
illuminated our discussions. They both showed that the perspective from
which we must view the Bill is not that of what happens in a brawl on a
Saturday night in Aldershot or Colchester, but what happens on the
front line on operations.</p><p><a name="06052329001053">Our armed forces have never
been so involved in operations as in recent years. We have all
seen&#151;because television is there today&#151;the circumstances
in which they fight. We therefore have a duty to examine the provision
from the point of view of its impact on our armed forces on the front
line. It is inevitable that we are more concerned with the Army than
the other two services because of the way in which the Army fights. The
Royal Air Force pilot who fires a missile will not see the enemy. Those
on a naval vessel who use bombardment may not see the enemy, but the
soldier does. Indeed, the soldier is often required to engage in
hand-to-hand combat.</p><p><a name="06052329001054">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend
the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), not only for his kind support
to me but for the way in which he opened the debate a couple of hours

associated provisions&#151;we are holding only one stand part debate,
but several related clauses go to the heart of the
measure&#151;represent the most significant change that the Bill
makes to existing practice. The chain of command is at the heart of
that key debate.</p><p><a name="06052329001055">The
expertise of senior officers on the ground who have first-hand
understanding of the conditions that their troops face has long been
essential in deciding whether split-second decisions made by soldiers

Until now, we trusted those in a position of command to decide whether
those under their command should face prosecution for their actions
while carrying out their duty in good faith. As I have said previously,
the Bill removes that trust.</p><p><a name="06052329001056">Under current arrangements,
commanding officers examine an incident and are informed by their
knowledge of the military context&#151;the operational
circumstances&#151;in deciding whether there is a case to answer.
Under the Bill, if an incident occurs or an accusation of a serious
offence is made, the case will be passed by a service policeman
directly to the service prosecuting authority for a perhaps lengthy
investigation.</p><p><a name="06052329001057">In the
Select Committee, I asked the hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig)
whether he could guarantee that the arrangements would not lead to more
investigations that resulted in legal proceedings. He could not give me
the cast-iron guarantee that I sought. Let me therefore pose the
question again and perhaps the Under-Secretary can assist. Will the
service prosecuting authority resemble its civilian counterpart in that
it will base its decisions to prosecute on the likelihood of securing a
conviction rather than on a proper understanding of the circumstances
that led to the alleged event?</p><p><a name="06052329001058">Lord Boyce has been much quoted
this evening. I shall quote him accurately, for the benefit of the hon.

encirclement&#148; among members of our armed forces. He said that
the removal of the power of a commanding officer based on the facts and
the situation on the ground to dismiss a charge against a serviceman
risks adding to that feeling. Let me put Lord Boyce&#146;s remarks in
context. He also
said:</p><a name="06052329001815"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is

you diminish his authority or start to erode his authority, you will
have a fracture which is ultimately going to cause
failure.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001062">That is the
issue before us tonight. We must ensure that we do nothing that
fractures that authority.</p><p><a name="06052329001063">After visiting those on
deployment, the Select Committee concluded that there had not been much
opposition in the Army to the Bill&#146;s proposed changes. Although
I accept that, we must realise that proposals in the Bill have hardly
sunk in at all in the military. I do not especially blame the
Government. The guys are out there trying to fight a war and they have
no time to start assessing the niceties of the legal position. 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1265</b><br>Although the people to whom we spoke had been briefed, I suspect that
some had been briefed only a little in advance of our visit. Some of
the changes will take time to make an
impact.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001869">8.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06052329001064">As has been
said, the change that the Government propose results partly from the
Trooper Williams case, in which the commanding officer, on legal
military advice, dismissed a charge of murder against Trooper Williams,
who was said to have shot an innocent Iraqi. More senior military
lawyers believed that the advice was wrong, but could not reopen the
case and the Army high command felt under political pressure, in the
grotesque phrase that Sir Alistair Irwin used, to &#147;offer for
prosecution&#148; Trooper Williams. That could be done only through
the civil courts.</p><p><a name="06052329001065">Sir
Alistair Irwin said that with the</p><a name="06052329001817"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;current legal, political and
ginger group interest in the deaths of Iraqi civilians during Operation
Telic, there is a significant possibility that this case, our
investigation and the subsequent failure to offer for prosecution could
become a cause c&#233;lbre for pressure
groups.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001066">I have said it
before, and I repeat that I find it reprehensible that a senior officer
used the expression &#147;offer for prosecution&#148; about one of
the men under his command. I do not believe that Pontius Pilate would
have used that expression.</p><p><a name="06052329001067">At the instigation of the
Attorney-General, Williams was charged but the case was dismissed by
the civilian judge. The Government argue that the removal of the power
to dismiss a serious charge will prevent a repetition of the Williams
case. However, the commanding officer&#146;s judgment was vindicated.
The case says more about the high command and the political pressures
that led to Trooper Williams being offered for prosecution than about
the power of the commanding officer to dismiss a charge. I agree with
the Government that we must avoid such a case in the future. I am at
one with the hon. Member for Islwyn, the former Under-Secretary, that
we must find a way to keep such matters in the military domain and not
leave them up to civilian courts.</p><p><a name="06052329001068"><b><a name="06052329002675">Mr.
Jones:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, if the system
for which the Bill provides was in place at the time of the Trooper
Williams case, the police evidence would have been collected early and
led to an informed judgment earlier that perhaps would not have meant
the unacceptably lengthy process that he describes? If that had been
done, Trooper Williams would not have gone through what he
did.</p><p><a name="06052329001069"><b><a name="06052329002676">Mr.
Howarth:</b> I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. The facts
prove him wrong. The commanding officer&#146;s original judgment was
right. He did the right thing. He took legal advice and investigated,
but some lawyer in uniform higher up thought that the advice given by
the legal officer on the ground was wrong. We then had the
farce&#151;well, it was not a farce for Trooper Williams; it was a
serious personal tragedy for him. It was a disgrace. We then had the
disgrace of the case going through the military 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1266</b><br>courts so that the high command could be absolved of failing to offer a
soldier for prosecution.</p><p><a name="06052329001070">In the Select Committee, I
suggested that there were ways round the problem. I suggested, as the
hon. Member for Islwyn was kind enough to point out, that there were
ways of dealing with it. The first option that I proposed would have
given a commanding officer the power to dismiss charges, even when he
would not have had the power to deal with them summarily, but would
have incorporated the amendments to Queen&#146;s Regulations of 29
July 2004, which would require the commanding officer to seek the
approval of his higher authority before dismissing any charge. That is
the situation that prevails in Iraq today. As my hon. Friend the Member
for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) suggested, that is the way the
system works today, and I cannot see why we cannot replicate it in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06052329001071">This is a lost
opportunity. I am sorry that the Government could not accede to our
proposals, and I would like to put it to them again that they would
reflect current practice, which appears to be working reasonably well.
They would also address the problem, which we all agree must never
arise again, of a charge arising from an event on operations during
active service going outside the military domain and being dealt with
by a civilian court that would not understand the military context. I
hope that the Government will be prepared to look again at this measure
in another place, particularly once they have heard the advice of the
former Chief of the Defence Staff.</p><p><a name="06052329001072">In the meantime, however, I am
disappointed that the Government were unable to accept the amendment
that I tabled to clause 116, to which the hon. Member for Islwyn and
others have already referred. My amendment would have required a
service policeman investigating a charge against a member of the armed
forces to inform that individual&#146;s commanding officer of any
intention to refer the case to the director of service prosecutions.
The amendment would also have made provision for the commanding officer
to make his own representations about the case to the director of
service prosecutions.</p><p><a name="06052329001073">I should like to explain to the
Minister that that would have enabled the commanding officer to set the
episode in the military context, so that the director of service
prosecutions would have that information to hand. In a moment, I shall
deal with the response that the hon. Member for Islwyn gave me in
Committee, but first I want to explain this point to the Minister. I
know that he is new to his post and&#151;I do not say this in a
patronising sense&#151;he has a huge amount to master. It seemed to
be accepted by the Government that it was desirable that the commanding
officer should have that input. We pressed the matter to a vote, and
the Committee divided equally. It was only the Chairman&#146;s
casting vote that enabled the Government to carry the day. However, I
remain convinced that there should be a requirement that the commanding
officer be informed.</p><p><a name="06052329001074">The Bill already reduces the
power of a commanding officer to dismiss a serious charge against an
individual under his command. However, to remove the commanding officer
from the loop altogether would reduce his authority over his men yet
further. We have heard powerful evidence tonight from a former 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1267</b><br>commanding officer of the importance of the bond between men and their
commander. The Committee would be ill advised not to recognise the
force of the argument put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for
Newark.</p><p><a name="06052329001075">The provision
to allow a commanding officer to submit his own report once a charge
had been referred to the director of service prosecutions would ensure
that the assessment of the commanding officer, setting out the military
context, was included in the director&#146;s assessment of whether
there was a case to answer. The commanding officer would know the men
under his command. He would probably have been present when the
incident took place; if not, he would not have been far away. He would
therefore bring not only more immediate knowledge of the military
context but, most importantly, knowledge of the individual
concerned.</p><p><a name="06052329001076">Will the
removal of the safeguard of having the commanding officer in the
decision-making process increase the chances of a serviceman being put
on trial without adequate understanding of the operational
circumstances? Lord Boyce said in the other place on 14
July:</p><a name="06052329001818"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Command
and discipline in the Armed Forces go absolutely hand in hand. A
commanding officer, who has total responsibility for the command of his
ship or unit, must, in turn, be responsible for&#151;and carry
out&#151;its discipline. It is impossible to achieve and maintain the
necessary level of discipline unless those under his or her command are
in absolutely no doubt that their commanding officer has authority over
them.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 14 July
2005; Vol. 673, c. 1235.]</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001077">My
hon. Friend the Member for Newark said that we must maintain that bond,
and he was right.</p><p><a name="06052329001078">The
hon. Member for North Durham has had great fun trying to suggest that
the former First Sea Lord and Chief of the Defence Staff had somehow
failed to provide adequate evidence to sustain his argument. I have
referred to the risk-averseness that many people in the armed forces
recognise. However, since the beginning of our proceedings, a document
has come to light. It is headed &#147;Reinforcement of pre-deployment
training in Iraq&#148;, and it was produced at the beginning of
December by Major Whitelegge, who is SO2 Plans, following a survey that
had been carried out among 7 Armoured Brigade. It is disappointing that
we were not told about its existence.</p><p><a name="06052329001079">One of the matters that the
major was asked to examine was the reluctance to become decisively
engaged when the rules of engagement clearly allowed them to do so. The
findings were pretty emphatic.</p><a name="06052329001819"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Confidence to open
fire. All agreed that there was a certain British reticence to open
fire, and that this was largely a positive feature at the start of an
operational deployment... However, there remained a common belief
that many soldiers lack the confidence to initiate opening fire when it
is tactically and legally sound to do so. Reasons for this were given
in the following approximate priority order:</p></ul><a name="06052329001820"><ul><p class="tabletext">(a) fear of investigation.
There is a widespread fear of being investigated for having opened
fire, and of a protracted prosecution system that might ensue. Some
believed that individual soldiers would not open fire as a result of
this fear. More typically, it was felt that soldiers would open fire,
but only within the strictest interpretation of the
ROE...</p></ul><a name="06052329001821"><ul><p class="tabletext">(b)

of engagement, and that we were able to ask questions of officials and
people who had served on the front line, and none of the issues that he

including that of the limitations on when servicemen can open fire. I
do not want take the House through all the scenarios involved at this

something. In that film, we saw guards on a ship at night, who heard a
sound, and fire was offered. They went to investigate, and the
&#147;enemy&#148; took off in an inflatable and were seen
disappearing. The guards were not allowed to shoot them because they
were not under immediate threat. One Member raised the point that while
they were not under immediate threat, the enemy might have been about
to offer immediate threat to some of their fellow servicemen. This is a
difficult area, and the hon. Member for Islwyn is right to raise it. A
lot more work needs to be done on that.</p><p><a name="06052329001088">To return to the substance, I
raised the issue of the survey because it has already gone into the

<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1269</b><br>Telegraph </i>a couple of weeks ago. I have made inquiries among those
who are currently serving, and I understand that a great effort has
been made to try to encourage and build confidence among those on the
front line that they might open fire with confidence. To the extent
that that has been done&#151;according to an insider whose word I
trust implicitly&#151;I am encouraged. I make no apology for
repeating something that has already appeared in a newspaper, perhaps
at greater length, as it illustrates the risk that we face if we do not
back up our people, and how easy it is for them to lose the confidence
that is essential if they are to be able to fight the fight on our
behalf and to save their own lives. If they fail to open fire out of
reticence and lose their lives, we will have betrayed and failed them,
as the whole House will agree. We must get the balance of judgment
right.</p><p><a name="06052329001089"><b><a name="06052329002683">Mr.
Brazier:</b> My hon. Friend is making a powerful speech.
Several Members have put this issue in the wider context of a litigious
society. May I remind him and the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr.
Jones) that in introducing the Compensation Bill to deal with such
wider civil effects, no one in the Government, even when saying that it
is purely a matter of perceptions, ever sought to blame those in the
scouting movement and other areas who have complained for somehow
stirring up innuendo?</p><p><a name="06052329001090"><b><a name="06052329002684">Mr.

that we will not be able to debate one of the new clauses relating to
the creation of an armed forces federation. To reinforce my earlier
point, let me quote from <i> The Sunday Times </i>yesterday, which
reported on the setting up of the British armed forces federation. It
quoted Professor Richard Holmes, who is universally admired by all of
us who have an interest in defence, as saying:</p><a name="06052329001824"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Politicians control
what senior officers say more than they did in the
past&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001092">He
continued:</p><a name="06052329001825"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;They simply
can&#146;t say what the problems might be. Someone has to do
that.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001093">That is his
support for the armed forces federation, which I happen to be against,
so I am afraid that I am on the wrong side of him on that matter.
However, the report goes on to say:</p><a name="06052329001826"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Many service members
believe comrades accused of war crimes in Iraq, who were later found
not guilty, were &#145;hung out to dry&#146; by the

for Newark&#151;of ensuring that 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1270</b><br>our people out there feel they have the support of not just the
political commanders, but the chain of
command.</p><p><a name="06052329001097">The hon.
Member for Islwyn&#151;the former Minister whom the Prime Minister
obviously thought too old to be veterans Minister&#151;sought to
assure me that there would be detailed guidance. I do not doubt his
word for a moment, but let me say this to his successor. Clause 116
clearly states what happens after an investigation. It could not be
more explicit; indeed, it could not be more pedantic. Subsection (2)
says that if</p><a name="06052329001827"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a service
policeman considers that there is sufficient evidence to charge a
person with a Schedule 2
offence&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001098">&#151;that is,
a serious
offence&#151;</p><a name="06052329001828"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;he must
refer the case to the Director of Service
Prosecutions&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001099">We are
absolutely clear about the role of the service policeman. It is
perfectly all right to specify that in the Bill. However, it cannot be
specified in the Bill that the commanding officer will be empowered
both to make representations and to be told of the outcome of the
service policeman&#146;s
investigation.</p><p><a name="06052329001100">I am
sorry, but I must insist that that is not correct. It is fine to be
prescriptive about the role of the service policeman, but I do not
think it acceptable to argue that we cannot be prescriptive about the
role of the commanding officer. The commanding officer is central to
the whole concept of the chain of command, and to the protection of the
men under his command. Unless the Minister is prepared to say that he
will deal with that in the other place, I am afraid that I will seek to
persuade the Committee to vote against the
clause.</p><p><a name="06052329001101"><b><a name="06052329002687">Mr.
Watson:</b> A powerful case has been put for each side of the
argument. I intend to explain clause 116, and then try to deal with
some of the key points that have been
raised.</p><p><a name="06052329001102">The clause
determines to whom a service policeman refers a case once he has
investigated it. It also determines to whom a service police force
refers a case that has been referred to it by a United Kingdom or
overseas civilian police force. Its purpose is to ensure that the most
serious or sensitive cases are referred to the service prosecuting
authority.</p><p><a name="06052329001103">Subsection
(2) requires a service policeman who considers that there is sufficient
evidence to charge a person with a schedule 2 offence&#151;that is,
one of the most serious offences&#151;to refer the case directly to
the prosecuting authority without first passing it to the
person&#146;s commanding officer. When a service policeman considers
that there is sufficient evidence to charge the person with another
offence in the context of circumstances &#147;prescribed by
regulations&#148;, he will also have to refer the case to the
prosecuting authority. When the offence is not covered by schedule 2,
and no prescribed circumstances apply but the service policeman
considers that there is sufficient evidence to charge the person with
some other offence, subsection (3) requires that it be passed to the
person&#146;s commanding
officer.</p><p><a name="06052329001104">Subsection
(4) requires a service policeman to consult the prosecuting authority
before referring a person to his or her commanding officer if it was
originally thought that a schedule 2 offence might have been committed,
or that prescribed circumstances might exist. That ensures that in such
a case the service 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1271</b><br>police&#146;s decision on whether there are sufficient grounds for the
case to be referred to the prosecuting authority will be made on the
advice of the prosecuting
authority.</p><a name="06052329001772"><p>Many
Members have raised specific points. First, let me deal with the
&#147;risk-averse&#148; points. We have heard a number of
quotations from Lord Boyce and various others. If I understand the
argument correctly, what is being suggested is that clause 116 will
create a politically correct brigade of lawyers who will be profoundly
challenging to the roles played by service personnel. The argument is
that personnel will be more risk-averse in the field of combat and in
operations, and that they will be inhibited from operating effectively
in theatre. I understand those arguments, but on reading the transcript
of the debate in Committee, I wanted to test the issue for myself. Last
week, I visited the Coldstream Guards and asked them whether they felt
inhibited by the rules of engagement and thought that a new culture was
developing in the forces. Their commanding officer afforded me time to
talk to infantrymen who had been on the front line, and from their CO
down I did not get that impression.</p><p><a name="06052329001105"><b><a name="06052329002688">Mr.
Gerald Howarth:</b> The Coldstream Guards were based in
Aldershot until last year, and they returned from Iraq after a
difficult tour. Their padre is a close friend of mine. I spoke to
several warrant officers in the sergeants&#146; mess, and there is no
doubt that some of them felt inhibited. I sought to say that an
authority whom I regard as one of integrity told me that the position
has improved, but the Minister will accept that the survey carried out
on the 7th Armoured Brigade at the end of November and the beginning of
December, and some of the remarks that have been made, indicate that
there has been a problem.</p><p><a name="06052329001106"><b><a name="06052329002689">Mr.
Watson:</b> The hon. Gentleman and I will have to draw
different conclusions from the conversations that we have had. That was
not said to me when I was in the sergeants&#146; mess, and when I
talked to the infantrymen to test out this issue they gave no
impression that they felt inhibited. I asked the commander who
conducted our forces in Basra whether he felt inhibited by the rules of
engagement, and he said, &#147;No, not at all.&#148; So the hon.
Gentleman and I have obviously had different
conversations.</p><p><a name="06052329001108"><b><a name="06052329002690">Mr.

various visits that I undertook with the Select Committee, I did not
come across anyone&#151;be it an infantry person or someone in a more
senior position&#151;who said that they were risk-averse in the way
that has been described. Unfortunately, even when evidence is put
before the hon. Gentleman, he cannot come to terms with
it.</p><p><a name="06052329001109"><b><a name="06052329002691">Mr.

in the world. It is all about using no more force than is necessary,
using firearms as a last resort and only to protect human life, only
firing aimed shots, no more rounds than are necessary and taking
precautions to hit only the target...Believe you me, the Army
knows what it is doing. The Rules of Engagement have stood the test of
time and they are right.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001111">Those are the words of the hon. Member
for Salisbury (Robert Key), who, sadly, cannot be here tonight. They
are on his website, and if I can feel reassured by those words, I hope
that the hon. Member for Aldershot can.
</p><p><a name="06052329001112"><b><a name="06052329002692">Mr.
Howarth:</b> I think that there has been a slight
misunderstanding. There is no dispute about the nature of the rules of
engagement. Indeed, one of our proposals was to include them in the
Bill, so that compliance with them would be sufficient protection
against prosecution. There are certain issues in that regard, which I
have raised with the hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), but the
serious question is whether people will be prosecuted. Concern that
they might have exceeded the rules of engagement could damage them
psychologically and affect their ability to be operationally effective;
at worst, it could risk their losing their lives.</p><a name="06052329001773"><p><b><a name="06052329002693">Mr.
Watson:</b> That concern is obviously not borne out by the
hon. Member for Salisbury. The Coldstream Guards to whom I talked last
week did not share it, either, so the hon. Member for Aldershot and I
will have to disagree on this issue.</p><p><a name="06052329001113"><b><a name="06052329002694">Mr.
Brazier:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr.
Howarth) quoted the survey leaked by <i> The Sunday Telegraph. </i>Does
the Minister believe that that survey was properly founded? Why did
that survey have to be leaked? When we had a Conservative Government,
the regular surveys of a range of attitudes were available at any time
on request by
Members.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001871">8.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06052329001114"><b><a name="06052329002695">Mr.
Watson:</b> The hon. Gentleman will know that I cannot comment
on that survey. I have not seen it and, if it was leaked, we do not
comment on leaked documents. However, I will try to review the press
article after the debate and if I can learn something from it I will
contact him.</p><p><a name="06052329001115">The hon.
Member for Aldershot made several points about the role of the
prosecuting authority and the commanding officer. I know that he has
expressed concern that if a serious offence were alleged, it would be
investigated by the service police and the case passed to the service
prosecuting authority without an opportunity for the commanding officer
to explain the service context to the prosecuting authority. In fact,
the Bill will not substantially change the present position, which hon.
Members seek to preserve. I do not underestimate the seriousness with
which hon. Members have made the point, but the service police will of
course be able to consult the CO.</p><p><a name="06052329001116">I shall explain why the
concerns expressed, especially by the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr.
Brazier), are 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1273</b><br>not founded. He said that the Bill would strip away a statutory
obligation. To take the Army as an example, nothing in the Army Act
1955 provides a right for COs or higher authority to submit a report to
the Army Prosecuting Authority setting out the military circumstances
that prevailed. That right is covered by
regulation.</p><p><a name="06052329001117"><b><a name="06052329002696">Mr.
Brazier:</b> We are now in a much more litigious era, with a
well briefed enemy who is clever at working out fresh ways to make life
difficult for our armed forces. The Bill will change the situation from
one in which the CO has the powers to dismiss charges to one in which
he is merely expected to be consulted. The Minister and his predecessor
have been happy to make promises on the Floor of the House, so what is
stopping the Government from providing the comfort of putting it in the
Bill?</p><p><a name="06052329001118"><b><a name="06052329002697">Mr.
Watson:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument&#151;he has made it on three or four occasions. I shall try
to answer that point. At present, there is provision in regulations for
the commanding officer to submit to higher authority any information in
his possession, in addition to other details, which&#151;in his
opinion&#151;may be material to the institution of court martial or
other proceedings. The higher authority is required to forward that
material to the prosecuting authority when forwarding a case from the
commanding officer. What use it makes of that information, if any, is
entirely a matter for the prosecuting
authority.</p><a name="06052329001774"><p>Under
the Bill, there is no prohibition on commanding officers providing the
same information as they do now. They will be aware of police
investigations and we would expect a similar provision to be in the
regulations made under the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) said to the Select Committee, we acknowledge that
in such cases a commanding officer may have valuable information that
could assist the director in the test that he must apply before
proceeding to charge individuals. A commanding officer will have to be
made aware of such a case, because it will affect one of his people and
the operational efficiency of his unit. Written guidance will set out
the standard operating procedures under which the service police will
be obliged to act in that regard. Even now, the service police send
daily reports to commanding officers notifying them of all cases that
they have begun to investigate. Notifying them of a case that has gone
directly to the prosecuting authority will be a matter of course and we
do not need to legislate for that process.
</p><p><a name="06052329001119"><b><a name="06052329002698">Mr.
Gerald Howarth:</b> One benefit of these proceedings is that
all those comments are being written into the record, but I cannot
understand why the Minister and his advisers are so loth to put
something prescriptive into the Bill when they are perfectly prepared
to include the
words:</p><a name="06052329001830"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If an
officer of a prescribed description becomes aware of circumstances of a
prescribed description, he must as soon as is reasonably practicable
ensure that a service police force is aware of the
matter.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1274</b><br><p><a name="06052329001120">Why not put on the face of the Bill that
the commanding officer shall be informed of the outcome of the
investigation, or that the commanding officer may&#151;permissive,
not mandatory&#151;inform the director of service prosecutions of the
military
context?</p><p><a name="06052329001121"><b><a name="06052329002699">Mr.
Watson:</b> There is no need to include such a provision, as I
shall explain. It is inconceivable that a commanding officer would not
want to take up their right to submit circumstances to a prosecuting
authority.</p><p><a name="06052329001122">In the
remaining time available, I want to deal with some of the more detailed
points that the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) made so
powerfully. He spoke of the need for powers to deal with serious
offences during operations, which is probably the most serious point in
our debate on these matters. Perhaps my explanation of the current
situation will inform his conclusions in the Lobby
later.</p><p><a name="06052329001123">UK forces
developed a shooting investigation policy for high-tempo operations in
Iraq that was so successful that they adopted the same model in
Afghanistan. It has led to fewer but better targeted service police
investigations. It allows COs to decide that there is no suggestion of
an offence and to delay service police investigation until the
operational tempo permits it. Nothing in the Bill is inconsistent with
that procedure.</p><p><a name="06052329001124">Under
the Bill, the CO will still have to make the service police aware of
serious offences as soon as is possible and reasonably practicable. I
hope that that assures the hon. Gentleman that we will not draw people
away from high-tempo operations during important tours of
duty.</p><p><a name="06052329001125"><b><a name="06052329002700">Patrick
Mercer:</b> The Minister has generously answered my point as
far as it goes. I am grateful for his indication that it is at the
heart of the debate because the crux of the matter is that in
operational circumstances such as those which prevailed for the 2nd
Royal Tank Regiment, the case of Trooper Williams, until it was
satisfactorily dealt with&#151;by the CO in that
case&#151;seriously worried the rest of the regiment and caused
operational ineffectiveness. If the powers to deal with such things
during high-tempo operations were stripped away from COs, it could
interfere with the operational effectiveness of units at that
level.</p><p><a name="06052329001126"><b><a name="06052329002701">Mr.
Watson:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I would
rather not be drawn into discussion of the case of Trooper Williams,
which is extremely detailed. The point that I was trying to make is
that we will not be drawing people away from their immediate
operational
effectiveness.</p><p><a name="06052329001127">I
cannot comment on individual cases, but I suspect that one feature of
the case mentioned by the hon. Member for Canterbury was the delay in
resolving the matter. Service chiefs and all members of the armed
forces share concern about such delays. The regime that we are
introducing will ensure that matters that ought to go to the
prosecuting authority move far more quickly than at present. The closer
relationship between the service police and the prosecuting 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1275</b><br>authority should help to improve the quality of the investigation. All
those factors will contribute to reducing such
delays.</p><p><a name="06052329001128">The hon.
Gentleman suggested that the clause would prevent service police from
consulting a
CO.</p><a name="06052329001775"><p><b><a name="06052329002702">Mr.
Brazier:</b> I did not suggest that the clause would prevent
service police from consulting COs, but that it says that they should
refer a case directly, which means that they could shove it on without
consulting the CO.
</p><p><a name="06052329001129"><b><a name="06052329002703">Mr.
Watson:</b> Let me explain what currently happens. The clause
will not prevent any service police from consulting the CO about the
case in deciding whether there is sufficient evidence of an offence
before sending the case to the director of service prosecutions. Where
the service context is relevant to whether an offence has been
committed, the service police not only may, but should, ensure that
they understand that context. However, if they decide that there is
sufficient evidence, the CO should not be able to stop the DSP
considering the
case.</p><p><a name="06052329001130">I have tried to
answer as many of the detailed points about the clause as I possibly
can. Obviously, I will review <i> Hansard</i> tomorrow, and if I can
help hon. Members further when I have looked at it, I will. With those
assurances, I vainly attempt to reassure the hon. Member for Aldershot
that the clause is not worth dividing the
Committee.</p><p><a name="06052329001131"><b><a name="06052329002704">Mr.
Gerald Howarth:</b> I made it clear at the outset, as did my
hon. Friends, that the clause goes to the heart of the Bill and
reflects some of the most significant changes to our procedures under
the existing individual service Acts. We have sought not only to set
out some of the concerns that we feel exist, but to make the case that,
if the Government feel so strongly that what we are saying is already
current practice, it ought to be stated in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06052329001132">I am sorry to disagree with the
hon. Gentleman on his first outing as the Minister, but I feel very
strongly about the issue. I have made the case in the Select Committee,
I have the support of my hon. Friends, and we are disappointed that the
Government feel unable to make such a change or, indeed, to offer us
any possible change, not even further consideration before the Bill
goes to another place. Therefore, I am afraid to say&#151;with no
personal disrespect to the Minister&#151;that I am not satisfied and
that I will invite my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against the
clause standing part of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06052329001133"><b><a name="06052329002705">The

and slightly relieved to stand at the Dispatch Box this evening with
the task of sending the Bill on its way to another place. I should like
to pay sincere tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr.
Touhig), who was responsible for introducing the Bill. He is a great
parliamentarian and a good friend. His deep regard and support for the
armed forces are well respected by Members on both sides of the House.
His open and consensual approach to the Bill, which helped the Select
Committee to conduct its businesses effectively, were widely welcomed.
I am indebted to him, and I am very grateful indeed for his
authoritative and constructive contribution to our debate. On a
personal note, I thank him for the support that he has given
me.</p><p><a name="06052329001641">I pay tribute to
members of the Select Committee, which was chaired by my right hon.
Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth).
Many of them have made sincere contributions today with the common
purpose of ensuring that we introduce legislation that can better meet
the needs of the 21st century. The hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr.
Howarth) has been gracious to me on my first run-out&#151;I am sure
that he could have been harder. He mentioned his former colleague and
very good friend, Eric Forth. I remember Eric with admiration, having
been a Friday Whip before assuming my new role. One thing that Eric
pioneered was in-flight refuelling during debate. Some of my hon.
Friends have been good at in-flight refuelling this afternoon. I will
not name them, but they have my grateful
thanks.</p><p><a name="06052329001642">I am sure the
House will join me in sending good wishes for a speedy recovery to the
hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key), who cannot be with us this
evening. He served on the Select Committee on the Bill, and made a
significant contribution to
it.</p><p><a name="06052329001643">I place on record
my thanks to the staff of my new private office, and the Bill team in
particular, who did not quite take away the sleepless nights, but they
helped with detailed briefings throughout the afternoon. They know what
they did and, if it is not out of order, I offer them a small drink
after the debate.</p><p><a name="06052329001644">We
have had a good debate. I shall not cover old ground, but I shall
mention my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry
Cohen). We 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1283</b><br>crossed swords for a couple of hours, especially over what constituted
the definition of an enemy. Never has Churchill&#146;s quote been so
valid&#151;enemy behind, opposition in front. My hon. Friend may have
defined his enemy this afternoon, but I hope he will be my friend at
the end of the
debate.</p><p><a name="06052329001645">Although my
time as Minister responsible for the Bill has been brief, it falls to
me to mark an important stage in its progress. I will not detain the
House unduly, but I shall say a few words about the Bill. It is a good
Bill.</p><p><a name="06052329001646"><b><a name="06052329003160">Mrs.
Joan Humble (Blackpool, North and Fleetwood) (Lab):</b> My
hon. Friend spoke a moment ago about going over old ground. May I ask
him to cover some new ground? He will be studying the review by
Nicholas Blake QC of the events at Deepcut. A key recommendation from
Nicholas Blake is the establishment of an armed forces ombudsman.
Perhaps as the debate on the Bill continues in another place, my hon.
Friend will consider that important recommendation to make sure that
the Bill deals with all the concerns that people have about the armed
forces.</p><p><a name="06052329001647"><b><a name="06052329003161">Mr.
Watson:</b> I understand the point that my hon. Friend makes.
She concerns herself in great detail with the Bill. We take the Blake
review extremely seriously. Although I am new in the position, the
Department hopes to respond shortly. I am sure my hon. Friend will have
an opportunity to express her views in her usual
way.</p><p><a name="06052329001648"><b><a name="06052329003162">Lembit
&#214;pik (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b> I do not wish to
detain the Minister, but he will accept that the hon. Lady&#146;s
view is shared on a cross-party basis. The parents of those who lost
their offspring at Deepcut Army barracks will feel disappointed that on
Report the Minister and others did not get to discuss the
recommendations of the Blake inquiry. Can he give the House an
assurance that he takes the concerns of the parents seriously, and that
there will be continuing discussion to see if we can bring about
closure for the parents, albeit with the possible revelation of some as
yet undisclosed
reports?</p><p><a name="06052329001649"><b><a name="06052329003163">Mr.
Watson:</b> I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
disappointment. The matter is serious and will not go away at the end
of the evening. I take his point on
board.</p><p><a name="06052329001650">The Bill marks
an historic change for the armed forces. In a sense, the most important
test of its value is the support that it has from the armed forces. The
services have been central to the development of the Bill. The clear
modern drafting is a testament to the skills of parliamentary counsel.
The chiefs of staff, commanding officers and men and women of all ranks
have supported the Bill.</p><p><a name="06052329001651">It is right that we should
replace the three service discipline Acts&#151;the Army Act 1955, the
Air Force Act 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957&#151;which
provided the legal basis for service discipline for so many years.
Importantly, when enacted the Bill will deliver the undertaking that
the Government gave in 1998 in their strategic defence review to
introduce a 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1284</b><br>single system of service law. Under this legislation, for the first
time, we will have a single system that will apply to all three
services at all times and wherever they are in the world; nor should we
forget the civilians who accompany them
overseas.</p><p><a name="06052329001652">The Bill
recognises a world in which the three services increasingly train and
operate together, but equally it will underpin the maintenance of
discipline through the chain of command that is so fundamental to the
operational effectiveness of our armed forces in which we all take such
pride. We have listened to Members and made some sensible amendments.
This is still work in progress, as we have said. The Government will
take the opportunity during the Bill&#146;s passage in another place
to bring forward any further amendments to ensure that we give the
armed forces the best possible system that we
can.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001873">9.25
pm</h5><p><a name="06052329001653"><b><a name="06052329003164">Mr.
Gerald Howarth: </b>I join the Minister in thanking those who
have contributed over the last four or five months to our deliberations
on these matters. It is true that the Bill team has been working even
longer; I think for 18 months. I should remind the House that when the
House last debated this matter in 1955, the Select Committee took two
years. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that hon. Members on
both sides of the Select Committee have undertaken in four or five
months that which our predecessor Committee in the 1950s took two years
to undertake. That seems like a productivity enhancement to
me.</p><p><a name="06052329001654">I should also like
to pay tribute, as I have done already, to the hon. Member for Islwyn
(Mr. Touhig) for all the help behind the scenes that he gave, and to
the Minister I am bound to say, &#147;A very good opening
performance,&#148; and I hope that he will take some confidence from
that. I also hope that he will accept that he has one of the best jobs
in the Government in representing and acting on behalf of some of the
finest men and women in our
country.</p><p><a name="06052329001655">You, Mr.
Deputy Speaker, said that consideration has now been completed, but
consideration of the Bill has not been completed. We have not been able
to discuss a number of amendments. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North
and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) had tabled a new clause about an ombudsman
that we were unable to discuss, and we had some concerns over service
panels and the make-up of the court martial panels. We also had a
concern that the director of service prosecutions must have a military
background, and there were other issues as well. So unfortunately we
will bid the Bill farewell to another place not fully considered here,
and I hope that some of those points will be taken up
there.</p><p><a name="06052329001656">One of the most
important points about the Bill is the way in which it has been
considered. The Select Committee procedure has been hugely beneficial,
and the Committee so found in its report and recommended that the
Government should consider applying the technique to other Bills. I
have no doubt, seeing the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah
McCarthy-Fry) in her place, having participated assiduously in our
proceedings, that it was extremely beneficial to all of us, however
much experience we had of the military. We all took away a huge amount
from 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1285</b><br>the opportunity of being able to cross-examine people before us and make
the visits. The Committee was better informed as a result. We may not
all have heard the same things or interpreted what we heard in quite
the same way, but the fact that we made those visits and held those
proceedings was beneficial.</p><p><a name="06052329001657">It was always difficult for the
Opposition given that the service chiefs had all signed up to the
legislation. It ill behoves an acting pilot officer to question the
Chief of the Air Staff, let alone the Chief of the Defence Staff, about
whether he has got it right or not, but I would be quite interested to
know in exactly how much detail each of the defence chiefs read the
legislation.</p><p><a name="06052329001658">As I
have said, the Opposition&#146;s approach was to look at the Bill
from the point of view of how it will affect our armed forces on the
front line, not so much how they will deal with discipline at home in
Aldershot or Colchester. The debate about the chain of command and the
power of commanding officers illustrated our genuine concerns about the
administration of discipline, particularly where servicemen and women
are felt to have acted outside the rules of engagement.</p><p><a name="06052329001659">It is good news that the
Government have accepted the need for annual renewal. I thank the hon.
Member for Islwyn for having acceded to that change, which is
incorporated in the Bill. That welcome provision will give the House an
opportunity to revisit how the changes are bedding
down.</p><p><a name="06052329001660">The Minister has
referred to the Bill&#146;s tri-service nature, which is widely
accepted as being the desirable way to go. However, one of the things
that came out of our visits to Cyprus, Oman and Iraq is that each of
the armed forces fights differently and has an individual ethos.
Paragraph 39 on page 13 of the Committee&#146;s report makes the
important point
that</p><a name="06052329001834"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The way
each Service fights is different and the Bill needs to accommodate
those differences&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001661">We
want to see everything in terms of joint operations, but that is not
necessarily the case, because, as an old boy has said, many sailors
will never work alongside a soldier or airman throughout their whole
military careers. Some of those differences came out during our visits,
and I hope that the Minister will reflect on how the Bill can be made
to fit the individual service ethos&#151;the desire of the chiefs to
make the default position on courts martial panels single service is a
good starting
point.</p><p><a name="06052329001662">The Opposition
have also taken the view that this body of military law is essential.
We agree with the Judge Advocate General that the military should be
governed by completely different law from that which applies to
civilians. I hope that we have managed to accommodate the changes to
civilian law to the extent that they will not damage the operational
effectiveness of the armed forces.</p><p><a name="06052329001663">As a sideswipe at the European
convention on human rights, I was concerned to be told during our
proceedings in Select Committee that although the Bill is compatible
with the ECHR, that is no bar to further challenges. I personally take
the view that the European Court of Human Rights should have nothing to
do with how the United Kingdom disposes of its armed forces. The
protection of the members of 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1286</b><br>our armed forces and their arrangements should be exclusively a matter
for this Parliament and not for some court composed of a collection of
foreigners. I feel very strongly about that matter.</p><p><a name="06052329001664">The test which we must apply to
our deliberations over the past few months is whether we have provided
our armed forces with a legal framework that will do them the justice
that they undoubtedly deserve. There is not an hon. Member in this
House, even among those who have spoken against the war in Iraq, who
does not have anything other than unbounded admiration for our armed
forces, and I hope that we have fashioned a law that will help them,
that will protect them and enable them to do their magnificent work on
behalf of the entire nation.</p><p><a name="06052329001665">I shall conclude with the
military covenant, which is quoted on page 6 of our report and which
sets out the Army&#146;s
doctrine:</p><a name="06052329001835"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Soldiers
differ from civilian employees because success in military operations,
when the price of failure may be death, requires the subordination of
the rights of the individual to the needs of the task and the team,
albeit within a legal
framework.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001666">I hope that
we have discharged our responsibility to the men and women of our armed
forces to their
satisfaction.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001874">9.34
pm</h5><p><a name="06052329001667"><b><a name="06052329003165">Mr.
Touhig:</b> I know the Armed Forces Bill as an old friend,
having taken it through its Committee stages with a number of
colleagues. In rising to speak from the Back Benches, I feel a little
like the ghost of Christmas past.</p><p><a name="06052329001668">Let me begin by congratulating
my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary on his appointment. I know that he
will do an excellent job. I am sure that Members on both sides of the
House will agree that having come into the job at such short notice he
has done a very good job during today&#146;s debate. While I pass on
the baton of Veterans Minister with considerable regret, I am happy to
hand over to my hon. Friend some of the work in the red boxes. I am
grateful to him and to other Members for their kind comments about my
time as Minister, particularly so far as this Bill is concerned. I am
conscious that the first contribution from a recently retired Minister
may at times be an uncomfortable experience for those on the Front
Bench, but I can put my hon. Friends at ease. I will enjoy my freedom
from the security of collective responsibility by making it plain that
I wholeheartedly support the Bill.</p><p><a name="06052329001669">With the strategic defence
review in 1998, the Government recognised that we needed a single
system of service law for today&#146;s armed forces. Our forces
increasingly train and operate together, and they need a modern system
of justice that reflects that. The Bill is the result of years of hard
and dedicated work, and the services themselves have been at the centre
of its development. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the former Secretary
of State for Defence said on Second Reading that this is a Bill that
has at its centre the armed forces themselves. In that sense, it is a
Bill for the armed forces. It has their full support, primarily because
it meets their needs in a way that has been absent for some
time.</p><p><a name="06052329001670">I turn to the
way in which the Bill has been handled, as referred to by the hon.
Member for Aldershot (Mr. 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1287</b><br>Howarth). I should like to add my thanks to the Bill team for their
professional and dedicated support. When I was Minister, I knew at
first hand that they did a tremendous job and that that was not often
recognised enough. The special Select Committee procedure is a regular
feature of the quinquennial review of service discipline. As has been
demonstrated, it has been an outstandingly successful arrangement for
the House. The evidence taken by the Committee, in what we might term
the Select Committee stage, gave Members the opportunity better to
understand the purposes behind the Bill.</p><p><a name="06052329001671">The combination of that expert
testimony and line-by-line scrutiny in Committee means that this Bill
has been considered in a far greater depth than many others. I pay
tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and
Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth), who chaired the Committee with his
customary blend of patience and purpose. He was ably assisted by the
hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key), who has served on several
special Select Committees considering service legislation. Indeed, his
experience led me at one stage to consider asking him to join the Bill
team, because I thought that he would make a considerable contribution.
I join with all Members in wishing him a speedy recovery and return to
the House.</p><p><a name="06052329001672">In
Committee and in the early debates in the House and today, as well as
in the media, I fear that we have heard a great deal of nonsense about
our armed forces being under some sort of legal siege that is affecting
the chain of command and blighting operational effectiveness. To me,
&#147;legal siege&#148; is a loose, vague, woolly and wholly
misleading term. As a concept it lacks intellectual rigour, and as a
description it lacks a grounding in fact. I do not mean to say that
certain perceptions do not exist in some quarters, although when
reading some of the newspaper reports I am reminded of Nye Bevan, who,
when asked whether he read the newspapers, said that of course he did
because it was his one continuous source of fiction.</p><p><a name="06052329001673">I consider the so-called legal
siege to be a mirage. The former Chief of the Defence Staff, the noble
and gallant Lord Boyce, who has been much quoted today, could not give
a single real example of how this intangible concept is supposedly
affecting operational effectiveness. During the Committee stage, when
asked by my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones), the
then Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Michael Walker, gave the
same reply:</p><a name="06052329001836"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If you ask me to give
you a physical concrete example, I
cannot.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001674">I would remind
Members of some wise words that we heard in the Committee&#146;s
hearings, which I uttered
earlier:</p><a name="06052329001837"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am
sure that we all could play a better role in trying to dampen down this
particular worry, and people like myself who are standing up and
speaking in the House of Lords debates and so forth perhaps need to
re-look at how we are saying things in order not to fuel anxieties of
this nature.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001675">Those were
the words of Admiral Lord Boyce himself, and I was grateful for his
candour when he gave us that evidence in Committee.</p><p><a name="06052329001676">Perception stems from what is
said in this place and in the press. If it is said often enough, it
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Hon. Members&#151;of this House 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1288</b><br>and the other place&#151;should be more temperate in their comments,
otherwise they feed a perception that undermines the morale of our
forces.</p><p><a name="06052329001677">We had much
discussion in Standing Committee and this evening on the role of
commanding officer. I should like to conclude by making it plain that
the Bill has the support of forces and that the changes that we are
making to the role of the commanding officer will be supported and
welcomed. Indeed, many of our forces have welcomed the removal of the
power to dismiss serious charges. I have a high regard for General Sir
Mike Jackson, and he put it
perfectly:</p><a name="06052329001838"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As
far as the Army is concerned, I would echo the fundamental place of the
Commanding Officer in holding good order and military discipline and we
are content that the new Bill secures that position. There have been
changes but they are not changes which we think in any way are
significantly detrimental to that pole position which we would wish the
Commanding Officer to
hold.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001678">I subscribe to his
remarks.</p><p><a name="06052329001679">When we
considered harmonising the powers of commanding officers, naval
captains had perhaps most to lose. It was once said of the Navy in
Nelson&#146;s time that, on board ship, the captain was second only
to God, and that was only a matter of seniority. The Bill updates
powers in the age of e-mail and satellite communications, and the then
First Sea Lord made it clear when he gave evidence to our Committee
that he was entirely happy with what has been retained. The changes in
the Bill allow commanding officers to get on with what they do best:
commanding, training and looking after the men and women under their
command.</p><p><a name="06052329001680">As I said on
Second Reading, we place an enormous responsibility on the shoulders of
our servicemen and women. We ask them to operate in circumstances that
are often difficult, unpredictable and dangerous. We ask them to
perform tasks that have no parallel in the civilian world. When young
men and women sign on to serve in our armed forces, they know that they
may face circumstances in which they put their lives on the line. That
does not happen to those who join Barclays bank or Tesco. It is the
peculiar and special position of those who join our armed forces.
Sometimes, they make the ultimate sacrifice. We have again recently
mourned the deaths of our young servicemen and women in Iraq.</p><p><a name="06052329001681">Parliament and the armed forces
demand high standards of behaviour from our forces, whether overseas on
operations or training at home. Discipline is essential and service law
is essential to enforce it. Ultimately we all want an effective and
efficient fighting force.</p><p><a name="06052329001682">There is no doubt that we need
a separate system of law for the armed forces and that it needs to
reflect the increasingly joint nature of their work. The Bill delivers
that. The forces want the measure. It will provide strong legislation
for service discipline in the 21st century. I hope that it will have
the wholehearted support of the other place and that it will soon be on
the statute
book.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001875">9.42
pm</h5><p><a name="06052329001683"><b><a name="06052329003166">Bob
Russell: </b>I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr.
Touhig) for his past service as Under-Secretary. I believe that the
Prime Minister has treated 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1289</b><br>him shabbily by taking away the job after he piloted the Bill almost to
the finishing post. It is something when one is deemed, at 58, to be
too old to be the veterans Minister. However, I warmly welcome his
replacement, the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson). As
has been said, he performed spectacularly tonight and I wish him well
in the future.</p><p><a name="06052329001684">We
welcome the Bill. It has been a long haul and it now goes to the other
place, where there will be an opportunity to do the fine tuning that
perhaps some people feel is still required. I join other speakers in
thanking the Bill Committee team for all their work in briefing hon.
Members and helping them through the various Committee stages. I say
&#147;various&#148; because it is the first time that I have served
on a Committee that evolved in such a way, through Standing and Select
Committee structures. I found it very useful and informative, and I
hope that it will become the pattern for future Bills.</p><p><a name="06052329001685">The Bill will bring about the
harmonisation of military disciplinary matters going back decades, if
not centuries. It is not only the armed forces discipline Acts of 1955
and 1957&#151;half a century ago&#151;that are being updated.
Certain measures go right back to the 19th century. It is right that,
in the third millennium, we should have disciplinary procedures for the
military that are fit for purpose, and that reflect the changing times
and the increasing tendency for our armed forces to be on joint
deployment, as we found when we visited British troops in Oman, Cyprus
and Iraq as part of our investigation. I was impressed to see in
Cyprus, for example, the military police from all three services
working successfully as a single unit. In Iraq, we met helicopter
pilots drawn from the RAF, the Army and the Navy working as a single
unit. Joint deployment must not take away from the fact that each
service has a special ethos, however. A naval helicopter pilot, for
example, needs training and disciplines in maritime conditions, whereas
those in the Army&#151;such as those in 16 Air Assault Brigade from
Colchester&#151;need to operate rapid attack helicopters to get
troops in at low level.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060522/debtext/60522-0270.htm"/>


<p><a name="06052329001686">I was delighted that, in
addition to visiting Iraq, Cyprus and Oman, the Committee had the good
sense to visit the military corrective training centre at Colchester.
It sets an example that the prison service could follow, in that it
provides a good way of training young men&#151;and, occasionally,
young women&#151;who have committed misdemeanours but who are
nevertheless an important part of the military, and of getting them
back into military service.</p><p><a name="06052329001687">It is a special privilege to
represent a garrison town, and I am particularly interested in the
welfare of military discipline matters. We have heard a lot today about
the command structure. In our garrison towns, we have garrison
commanders. However, by the end of the year, they will no longer be
there, because the reconfiguration will result in brigade commanders
taking over the role. I discovered that yesterday, and I also found, to
my horror, that Colchester&#146;s garrison commander, Colonel Tony
Barton, will no longer be there. In fact, he is leaving the service
because he feels that he is being forced out. That cannot be right,
because garrison commanders are all part of the chain 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1290</b><br>of command, and garrison boundaries and brigade commanders&#146;
boundaries are not always coterminous. I foresee problems arising from
this change.</p><p><a name="06052329001688">I would
like the Minister to comment on another matter, which I have raised in
Committee. It is the potential conflict between Ministry of Defence
police and the civilian police as a result of the growing tendency,
following the forced privatisation of married quarters by the previous
Tory Government, to sell the houses on. There is now uncertainty on one
Army estate in Colchester as to what is military and what is civilian,
and whether the MOD police or the civilian police should prevail. I am
sure that the problem can be worked out, but it does need to be
addressed.</p><p><a name="06052329001689">I am
disappointed that our debate today dragged on in the way that it did,
because it meant that we did not reach the amendment tabled by the hon.
Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay). However, I hope that his
proposal will come back at another time in another place.</p><p><a name="06052329001690">Will the Minister also confirm
in his summing up that the disciplinary procedures will apply to the
Gurkhas serving in the British Army? I mention that because I want to
put on record that the United British Gurkhas Ex-servicemen&#146;s
Association from Nepal presented a petition at No. 10 Downing street
today about the injustices and unfairness suffered by those veterans. I
hope that the Minister will confirm that today&#146;s Gurkhas will be
treated on equal terms with the rest of the British
Army.</p><p><a name="06052329001691">One interesting
aspect of military discipline that was new to all of us on the
Committee was AGAI 67&#151;it is just as well that it was not two
more than that. Anyway, it stands for Army general and administrative
instructions, which are low-level disciplinary procedures that can be
carried out by sergeants and corporals as a form of immediate
disciplinary action. I understand that the Bill will enable the Royal
Navy and Royal Air Force also to introduce AGAI 67 minor
sanctions.</p><p><a name="06052329001692">The
Liberal Democrats support the Bill. It is important, however, that the
ethos of the different services and the distinctiveness of the Army,
Navy and Air Force are maintained and retained while at the same time
harmonising disciplinary procedures, especially when we have joint
deployments. I wish the Minister well as he takes the Bill through the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001876">9.50

Humble: </b>Like other Members, I want to compliment both the
former and current Minister and the whole team involved in this
important Bill. However, the legislation must not only satisfy the
needs of the armed forces but the needs of families who, sadly, have
lost their children while serving in the armed forces and in peacetime
barracks. They, too, are looking for answers in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06052329001694">The experience of Army life is
of immense benefit to the overwhelming majority of young men and women
able to take advantage of that career. At the same time, young soldiers
are in a vulnerable position. Service life requires strict discipline
and a tough regime. Sometimes, however, discipline and toughness become
bullying and harassment. Our task is to minimise the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1291</b><br>opportunities for that to happen, and when it does, to provide a ready
source of remedy to those so abused and harassed.</p><p><a name="06052329001695">I referred earlier to Nicholas
Blake QC, who undertook the inquiry into the deaths at Deepcut. Like
him, I do not believe that the current proposals in the Bill go far
enough to ensure independent supervision and review of the discipline
and complaints system. Like him, I believe that there is</p><a name="06052329001839"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a danger that an historic
opportunity will be lost for the Armed Forces to obtain independent
assistance to achieve the goals they have set themselves to ensure the
welfare of trainees and soldiers is effectively
addressed.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001696">I, too,
believe that the</p><a name="06052329001840"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;establishment of the office of a
&#145;Commissioner of Military Complaints&#146; is now an essential
step in improving confidence, transparency and
justice&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001697">Regrettably, we did not have an
opportunity to examine in detail new clause 4. When my hon. Friend the
Minister considers the detail of the 34 recommendations that Nicholas
Blake put forward, I urge him to consider especially his recommendation
for an independent armed forces ombudsman&#151;someone who is
genuinely independent and has power to investigate
complaints.</p><p><a name="06052329001698"><b><a name="06052329003168">Jim
Dobbin (Heywood and Middleton) (Lab/Co-op):</b> Is my hon.
Friend aware that my constituent, Norma Langford, whose son, Corporal
Ian Holt, died in Belize on non-combat duty in 1991, would be thrilled
were such an independent inspectorate set up? At present, such
investigations are usually left to the special investigation branch of
the military police. She would like the whole system to be open and
transparent.</p><p><a name="06052329001699"><b><a name="06052329003169">Mrs.

of the most important things that I and others members of that group do
is to meet families who have lost their loved ones. I am sure that Mrs.
Langford would be pleased were such an armed forces commissioner and
ombudsman set up.</p><p><a name="06052329001700">I
also advise my hon. Friend the Minister that Nicholas Blake says in his
report that he has informally discussed the possible role of such a
commissioner with commanding officers and others, and has understood
that there is no objection in principle or practice to such independent
oversight of the system, and nor is there concern that it will
undermine military discipline. In further debate on this excellent
Bill, I urge my hon. Friend to make it even better than it already is
by introducing exactly such a system of independent
oversight.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001877">9.54

McCarthy-Fry: </b>I welcome the Minister to his new role. I
think that, given his performance today, he will be a formidable
addition to the defence team. I also welcome the process by which the
Bill was examined. We went through reams of written evidence in the
Select Committee, and also had an opportunity to examine witnesses. For
me, however, one of the most important parts of the process was the
Committee&#146;s 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1292</b><br>visit to Cyprus, Oman and Iraq, where we were able to speak to the guys
and girls on the ground who would be influenced by and subject to the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06052329001702">We ask our armed
forces to operate in dangerous places and we ask them to put their
lives at risk, so it is obvious that they must obey orders from their
commanding officers. It emerged clearly today that we cannot allow
people to operate like maverick loners. I think that the best way to
prevent that is to foster team work, and to make a joint commitment to
a common goal. Team work is much more likely to be generated by trust,
transparency and openness than by operation as a secret closed
group.</p><p><a name="06052329001703">Two issues
became very clear to me as we debated the Bill. One was the removal of
the power of the commanding officer to discuss a case, which has been
much debated this evening. It was also discussed extensively with
serving personnel during our visits. I do not accept that it damages
the chain of command; I think that it enhances the reputation of our
armed services. It represents a willingness not just to ensure that
serious cases are investigated properly but to ensure that they are
seen to be investigated properly, so that our armed services are held

but on the world
stage.</p><p><a name="06052329001704">The second
issue is the duty of care and redress of complaints, mentioned by my
hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs.
Humble). We want our young people to choose the armed services as a
valued career path where their capabilities will be stretched and their
mettle will be tested, but where there is also a duty of care and an
open and transparent redress procedure.</p><p><a name="06052329001705">I represent a city with a long
and proud history of its sons and daughters going to sea to defend our
shores in armed service. I have a vested interest in ensuring the
safety and security of my constituency, which in the past has been a
military target, and in ensuring that my country is protected by an
effective and professional armed service. However, I also have an
interest in ensuring that individual serving soldiers, sailors and
airmen are protected by a duty of care, and that potential
recruits are not deterred by the perception of a bullying culture or
complaints hidden under the
carpet.</p><p><a name="06052329001706">Despite the
omission of an independent commissioner, which I hope will be discussed
again when the Bill goes to another place, I believe that the Bill
brings service discipline up to date. It reflects the modern
world&#151;the very different threats that face us and our armed
services and the highly visible theatre in which they now operate, with
&#147;embedded&#148; journalists and images posted on websites and

Vaz (Leicester, East) (Lab):</b> I want to thank you, Mr.
Speaker, for allowing me the opportunity to discuss detention without
trial at Guantanamo Bay. I am pleased to see the Minister for the
Middle East, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells), on
the Front Bench tonight, and I am glad that so many other Members of
the House have taken such a strong interest in this subject. I am
particularly pleased to see my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr.
Khan) here, and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney,
North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) hopes to join us later.</p><p><a name="06052329001723">This is the fourth such debate
to be held in the four years since the detention facility was
established in early 2002, and the first since the release of the
remaining British citizens a year ago. It takes place at an appropriate
time: on the back of recent comments made by my right hon. and learned
Friend the Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney-General, and of the publication
last Friday&#151;just in time for this debate&#151;of the United
Nations convention against torture&#146;s critical report on
Guantanamo.</p><p><a name="06052329001724">Also on
Friday, I was sorry to hear of reports by the BBC and other news
agencies that four detainees attempted to commit suicide, and that the
efforts of prison guards to stop those attempts were met by violent
resistance from other inmates. Sadly, it now appears that prolonged
exposure to the conditions within the facility have caused the inmates
to look to suicide as the only alternative. With that in mind, the
recent speech of the Attorney-General deserves even greater
consideration.</p><p><a name="06052329001725">On 10
May, the Attorney-General used a speech to the Royal United Services
Institute to make clear his opposition to the continued detention
without fair trial of those imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay. Lord
Goldsmith stated that the camp should be closed</p><a name="06052329001850"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as a matter of
principle&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001726">Although he
made it clear that, on this issue, he was speaking in a personal
capacity, as one of this country&#146;s foremost and most respected
legal experts&#151;and, indeed, as the Government&#146;s chief
legal adviser&#151;his speech&#146;s significance cannot be
underestimated. We all know of his intellectual prowess and
determination. When he spoke, he meant what he said.</p><p><a name="06052329001727">The Attorney-General&#146;s
opinion is the most recent development concerning this subject. On 17
February, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and for Wales, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), said that he would
like to see the camp at Guantanamo Bay closed. Our Prime Minister, who
has fostered an excellent relationship with the United States, has gone
so far as to call the detention centre an
&#147;anomaly&#148;&#151;a view that he repeated at Question Time
last week. Those three statements clearly reveal that the Government
have not yet developed a coherent position on how the current situation
should be resolved. Now is an excellent time for them to make such a
statement.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1296</b><br><p><a name="06052329001728">Only two weeks ago, President
Bush, during a visit to the United States by Chancellor Angela Merkel,
stated his desire to end detention at Guantanamo and to get the
detainees into court. As everyone appears concerned, why is Guantanamo
still open? The opinion of such figures clearly shows that the
arguments about what has become known as Camp X-Ray are progressing in
the same direction. Guantanamo cannot continue. Detention without trial
at Guantanamo is not a necessary part of the global fight against
extremism and fundamentalism&#151;also known as the war against
terrorism&#151;rather, it is counter-productive to the efforts of the
international community.</p><p><a name="06052329001729">The tragic events of 11
September clearly demonstrated how vulnerable open and democratic
societies are to the threat of organised terrorist networks. The
subsequent military campaign in Afghanistan&#151;fully supported by
this Government, NATO and the United Nations&#151;resulted in
individuals suspected of belonging to the al-Qaeda network being
captured by the American military forces. More than 600 of these
alleged terrorists have been received in the detention facility since
2002. Although some 270 have since been released without charge, almost
500 still remain. These include 220 from Afghanistan, 119 from Saudi
Arabia, 94 from Yemen, 57 from Pakistan and smaller numbers of men from
35 different countries. Although all eight British citizens have been
released, there remain another eight men who claim to have long-term
British residency
permits.</p><p><a name="06052329001730">I consider
the United States to be a great friend and ally of this country, not
merely through historical ties or present circumstances, but because of
the very real values and interests that our countries share. As the
Attorney-General remarked, the US is a great beacon of freedom, liberty
and justice. That is the basis on which the strongest arguments can be
made against the detention camp in its present form. Every day that
those men are made to wait to face justice is a day that degrades the
reputation of the US.</p><p><a name="06052329001731">That reputation for fairness
and equal treatment, whatever one&#146;s race, religion or ethnicity,
is one of the greatest tools we have in the battle for the hearts and
minds of millions across the world and in the face of propaganda by
such organisations as al-Qaeda. In that context, the existence of
Guantanamo Bay damages the efforts of the American and British
Governments to isolate the terrorists and prevent them from recruiting
further converts to their cause. It helps extremists to fuel
perceptions that the US, and the west in general, targets Muslims and
denies them their human
rights.</p><p><a name="06052329001732">The agenda of
such extremist groups are obvious and can be discounted. What cannot be
ignored is the list of independent and respected Governments and
non-governmental organisations that have made clear their opposition to
the camp&#146;s existence. The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, has
called for the camp&#146;s closure. Organisations such as Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch have been consistent in their
condemnation. Amnesty is concerned at news of hunger strikes and
suicide attempts by inmates and has called Guantanamo &#147;a moral
disgrace&#148;, an &#147;emotional abyss&#148; for those affected
and &#147;a legal black hole&#148;.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1297</b><br><p><a name="06052329001733">As I said earlier, it can be
seen from the number of hon. Members in their places, including my hon.
Friends the Members for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson), for
Tooting, for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry), for
Hackney, North and Stoke Newington and for Brent, South (Ms Butler),
that this issue is of real concern. The legal arguments surrounding
Guantanamo have become complex and polarised, with no consensus
existing. None the less, it is a popular view, at least outside the US,
that the basis for the detention camp rests on shaky legal
foundations.</p><p><a name="06052329001734">The
right to fair trial without prolonged detention is a fundamental and
well-established tenet of international law, which is explicit in
articles 10 and 11 of the universal declaration of human rights and
articles 14, 15 and 16 of the international covenant on civil and
political rights. If it is argued that the laws of war apply, the
Geneva convention has strict criteria governing the treatment that
prisoners of war should
receive.</p><p><a name="06052329001735">The US
Government argue that those prisoners are not in legal limbo but,
pending a decision by the US Supreme Court, are nearing the time at
which they will face trial before the military commission. Within the
judicial process, it is claimed, the accused will have two
opportunities to appeal to a fully civilian federal appeals court.
However, that is not a reason to believe that the transportation of
hundreds of individuals thousands of miles from their homelands and
families and their imprisonment for years before trial is in any way
justifiable.</p><p><a name="06052329001736">Unfortunately, whatever the
legal basis for the detention, the damage has been done. It is now a
popular view in this country and other countries that the US Government
have operated outside international law, with a clear disregard for the
concerns of the international community and its closest
friends.</p><p><a name="06052329001737">In a series
of statements from the State Department and the Department of Defence,
the US has condemned the use of torture or inhumane techniques and
pledged to prosecute any citizen found to have committed such acts.
However, last week the United Nations committee against torture
published its report on the detention policies of the US and judged
them according to the convention against torture that the US ratified
in 1994. The report concluded that the conditions for prisoners at
Guantanamo Bay constituted torture and called for the camp to be closed
as soon as
possible.</p><p><a name="06052329001738">Allegations
of torture must be taken seriously. The right not to face torture or
inhumane or degrading treatment is an absolute right. After the
appalling images of torture at committed by soldiers at Abu Ghraib
prison in Iraq, it is essential that the United States and our
Government make every possible effort to make it clear that any such
abuse is unacceptable and should not take place. Unfortunately, in the
case of Guantanamo, the closed nature of the camp, where even UN
officials were prevented from meeting detainees without first signing a
confidentiality agreement, has ensured that serious allegations about
treatment proliferate.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1298</b><br><p><a name="06052329001739">What we know comes from the
American Army&#146;s Schmidt report, which details techniques also
known as &#147;torture lite&#148;. Many of sections of the Schmidt
report are still censored, but it details techniques such as 18 to
20-hours a day questioning for 48 in 54 days, blasting prisoners with
strobe lights and ear-splitting rock music, the use of snarling dogs,
threatening to hurt detainees&#146; families and sexual humiliation.
On that basis, I propose that a delegation of British parliamentarians
be allowed to visit the detention complex in Guantanamo to assess the
treatment of detainees. I should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
support for such a visit. If that is not possible, he should consider
arranging a visit by our excellent Attorney-General so that he can
assess the conditions of the detainees, as he has made his interest in
the matter clear.</p><p><a name="06052329001740">Sir
Winston Churchill noted that America always does the right thing after
exhausting every possible alternative. In the case of Guantanamo, our
ally is running out of alternatives and I am sure that, in the fullness
of time, Washington will indeed do the right thing. I call on the
Minister and his Department to help to ensure that that happens sooner
rather than later. In particular, will the Minister clarify his
position about the continued imprisonment of eight individuals who
claim to hold British residency?</p><p><a name="06052329001741">On Thursday 5 May,
representatives of two of those men lost a bid at the High Court to
force the Foreign Secretary to intervene on their behalf. A Foreign
Office spokesman said that the FCO was unable to provide consular
assistance to</p><a name="06052329001851"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;those who
are not British
citizens&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06052329001742">which
is a very strict interpretation of the Foreign Office remit. British
diplomatic influence is not solely limited to the protection of British
citizens; it also applies to British interests, which include upholding
the principle of inalienable human rights. For example, Abdul Rahman is
an Afghanistani who, on conversion to Christianity, was threatened with
the death penalty. At the time, the Minister was on the record as
deeply troubled by the case and he sought urgent clarification from the
Afghani authorities. I commend him for having done so. Mr. Rahman was
not British; indeed, he was on the other side of the world at the time.
Surely, that is a common precedent whereby the Government can represent
our concerns about the men with British residency held at Guantanamo.
Will the Minister make such
representations?</p><a name="06052329001776"><p>The
Prime Minister will be meeting President Bush later this week. I hope
that he will use that visit to state the Government&#146;s concerns
about the situation in Guantanamo Bay. Will the Minister confirm that
that will happen?</p><p><a name="06052329001743">I also ask the Minister whether
he would consider positioning the UK in the role of co-ordinator for
those countries that still have detainees imprisoned at Guantanamo. The
UK&#146;s relationship with the United States and its experience of
having a number of citizens detained at that facility for years would
allow the Foreign Office to operate in that much-needed capacity.
However, such measures would be only half a solution. The problem with
Guantanamo Bay is the existence of the detention facility, the way that
it operates and the image that it presents to the world. It runs
counter to the fundamental values that we hold dear and wish to 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1299</b><br>protect: the right to fair trail, the right not to be tortured or
treated inhumanely and the belief in the strength of openness,
transparency and accountability. I call on the Minister to support the
view of the Attorney-General&#151;Guantanamo Bay must close, and it
must close
now.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052329001879">10.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06052329001744"><b><a name="06052329003174">The
Minister for the Middle East (Dr. Kim Howells):</b> I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)
on securing the debate, and I welcome the opportunity to debate these
issues today. First, I want to reiterate the Government&#146;s
position on Guantanamo. We have made it clear that we regard the
circumstances under which detainees continue to be held at Guantanamo
Bay as unacceptable. The US Government know our views. As my right hon.
Friend the Prime Minister has said, as recently as four days ago, it
would be better if Guantanamo were
closed.</p><p><a name="06052329001745">We continue to
raise these concerns in our regular discussions on detainee-related
issues with the US Government. We seek to ensure that the handling of
detainees is consistent with the British Government&#146;s other
objectives, including preventing further terrorist attacks, undermining
the work of those who recruit terrorists and upholding respect for
human rights and the rule of law. As we do so, let us reflect on the
circumstances that led to Guantanamo
Bay.</p><p><a name="06052329001746"><b><a name="06052329003175">Ms
Diane Abbott (Hackney, North and Stoke Newington) (Lab):</b>
Will my hon. Friend give
way?</p><p><a name="06052329001747"><b><a name="06052329003176">Dr.
Howells:</b> No, I am afraid not. If my hon. Friend will allow
me, I have not much time in which to answer a very big
contribution.</p><p><a name="06052329001748">As my
hon. Friend has reminded us, almost 3,000 people were killed during the
terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001. As the Foreign Secretary told
the Foreign Affairs Committee on 15 March, if September 11 had happened
in this country rather than the United States, it would have changed
our politics and security parameters just as it has changed the
Americans.</p><p><a name="06052329001749">It is also
important to recognise the dilemma faced by the US Government in
considering Guantanamo&#146;s future&#151;how to balance collective
security and respect individual&#146;s human rights at the same time.
More than 270 detainees have been moved from Guantanamo back to their
home countries or their country of origin. Many more are being
considered for the same, under arrangements designed to ensure that
they will be treated humanely on their return. That is not an easy
process; it will take
time.</p><p><a name="06052329001750">We expect the
United States to be an example of fairness and justice, where civil
liberties and human rights are protected and cherished. Sadly, they are
not protected and cherished in some countries. Indeed, there are places
where they hardly exist at all. The question is what happens to those
who are left. One obvious answer&#151;we have heard from some
quarters&#151;would be to release all the detainees at Guantanamo. I
fear that that would not be entirely wise. It would hardly serve not
only the US Government&#146;s own citizens but everyone else in the
world if the Americans were suddenly to release people who could return
to terrorism, as some of those already released have.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1300</b><br><p><a name="06052329001751">My hon. Friend question raises a
number of detailed issues that I am happy to try and address this
evening. First, on the legal aspects of indefinite detention, it is
useful to understand the US Government&#146;s legal position, even if
one does not necessarily agree with it. The US Government believe that
they are in a continuing state of at least potentially worldwide armed
conflict with al Qaeda&#151;that is, at war. They believe therefore
that the laws of armed conflict apply to those whom they detain. The US
Government&#146;s view is that, under the laws of armed conflict,
they are entitled to detain people until that war is over, as they did,
for example, during world war two, when again no one knew how long the
conflict would
last.</p><p><a name="06052329001752">The British
Government&#146;s view is that, whatever the status of the so-called
global war on terror, the detainees at Guantanamo are entitled to
humane treatment and, if prosecuted, to a fair trial. We have made that
clear to the United States authorities. The United States is well aware
of the UK&#146;s opposition to the death penalty under all
circumstances. In private diplomatic discussions, at both ministerial
and official levels, the UK has made its views known to the US
Government and has made representations to them about the circumstances
in which, and conditions under which, detainees are held at
Guantanamo.</p><p><a name="06052329001753">After a
lengthy series of discussions with the US, which were led for the
Government by the Attorney-General, in 2004 the Government concluded
that the military commissions process would not provide sufficient
guarantees of a fair trial according to international standards. That
eventually led to the release and return of the British detainees at
Guantanamo. I am sure that hon. Members will be aware that the majority
of the military commission&#146;s proceedings have been stayed,
pending a US Supreme Court decision in June on the right of the
detainees to challenge the legality of their
detention.</p><p><a name="06052329001754">My hon.
Friend raised the question of torture and other allegations of abuse at
Guantanamo. Let me make our position on torture absolutely clear. The
United Kingdom condemns unreservedly the use of torture and works hard
with its international partners to eradicate that abhorrent practice.
We abide by our commitments under international law, including the UN
convention against torture and the European convention on human rights,
and we expect all other countries to comply with their international
obligations. We are active in pressing them to deliver on those human
rights
commitments.</p><p><a name="06052329001755">The US
Government have given repeated assurances on this matter and on the
treatment of detainees. Those assurances include the detailed public
statement made by the US Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, on 5
December 2005, which confirmed that the US respects the rules of
international law, including the UN convention on torture. Dr. Rice
stated that the US does not authorise or condone the torture of
detainees, and that torture and conspiracy to commit torture are crimes
under US law wherever they may occur in the world. In addition, the US
Detainee Treatment Act, which was enacted on 30 December 2005, provides
that no individual in the custody or under the physical control of the
US Government, regardless of nationality, shall be subject to cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. That legislation 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1301</b><br>makes a matter of statute what President Bush has made clear was already
US Government policy.</p><p><a name="06052329001756">My hon. Friend has reminded the
House of a report submitted on 15 February by five holders of mandates
of special procedures of the UN Commission on Human Rights. A number of
serious criticisms about the reported situation of detainees in
Guantanamo Bay were made in that report. In their formal reply on 10
March, the US Government strongly objected to the report both in terms
of process and of substance, and argued that factual and legal
assertions in it were inaccurate and flawed. It is clearly important
that the US Government and the UN continue to engage on those
issues.</p><p><a name="06052329001757">My hon. Friend
listed some of the techniques allegedly used at Guantanamo. Those
allegations have surfaced previously in relation to UK nationals. I
want to make it clear that, as far as allegations of abuse made by UK
nationals previously held at Guantanamo are concerned, we take their
allegations of mistreatment very seriously. In respect of the British
detainees, we raised concerns about issues including isolation, lack of
access to daylight, lack of exercise and delays with mail. We pursued
those concerns with the US authorities and secured a number of
improvements in the physical conditions of the detention of the
detainees, as well as improvements to the exercise regime and mail
service.</p><p><a name="06052329001758">The nine
visits made by Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials to check on
the British detainees&#146; welfare showed us that, overall, the
detainees appeared in sound physical health. The families of the
detainees were given read-outs of the visits and statements were made
to Parliament. Our visits found that medical facilities at Guantanamo
were of a high standard. On each of the nine visits, we gave the
British detainees the opportunity to express concerns about their
treatment. None of them alleged to us that they were systematically
mistreated at
Guantanamo.</p><p><a name="06052329001759">Over the
past few months, several right hon. and hon. Members have raised the
circumstances of the former UK residents who are detained in
Guantanamo. It is the longstanding policy of the UK Government not to
offer consular assistance to non-British nationals, except in cases in
which a specific agreement to do so exists with another state. My hon.
Friend spoke of exceptions to that rule, such as the case of Abdul
Rahman, the Christian convert in Afghanistan who faced the
threat&#151;it was a remote possibility&#151;of the death
penalty.</p><p><a name="06052329001760">Hon. Members
will no doubt be aware of the recent judicial review of the former
Foreign Secretary&#146;s decision not to make formal representations
to the United States Government for the release and return to the UK of
three of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay who were formerly
resident in the UK. The court held that there was no duty on the
Foreign Secretary in domestic or international law to make the formal
request sought by the claimants. The claimants have been granted leave
to appeal, so it would not be appropriate for me to say any more about
the case at the moment.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1302</b><br><p><a name="06052329001761">The court also recognised that
the Government have made informal representations on humanitarian
grounds to the US Government in respect of the detainee claimants. In
2005, my predecessor, Baroness Symons, agreed exceptionally to meet the
families and representatives of those detainees who we knew were
formerly resident in the UK, but were not British nationals, on a
humanitarian basis. We passed on the concerns expressed to us by the
families to the US
authorities.</p><p><a name="06052329001762">I fully
agree with my hon. Friend that there needs to be greater understanding
of how Guantanamo operates. A visit by, say, the Foreign Affairs
Committee would clearly help to achieve that. I understand that the
Committee is already in touch with the US Administration about visiting
the detention facility at Guantanamo
Bay.</p><p><a name="06052329001763">As I have said,
it is important that we never forget the context in which Guantanamo
came about: the slaughter of 3,000 innocent people on 11 September.
That was followed by atrocities in Madrid, Bali, Sharm el Sheikh,
Amman, Istanbul, Riyadh and Moscow, and then last summer by the attacks
on the London underground. The intent is clear. In Iraq and
Afghanistan, the terrorists want to destroy new-found freedom and
democracy and to kill people. I was in Baghdad when al-Zarqawi&#146;s
suicide bombers murders hundreds of innocent Shi&#146;a Iraqis in
just a couple of bloody days. Understandably, I suppose, the fate of
those poor people has not been the subject of intense legal and human
rights scrutiny in the way in which the detaining of terrorist suspects
at Guantanamo has. We do not expect civilised behaviour from al-Qaeda
henchmen, but we should not forget that those people had human rights,
too. It is right that Britain should stand firm with our friends and
allies against such
evil.</p><p><a name="06052329001764">All of us who
care for the cause of civil liberties and human rights should pause and
recall that those who were so brutally murdered in London on 7 July and
in many other atrocities had human rights. Self-appointed executioners
took those rights away from them, so we will continue to pursue those
who commit acts of terrorism. At the same time, we shall maintain
absolutely our commitment to civil liberties and human
rights.</p><p><a name="06052329001765"><b><a name="06052329003177">Emily
