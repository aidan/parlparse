 The Secretary of State will know that demand for e-books is growing. Penguin made as much on e-books in the first two months of this year as it did in the whole of 2007.

 The hon. Gentleman raises an important question. New technology, of which e-books are a good example, can help us to enjoy music, literature and culture more freely, and that is to be celebrated. However, there is a genuine issue to do with the illegal sharing and downloading of material to which he alludes. It is already causing serious damage to our creative industries, particularly the music industry. Our first preference is for rights holders and internet service providers to reach voluntary agreements about access to content. I must say that I am disheartened by recent comments from within the ISP community to suggest that providers do not have any responsibility for illegal downloading. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that jointly with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, we will shortly publish a document that includes options for legislation if voluntary agreements cannot be secured.</p>

I am its vice-chairman, although I have not yet published any memoirs or diaries, and have no money that results from such publications in the bank account. Will he agree to meet members of the all-party group to discuss how we can be fair to the writers, creative artists and journalists of Britain, and get them all to vote Labour?</p>

 I certainly accept my right hon. Friend&#146;s invitation, and I look forward to receiving his recipe for our return to popularity when I meet him. I repeat that these are incredibly urgent questions, not just for writers but for creators of all kinds in our society. We have to come up with ways to ensure that the creative process is respected and valued in the online world. If we cannot come up with solutions, we face the risk of damage to sectors in which Britain has traditionally been strong for many, many years. We all need to  apply our minds to the issue with some urgency, and come up with solutions that are fair to industry and, crucially, to the creators of the high-quality content that people want.</p>

 I very much welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s comments about the importance of copyright, and particularly his commitment to putting pressure on the ISPs to address the issue of illegal file-sharing. When he comes to look at the proposed copyright exception for format shifting, will he accept that the ways in which consumers enjoy music and video are different, so the proposals might be appropriate for the music industry, but not necessarily for the video industry? Will he listen carefully to the video industry&#146;s representations on that point?</p>

 I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s opening remarks, and I thank him for his general approach on the issue; I think that we can strike a lot of common ground. I have read the report that his Committee&#151;the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport&#151;produced on the subject, and it raises incredibly important points. He is right to say that the internet has affected creative industries in different ways. Music has been the first in line to be affected; other industries have had more time, presumably because their files are larger, so it is harder to get the same traffic in file-sharing. I will apply a careful mind to the questions. We want to ensure that we have proportionate systems in place in all sectors. Coming up with solutions that protect our creative industries is absolutely at the top of my in-tray. If we do not do that, we risk doing serious damage to the industries in the short term, which will damage the country in the long term.</p>

 There is a balance to be struck, is there not? It is a good thing that people can freely access information and the work of writers, but we must get the balance right. I urge them to read the Gowers review of intellectual property, which the Government commissioned and on which we have been consulting. The answer is always in voluntary solutions. All of us would prefer voluntary solutions that are proportionate and balanced, but I say again, in line with recommendation 39 of the Gowers review, that if such solutions fail to emerge, we will legislate. As a sign of our intent, we will shortly publish a consultation document containing some of those options.</p>

 Has the Secretary of State had time to consider the proposal from Commissioner McCreevy to end the historic discrimination against musicians and increase term copyright for sound recordings from 50 to 95 years? Is he prepared to back that enthusiastically and do the right thing for UK musicians and the UK music industry, to end the ludicrous situation where musicians lose payments in their old age?</p>

 I still have an open mind on the matter. The hon. Gentleman will know that the Gowers review did not back the extension in the same way as Commissioner McCreevy has done. I think I am right in saying that he is due to issue his detailed proposals in the summer. I will examine those proposals closely and take a view about whether it is in the interests of the music industry to take them forward. As I said, there is a balance to be struck between protecting the creative process and rewarding performers as well as composers, and creating a disincentive for any industry to invest in new and emerging talent, which none of us would want. That balance always needs to be struck.</p>

 I do not know whether the Secretary of State, like our right hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane), a marvellous journalist in his own right, saw <i> The Guardian</i> last Thursday, where Stephen Fry wrote that the BBC executives were naive in believing they could control the distribution of programmes online via their iPlayer service. I am sure the Secretary of State is aware that the BBC seems to be throwing out valuable content free of charge, which shows a naivet&#233; about how the internet works.

 I have not had a chance to read the article, but I will look it up, following my hon. Friend&#146;s question. I would issue a note of caution. The iPlayer is proving incredibly popular extremely quickly. We have all paid for the content as licence fee payers, and there is a strong argument that we should be able to access it at our own convenience. I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s point that it could undermine public service broadcasting in the long term if we allow people to access that content through other formats and they end up not paying a licence fee, but the BBC is to be congratulated on introducing a service that is already proving highly popular.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Minister of State is due to meet the industry shortly to discuss the matter further. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. We will consider any evidence that is produced, but in line with the general theme that I have adopted in response to all the previous questions, we see it as a top priority of the Department to protect the creative process and ensure that the people who create the content that we all want to see are properly rewarded for that work.</p>

However, our market share in terms of visitors and spend has fallen consistently over the past 10 years. I know that under this Labour Government people are desperate to leave the country, even if it is just for a two-week holiday, but what is the Minister going to do to arrest that decline?</p>

 First, I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is going to tell his family or his constituents&#146; families that they should not take holidays abroad. That sounds a bit odd. In a free society, people will choose to take holidays, particularly with cheaper air fares and greater wealth and prosperity. I think that what the future holds for what is a very strong tourism industry lies in domestic tourism&#151;where we spend our holidays. Eighty per cent. of the money earned through the tourism industry comes from domestic tourism. With increasing prosperity, it may be that we take a couple of breaks a year. We are aiming to get more and more people to take some, if not all of their breaks in many of the wonderful resorts and locations that we have in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency and across the whole of England. Tourism has grown year on year. The most recent figures that I have available indicate that inbound tourism grew by 5 per cent. in terms of numbers and 6 per cent. in terms of income. That shows that we are being successful.</p>

 We have a great product in the United Kingdom, particularly with the constant sunshine that we enjoy here&#151;over the past couple of days, at least. Part of the problem, though, is that the first thing that people see when they come into this country from abroad and when they leave is the airport. In too many cases, they spend more time at Heathrow, for instance, than they would at any visitor attraction, so that they should send their postcards from the airport and take a photograph of their luggage as an enduring memory of what it used to look like. What can the Minister do to ensure that when people visit the UK they can come through Heathrow without all the hassles that have befallen them recently?</p>

 I am pleased to hear that the Minister is speaking to the British Amusement Catering Trade Association later this afternoon. According to a survey that it recently conducted, amusement arcades have experienced an overall decline in revenue of 21 per cent. since the Gambling Act 2005 was implemented. The Minister has already acknowledged that there is a serious problem in the industry. Would he address the problem by increasing the number of class B3 machines permitted in amusement arcades, and by restoring the &#163;2 stake for such machines?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that issue; it is a matter of concern to a number of people. The Government feel that it is important that we get things right. B3 machines are a hard form of gambling and on the numbers, we have to get the balance completely right and take the right decisions. We have listened to evidence from BACTA, the Bingo Association and a number of other gaming bodies who are having difficulties. I understand the urgency and immediacy of the problem, but I want to ensure that we get the right solution.</p>

 I do not think that it was the intention of the then Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn), to damage the seaside industry when he took the Bill through Committee, but the fact is that the seaside amusement arcade is an integral part of the wet-weather offer that many seaside resorts, such as Margate and Herne Bay in my constituency, need. Amusement arcades are shutting as we speak. The industries that supply them, such as two manufacturing industries in Thanet&#151;an area of high unemployment&#151;are under severe threat.

 I hope to make decisions reasonably soon&#151;<i> [Laughter.]</i> Or, indeed, very soon. The hon. Gentleman has highlighted an issue, and there is some confusion that we need to clear up. We need to distinguish between seaside arcades that offer a lower risk of gambling and the adult gaming centres that are usually on the high street.

The Arts Council reconsidered and changed its view in the light of those representations, and it has now commissioned a review of the process and will be reflecting on that.

 I say to my hon. Friend that I know that this issue raises strong feelings; as the House knows, there is currently a private Member&#146;s Bill on the subject. In January, new restrictions on the advertising to children of foods high in salt, sugar and fat were brought in. It is my position, and it makes sense, to take some time to evaluate the success of those restrictions before considering going further. Some evidence is already emerging that they are indeed having an effect.</p>

Friend that tackling obesity is obviously a complicated issue and there is no one simple answer to it. Speaking as someone with three young children, I know that it is important to say that these days children get their messages from a huge array of sources, so the idea that simply restricting or controlling advertising on television will solve the problem fails to grapple with the real issues. It is also important to say that children&#146;s programming generally is under pressure, yet that is an area of TV where young people can get good responsible messages. My hon. Friend needs to consider the impact on children&#146;s programming of any further restrictions on television advertising.</p>

 The Minister for Sport will know that athletes with a learning disability have been unable to compete in the Paralympics since the Sydney games in 2000. The International Paralympic Committee will consider the matter again this autumn. One issue raised by Mencap, among others, is that along with the inability to compete, some of those athletes have lost their funding for training equipment. Will the Minister ensure that if the decision goes the right way this autumn, that funding for training and equipment is reinstated to those athletes as soon as possible so that they have the best chance to compete in the Olympics and Paralympics to be held in London in 2012?</p>

I take the view that there is more we can do, so I am working with the governing bodies in sport and the promoters of major music and others. For some events, we take the principle that access should be enshrined in legislation for broadcasting purposes, but I personally believe that we should have a stronger system of ticket allocation around sporting events, particularly when they are of national significance. I believe that with the new technology that is available, we can put more security into ticketing arrangements and ensure that more tickets get into the hands of the real fans. I hope that the hon.

 My hon.

In the context of the consideration of draft legislation by the departmental Select Committee, I hope that a debate will take place on whether other subsidiary criteria can be considered, particularly for recently constructed buildings, before a recommendation is made to the Department. Economic regeneration would be one such criterion.</p>

 In a recent article in the <i> Manchester Evening News</i>, Lord Coe said he regretted that London&#146;s sporting facilities lagged 30 years behind those of the great northern cities.

 There are two issues.

Hosting the Commonwealth games was a great driver of sport regeneration for Manchester and the north-west. The hon. Gentleman has already heard this afternoon about the remarkable achievements of the school sport programme, which is transforming sport for young people in schools. It will continue to build an element of the great legacy towards 2012 in ensuring that a generation of young people&#146;s lives are transformed through sport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80512-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0805122000159">When Louise Brown, the world&#146;s first test-tube baby, was born in England 30 years ago, her birth heralded a major breakthrough in fertility research, pioneered by British scientists. The advent of in vitro fertilisation&#151;the creation of embryos in a laboratory&#151;also raised important ethical questions that demanded sensitive and lengthy consideration. In 1982, Baroness Warnock was asked by the Government to chair an inquiry to consider some of these questions. In 1984, the report of her Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology was published. After extensive consultation and debate, this led to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80512-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0805122000160">That landmark legislation laid down legal limits on the use of embryos, and ensured that all IVF treatment and research involving embryos was properly licensed by a body independent of both Government and scientists. Thus the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority was created, the first such authority anywhere in the world. It has attracted international respect and admiration, not just for the important work it does but for the way in which that work is carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80512-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0805122000161">I believe that the 1990 Act and the process that led to it showed Parliament at its best. Baroness Warnock stated at the time:</p>
<a name="80512-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="0805122000307"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are conscious of an increasing sense of urgency that controls should be introduced where none exist, and that the law should be brought up to date so that society may be protected from its real and very proper fear of a rudderless voyage into unknown and threatening seas.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80512-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0805122000162">Parliament&#146;s objective has always been to support scientific advances that benefit patients and their families, through a clear legal, moral and ethical framework that provides proper controls and safeguards and reflects the concerns that many people have about research involving stem cells and embryology.</p>

 As the Minister who in 1997 authorised the funding of the research that led to the cloning of Dolly the sheep and, almost the same day that that was announced, set up the human genetics advisory board, may I say to the Secretary of State that what he is proposing in this Bill on stem cell research is absolutely right? The fact that Professor Wilmut, who was involved in the Roslin Institute at the time of Dolly the sheep, is now saying we can move on to adult stem cell research does not mean that he or someone else does not need to continue to conduct embryo research so that we can look for a better quality of life for people suffering from terrible wasting diseases.</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend for that intervention, which I believe is helpful: there was an element of surprise in my voice then! It is important to hold the debate on some of the most sensitive issues on the Floor of the House rather than in the Committee corridor, so that all Members can participate. That is consistent with the approach taken when the 1990 Act was introduced, when a great deal of effort was made to ensure that the argument was not a partisan one and that people who had deeply held views and beliefs, both ethical and religious, had the chance to contribute.</p>

 The Secretary of State says that he likes the way in which the 1990 Act was handled; large parts of that Bill were taken on the Floor of the House at the Committee stage. The difference on that occasion was that every Member of the House was given a free vote on all issues that they perceived to be ethical, at any stage. Ministers were included in that arrangement. They made it clear in their speeches both when they were speaking on behalf of the Government and when they were giving their own ethical judgments, and Ministers were divided on some Divisions because their ethical judgments varied.

That is based on the fact that Members who have a concern about some of the more difficult issues will get the chance to vote on them, because, as my right hon.

Over the last 18 years, methods that are not explicitly governed by the 1990 Act, such as cell nuclear replacement, where the nucleus of an egg is removed and replaced with the nucleus of another cell, and parthenogenesis, where an egg is stimulated either electrically or chemically to develop into an embryo, have been developed. Similarly, there is no explicit provision for the regulation of the use of admixed embryos, which combine human and animal genetic  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80512-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0805122000190">Scientists want to create admixed embryos principally because of a shortage of human eggs for stem cell research. The process of creating the admixed embryo most commonly used to grow stem cells involves taking an animal egg and replacing the nucleus with the cell nucleus from a human skin cell. The resultant embryo is 99.9 per cent. human. We know of no scientist anywhere in the world who wishes to implant such embryos in a woman or an animal, but even if the desire existed, the legal authority would not. Such actions will remain a criminal offence under international law.</p>

It will retain the restrictions imposed by the 1990 Act&#151;that the maximum permitted period of development for all research embryos is 14 days. In practice, no research embryos have been developed as far as that maximum. This is not the first development that has combined human and animal material. If scientists in the UK had not been able to fuse human and animal cells in the &#146;60s and &#146;70s, developments such as the human genome project would not be possible and drugs such as Herceptin would not have been created. The Government believe that it is important to bring this new and exciting scientific development within the strict legal and ethical framework that the Bill provides.</p>

Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) and I said that Conservative Members would have a free vote throughout the passage of the Bill. It is why the Government could and should have done exactly the same. Unfortunately, back in 2006 the Government imposed a whip on regulations relating to the anonymity of sperm and egg donation, and they imposed a whip on Labour peers during the passage of this Bill. It has only been as they have relented under pressure from their own Members, from us and from the media that they have consented to a partial free vote on certain aspects of the Bill. I entirely share the view of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) that if Members have ethical considerations that, in their view, prevail over any other considerations in a Bill, they should be in a position to exercise their conscience and judgment, including on Third Reading.</p>

None the less, my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="80512-0005.htm_para19"><a name="0805122000243">Speaking for myself, I support Second Reading of the Bill. Even those who wish to amend the Bill at subsequent stages must recognise that the legislation needs to be updated. The example I would give, which will be familiar to many hon. Members, is that of  the decisions that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority made in January concerning two projects involving the use of animal eggs from which the nucleus had been removed. Despite the fact that the 1990 Act prohibits the mixing of animal and human gametes, other than to test the fertility of sperm, the authority regarded the embryo created as human and concluded that, as such, it could license research. The HFEA&#146;s decisions and interpretation of the 1990 Act suggest that substantial research using hybrid embryos would continue even if there were no legislation, so the Bill is necessary to provide clarity and to update the law. That does not mean, however, that the Bill should go forward unamended.</p>

That was true in 1990, it has remained true and it is important for us to provide that assurance now. It is partly for that reason that my colleagues and I will propose a number of amendments.

I accept that there is a need to pursue different models by which stem cells can be created or reprogrammed to provide potential therapeutic benefit. Although research on reprogramming adult stem cells is encouraging, it would be foolhardy to block embryonic stem cell research and it is increasingly evident that the availability of human eggs for research purposes will be a serious constraint on the conduct of such experiments.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raised the interesting question of why the Government changed their mind on human-animal hybrid embryos. Was it not because a scientific consensus emerged among the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust and the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, in a unanimous report, supported by people who do not often agree with anyone, such as the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink), who supported the recommendation that the Bill should appear as drafted?</p>

 I am interested in that point. My constituency of South Cambridgeshire probably has as many scientists engaged in stem cell research as any constituency in the country. From the many people to whom I have spoken in my constituency, I believe that the consensus rests on the proposition that embryonic stem cell research is one of several models of research, which may deliver substantial therapeutic benefit in future, and on the fact that constraints emerged on the availability of human eggs, which meant that there were significant benefits to be derived from using animal eggs. However, that belief did not extend&#151;and I have not heard scientists in my constituency arrive at a consensus on the matter&#151;to human-animal embryos in which there is a substantial mix of human and animal nucleic DNA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="80512-0006.htm_para5"><a name="0805122000259">The document that the Government presented to the Science and Technology Committee in January 2007 stated that</p>

They have not based the measure on the proposition that embryos that are ostensibly human can be created, and, by virtue of the use of animal eggs, may enable embryonic stem cell research to make progress. Instead, they have structured it in such a way as to permit the creation of embryos with both nucleic human and nucleic animal DNA. As the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith) said, that is a 50:50 embryo, as it were.</p>

Same-sex couples and single mothers can be successful parents, but if we enable a child to be born in circumstances in which a natural conception would not be possible, we have an ethical responsibility to ensure that the welfare of the child is fully protected. It is in the interests of every child to have a mother and a father, but if no father is present&#151;as is, unhappily, the case for many children today&#151;a male role model should be available. For that reason, I, personally, do not regard the substitution of &#147;supportive parenting&#148; for &#147;father&#148; as sufficient.

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="80512-0006.htm_para17"><a name="0805122000285">If the Government had not proposed a change in the legislation, I do not think that I would have suggested such a change and I do not believe that anyone would have regarded it as necessary. The present legislation is being implemented by the authority in a way that, in practice, is not discriminatory to same-sex couples. However, given that the Government have introduced the Bill, I believe that it is better to reflect the practice in clinics today than to try to resist language that accurately describes what is being done across the country.</p>

 No. I want to complete my speech quite quickly because there are many Members waiting to speak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="80512-0006.htm_para18"><a name="0805122000288">The Secretary of State said, perfectly correctly, that the Government were proposing no changes to abortion legislation. Indeed, speaking from the Conservative Front Bench, I do not think that we are. However, when we come to consider amendments on abortion, I hope that the House will bear in mind three issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="80512-0006.htm_para19"><a name="0805122000289">First, there continue to be far too many abortions. We have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in western Europe. We fail too many young people through family breakdown, poor parenting, inadequate social support and poor education. Lack of self-esteem has a corrosive effect on young people, and I have no doubt that the high numbers of teenage abortions are a symptom of this wider malaise. This is a central challenge that we have to face in repairing our broken society, and we should not debate this matter in isolation from that challenge. Furthermore, far too many abortions&#151;about a third&#151;are repeat abortions. We must look at the effectiveness of sex education and of contraceptive services. Personally, I also believe that many more young women&#151;women of any age, for that matter&#151;should be made aware of, and offered, long-acting reversible contraception through the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="80512-0006.htm_para20"><a name="0805122000290">Secondly, if a woman needs an abortion in terms sanctioned by the Abortion Act 1967, it must surely be better for it to be an early, medical abortion than a later, surgical one. I therefore hope that the House will consider whether the requirement for two doctors to consent to an abortion being performed, and the restrictions on nurses providing medical abortions, need to be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para0"><a name="0805122000291">Thirdly&#151;consistent with that thought and with the principle of according increased protection to the foetus during its development&#151;I believe that we should take a more restrictive view of late abortions. The change made in 1990, which lowered the time limit from 28 to 24 weeks, has clearly been justified. The limits set at each stage, from 1967 onwards, have been intended to reflect the limit of viability. The research published by Field and others in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> last week was based on a study of the survival of extremely premature babies born in the former Trent health region. It clearly shows that an increased proportion of babies born at 24 and 25 weeks&#146; gestation are surviving to be discharged home from neonatal intensive care. The authors report no corresponding increase in survival in respect of babies born at 23 weeks. It must be noted,  <br>

however, that 18 per cent. of those babies admitted to neonatal intensive care did survive. As we are talking about a total of 510 babies a year born at 23 weeks&#146; gestation, that means that approximately 100 of those babies would live and go home. If they were aborted at 23 weeks, they would not live.</p>

 Let me talk about the study first, then I will happily give way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para1"><a name="0805122000294">The authors also report that no babies born at 22 weeks survived. Like other studies, they suggest that this might represent the limit of viability. I cannot say whether they are right, but I note that, of 150 babies born alive at 22 weeks over the whole period of the study in Trent, only 24 were admitted to intensive care. In the latest period, 2000-05, only nine were admitted to intensive care. From my point of view&#151;I am not a scientist, but I can read statistics&#151;in order to draw any conclusion from such a small number of cases, one would need to assess why those babies were being born so prematurely. Were they failing to thrive? Were they twins or other multiple births? Were they suffering from a genetic defect?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para2"><a name="0805122000295">Abortions at 22 weeks would be of a foetus that was otherwise healthy, unless they were carried out on the specific ground of a prospective abnormality or handicap of the child concerned. So while such a baby would require intensive care, and doubtless very large numbers might not survive, I do not regard that study as providing conclusive evidence that a baby cannot be sustained at 22 weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para3"><a name="0805122000296">I would personally be loth to move from the principle of linking the time limit for abortion to the viability of the foetus. That is where it was established in 1967; it has moved over time. It is arguable, but I would argue personally that the evidence would support a further reduction&#151;in my view, to 22 weeks&#151;in order to ensure a prospective legal framework that could accommodate improving medical science.</p>

 I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware of other studies&#151;for example, in University College hospital, London, and in other countries&#151;showing that if poorly babies who are born prematurely receive immediate good neonatal care from a specialist dedicated team of staff, the outcomes are very much better. University College hospital figures are much better than those emerging from the Trent study. One conclusion from the Trent study is that anyone going into premature labour should go to University College hospital and not to the Trent region.</p>

<p><a name="st_o180"><a name="0805122000298"><a name="80512-0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="0805122000547"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 My hon. Friend may have gathered from what I said that I am effectively arguing that in circumstances where neonatal intensive care was provided to all such babies born at 22 weeks and where the foetus was otherwise healthy&#151;or rather the baby was healthy at that stage&#151;the prospects for survival at 22 weeks may well be far greater than suggested by the negative view expressed in the study from Nottingham and Leicester. It is not for me to say any more than that, but I think that it provides a basis for reducing the limit&#151;albeit, in my view, by just two weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para4"><a name="0805122000301">Let me make my point of view clear. I shall support the Second Reading of the Bill, but I shall vote against the programme motion. On human admixed embryos, in respect of which the Government are changing the ethical framework of the 1990 Act, it is unacceptable to dispense with such a controversial issue in as little as three hours. The number of interventions on the Secretary of State&#146;s speech demonstrates that other issues will also take considerable time. As far as abortion is concerned, I have no doubt that a full day&#146;s debate, rather than just three hours, should have been allocated. Issues about the time limit, the manner in which approval for early abortion is given and other aspects of the availability of early abortions cannot be given their due weight in a debate of just three hours.</p>

 May I first tell my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State how pleased I am that the Bill is before us on Second Reading. I was involved in debates about the human embryo during the 1980s. Issues were posed in a private Member&#146;s Bill, which I will not go further into; I was also heavily involved in debating the legislation in the 1990s. My right hon. Friend was right to describe that legislation as pioneering&#151;indeed it was. It was rightly debated extensively on the Floor of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para6"><a name="0805126000002">Let me respond to both the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) and the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), who mentioned that we now have 18 years of experience of regulation in this area. I and many other Members will have visited the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and talked to those who work for it. When it was introduced, it was not a blank sheet of paper for the future; it is quite different now from what it was back in 1990.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para7"><a name="0805126000003">I am pleased that we are updating the regulation of assisted reproduction and embryo research in the light of scientific developments over the past 18 years. In 1990, we were very restricted in what we could do; we need only look at the decisions that the House has taken on the issue, through statutory instruments, which we could not have taken back in 1990. I remember when I was a shadow health spokesman that I had to help a Minister and his Parliamentary Private Secretary to get through a provision on the lifetime of stored embryos. That had not been put in the original Bill&#151;no one wanted to go there, because of the ethical issues at the time. The Committee of Selection hand-picked Labour Members to bring in time scales  <br>

for the storage of human embryos, so that eggs whose owners had walked away and were untraceable could be got rid of. Those were the types of difficulties that were left because we could not know the detail in 1990. Eighteen years on, the situation is a little different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para8"><a name="0805126000004">The Bill will help to maintain the UK&#146;s position as a world leader in embryo research, including stem cell research. In addition, it will reflect modern social attitudes and Government policies on the family. Given the changes introduced by the House over the past decade, that is necessary. Research involving human embryos is necessary for the progress of assisted conception techniques. That was true then and it is true now. According to House of Commons Library figures on IVF up to 2005, there are now thousands of IVF births a year whereas many years ago there were hundreds. That is a result of this type of research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para9"><a name="0805126000005">Such research also holds great promise for the understanding and development of treatments for a range of diseases and disorders. In particular, embryonic stem cell research using cells extracted from early embryos potentially offers major breakthroughs in medical science. Research involving the creation of human embryos outside the body led to the first IVF-conceived birth in 1978&#151;some Members of the House went to her 21st birthday held down here, when she came to say hello.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para10"><a name="0805126000006">The UK has a widely admired and established system of statutory regulation, based on an independent licensing authority, the HFEA, which reflects the special status of the human embryo, as recognised in the Warnock report which underpinned the 1990 Act. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire said that that special status should have been enshrined in legislation, but my understanding is that it is based on a gradualist approach to the moral status of the human embryo: that it has an increasing status as it develops. That is my understanding of why we legislated as we did in 1990. The law therefore allows research, but only within certain parameters, such as a 14-day limit on the development of embryos in vitro. The Bill seeks to update the existing law, primarily in the light of technological advances, thereby helping to maintain the UK&#146;s position as a leading research base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para11"><a name="0805126000007">I want to comment on the three issues that will be subject to a free vote, on which many of us have written. On human admixed embryos, some of the language over the past 18 years has not changed at all, as the Easter sermon in Scotland showed. It is not about creating monsters, as much as people still make that argument about such science, and it never was. If it were, I would not have been as supportive of such science over the years. It is purely laboratory research and aimed at increasing knowledge about serious diseases and treatments for them. Embryos must be destroyed at 14 days, and so far no scientist has been able to develop the embryo beyond six days. Those embryos cannot be placed in a woman or, indeed, in an animal. Interestingly, no one is suggesting that the 14-day limit on which we agreed in 1990 should be changed. Whatever was said at the time, no one is saying now that we got it wrong then. Medical science has come nowhere near trying to give that boundary a shove, and telling us to change what we understood to  <br>

be right and proper. I do not consider that the science has become out of control. I think that some of the decisions made by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) in 1990 were right, and that that has been shown by the test of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para12"><a name="0805126000008">The Bill seeks to clarify the regulation of human admixed embryos for research. The 1990 Act refers only to human embryos, not to new and innovative ways of creating embryos combining human and animal material, which is why the provision on admixed embryos has been introduced. The Bill proposes that the same licensing process should apply as for fully human embryos, and that the 14-day legal limit should apply to admixed embryos as well. The issue has arisen under the current legislation, as has the HFEA&#146;s responsibility for managing the science effectively on behalf of us legislators, and I see no problem with accepting that element of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para13"><a name="0805126000009">Another issue is that of embryo screening and selection, and saviour siblings. The Bill spells out for the first time in law a number of rules relating to the screening and selection of embryos and gametes. In broad terms, embryo screening and selection will be allowed only for the purpose of screening out serious genetic diseases or disorders. The HFEA has licensed screening in a number of cases since 1990, including cases of single-gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para14"><a name="0805126000010">The Bill will ban selecting the sex of a child except when the intention is to avoid a serious sex-linked disease, and it addresses the issue of saviour siblings. As a last resort, an embryo may be selected so that the resulting child is a tissue match for a seriously ill older brother or sister. That has been licensed in a handful of cases involving rare blood diseases. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) referred to the family of three young children and their mum and dad who appeared on BBC television this morning. They had to travel to America, a total journey of 80,000 miles. They were lucky in the sense that they were able to do that, unlike many of our constituents who might otherwise be assisted in the same way. The Bill makes it clear that such activities are lawful, and gives Parliament the opportunity to debate them. I agree with that as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para15"><a name="0805126000011">My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson), who has now left the Chamber, raised the issue of what he described as &#147;spare parts&#148;. He asked whether saviour siblings could be created for the purpose of organ transplants. The simple answer is no. Whatever anyone may say, the Bill does not allow embryo selection decisions for that purpose, although other parts of the law&#151;governed by the Human Tissue Authority&#151;do allow it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para16"><a name="0805126000012">Another issue that causes people to shuffle around in their seats a fair amount is that of the &#147;need for a father&#148;. I do not think that the Bill is about &#147;doing away with fathers&#148;, or about being politically correct. I think the Government are right to recognise the important role that fathers play in their children&#146;s lives. There is a range of policies designed to strengthen that role, and to underline fathers&#146; responsibilities. In fact, the Bill will bring conditions into line with legislation already passed by the House on civil partnerships&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para17"><a name="0805126000015">I welcome the opportunity to debate the Bill. It has been a long time coming, and rightly so. There has been a process of deliberation: a draft Bill has been considered by a Joint Committee. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) for his chairmanship of that Committee, and to its other members, who produced an impressive piece of work during an exhaustive process. What was particularly impressive was that the Government were prepared to listen. That is the way in which legislation ought to be developed before being presented to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para18"><a name="0805126000016">Why is the Bill necessary? The history in this area has been of legislation trying to keep pace with scientific endeavour and developments. The 1990 legislation followed the first great breakthrough: the first IVF birth back in 1978. It was six years after that that Baroness Warnock produced her report, which set out the ethical and moral principles that have guided us ever since, and which have stood the test of time. They included according a special moral status to the human embryo. Although those principles might not have secured universal acceptance, they have clearly provided a rational framework for the development of legislation. However, it took another six years before legislation finally arrived, in the form of the 1990 Act. I pay tribute to the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) for marshalling that legislation through Parliament, because, remarkably, it has also stood the test of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para19"><a name="0805126000017">We have led the way internationally, but science has moved on and those advances raise new ethical, legal and social issues. Although the 1990 Act has clearly given public confidence because it introduced a robust regulatory system, in order to maintain public confidence legislation must be able to meet new challenges; hence the need for updating. Ultimately, it has to be Parliament that sets the framework&#151;the boundaries within which scientists and the medical profession can lawfully operate. In setting the framework here and now, we have to look forward and anticipate new breakthroughs, in order to make sure that the legislation is as durable as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para20"><a name="0805126000018">I want to say at the outset that, like the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats will have free votes on all matters in the Bill.

Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)? Regardless of whether people agree or disagree with him, he clearly brings remarkable intellectual force to the debate.

When dealing with issues that engender strong feelings and anxieties and on which Members and others have deeply held convictions, it is incumbent on those on all sides of the argument to remain measured, avoid exaggeration or sensationalism and respect the other point of view. Some of the comments made outside this place so far in the debate have not met that test. Church leaders and others to whom people look for guidance have a particular responsibility for the comments they make.</p>

As a layman who has witnessed the horror of degenerative and genetic conditions, I believe that there is a powerful case for research, which increases understanding and could ultimately lead to cures. My father had Parkinson&#146;s, before he died, and I also knew well a local radio newsman in Norfolk who had motor neurone disease. I witnessed the deterioration that that cruel and horrible condition caused. If there is a chance of our finding cures or treatments, that is surely a worthy objective. Any such research would, of course, be subject, under this Bill, to tight control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80512-0007.htm_para24"><a name="0805126000024">I wish to discuss human admixed embryos, which are inevitably one of the Bill&#146;s more emotive issues. Surely, for the purposes of research, it must be right to consider their use. We are talking about keeping them only for up to 14 days and, again, only in a laboratory. As I have said, some of the claims have been exaggerated. There is a genuine problem of a shortage of human eggs hampering research. It is difficult to recruit egg donors&#151;the process is a physically demanding one for a woman to go through&#151;and there are long waiting lists of people seeking donor eggs for IVF treatment, so scientists struggle to obtain enough eggs for research. Surely it makes sense to save human eggs for IVF treatment, so if we really want research that has the potential to deliver cures of treatments for some of these awful conditions to be done, there must be a compelling logic to making use of admixed embryos.</p>

The suggestion has been made that a regulation-making power could be included in the Bill to allow sperm and egg derived respectively from a male and female stem cell&#151;not from testes or ovaries&#151;to be permitted sperm or permitted egg for the purpose of implanting a permitted embryo in order to treat the infertility of those individuals, such as cancer sufferers, who cannot produce their own gametes in the normal way. The science is not there yet, but there is the potential to allow thousands of cancer survivors and their partners to have a child of their own genetic material. That is remarkable science, which was undreamed of not long ago. I would welcome an indication from the Government that they have not closed their mind on that issue.</p>

By tissue-typing IVF embryos, we can identify an embryo that is a tissue match for a sick older sibling suffering from a serious disease so that the transplant of umbilical cord or bone marrow would be a more effective treatment. The original draft Bill limited screening for that purpose to circumstances in which an older sibling had a &#147;life-threatening&#148; disease. The Joint Committee thought that that was too narrow, and the Bill now refers to &#147;serious&#148; disease. That seems entirely rational. It would be hard to argue that we should help only those with a life-threatening condition, leaving those with serious conditions without hope.</p>

Inevitably, each hon. Member must reach their own conclusion. The reference that the hon.

The 2001 regulations permitted therapeutic cloning to provide the prospect of generating stem cell therapy for diseases such as Parkinson&#146;s and diabetes. All those who support such research do so because of its potential to provide therapy. However, it is unclear whether research licences could lawfully permit the use of embryos for therapy if the research proved ultimately successful. It would be odd if we did not address now the potential for such research to succeed. Do we really want to return to the matter with more primary legislation?

However, there appears to be evidence that the need-for-a-father test is an additional hurdle that excludes some women. My hon.

 My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon tells me that the criteria that the NHS set refer to&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> Let me develop my argument. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority code of practice rightly says that if a single or lesbian woman seeks treatment, the treatment centre should assess the prospective mother&#146;s ability to meet the child&#146;s needs.

 I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that there is no direct relationship between the text of the Bill and the criteria applied in the NHS for access to infertility treatment. We have complained many times to the Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), and her predecessors about the fact that arbitrary social criteria are applied. The changes in the Bill will not prevent that from happening. For example, the Bill will not stop primary care trusts from saying that a woman cannot have access to fertility treatment if her partner has children from a previous marriage, or from restricting access to such treatment for same-sex couples or single parents. It is a red herring to base arguments about the Bill on the NHS criteria.</p>

 I hear the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but I disagree with him. <i> [Interruption.] </i>May I just develop my point? The BMA addresses the question of whether there is evidence that children born to single women or lesbian couples are disadvantaged in any way. Its submission says that there is evidence that children raised by single women are more likely to be disadvantaged, but that is not true of children born to single women or lesbian couples who choose to start a family on their own through assisted conception. The early research indicates that such children fare just as well as those born to two heterosexual parents through assisted conception.</p>

If the evidence suggests that there is no disadvantage, there should not be in-built discrimination in legislation placing an additional hurdle before some people because of what they are. We should instead look at individual circumstances. The argument is not about anybody claiming to have a right to a child; it is about individuals having the right to be considered objectively for IVF treatment. The Bill would require treatment clinics to consider the welfare of the child, including the need for supportive parenting. That seems to be the right test, and I will support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80512-0008.htm_para11"><a name="0805126000053">Let me turn to the issue of whether the birth certificate of a donor-conceived child should have that fact recorded on it. There is considerable force behind the argument that the individual has the right to know. The issue was debated at length in the other place, and one of the possibilities that was considered was the use of a symbol to indicate that a child was donor-conceived. The Government are committed to carrying out a review of the law and practice, and I would be grateful if the Minister said, in her closing speech, where we are with that process and when the review is likely to reach a conclusion.</p>

That appears to be the scientific consensus. The Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), addressed the issue. If we are making legislation on the basis of evidence, we should not be persuaded that there is a case for changing the current 24-week limit.</p>

The need to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies highlights the importance of sex and relationship education in schools, which should be part of the minimum curriculum entitlement. That is what my party believes. It is dreadful that the United Kingdom continues to be top of the league table for teenage pregnancies, and the number of unwanted pregnancies suggests that we are failing as a society. If we can address that, we can deal with the number of abortions that take place.

However, the Healthcare Commission could investigate, make judgments when appropriate and ensure effective service delivery. Instead, we have a system in which the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Healthcare Commission regulate.

This House and our Ministers should insist that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence regulations be fully implemented. In 2004, we had a commitment that three full cycles of in vitro fertilisation should be available to all who fitted the clinical criteria. By 2005, it was said that each primary care trust would support at least one full cycle. At this point, a seriously small minority get three cycles, although I cannot give a percentage because I did not bring that information with me. However, the majority of people are in the middle. They hope for some treatment, but little is delivered. This is 2008, and NICE regulations are involved; frankly, it is a scandal.

Speaking with my other hat on, which I share with the hon. Members for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke), if it is acceptable that children who are available for adoption and fostering can be adopted and fostered by single women or by homosexual couples, I see no reason why they should be excluded from accessing all that can be provided for them in terms of embryology treatment. It is completely unacceptable that it is seen as acceptable for one group but not for another. The children who are being adopted by women and homosexuals are invariably those with special needs who are unwanted by heterosexual couples. The House needs to wake up to the hypocrisy that we sometimes seem to develop among ourselves. I come from a very happy home with a brilliant father&#151;somewhat autocratic and always passionate, especially about Welsh rugby and the Labour party, although we can forgive him on those scores. We cannot say that what we have had in our own lives is the only option available. I have known many divorced women and men who have been the most magnificent parents.</p>

 As several hon. Members have reminded me, I had the pleasure of moving the Second Reading of the 1990 Bill. I am glad that we all look back on that as a rather successful and groundbreaking piece of legislation on which we can now build. In case it be thought that this is causing an unusual degree of immodesty on my part, I must concede that&#151;in common, I suspect, with the present Secretary of State&#151;although I presided over those activities and played a leading part in taking the Bill through the House, my Minister of State, Virginia Bottomley, had played a far larger role in putting it together than I had, as had a large number of medics and officials in the Department. It was a necessary piece of legislation, and I am glad to say that, as a result of a very long and careful production process, it has been a success.

asked Baroness Warnock to consider the problem in 1982, before it had become a matter of major public controversy, and her recommendations created a virtual consensus that has remained until now and lies behind this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80512-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08051220000017">It is important to bear in mind what the Bill is about, now that we are updating it as we undoubtedly must. Embryo research had been carried out in this country for about 20 years before we legislated in 1990. The first test-tube baby had been born in 1978 and IVF was becoming widespread. In the 12 years before the 1990 Act, such research was an entirely voluntary, unregulated activity, where each researcher made his or her judgment about the ethics involved and how far they should go. We had introduced a licensing authority in co-operation with the royal colleges, but its role was purely voluntary and advisory. Most respectable researchers allowed themselves to be guided by its views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80512-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08051220000018">The purpose of the 1990 legislation was to establish a regulatory and statutory framework. It was precisely because everybody agreed that the human tissue in question had to be treated with particular respect, and because everybody realised that serious ethical concerns were being raised about what was being done, that we set up the new authority. It was decided that the judgments involved should be made, to a certain extent, independently of Parliament, politicians and Ministers, when it came to particular areas of research, but it was set up for the purposes of control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80512-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08051220000019">My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) made the point that a happy side effect of the 1990 legislation was that it made this country one of the leading places in the world for research into degenerative diseases, genetic diseases and research of all kinds connected to the human embryo. It was not the purpose of that legislation, and it should not be the purpose of this Bill, to enable us to have a more permissive regime in order to compete with other jurisdictions. The point is to reassure citizens that Parliament has had regard to the need to set a proper legal and ethical framework within which the best scientists and medics can feel confident to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80512-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08051220000020">That leads me to touch on the way in which the Bill is being handled, about which I have some criticisms&#151;though none of the Secretary of State. I hope that I presented the Bill in 1990 in the same reasonable and sensible way that he just has. The Bill seems quite devoid of any party political or ideological content. In 1990, because of the very sensitive nature of the subject and the strong religious and philosophical views that people held, we introduced a quite different way of handling the legislation. A complete free vote was allowed to every Member of the Government&#151;each and every Minister and not just each and every Back Bencher. Although as Ministers we presented the Bill to try to ensure that there was some sort of sensible, workable, well-drafted legal framework, we left it entirely to the House as to what the contents were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80512-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08051220000021">There was no question of Ministers being given permission to absent themselves on particular issues if they wanted. Ministers went into both Lobbies at various stages. When I spoke from the Front Bench, along with my colleagues who happened to be Ministers, I made a clear distinction&#151;as the Secretary of State just did&#151;between what I was saying on behalf of the Government, based on the advice of medics, or  <br>

The Government tabled a whole list of contradictory amendments.</p>

 It was confusing for those who do not normally look at the amendment paper. People published guides to it, as I recall, and we invited the House to choose from a range of options after how many weeks an abortion should be permitted. We asked for people&#146;s views on that, and it was an important way of proceeding. Contrary to my wishes, because I had other things to do at the time, the then Leader of the House insisted on the amendments being drafted in such a way that we could get into the debate on abortion at length.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80512-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08051220000025">I do not make the point simply out of concern for Roman Catholic and other opponents of parts of the Bill on the Labour Benches, although I have the highest respect for their views, because no one can feel that they have absolute moral authority on the matter. However, I am concerned about the reputation of Parliament, and even about that of whipping votes. I believe in party discipline, and one sometimes needs to enforce the Whip on administrative, financial and legal matters&#151;Members should revolt only now and again, and on serious matters of principle. However, the moral authority of legislation is affected if people are allowed to argue that it was pushed through with too much party political control.</p>

I take a secular view of such matters. I am a social liberal, who is on the social liberal side of most of the arguments that the Bill presents. If it were simply a matter of realpolitik, I would tell the Secretary of State, the Prime Minister and the Chief Whip, &#147;I don&#146;t know what you&#146;re worried about. If you allow a free vote, you&#146;ll find that the socially liberal majority of the House of Commons is enormous, entirely in line with the opinion of the citizenship at large.&#148; Governments often get a bigger majority with a free vote.</p>

 I commend members of the general public who are interested&#151;as many are&#151;in the matter to study our debates and discover the current position. If we asked most people how many single women and lesbian couples were allowed assistance under current law, they would be astonished at the reply. The matter should be examined in some depth.

We go into much detail, but the fundamental issue at the heart of the debate is the ethical argument about what represents a human personality and what regard we should pay to the embryonic tissue with which we deal in research or medicine. I understand the concept of natural law, but much medicine and science is an unnatural intervention in the order of things, and one is constantly making ethical judgments about the extent to which that is justifiable to ease human suffering.</p>

I cannot for the life of me accept that that applies simply to a fertilised embryo&#151;millions die naturally every day and never become implanted in the womb. I believe that the judgment of 14 days or the emergence of the primitive streak has held up well for the past 18 years and we should stick to it. Then, we must consider how to deal respectfully with human issue and how the Bill should protect it. However, we should not strive to go beyond that.

 I will try to confine my remarks to the three main issues that we have been discussing today: the need for a father for any child resulting from IVF treatment, human-animal embryos and saviour siblings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80512-0009.htm_para14"><a name="08051220000039">On the need for a father, clause 14(2)(b) removes the provision in the 1990 Act under which IVF clinics must have regard for the need of any child resulting from IVF treatment for a father. I consider that removal to be one of the most ill-conceived measures to be put before the House while I have been a Member. The law as it stands provides an important safeguard for the unborn child, as well as recognising and promoting the generally accepted notion of the ideal family unit&#151;the one designed by nature, that of a mother, father and child. There is abundant evidence showing that children raised in a stable unit of that nature develop much better socially and emotionally, and attain  higher levels of educational achievement than their counterparts in other types of family unit. I make that point as a simple statement of fact. In making it, I in no way wish to disparage the love, care and commitment given to their children by most lone or same-sex parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="80512-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08051220000040">The current law does not prevent or obstruct single women or lesbian couples from obtaining IVF treatment. Indeed, we have not heard one example today of a lesbian woman who has not been able to receive IVF treatment. The law simply emphasises the importance of a father to a child and encourages women without a male partner to make provision for a father figure to be involved with the child, such as a grandfather. To me, that seems pure common sense. The best interest of the child should be of paramount importance in this debate. Surely a discussion of the benefits that a child gets from having a father and an examination of how the void created by not having one could to some extent be filled should be a minimum requirement for the IVF treatment assessment process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80512-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08051220000041">The state, through either the NHS or a licensed clinic, in effect licenses the creation of life that would not otherwise exist. It therefore has a responsibility to ensure that all relevant factors are taken into consideration before a decision to proceed is taken. The Government&#146;s decision to remove the requirement for the need for a father to be considered is a clear abrogation of that responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80512-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08051220000042">My final point on this matter relates to the Government&#146;s intention to airbrush out of existence the biological fathers of the children of lesbian couples. I believe the measure is unfair to the child and potentially harmful. It smacks of the state colluding to fulfil a fantasy of parenthood and should be removed from the Bill.</p>

The Bill goes further, permitting the creation of hybrid animal-human embryos. It provides for full hybrids, which would be created by fertilising human eggs with animal sperm, or vice versa. The resulting embryo would be 50 per cent. animal and 50 per cent. human. I find this aspect of the Bill revolting, and if my postbag is anything to go by, it also horrifies a good number of my constituents.</p>

I have no doubt that many of those who voted for embryonic cloning in 2001, and those who will probably vote for animal-human hybrids in this Bill, did so and will do so out of a genuine humanitarian desire to help those who suffer from disabling diseases.

 I have the pleasure of sitting on the Joint Committee with the hon. Lady.

 Yes, I do. With saviour siblings, there is also embryo selection, which is used widely in IVF treatment, and I have concerns about embryos being discarded because of the possibility of disability.

We must address the issues of infertility, congenital disease, miscarriage and the development of human embryos. We must address how to apply fruitful research to the development of effective treatment, and what constitutes, what causes and what might cure or alleviate serious diseases. We must address how we can improve contraception in this country, and we must address the issue of the genes and chromosomal abnormalities that give rise to the list of distressing phenomena with which all Members of the House are familiar.</p>

Bill. Secondly, I say to my hon. Friend: let politicians for a moment, rather uncharacteristically, assume the mantle of humility. I suspect that none of us in this House is as great an expert as Sir Martin Evans or some of the other individuals to whom reference has been made. I know that there is expertise in the House, which is respected, but we cannot compete with that other expertise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80512-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08051220000069">We should not close off the possibilities of research simply because a Member, who is possibly already geared up to vote in a particular direction, chooses to seize on a given research project or a particular academic in order to advance a view that we should not proceed with a particular method. I believe in a degree of competition. I do not believe that the mere existence of alternatives is sufficient to allow us credibly or responsibly to say, &#147;We won&#146;t use that mechanism. We&#146;ll stick to another. We&#146;ll satisfy ourselves with something that already applies.&#148; I believe that there should be plenty of opportunities for different methods to be used, in the hope that eventually one or more will yield positive results.</p>

 The kind of stem cell research that the hon. Gentleman supports might not attract the same level of criticism, but, on the strength of the information that I have garnered thus far, I am sceptical as to whether it is likely to deliver the scale and quality of outcomes that could be achieved by the kind of embryo research planned for in the Bill. I respect the hon. Gentleman&#146;s position, but I stand by the view that we need all sorts of different sources of potential improvement. We should not act as the exclusive arbiters in favour of one source, rather than of either of the other two main sources that are on the table at the moment.</p>

The first is the issue of admixed embryos. I respect the fact that some Members feel an almost overwhelming revulsion at the idea. I do not share that feeling. I have said that I am motivated by the pursuit of results, and I believe that the pragmatic arguments are strong. There is a shortage of human eggs, and the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) and others have referred to another relevant factor in this context&#151;the fact that the whole process of egg harvesting is difficult, burdensome and hazardous. Moreover, for a proportion&#151;admittedly only a small proportion&#151;of women, it is potentially fatal. My view is that if we can efficiently deploy an alternative by using animal eggs as part of the mix instead, there will be much to commend that. I look forward to the possibility&#151;I put it no more strongly than that&#151;that that process might yield beneficial results.</p>

found on one side. Of course he is motivated by moral considerations, and so am I. I cannot stand idly by  and look at the situation of someone who is withered and debilitated by the most appalling disease&#151;be it Parkinson&#146;s, Alzheimer&#146;s or motor neurone disease&#151;knowing that there might be a possibility of a cure or alleviation by one or more of the methods provided for in the Bill. I cannot simply turn away, saying that some abstract theory, dogmatic reasoning or religious insistence prevents me from giving the go-ahead to that work. That is where I am coming from on this subject. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80512-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08051220000074">There are similar moral considerations with regard to saviour siblings. Let me confront the point that is most regularly and passionately made against the concept. The notion is that what is entailed is the bringing into being of an additional human being for a purely utilitarian purpose. It is said that this would devalue the individual, that that person might suffer subsequently and that the process would be intrinsically wrong. My view is that, in the first instance, that should be a judgment for the prospective parent or parents. If the prospective parent says to himself or herself&#151;or if the partnership decides&#151;that this is something that they want to do because a sibling can be helped, a disease can be cured or a life can be saved and, as a consequence, extended, I have respect for that. The pursuit of tissue-typing offers the best and most obvious example of the deployment of the potential of scientific research for the ultimate purpose&#151;the saving or improvement of human life. These processes exist not in isolation but to provide a particular benefit.</p>

 I can certainly conceive that not everyone who wishes to benefit will do so. If my hon. Friend is encouraging me&#151;I am not sure whether this was the gravamen of his intervention&#151;in the direction of saying that more and more people should so benefit, my answer is in the affirmative. I thought that I had made it clear that this is essentially a good thing, which we should welcome and which the Bill should allow to be introduced and extended.</p>

My view, for what it is worth, is that the Government&#146;s proposal is perfectly reasonable. I am not convinced that the insertion of the phrase &#147;supportive parenting&#148; was necessary. It was a compromise that was reached in the other place, but the earlier formulation seemed perfectly satisfactory. However, I shall not castigate the Government for attempting to meet reasoned&#151;if, in my view, incorrect &#151;criticism. They have come up with a form of words that is unobjectionable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80512-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08051220000078">My view is that we should not discriminate. We should not have class actions. We should not have the dogmatic exclusion of whole categories of people. We have equality legislation with which these provisions should be compatible. My anxiety is that the call to reinsert the need for a father is not grounded in evidence but driven by preconceptions and, in some&#151;although not all&#151;cases, by rank prejudice. That is wrong. Judgments should be made on the basis of the individual case, not on the strength of a theory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80512-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08051220000097">Let me also tell the House about the work done in Japan by Professor Yamanaka&#146;s group, and at the university of Wisconsin in the United States, to reprogramme a skin fibroblast. Four genes are necessary for that reprogramming, and one is an oncogene&#151;a gene that produces cancer. It is not therefore surprising that when Professor Shinya Yamanaka&#146;s group in Japan injected stem cells into a four-cell mouse blastocyst and embedded it in a womb, the full-term mouse that developed contained tumours in almost every part of its body. I would not therefore like right hon. and hon. Members to feel that we can completely abandon stem cell research using human embryos or cytoplasmic hybrid embryos, and rely entirely on either rewinding adult cells, or even using adult stem cells. All three lines of research must continue, because faults are inherent in each of them. At the moment we do not know which one will tell  us how diseases will develop or produce the best therapeutic results.</p>

For a long time, in listening to debates in the House on both animals and humans, I have thought that a parliamentary bioethics committee was needed&#151;not a national bioethics committee. If Members want to observe the difference between the two, I urge them to read the articles in &#147;Science in Parliament&#148;, which will appear on their desks next week, and an article in <i> The Observer</i> that Baroness Warnock has already written. Those ought to be part of the debate. I agree that we should be led by a discussion of ethics, and there is not enough time on the Floor of the House to discuss all the issues and the ethics involved at the same time.</p>

 The House has been treated to a rich feast of speeches, demonstrating the diversity of opinion on the subject held by our constituents and certainly by right hon. and hon. Members. I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon). Although I do not agree with everything&#151;perhaps anything&#151;that he said, I recognise his tremendous expertise in this field. There are valid arguments on both sides of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para0"><a name="08051220000100">In making decisions about what human embryo research we will permit, we must, as the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East said, be guided by science and discovery. Our civilisation has always cherished progress and we should endorse those who legitimately strive to produce remedies against some of the worst diseases that assail human frailty, but we should not be too hasty in abandoning an ethical understanding of what it is to be human. Nor should we discard the wisdom of the ages: the wisdom that places humans as important moral objects, distinct from other animals. Reaching back to Plato and Aristotle, man has sought to understand the distinction between humans and the rest of nature. We need to hold in balance, on the one hand, our traditional understanding of who we are, including legitimate religious beliefs, and on the other, important scientific endeavour. Why is it that some people who are so socially liberal are inclusive of everything apart from those who hold sincere religious beliefs? That is not true inclusiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08051220000101">Those of us who believe that some&#151;not all&#151;of the Bill&#146;s provisions should be rejected do not oppose research into therapies that could save and improve lives. However, we believe that there is a better way of conducting that research. I want to ensure that public money is spent most effectively. We are constantly told that more than 80 therapies have been developed from adult stem cell research, while so far no therapies at all have been developed as a result of embryonic stem cell research. We have still not been given an answer for that in the debate. Yes, of course, it takes a long time, but we have had 20 years. When the Minister winds up, will she tell us why she thinks that we have not had greater success in that important field?</p>

I make no bones about that. Mixing the life essence of humans and animals is plain wrong, and a slippery slope to who knows where. But even the science seems to favour those of us who oppose this measure. Those who favour human admixed embryos rely on two main arguments: first, that admixed embryos are necessary because they will provide a mechanism for mapping genetic disorders; and secondly, that they will make up for the shortage of human eggs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08051220000105">My concern is that the creation of human admixed embryonic stem cells is a distraction from areas of research that are proven to be more effective, because they will never be able to be used as a therapy and no one wishes to see them implanted. Thus, the only use for them is disease modelling. However, even in that context there is a vast problem. How far will such admixed embryos truly mirror the development of human embryos? Stuart Newman, from New York medical school&#151;he has not been quoted yet, and we have had plenty of quotes&#151;called it a poorly motivated experiment, and said that the</p>

He says that one of his objections to the admixed embryos is that they represent a slippery slope. May I put it to him that of all the arguments that he can deploy, the so-called slippery slope thesis is the least persuasive? If he believes in parliamentary sovereignty, such matters can and will be determined by this House. If I may say so, it is a lazy argument.</p>

 I have already given way a couple of times, and would therefore be breaking into my own time. I know that the House wants to hear my pearls of wisdom.</p>

I have just mentioned Europe, so perhaps I should have given way to my hon. Friend, but I will not. Professor Sir Ian Wilmut was a great hero to the social liberals in our midst when he created Dolly the sheep, but now that he has moved from embryonic stem cell research lesser emphasis is given to his point of view. I wonder why. If we pass the Bill, Britain will not lead in this area, but start to fall behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08051220000114">Let me turn to the troubling issue of saviour siblings. The fact that we can select our children to generate a source of material to help sick relatives does not mean that we should. Of course we all have deep sympathy for those who suffer from genetic disorders. In the past three years, I have watched my much-loved father-in-law slowly transform from one of the nicest, most wonderful people on the planet into a person who, because of his extreme Alzheimer&#146;s disease, is completely unrecognisable. If I could wave a magic wand and find a way of treating that disease I would, but the fact that a complaint is very serious does not mean that we should continue with a research process that is wrong. I do not believe that that is an answer to the ethical and moral problems.</p>

We should not solve one problem by creating another. Saviour siblings may be loved, cared for and wanted&#151;indeed, only families who care desperately about their first child will have them, so of course they will be cared for&#151;but they will always have a secondary purpose. They are a means to an end, and they will come to know that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08051220000116">I am sure we all remember the existential angst of our teenage years.

We already have a huge problem with depression and many other types of mental disorder.</p>

I do not think we are doing particularly well at looking after people with mental health needs up and down the country, but many suffer from such psychological challenges because of their own upbringing. They may, for instance, have experienced extreme behaviour during their childhood. We should not seek a physical cure for one child at the expense of possible additional mental challenges for others.

The House may have guessed that I am not necessarily in favour of that. Although the practical implications of the clause are slight&#151;we must accept that&#151;its symbolic magnitude should not be underestimated. It is fundamentally a question of the hierarchy of rights. Should the sensibilities of those who may be bringing up children after they are born be put before the interests of the child? Lord Darzi recently said in another place that the removal of the &#147;need for a father&#148; clause should be seen in the context of the wider Government policy of promoting equality, but what about the wider Government policy of ensuring that the child&#146;s welfare is the paramount consideration, as seen in the Adoption and Children Act 2002? Surely that should come first.</p>

As we all know, family structures are an interdependent triad of relationships between father and child, between mother and child and between father and mother, each performing separate and complementary roles in the socialisation and normalisation of each party. We need to start affirming the position of fathers in parenting, families and society in general, and the Bill tugs us in the wrong direction.

have argued about the issues for 100 years and more, in cold flats, in universities and in schools. They have not gone away, and many of them are not new. All these questions&#151;what is life, when is an embryo a gamete, what is the role of our maker&#151;have been around for a long time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08051220000126">I should declare a couple of interests. As was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon), I chaired the Select Committee. We had epic discussions, and we split, not amicably. I earned a reputation as Dr. Frankenstein, according to my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith), and I have loved and lived that reputation ever since.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08051220000127">I am also a member of the Stem Cell Foundation, which is part of a Medical Research Council unit. It contains some distinguished individuals who are interested in promoting the foundation, which was established in 2005 to support the advance of pioneering stem cell research into medical practice. We receive many private donations. So far we have received some &#163;90 million, and we hope that when stem cell work starts to break through we shall be able to develop it in this country. Many of us remember what happened when monoclonal antibodies were discovered at Cambridge. The work was taken to the United States, and millions of people, as well as industries, benefited from our discoveries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08051220000128">I am very pleased to be continuing the stem cell work. As with everything in science, we live in hope that something will happen, but it is never possible to swear to it. I am 99.9 per cent. sure that the sun will rise tomorrow morning, but who knows? Something just might happen. We live in a world in which interesting things turn up in science, and that is why we become involved. We want an environment in which we can research and find things out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08051220000129">I remember when, in the 1970s, we discussed genetic recombinant DNA. There were huge fights and marches in Boston to protest against the insertion of animal DNA into human cells and vice versa. It was the scientists themselves who regulated the position and determined the category into which the work should fall. They have now established the principle, and people carry out such work all the time. For example, human insulin and bacteria are made in animal cells, to the benefit of many people who suffer from diabetes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08051220000130">Science was what motivated us to examine the issue in 2004, but we knew that there was a public out there who had been involved in the debates about in vitro fertilisation, and much of what is being said now was said about it then. All the same words and phrases were used, such as &#147;unnatural&#148; and &#147;playing God&#148;. Now in vitro fertilisation is standard practice, and we are talking of improvements that ought to be made. We should be pressurising the system to ensure that it is available to people, because having a child is very much part of being a human being, and wanting a healthy child is particularly so.</p>

who prefer to accept that life is a hazard and not to know what will happen, but it will be available. Jim Watson, the Nobel prize winner, has just had his DNA examined, but he refused to allow the part that might predict Alzheimer&#146;s to be examined, because he has reached the age at which it might happen and he was not sure whether he could handle the knowledge emotionally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08051220000132">Very interesting developments are in prospect, and as has been said before, we must be ahead of the curve and ensure we have the necessary legislation. Members have referred to the work in Japan. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East mentioned the oncogene, which might be involved in the development of cancers&#151;Nobel prize-winning stuff again&#151;and might be carried by retroviruses when they are put into a particular cell. That is the problem with gene therapy&#151;trying to change genetic problems by inserting DNA. We do not yet have a foolproof mechanism for the use of retrovirusues, although scientists are trying to find other ways of getting genes into adult cells while preventing the development of cancers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08051220000133">Not all scientists agree with this type of work. For example, in an article entitled, &#147;The Production of Admixed Animal-Human Embryos: Is it Necessary, or Merely Desirable?&#148; Professor Michael Balls&#151;a familiar name in this place&#151;from FRAME, an organisation that tries to stop animals being used in medical research, questions the partial arrogance of science in wanting to do such things. Therefore, scientists do argue about whether this is a valid procedure in conference centres and debating halls&#151;as I said, we have managed to hammer out the issue of recombinant DNA. My bet is that the scientific community, including the medics, and the public&#151;when they are engaged&#151;will be able to say what they think about these embryos.</p>

Indeed, I remember merging mouse cells and human cells and getting chromosomes&#151;genetic material&#151;from mice and humans. A competition went on between them, and the cells and chromosomes that developed were mainly human. As a result, we found out about matters such as which DNA genes and chromosomes were next to each other. That has now developed into the human genome field, which has so much potential in developing our attitudes on, and knowledge of, health. As there were admixed embryos in the past, I think there will continue to be such embryos.</p>

Some stem cells at certain layers in the blastocyst are better at developing than others. Some people say, &#147;Embryonic stem cells haven&#146;t done anything.&#148; That is not quite true. We have to go through very strong safety conditions and procedures, and we use mice and rats. People might be against that experimentation, too, but it is the law and it has to be followed. Certain situations, such as where there are model mental health problems in mice or rats, can be corrected by injecting embryonic stem cells.</p>

 Yes, that is true; it is the stuff of science fiction, and people see it on the television so they are persuaded to believe that it will happen and that evil people in white coats are running around trying to do that and thinking, &#147;Who cares about a Nobel prize when we can produce a three-headed monster; that&#146;s a real achievement.&#148; None of the scientists I know ever talks about that; they may do so in a jocular way after a couple of pints, but as far as I know no one wants to do that. There is no gain or benefit; there are merely problems, and it is unlikely to happen.</p>

We know that there are pre-stem cells in certain cancers, and if they are in somebody with a leukaemia, that can develop at later stages into full-blown leukaemia. So the development of drugs against pre-stem cells&#151;we do not have to go into the detail&#151;is much more effective than doing that at later stem-cell stages. We have only managed to do that by being able to do the kind of test I mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para26"><a name="08051220000139">I said that I was 99.9 per cent. sure that the sun would rise tomorrow morning. The same percentage is often cited in respect of mitochondria and hybrid admixed embryos. The mitochondrial DNA is the contribution from the animals; that is the 0.1 per cent. We should not dismiss mitochondrial DNA by saying that as it is only 0.1 per cent. it does not matter. Importantly, there are many mitochondrial diseases in human beings. We should look at the evidence. Work is still being done on this; such embryonic research is difficult, because when we try to make embryos by this method we have to look at the mitochondria. It must be asked whether there is a possibility that material from the nucleus&#151;the DNA&#151;also adds things to the mitochondria, and whether the mitochondrial DNA does, too. Is there an interaction between them, and what actually happens? It appears that in certain cases with such hybrids, human mitochondria starts to appear. It can be assessed by its DNA. Therefore, there is still a lot to learn in that area, even though it is only 0.1 per cent. of DNA. However, there is no evidence that this affects the stem cells produced, and the way they grow, and how they look. Their morphology is one thing, but their biochemistry is another thing, and there is no evidence of any changes in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80512-0011.htm_para27"><a name="08051220000140">It must be pointed out that this is all being done in a very regulated work environment. That regulation is done not only by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, but by local ethical committees. It is necessary to get permission from them to do this kind of research. Lord Winston in the other place complains, of course, saying there is too much regulation; but we have a lot of regulation that makes this work.</p>

 My constituents have a range of views on this issue, and for the avoidance of doubt I have posted details of my views on the matters under discussion on my website. Therefore, I will not have to repeat a lot of the arguments we have heard this afternoon, and I can concentrate on broadening the debate a little.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08051231000002">The most important thing to say is that I fundamentally believe in respecting other people&#146;s views. I happen to come at this matter from a Christian viewpoint. I know that there are as many different views within, for example, the Muslim faith as within the Christian faith, and we should not start sniping at each other along those lines. Respect is crucial, not least, as my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) pointed out, for the scientific community. I know of no scientists&#151;GPs, clinicians, or the people working in the fertility clinic or the genetics unit in Salisbury district hospital&#151;who do not have an in-built sense of responsibility for the ethics of what they are doing. It is fundamental to everything they undertake, so I have huge respect for the scientific community in all of this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08051231000003">Like some other Members present, I am a veteran of the 1990 legislation, and the law that we produced then&#151;thanks to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)&#151;has stood the test of time and served us well. However, it is time to bring it up to date. Last year, a Joint Committee of Lords and Commons sat to examine the proposed legislation. I served on it. We made extensive recommendations to both Houses of Parliament and to the Government, as a result of which the Government have abandoned some of their proposals and changed others. I pay tribute to Ministers both in post then and now, and also to the Bill team at the Department of Health, who had an exceptionally difficult task in drawing up the Bill as it currently stands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08051231000004">The Government are doing the right thing. We must have an updated Act of Parliament to make sure our scientists are working within the proper framework in terms of moral and ethical issues as well as practical, legal issues and considerations. Of course, this Bill is not being rushed through. The process has been continuous ever since the Warnock committee started its work in 1982. It has been continually on the back burner, and occasionally on the front burner as we have had to face individual issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08051231000005">I want to underline something that the hon.  Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) said: the importance of having a national bioethics commission. The high court of Parliament is, de facto, our national bioethics commission. Every point of view is found and expressed in both Houses, and last year on the Joint Committee we had people of many religious views, varying from a rabbi to a bishop of the Church of England to a Wee Free Presbyterian and others, as well as people of no faith at all. That is how it should be.</p>

Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), that went to Sweden and to Italy to examine their bioethics committees, I am sure that the best bioethics committee is the Houses of Parliament. I emphasise and support what he said about the need to have a standing Joint Committee of both Houses along the lines of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, so that we can consider these issues as they arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08051231000007">It is important to underline the fact that the moral framework of the law, which was devised all those years ago by Baroness Warnock, still stands today. Three moral principles&#151;first, that all human tissue is special and uniquely demanding of respect; secondly, that embryos can only be used for up to 14 days, the point at which the primitive streak emerges; and, thirdly, that no embryo that has been used for research may ever be implanted in a woman&#151;are pillars that are fundamental to the morality of this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08051231000008">I said that I come at this from a Christian point of view: I am a fully paid-up member of the Church of England. I am grateful to the Archbishops Council for the advice that it has made available to all Members of this House on the exact position of the Church of England, because that is important. On all this free-vote territory and on all these moral issues, I always seek the advice of theologians and priests whom I respect before sticking my head above the parapet. It is important to recognise, as a starting point, that a human embryo needs protection because it has the potential to develop as a person, or persons, made in the image of God. We believe that the Church is called to balance its concern for healing and saving lives with its equally strong concern to see the moral significance of all human life, including the embryo, respected for its sacred nature. That is the position of my Church, and it is my position too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08051231000009">Of course, some Christians regard an embryo from the moment of conception as a person made in God&#146;s image, and therefore they oppose all experimentation on the embryo. I fully respect that view, although I do not agree with it. I take the gradualist approach, viewing embryos as much more than just cellular material, but I support limited experimentation in the first 14 days. I am not going to dwell on the individual challenges facing the House beyond that. Perhaps when we return next week for two days in Committee on the Floor of the House and perhaps if I have the honour of serving on the Public Bill Committee later, we will go into that in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08051231000010">One issue has not been mentioned so far: what should be put on a birth certificate? I think that the state has a moral duty not to be party to a deliberate deception about a person&#146;s genetic history. The evidence convinces me that everyone has the right to know the identity of their biological parents, and it also suggests that the best approach is for the social parents to inform their children at the earliest opportunity, at the most appropriate moment, of their origin. However, for the avoidance of doubt and to be fair to everyone, there is a case for printing on every birth certificate a notice of other state agencies that may hold additional information on a person&#146;s genetic history. Therefore, no one would be discriminated against and everybody would know that it might be worth checking, if there is any doubt and one&#146;s &#147;parents&#148; have not told one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08051231000011">One other issue is important. When the Joint Committee took evidence from a very wide range of people, one of the things we were seeking after truth to discover was what people in this country actually thought about stem cell research and about this Bill. The answer was clear: it was that we do not know. The Committee concluded:</p>
<a name="80512-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="08051231000279"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We find it unhelpful that witnesses on both sides of the argument have claimed to represent the public view, where supporting evidence for this is lacking.&#148;</p>

 It was a pleasure to serve on the Committee with my hon. Friend, to discuss issues with him and to agree with him about birth certificates. He mentioned that the view was that we did not know public opinion. As I recall it, that view came from the science editor of <i> The Times</i>. If one were to examine the formal consultation process, one would find that the view was very clearly that the majority of the public were against moving towards human admixed embryos. </p>

 There is a difficulty with this matter. I have produced from my copious notes the result of a poll that was produced recently in the national press. It asked:</p>
<a name="80512-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="08051231000280"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Should human-animal embryos be allowed?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08051231000014">All sorts of statistics were printed, one example being that 50 per cent. of people said yes to that. It also asked:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08051231000015">Some 40 per cent. of people said yes to that whereas 32 per cent. said no&#151;or possibly the other way round. The poll is extraordinary, but it does not represent public opinion in the sense of social indicators as the result of basic, serious, professional, social science research into public opinion in this country in this area&#151;we have it not. The Government have admitted that no such research has been done, which is why the Joint Committee, on which my hon. Friend and I served, has recommended that the Government should forthwith start doing that research; they should commission that serious research, so that we do not have to rely on what <i> The Sun</i> says its readers think or on what any other organ thinks its readers think.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a characteristically sagacious speech. May I put it to him that much depends upon what question is asked? Moreover, there are Members who say, &#147;My postbag says&#148; without it perhaps having occurred to them that people of a particular view, especially those who are against a Bill, are probably, on the whole, more likely to write than those who are in favour of it. Would it not be a good idea simply for us to accept that we are not necessarily tribunes and that we cannot be sure of public opinion, but that we are here to exercise our judgment in the national interest?</p>

received hardly anything at all on this issue in my postbag; I have perhaps received four or five letters, probably 20 e-mails and a postcard campaign or two, to which I have courteously replied. Nevertheless, none of us should assume that we know what all our constituents think&#151;I do not. I always listen carefully and courteously when constituents tell me their view, but I then have to make my judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08051231000019">I hope that I have explained one or two of the reasons why I come to my judgment that this Bill is a sensible and practical one. It has gone through the mill of the opinion of both Houses of Parliament. It strives to provide a framework that will ensure that our scientific community and our clinicians can care better for people in this country who are ill, or who will be in the future, and can relieve the problems that they suffer. As someone who observed my dear mother dying of Alzheimer&#146;s disease, I do not need any convincing of what it would mean if only we could begin to understand how to put all those sorts of diseases right. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08051231000020">I believe that the Bill is a great force for good and a step in the right direction, rather than the wrong one. It is a natural evolution of the current position. As a Parliament, we must always be careful not to go too far. We must accept that it is our responsibility to say to the scientific community, &#147;Just because you can do something, that does not mean you should.&#148; We should come back to this matter in far less than another 20 years, and I am sure that we will do so. Indeed, I recall saying on Third Reading of the 1990 Bill that the scientific community will be back within 10 years. It took less than 10 years for us to take a view on certain limited aspects of the matter, but here we are again looking at this very important Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08051231000021">It is a comment on how far we have progressed that there are perhaps 50 hon. Members on both sides of the House this afternoon and that people are speaking passionately about the subject. That was nothing compared with the situation in 1990, when people were sitting in the gangways, standing at the doors and standing behind the Bar of the House with enthusiasm. I suspect that that will happen again next week, when we deal with some of the more controversial issues, but we have moved on and there is a much greater public understanding, as well as acceptance, of what our medical clinicians and researchers are trying to do. I support the Bill on Second Reading. I will not be supporting every move all the way through that the Government wish to make, but, on the whole, this is a Bill worth having.</p>

 I am delighted to be able to speak in this debate on a Bill that I very much welcome. I believe that the Bill will strengthen regulation in important areas of scientific research, including embryo and stem cell research. That is a very grey area at the moment. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) said, a lengthy process of review has taken place since the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. It has included White Papers, consultations and Committee reports, so this Bill has not been entered into lightly. In the other place, they did an extremely thorough job of debating and scrutinising the Bill. Judging by today&#146;s contributions so far, the debates in this House will be equally stimulating.  <br>

I listened with great pleasure to the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who spoke with elegance, knowledge and humour on these important issues and managed to poke fun at the Government at the same time. It was an impressive masterclass.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08051231000023">I am pleased that the Bill sets out a clear regulatory framework for scientific research, although the HFEA already requires researchers to demonstrate that the research is necessary and it is permitted only if it fits within the research purposes set out in the 1990 Act and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Research Purposes) Regulations 2001.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08051231000024">Although embryonic cell research is still in its early stages, it is already advancing scientific understanding of early human development and the processes involved in particular diseases, such as Parkinson&#146;s and motor neurone disease. In the future, it could lead to the development of new cell-based therapies for these conditions. Like other colleagues, I have been contacted by a number of national and local organisations, as well as individual constituents whose friends or relatives suffer from degenerative diseases, who have all asked me to support the Bill. However, every letter, e-mail and phone call also stressed the need for adequate regulation of this important research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08051231000029">There has been a great deal of debate about the replacement of the reference to the child&#146;s need for a father with one to the child&#146;s need for supportive parenting. My personal view is that a child benefits from having a mother and a father and that fathers are intrinsically valuable. However, I also believe that the most important aspect of the upbringing of any child is a loving and supportive environment where their welfare is paramount. Whether that is provided by a conventional family, a single-parent family or any other type of family should not be a matter for Parliament to decide by statute. Early research into the welfare of children born to single women or lesbian couples who choose to start a family by assisted conception shows that those children fare just as well as those born by assisted conception to heterosexual parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08051231000030">The Bill also sets out the circumstances in which embryos can be tested in a lab. A wonderful procedure with a dreadful name, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, enables couples who know they are at significant risk of having a child with a specific genetic condition such as cystic fibrosis or Duchenne muscular dystrophy to avoid the transfer of embryos affected by that condition. What a wonderful gift that would be to such a family. I support the use of embryo testing for this purpose, but I agree with the Government that it should be available only in cases where there is a significant risk of serious disease.</p>

sibling suffering a life-threatening or serious medical condition. In fact, the licensing authority has carried out a number of policy reviews on embryo testing, including on tissue-typing. Each application is considered on its own merits and a licence is granted only when the authority is convinced that the child will be a valued member of the family and that tissue from that child is the only means of treating the older sibling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80512-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08051231000032">In practice, tissue-typing is only carried out for life-threatening blood conditions and has happened in only a small number of cases. Six families have benefited from such a procedure, but the technology has resulted in children being cured of serious medical conditions. The courts have already confirmed the authority&#146;s power to license tissue-typing, and so one of the Bill&#146;s most important aims must be to make that power explicit in law.</p>

It was raised in the Joint Committee and the Science and Technology Committee when they considered the legislation. It is nonsense that there is no mechanism to bring together people from both Houses to debate ethics and advise the Government on issues of such importance, and that the Government have to look elsewhere for such advice.</p>

To allocate only three hours&#146; debate for the whole of schedule 2 is unrealistic. I think Ministers believe that the schedule is about saviour siblings, but it is significantly more than that; it is also about embryo testing, sex selection, storage limits, the licensing of therapies, the Lord Hunt test and, most important, the use of hybrid embryos.

 I commend the hon. Gentleman on chairing the Joint Committee with such dexterity and on dealing with issues of great complexity and depth in a fairly short time. I commend him, too, for his point about the lack of parliamentary time.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments and for his diligent support for the Bill. Under the expert legal guidance of Lord Mackay of Clashfern, we tried hard to find an all-encompassing definition of all embryos that were not pure embryos. Indeed, the Academy of Medical Sciences tried to do so, too. Unfortunately, we failed. To return to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, however, we should not give up; before the Bill becomes law, it is important that we have a much clearer definition of what we are talking about.

They and the House showed faith in our clinicians, our scientists and our regulators, and that faith has been rewarded.

the creation of human-animal chimera or hybrid embryos was necessary and desirable. We concluded that such research had the potential to contribute to the development of greater understanding of the genetic basis of diseases and of stem cell technology. However, the important point is that we did not say that it was the only viable form of research to develop stem cells. We did not say that, and I cannot recall that any serious group of scientists or politicians has made such a claim.</p>

Earlier, the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) made that point in his usual brilliant way. The same point applies to the newly developed technology of induced pluripotent stem cells in Japan and the United States. The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) is no longer in the Chamber. He made the telling point that if we tried to bring adult stem cells back to pluripotency, we would unleash all sorts of other things whose genetic trends are unknown. It is important that no avenue of possible scientific advancement that could bring relief to people suffering hugely debilitating conditions should be outlawed or limited.

 No, I will not. The issue of saviour siblings is very pertinent. If, through pre-genetic diagnosis, we can screen out of embryos debilitating conditions that will affect the life chances of a child, we should do it.

The Bill also provides clear, necessary guidance on the use of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, and places limits on its use.

When we were carrying out the first Science and Technology Committee report on human fertilisation technologies, the fruits of which are very much apparent in the Bill, we visited Italy. We had interesting discussions with the Vatican, and although there was a slight doctrinal difference, which I attribute to St. Thomas Aquinas, the monsignors in the Vatican were not putting out the same sort of ridiculous misrepresentation as certain Catholic cardinals have done in this country, which does the Catholic Church a disservice.

Prior to that, the issue had been completely unregulated and all manner of things had been going on. A scientist had been threatening to clone a human being; that would clearly be absolutely impossible in this country under this legislation. When it finally arrived, the law was so badly drafted that it meant that an embryo could not be frozen and that all the embryos produced at any given time had to be implanted. If there were 10 embryos, 10 embryos would be implanted. The consequence of that is excessive multiple births and all that that implies. Embryos could not be frozen, so people were stuck with thousands of frozen embryos that they did not know what to do with.</p>

Once that happens, there is judicial review and there are challenges in the courts. The courts, however, are not the places in which to make ethical or medical decisions.

There is a problem in producing stem cells because not enough human eggs are available, so there is a desire to use oocytes, mainly from cows. The results are not even true hybrids. Technically they are cytoplasmic hybrids; it is a question of denucleating an egg and putting in a human nucleus from a skin cell. That is not an embryo as such. In any event, the DNA involved is 99 per cent. human, and all the nuclear DNA is human. The 1 per cent. that remains is the mitochondrial DNA, which does not determine the character of what might grow. In any case, it will not be allowed to grow; it will never get beyond a small ball of cells. At 14 days, it will be destroyed and there is no question of implantation.</p>

Why should things be so different because there is a reproductive implication? On this issue I strongly differ from those with religious views, because human life results from the whole human being; I do not see much humanity in my fingernail, for instance.

Remember that nearly all late-term abortions are carried out for medical reasons because of foetal abnormalities that can be detected only very late in the pregnancy.

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80512-0014.htm_para24"><a name="08051231000128">We need only consider the issue of fatherhood to see the flaws in Government thinking. The removal of the need for a father in licensing IVF treatment is not based on evidence of any harm caused by what is in many ways a light-touch piece of guidance. Evidence confirms, clearly and categorically, that fathers have a distinctive importance in the family parental relationship. The absence of a father has a significant impact on a child, which can be compensated for, but not replaced, by a loving mother and supportive parenting. How can it be right that the Bill will not only remove the need for a father in terms of IVF treatment but permit the deliberate creation of a child with the intention of removing from them the chance of ever having a father? Is it in the best interests of the child&#146;s welfare to deliberately and permanently write the biological father out of their life? At a time when the Government and voluntary sector initiatives are looking at how best to encourage fatherhood, it is ironic that the Bill, in effect, authorises state fatherlessness.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80512-0015.htm_para0"><a name="08051231000131">So we should be cautious. We should not ignore the fact that Australia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium have banned what the Bill would like us to permit. Rather than being in the lead, the UK stands out on a limb as regards proposing animal-human hybrids.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80512-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08051231000132">The major problem with the Bill is that the Government are marching us up to the top of the hill of embryonic research. It is as if they are saying, &#147;We will reach the summit, where there will be treatments for Alzheimer&#146;s, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis and so on.&#148; That sounds attractive&#151;obviously, we would all want to sign up to cures for those debilitating illnesses. I need only think of my brother-in-law, who has recently been diagnosed with MS, and how much we would love him to be able to have a cure. However, this is not new&#151;as a country we have been marched up the hill since 1990. At that time, people discounted the alternative arguments for supporting adult stem cell research. Funding was restricted, although it has now been restored to some degree of balance. The summit of treatments is still far off, as it was in 1990. The Government are saying, &#147;We know we have been on this hill since 1990. We&#146;ve invested millions in limited stem cell lines. We know that there have been no treatments to date and that the problems of immune rejection have yet to be conclusively overcome. Stay on this path&#151;we will get there by a new route, through animal-human hybrids.&#148;. Everyone agrees, though, that the prospect of treatment and clinical trials is a long way off. Faced with that long journey, with many obstacles, we naturally wanted to seek reassurance from the scientists who came to our Joint Committee, who said that they were unable to establish any scientific evidence at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="80512-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08051231000133">It does not give us reassurance when we look at the summit, which many would say is over-hyped and could well be false. The real progress has been made with adult stem cell research and umbilical cord blood stem cells. Funding has been rebalanced, but umbilical cord blood is the poor relation of the stem cell therapy world. We should be marching up a different hill to ensure that we have regenerative medicine that produces results, relieves suffering and reduces health care costs. Cord blood is producing more than 80 treatments in leukaemia and other areas of immune deficiency and moving into degenerative diseases. If the Government took umbilical cord blood collection and banking seriously, controversial parts of the Bill would not be necessary. Professor Peter Braude has acknowledged that if banked widely and efficiently, umbilical cord blood would obviate the supposed need for saviour siblings. The wide storage of cord blood would increase the availability of matches, not just with siblings and other members of the family but beyond. There is a wonderful opportunity to collect and use that resource that is not being grasped sufficiently by the Government. We are lagging behind other countries in that area of stem cell research. It frustrates me that the Bill condones the creation of commodity humans and part animal, part human entities, but refuses to make provision for the valuable resource of cord blood, which is simply treated as waste in 98.5 per cent. of all cases. When we look at good scientific endeavour, surely we want to look at what produces results, and we are missing an opportunity in this country in the area of umbilical cord blood and adult stem cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="80512-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08051231000134">An issue that greatly concerns me, which threads through the Bill, is how we view life in the context of seeking cures and treatments to degenerative or disabling illnesses. We need to take great care to ensure that we are not casting judgment on the basis of quality of life, which values some lives more than others. That has particular resonance when looking at the issue of embryo selection and abortion on the grounds of disability. Jean Rostand, the French biologist, said:</p>
<a name="80512-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="08051231000292"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For my part I believe that there is no life so degraded, debased, deteriorated, or impoverished that it does not deserve respect and is not worth defending with zeal and conviction. I have the weakness to believe that it is an honour for our society to desire the expensive luxury of sustaining life for its useless, incompetent and incurably ill members. I would almost measure society&#146;s degree of civilisation by the amount of effort and vigilance it imposes on itself out of pure respect for life.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80512-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08051231000135">According to that judgment, the Bill will, I am afraid to say, make us less civilised through a lack of respect for life. I urge the Government to think again.</p>

The king&#146;s horses and all the king&#146;s men have sought  to put Humpty together again, but it is flawed fundamentally. Amendments will not be able to do it; the Bill is too short on sound ethics and sound science and it undermines human and family life. We should vote against it.</p>

controversies in leading newspapers and on the television. Before immersing myself in <i> Hansard</i>, I had only a broad, under-informed view of the issues. My understanding and preconceptions have been significantly augmented by the Lords&#146; debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80512-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08051231000138">Unfortunately, to my mind, few peers understood the biology and the law involved, which meant that only on issues such as saviour siblings, which could be properly understood because they did not have a scientific background, did we see a healthy debate in which all peers could take part. This Government have failed to heed the assessment of the Joint Committee on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Draft) Bill that the Bill lacked an ethical underpinning. The Committee suggested a joint bioethics committee of both Houses to consider bioethical issues, such as the ones raised by the Bill, and a Lords amendment, which was not voted on, suggested a national bioethics committee. Neither of those ideas was adopted, which means that neither the House of Lords nor the House of Commons will have received a vitally needed, scientifically independent bioethical viewpoint on the Bill. I believe that the Bill should not have proceeded without one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80512-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08051231000139">There has been much discussion on the topic of animal-human hybrids, and I support the views of the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes), which put the matter very well indeed. Most reasonable people would say that to combine an animal and human embryo is, by definition, monstrous. I regret that individuals who expressed such views have been accused of hype. If anyone was guilty of hype it was Professor Winston and his colleagues who favoured embryonic stem cells, which have not produced any therapies despite 18 years of research, over adult stem cells, which have already produced more than 80 treatments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80512-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08051231000140">The scientific community, which sees the embryo as nothing more than a clump of cells, denies any respect for the sanctity of life or human dignity. In my mind,  a human embryo is a potential human being, the personhood of which needs to be respected. In France, the personhood of embryos has recently been recognised by allowing women who have miscarried between 18 and 20 weeks the right to register a name.</p>

The dictionary definition of pro-life includes the phrase &#147;opposed to abortion&#148; Many of the proposals in the Bill are anti-life because many embryos will be killed to achieve the aims of the research and procedures. Most quality of life arguments lead to the conclusion that life of a lower quality ought to be terminated or that a life that might reduce the quality of another ought to be snuffed out. I cannot agree with those proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80512-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08051231000142">The creation of animal-human hybrids is based on a utilitarian mentality that human life can be treated simply as research material if it benefits the common good. Most crucially, it violates the dignity of the human person. The United Kingdom has already breached article 18 of the European convention on human rights and biomedicine by the creation of human embryos for research purposes. Many European countries would not even consider the creation of animal-human embryos. The shortage of eggs should not be used as an excuse for such research; only ethical avenues of research should be allowed. Countries such as Australia, Canada and  <br>

the USA have legislation to prohibit such research. China, Japan and South Korea may allow experiments in this area, but the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has failed to give details of any other country that has legislated to allow it. There is little appreciation of how far out on a limb the UK is in relation to the creation of human admixed embryos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80512-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08051231000143">Ethical concerns about abortion and embryology mean that advances should be treated with additional caution. Launching into ethically dubious areas will not solve the ethical problem&#151;it will compound it. &#147;Progress&#148; in this area is actually a backwards step that takes us further down the slippery slope of moral decline by crossing the species barrier and treating humans no better than animals. In fact, legislation in this country gives animals better protection than the human foetus because under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, an animal embryo becomes a protected animal after half its gestation period, which is equivalent to 20 weeks for a human being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80512-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08051231000144">The press statement issued by the HFEA on 5 September 2007 said that the public expected animal-human embryos for research to be tightly regulated. The evidence is that two applications that allow for animal-human hybrids were not required to have any additional safeguards. Even the Select Committee on Science and Technology argued for risk management because of the concerns raised by the Scottish Council on Human Bioethics that scientists undertaking such research risked creating new diseases. No consideration has been given to safety issues in the Bill, and cow eggs are simply obtained from local abattoirs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80512-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08051231000145">I come to the deliberate removal of an explicit reference to the father on a child&#146;s birth certificate. The Bill will not only allow for designer babies, but for designer artificially created families. Such registration of children on birth certificates will result in the creation of two-father and two-mother families. No account is to be taken of the child&#146;s right to a mother and a father. That right should never be outweighed, particularly not by the supposed rights of adults to choose to engineer the structure of their family as they please. The rights of adults are paramount in the proposals before us, while the best interests of the child are totally ignored. The effect on the child&#146;s identity, or their gender confusion, has not even been considered. A child is to be treated as a mere commodity, where someone can opt to become the other parent simply by giving notice. That child product, like a washing machine, can be registered by two mothers as parents on the birth certificate.</p>

I oppose unjustified discrimination against homosexuals, but I must protect the traditional notion of a family. Homophobia means a fear of homosexuals and the term is not appropriate in our current discussion.

I supported that reduction. I am primarily concerned about the women who are most likely to have to have a late abortion. They are the women who find, very late in a pregnancy, that there is a foetal abnormality; the women in the middle of the menopause who cannot believe what is happening; the women with mental health problems; and the underage girls who dare not admit to themselves that they are pregnant. Taken together, those groups are exceedingly vulnerable. We should be supporting them, not condemning them.</p>

There are strongly and sincerely held views on both sides. However, it is important to stress that we are not discussing a matter that pitches science against morality. In my view, there are morality and ethical codes on both sides. I feel, for example, morally obliged to support the Bill. I do not accept the view that it is only science that is in favour of the measure and that the opposition to the Bill has all the moral and ethical arguments. In fact, I would obviously say that that opposition was wrong&#151;although I respect the views taken&#151;and that it is ethically wrong to seek to stand in the way of some of that research.</p>

Often we see only the protest from people who feel strongly against something, particularly measures such as this Bill. It is appropriate that Ministers should know not only that there is public support for embryo research for medical purposes&#151;indeed, I think that the Government do know that&#151;but that people are willing to come out and show themselves publicly in support of the measure.</p>

The White Paper was not the best way of interpreting the results of the consultation, but the Bill is far better than that presaged in the White Paper. That is a result of the Government&#146;s willingness to listen to the reports of scrutiny committees, such as the Select Committees that considered the matter. Governments and political parties are sometimes unwilling to change their expressed view for fear of being accused of doing a U-turn, but in this case, where there is a need to consider scientific evidence, it is appropriate that the Government have done so.</p>

 I, too, was a member of the Science and Technology Committee, along with the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon), when it considered the issue in 2005. I have grave concerns about the lack of debate on human-animal chimeric embryos and human-animal transgenic embryos or hybrids. The issue is being glossed over. Does the hon. Gentleman recollect that we on the Committee did not agree about those issues and that five members&#151;half the Committee&#151;issued a separate report disowning the substantive report?</p>

 What I can say is that when the Science and Technology Committee considered the issue more recently, there was unanimity, which included the three Conservative Members, two of whom have a strong history of voting for pro-life positions. They had recognised&#151;by the time we reported in 2007&#151;that the evidence was clear that authorising embryo research would be ethically appropriate and scientifically justified.</p>

Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) mentioned. The Government have to pay some attention to the timetable. It would be a pity if some people felt that they could not support certain measures in the Bill because we had not been given enough time, although I obviously understand the pressure on Government time. The Government should hold out some hope that they will seek to amend the Bill in certain areas, if only to give clarity on, for example, whether embryos can be licensed for therapy as well as research.</p>

For example, the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) argued that after 20 years of embryonic stem cell research there were still no therapies. As the Minister rightly said in an intervention, however, the technology is relatively recent; indeed, it was only possible to pursue it in this country following the passage of the 2001 cloning regulations. I understand that there is already the prospect of two early clinical trials in the United States relating to&#151;I believe; I am not certain&#151;the treatment of spinal injuries and serious retinal disease.  <br>

Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith) citing leading scientists, apparently in support of her position. I intervened to say how inappropriate that was. Sir Martin Evans, Robin Lovell-Badge, Professor Martin Bobrow and Sir Liam Donaldson all support the measures in the Bill. Quoting them out of context and then misinterpreting what they said on specific points does not do justice to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80512-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08051231000172">True hybrids were discussed by the hon. Members for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) and for Morecambe and Lunesdale. The reason why the Select Committee advocated including true hybrids in the permissive regime and allowing the HFEA to license their use if an appropriate application came forward was that there was no good reason not to. Once one accepts that it is legitimate to do destructive medical research on human embryos, there is no ethical reason to give greater protection to things that are not human embryos. It would be an inversion of everyone&#146;s ethical compass to say that certain embryo entities require greater protection than a fully human embryo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80512-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08051231000173">It is true that scientists have not yet, beyond the hamster test, identified potential scientific uses for true hybrids, but if they do not, the HFEA would not then license their use, because that research would not be necessary or desirable enough and neither would the further test, that it is necessary to use embryos at all, be satisfied. It would be wrong to have a ban in primary legislation, however, because a non-ethically difficult use might come along in a few years&#146; time, and the House might then be required to pass new primary legislation. The onus is on hon. Members such as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire to show why we should not give the HFEA the power to license such research if the appropriate requirements are met.</p>

Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes), who is not in his place and whom I genuinely respect for the clarity of his views, argue that there were no safeguards for saviour siblings. Common law provides significant safeguards for children regarding non-therapeutic acts such as the donation of bone marrow and other interventions. It is ridiculous to suggest that hospital ethics committees, doctors&#151;who are subject to General Medical Council supervision&#151;and common assault laws would allow the removal of body parts from living children, even without the Lords amendment that the Minister mentioned, which would prevent the use of saviour sibling legislation to presage the use of solid organs. There is no prospect of children&#146;s bodies being raided for organs against their best interests, and there has never been any question of that happening. Children have always been able to donate tissue to siblings, and our having the ability to do tissue-typing in advance does not change that.</p>

One can envisage circumstances in which a saviour sibling might ask, &#147;What was the purpose of my being born?&#148; but there is no evidence that that will happen. There is, however, clear evidence that if we do not allow these changes, small numbers of children&#151;the siblings who are ill&#151;would die. It is  <br>

therefore appropriate to give the benefit of the doubt in favour of that clear evidence, and to proceed on that basis. I cannot see harm coming to a saviour sibling  in a case such as that of the Whitakers, who were mentioned earlier. They ended up with two healthy children, but the alternative would have been that they ended up with none.</p>

 It is certainly true that my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) envisaged harm to saviour siblings, but the harm that he envisaged was purely speculative. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that my hon. Friend was in danger of universalising from his sense of what would be favoured by his family? He is entitled to his view about what should apply to his family, but it is not clear why he should seek, on the basis of speculation, to prescribe for the rest of the nation in quite such a fashion.</p>

It is offensive and discriminatory to use such terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80512-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08051231000179">The hon.

In my view&#151;I think that this is the Government&#146;s view as well, and it should be the view of Parliament&#151;discrimination against lesbian couples, such as making them jump over extra hurdles, is not justified by the evidence that we have heard about. That evidence comes from research into how well children do when they are born to lesbian parents and solo parents&#151;women who specifically seek to become single parents. If that is the research finding, the onus is on people who want to put a discriminatory hurdle in the way of such people to justify doing so by showing that there is evidence of harm. It is not enough to say, &#147;People can get treated if they go to enough clinics,&#148; or that because no one has been willing to go through the publicity of a legal case, instead of getting on with their life, there has been no harm. We should start from the position that unjustified discrimination, such as placing extra hurdles before certain people, should not be allowed.</p>

It was asserted earlier that some babies are now surviving at 23 weeks, but a few also survived at 23 weeks in 1990. The point of viability is not the earliest point at which babies might survive when prematurely born, but the point at which a premature baby&#151;a foetus&#151;alive at the onset of labour would have a decent chance of surviving, without serious abnormality, independently of the woman&#146;s body. In 1990, that point was set, on medical advice, at 24 weeks. The same medical advice that we trusted in 1990&#151;we can read the debates to show that we did&#151;shows that that has not changed, and that is why the abortion time limit should stay at 24 weeks.</p>

 May I first record my support for the establishment of a bioethics committee, as has been suggested by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) and many other hon. Members? Like other hon. Members, I have received a lot of letters on these issues. Many have been from those who are against the Bill, but I have also had some very strong ones from people asking me to vote in favour of it. I am not an up-to-date scientist; I bow to the views of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris). I am speaking as a rather long-retired physician, with my knowledge of patients and of how some of the illnesses in question have affected them. I am speaking on behalf of the patient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80512-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08051231000182">People know about the horrors of motor neurone disease. Although a person&#146;s intellect remains intact, their body begins to fail around them. Their muscles can be the first to go, or their limbs, followed by swallowing and speaking. Gradually, they lose control of all bodily movements and functions, and eventually they cannot eat, talk or even breathe. This results in anguish for the patient and for their family. There are no effective treatments or cures, and it is even worse than cancer in that, because it is not a painful death, doctors cannot give analgesics to ease the end. It is truly awful, which is why so many motor neurone disease patients wish to die, and go to huge extremes to achieve a legal suicide. We must think of those people. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80512-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08051231000183">We have seen references to people with Parkinson&#146;s disease in <i> The Guardian</i> today, and the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) also mentioned the condition earlier. It starts with tremor, stiffness and perhaps an immobile face, which can result in the patient beginning to lose their rapport with their friends. At first, drugs help, but the treatment becomes more and more complicated. The patient needs more and more drugs at more and more frequent intervals, and they eventually reach the terrible stage at which the side effects of the drugs, which they cannot get away from, are almost more terrible than the disease. Eventually, the poor patient becomes a total salivating wreck, with intellectual impairment thrown in.</p>

Its original description covered dementia that affected people who could still be in their 50s, which is unbelievably cruel for a spouse who might still have relatively young children. The family can be completely destroyed. The first thing that happens with any kind of dementia is that all the nice parts of a person&#146;s personality go: their personal cleanliness and their recent memory, for example. Eventually, worst of all, they fail to recognise their best beloved. The effect on a family, particularly one with young children, is horrific. Those are just three of the illnesses for which, despite all the advances, we can do very little. So any research that could help, and that could possibly give patients and their families a gleam of hope, must be supported.</p>

It is a completely wasted resource. The Anthony Nolan Trust, already referred to, estimates that 65,000 litres of cord blood are discarded every year. Cord blood is taken after the baby is born, so there is no risk to the baby. It is wasted, yet it can be an excellent source of stem cells. The Anthony Nolan Trust is asking for support because it has the opportunity to establish a cord blood bank that would have a much wider scope for collection and distribution of cord blood than does the current NHS cord blood bank.</p>

I will certainly support Second Reading and I will be very interested to follow the debate on subsequent amendments. I regret that abortion has been brought into the Bill, as it is a matter that deserves attention separately.</p>

That is not a new phenomenon, but it has had renewed vigour in recent months and years. From well-known commentators to academics, that approach is presented not as an attack on free speech, which it is, but yet another step on the enlightenment path to make us happy, rational and free.

Among the clamour when Tony Blair mentioned God in the famous &#147;Parkinson&#148; interview, the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman kindly warned me that he would cite that, and he knows from our conversation that the quote is only partial.

Beneath the emotive and misleading headline &#147;Evangelicals fund MPs ahead of embryo vote&#148; was an article that was equally distorting, trading on the ignorance of the public to suggest that our interns&#146; passes&#151;the same as those held by 13,000 other people&#151;gave them privileged access with which they could influence MPs, and that the position of some of the MPs mentioned in the article, such as mine in the Opposition Whips&#146; Office, would allow them to exert undue influence on colleagues. There was also the old chestnut that all this was based on what had happened in the United States and heralded the rise of the evangelical right&#151;ironically, just as that influence is, quite properly in my view, in decline over there.

For children of single parents, the father may never be put on the birth certificate, or the details may be put on wrongly. The proportion of cases, even involving those in stable relationships, where, for perfectly understandable reasons, the wrong father is entered on the birth certificate is higher than Members of this House might like to think. An absolute right for the child to know its father would commit this House to a wide-ranging extension of settling of the paternity of every child born in this country.

The Bill enshrines the idea of saviour siblings&#151;embryos that are modified to be a genetic match to their siblings and then harvested for particular tissue.

The answers to parliamentary questions given by the Minister&#146;s Department reveal that since 1990 there have been no such cures derived from human embryo research or embryonic stem cell research.

That is the reason why many people who hold such convictions should object to such procedures. In August 1984, before the Warnock report was produced, I proposed to the Life conference in Leamington Spa the idea of a petition with 2 million signatures. I said that I believed that there would be a need for legislation, and that the best way to ensure that we got our case across was not merely to have a petition with 500,000, 1 million or 1.5 million signatures, but one with 2 million signatures. That petition was delivered to this House.</p>

Enoch Powell and filibustered in Committee by the efforts of the then Member for Bolton, Mr. Peter Thurnham, who was supplied with information by a young doctor &#151;Robert Winston. That contrast takes us back to some of the fundamental questions that we have to address today. These are not new issues; they are central to the question of whether we should have new therapeutic methods, with committees largely packed by those of a certain opinion, which tends to lead them to their predetermined conclusions. There is great feeling outside that something is not quite right about what is being done in our name.</p>

There is no doubt that we should all be concerned about those who suffer from degenerative diseases and the other conditions that have been mentioned, but we have to face a choice. Our choice should be based on deep and instinctive repugnance towards the proposition that a thing, however defined, whose sole purpose or object is that it may be a human life, should be subjected to experiment and destroyed for the acquisition of knowledge. We should maintain that fundamental tenet.</p>

 Avoiding any controversy, may I begin with six unquestioned and unquestionable truths? First, it is uncertain whether important therapies will come from embryonic stem cell research. Secondly, if they come, it is probable that they are a long way off. Thirdly, no substantial therapies have so far come from embryonic stem cell research but, fourthly, many therapies have come from adult stem cell research. Fifthly, it is ultimately adult stem cell research&#151;this point has not yet been made&#151;that holds the key to mass-producing and industrialising the production of stem cells. Sixthly, adult stem cell research&#151;cord blood use and so on&#151;is morally problematic.</p>

Parliament is asked to extend the programme. At the meeting referred to by the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), Professor Colin Blakemore, a former head of the Medical Research Council, asked me to have faith. Why should we not? Well, the main, fundamental reason is the possible encouragement that the research gives to a casual attitude to, or a lack of respect for, human life.</p>

an individual and the code of a human life no different from ours. Of course, an embryo is not actually an individual, and we could argue that its destruction and its treatment do not matter&#151;that it is mere human material. That has already been argued in this debate. However, that is not the view of the existing law. It requires good reasons for experimenting on, or tampering with, embryos. If that was not the case, we would be comfortable with embryos being used in cosmetics, foodstuffs and so on. We require good reasons, namely the hope of scientific advance or medical therapy. The potential risks and harms are set against the potential goods in a utilitarian fashion.</p>

Utilitarianism seldom works, because people weigh risks and harms differently. But assuming it does, we are asked to consider the benefits of extending the research programme to allow cybrids&#151;cloned admixed embryos&#151;human-animal embryos, chimeras and transgenic beings. Arguably, although it has not been said in the debate, the Bill allows a loophole for human reproductive cloning. All these permissions are not quite subject to the 14-day rule or the no-implantation rule.</p>

The real limit is the imagination and endeavour of the scientific community&#151;the ad hoc, post hoc baptising of what decent scientists do, as opposed to rogue, usually foreign, scientists. There is no rule that can be provided to differentiate the two categories, other than the claims that the decent scientists have good ethical reasons, that their work may minimally advance understanding, and may, but not will in all probability, lead to therapy. What research programme, when one thinks about it, could not meet that standard? Perhaps that is why the HFEA has refused none hitherto.</p>

 This has been an excellent and stimulating debate, which has belied the concerns, rumours and accusations that the House could not cope with such complex issues. There have been contributions demonstrating real passion and real expertise. The contributions have been intelligent and well informed, particularly that of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), the shadow Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08051231000254">The Bill is evolutionary and thought provoking, but the debate has demonstrated the significant diversity and disparity of views in the House, reflecting the diversity and disparity of views outside, although not necessarily in the same proportion. I have enormous respect for those with ethical and moral reservations about the Bill. As one who is married to a south American Catholic, I understand how deeply and passionately held those views are. The comments that I am about to make from the Dispatch Box are therefore my personal views, not necessarily those of the entire party that I represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08051231000255">The 1990 Act has proved a robust piece of legislation. Credit for that must go to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) who, with his colleagues, piloted the Bill successfully through the House 18 years ago. The Act was also built on the excellent work of Baroness Warnock and her colleagues, whose ideas were its precursors. However, the 1990 Act should now be updated and reviewed, within an ethical framework, in the light of advances in science, medicine and technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08051231000256">As other Members have said, Britain is a world leader in reproductive stem cell technologies. We should be proud of that heritage and want Britain to remain at the forefront of such scientific research, in a clear ethical framework. Britain has flourished in the field, not only because of the skills of our scientists and our first-class facilities but because of the clearly defined regulatory environment, grounded on ethical platforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08051231000257">It is right that the complex issues involved should be carefully considered in Parliament and the country as a whole, and I welcome the national debate on many of the controversial and important issues. However, it is also right that Members should be able to vote with their consciences on these key moral issues. It was wrong of the Government to try to whip the Bill, as they originally intended, and it was wrong to whip the Bill in the other place. I am pleased that Conservative Members will have a free vote throughout the Bill&#146;s passage.</p>

I suspect that if the Secretary of State and the Minister had their way, this would be a completely free vote for Government Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08051231000259">There is a large number of controversial and complex aspects to the Bill and it is right that some of the votes should be on the Floor of the House; we Conservatives have been pressing for that. I am pleased that many more Members will have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. We believe that the programme motion is incorrect and that there should be longer debates, particularly on admix embryos. If we are to debate abortion as part of our discussion of the Bill, that should be for longer than three hours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08051231000260">The debate on schedule 2, which contains provisions on not only saviour siblings, but such important issues as embryo selection, embryo research and, potentially, the issue of birth certificates, will all be taken in a three-hour period next Tuesday afternoon if the programme motion goes through. That will not allow anything like the time that should be allocated for such significant issues. We will have time to debate in detail the four different types of admix embryos, but there are significant differences between them. I will not go through them in detail now, but I want to highlight one or two key differences. Cytoplasmic embryos are a mix of only up to 0.1 per cent. of the genetic material. Transgenic embryos probably usually transmit only one gene&#151;but not gametes, which are sex cells&#151;into animal mitochondria. Human-animal chimera embryos are useful for understanding how stem cells develop into the different types of cells in our bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08051231000261">However, the main issue during the debate on admix embryos will be the necessity or otherwise for true hybrids. Some hon. Members have said that they do not believe that there are disparities between the types of potential admix embryos, but there are. True hybrids are the only ones that are 50-50 and the only ones to merge the sex cells of animals and humans. We shall certainly table further amendments to enable further discussion on these important issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08051231000262">There is a shortage of eggs, a point rightly articulated by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow). However, it must be understood that the animal eggs are used only as a vessel to ensure an ample supply of eggs for research. My hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) and others have cited the work of Professor Yamanaka in Kyoto. Recently, I was fortunate enough to go to Kyoto university to discuss these issues with Professor Yamanaka&#146;s team, which does not want embryonic stem cell research to cease. In fact, it needs to have a laboratory in California, which has a more permissive regulatory regime than Japan, in order to carry out embryonic stem cell research and continue its work on pluripotent cells. Let me quote what it said when I asked what would happen if embryonic stem cell research was not allowed: &#147;We still need embryonic stem cells. If embryonic stem cells were not allowed we would be in trouble. Achievements here are based on former work done on embryonic stem cells.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08051231000263">These issues are not mutually exclusive. The development of induced pluripotent cells is an excellent advance, but the process is not without problems. Many scientists are concerned about the risk of telomere degeneration in induced pluripotent cells, as well as mitochondrial degeneration, damage from the virus used to stimulate reproduction, and the risk of reintroducing defective genes, culminating in potentially significant tumour growth&#151;a point correctly made by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon). I believe that all types of stem cell research&#151;embryonic, adult and cord blood&#151;must continue, as we do not know which, if any, will herald cures for some of the serious diseases that exist. However, I have reservations about true hybrids, to which we will return in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08051231000264">Hon. Members rightly raised the issue of saviour siblings and embryo selection. The Bill is absolutely right to outlaw sex selection for non-medical reasons. However, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis&#151;PGD&#151;will be permitted if there is a significant risk of a child developing a serious gender-related physical or mental disability, serious illness or other serious medical condition. It is not compulsory for parents with possible genetic illnesses to use PGD, and rightly they may not use it to select any positive characteristics. The Bill also permits the selection of embryos in order to provide compatible cord blood cells, bone marrow or other tissue to a sibling with a serious medical condition. Cells are taken from the umbilical cord of the saviour sibling, and, as a very last resort, bone marrow. It is clearly very controversial, but the creation of a saviour sibling already occurs, if only rarely: to date, the HFEA has licensed tissue- typing for only six families. It is, and should remain, a last resort. In that context, cord blood is known to be an excellent source of useful stem cells. As other hon. Members have pointed out, 98.5 per cent. of cord blood is currently thrown away. Retaining more would not entirely obviate the need for the creation of saviour siblings, but it would increase the chances of a match being found for a seriously ill child. I urge the Government to consider ways of increasing the amount of cord blood that is banked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para21"><a name="08051231000265">Let me turn my attention to the so-called &#147;need for a father&#148; clause. The important thing is the welfare of the child. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) needs to be careful. We will have a great deal of debate throughout the passage of the Bill, and he must not assume that those who disagree with him start from a basis of prejudice&#151;we do not. The Bill requires fertility clinics to take into account the need for a father when providing treatment. It is widely accepted that the clause has not stopped same-sex couples and single women facing barriers in accessing treatment, nor would it in future were it to remain. The hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith), who, sadly, is not in her place, rightly pointed out that there is no evidence to contradict this.</p>

loving, same-sex couple household or by a loving single parent&#151;that is not in question. However, I would like clinics to have a duty to discuss with applicants for fertility services the differing perspectives that men and women can bring to life and the importance of both. The points made by some Members earlier about the social criteria that primary care trusts have for IVF treatment have no bearing on the Bill at all, although the inconsistency of those social criteria and their lack of transparency is creating real angst for many people. I know that the Minister is looking at that issue in great detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08051231000269">I was pleased to see that artificial gametes are to be outlawed by the Bill; it would be helpful if the Minister would confirm that. I was surprised to hear that the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) seemed to be in favour of artificial gametes. I recognise that they could lead to a therapy for those who, through illness or accident, can no longer produce sperm, but artificial gametes have inherent risks. Were that practice to be permitted, the stem cells of a man could theoretically be used to create a female ovum. The stem cells of a woman could be used to create male sperm, enabling same-sex couples to have children who are the genetic offspring of them both. One individual could have a child who is the genetic offspring of only themselves, which is not the same thing as cloning, but clearly is something that the House must prohibit. I am afraid that by prohibiting such research in the Bill, we will not stop it; it will just move elsewhere in the world. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para24"><a name="08051231000270">There are serious issues in the Bill that are not the subject of a free vote for Labour Members, and I think that they should be&#151;for example, the issue of complex mitochondrial diseases. The Bill includes the possibility of eradicating a number of serious genetic conditions that are inherited through mitochondria. By opening the door to mitochondrial replacement, the Bill could allow the nucleus of a mother&#146;s egg to be transferred into an egg with healthy mitochondria and then fertilised. That will allow women who know that they are carrying serious genetic conditions in their mitochondria to have children without the risk of passing on those conditions to their offspring. That highly innovative area requires careful research and consideration. It could provide significant medical enhancement, but it does throw up difficult ethical and moral issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para25"><a name="08051231000271">The issue of birth certificates was mentioned earlier. It is a highly complicated area and the Bill would allow for same-sex couples to be named on birth certificates, bringing legislation in line with heterosexual couples who have used donor sperm. As I understand it, that issue is covered by schedule 2, and if it is not debated during the three-hour period next Tuesday, we will not be allowed to debate it during the remaining Committee proceedings. Parliament has to decide and consider whether we believe that birth certificates should primarily be a record of one&#146;s social origins or one&#146;s biological origins, or indeed, whether a further compromise can be found.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para26"><a name="08051231000272">Another controversial issue on which the Government are not allowing Labour Members a free vote is the storage of child embryos or gametes in existing cell lines. Two areas must be looked at, in the context that  <br>

consent is the cornerstone of the Bill, which avoids the need to decide on the issue of property and create explicit property rights. First, we are concerned that in cases where a child suffers from a serious genetic illness that will prevent them from reaching adulthood, parents are unable to consent on behalf of the child to the storage of their eggs, gametes or cells to use for research into the child&#146;s condition. If a child cannot live to the age of 18, it will be impossible to do research to enable other children who suffer from such diseases to survive beyond that period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para27"><a name="08051231000273">Secondly, some valuable work has been done creating stem cell lines, which could be lost if the Government do not amend the legislation to allow cells donated in the past to be used for embryonic stem cell research without additional consent from the donor. In some cases, the cells have been anonymous to such a degree that it would be impossible to contact the donor, and in other cases it may be impossible to locate the donor. The Minister in the other place agreed to consider those issues and return to the House and we await the Government&#146;s decision with interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para28"><a name="08051231000274">Complex issues surround the surrogacy laws. In England, surrogacy agreements have no legal force, so parents who wish to use surrogate mothers have to adopt or apply for a parental order, which involves a great deal of state intervention. Parents can be refused adoption orders even though the child is their genetic offspring. Children who are born to surrogate mothers abroad also face challenges. In some countries, as in  the UK, a child will be regarded as the offspring of  the surrogate mother, but in others&#151;for example, the United States&#151;the child will be considered that of the commissioning parents, potentially leaving a child stateless and parentless.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para29"><a name="08051231000275">As the hon. Member for North Norfolk said, other significant issues surround the therapeutic use of embryonic stem cells. I am sure that we will revert to that in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80512-0018.htm_para30"><a name="08051231000276">There are no provisions in the Bill to allow the creation of embryos or derivation of embryonic stem cells to treat conditions other than those associated with reproduction. Clearly, that needs to be examined.</p>

and ethical complexity. As the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) said so eloquently, the Bill seeks a pragmatic fusion between science and the social mores of today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para1"><a name="0805139000010">The Bill is primarily an overhaul of legislation that was passed 18 years ago. It builds on a model that Parliament originally laid down and several of its proposals reflect more recent decisions in the House and in another place. Its overall effect is that of evolution, not revolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para2"><a name="0805139000011">As the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) said, the foundation that the 1990 Act provided was a considered response to concerns that there should be limits and barriers in law under a scheme of statutory regulation. The Bill is a recasting, in a similar mould, to ensure that the law and regulations can tackle the challenges of today and tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para3"><a name="0805139000012">I agree with the sentiment of the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key), who said that he knew of no scientist who does not give due attention to the ethics of the issues. That was echoed by the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para4"><a name="0805139000013">I thank the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) for his positive and constructive approach. I look forward to our debates, although I feel that we might not always agree. I echo his point that the Government&#146;s expressed aim is to ensure  that the United Kingdom is at the forefront of developments in cutting-edge science and technology, which promises so much for individuals and their families and for society. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) graphically described that when he spoke about the diseases that blight people&#146;s lives. To achieve those aims, it is imperative that good regulation can keep pace and provide proper oversight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para5"><a name="0805139000014">Advances in technology go hand in hand with  those in regulation. They are united through proper accountability and public confidence. The Bill is an attempt to maintain that unity, keeping the established foundations that have proved sound, and updating them when necessary. Failure to address those matters would lead inevitably to a loss for society. Doubts about what is regulated or what is allowed would endanger public confidence. Confusion about legal duties and responsibilities would harm public accountability. The impact would be felt through slower or stopped progress in understanding and treating infertility and serious medical conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para6"><a name="0805139000015">The Bill aims to ensure that all such embryos come within the scope of regulation, as the current law, drawn up in the late 1980s, is not explicit about these entities. The Government decided that the matter should not be left open to interpretation. We believe that the Bill as drafted provides the necessary clarity. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) explained, developments of treatments and scientific advances have always been controversial. The Bill has its share of that. It allows the creation and use of admixed embryos for licensed projects of research, in much the same way as it allows projects of embryo research. That means scrutiny of every proposal through the licence application process, which is overseen by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. For embryo research projects, the law again sets out that the HFEA must be satisfied that the  <br>

research is necessary or desirable for one of the defined statutory research purposes. The use specifically of embryos must be necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para7"><a name="0805139000016">What the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) fears&#151;that such research will be a distraction and will skew research in other areas&#151;therefore simply will not happen. The position is not either/or; it is about ensuring that the breadth of research that the House believes is important is allowed to develop for treatments.</p>

<p><a name="st_o312"><a name="0805139000017"><a name="80512-0019.htm_spnew0"><a name="0805139001005"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 Will the Minister explain the extent to which the research that will be made available will  be available on a universal basis? There are those, including me, who are deeply concerned not only about the principles involved, but about whether the research would be available only to those who were at the upper end and could afford it. Will the research be universal or not?</p>

<p><a name="st_o313"><a name="0805139000018"><a name="80512-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="0805139001006"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>
 I think that the hon. Gentleman is confusing a regulatory framework that permits research with the commissioning or funding, from different authorities, for that research to take place. The Bill is not about what research will be funded in the future from where, but about putting important regulations in place and continuing to afford the protection that the House has always wanted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para8"><a name="0805139000019">To deal with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point, having ensured that the regulations apply and that the projects must meet the proper criteria, the Bill sets out strict prohibitions to guard against abuses. It makes it an offence to keep an admixed embryo beyond 14 days and prohibits the placing of an admixed embryo in a woman or an animal. Those are genuine safeguards, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner) and the hon. Member for Beckenham pointed out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para9"><a name="0805139000020">The Government have listened carefully to wide-ranging and deep-seated views on each side of the issue. There has already been considerable debate on the issue in another place, and through consultation and the scrutiny process. Scientists do not undertake such work lightly or through mere curiosity. The primary motivation is a pragmatic issue, namely the shortage of human eggs for use in the creation of embryonic stem cell lines. The Bill is a means to ensure that effective regulation applies, while also allowing scientific endeavour that promises advances in the knowledge and understanding of some serious diseases.</p>

<p><a name="st_o314"><a name="0805139000021"><a name="80512-0019.htm_spnew2"><a name="0805139001007"><b>Mr. Burrowes:</b>
 On the subject of safeguards, will the Minister give some of the reassurance that Lord Darzi gave in the other place, at a similar stage, that the Government are committed to banning human reproductive cloning? Will she confirm in particular whether permission for reproductive cloning could be given for any purpose laid out in proposed new section 3ZA(5)?</p>

<p><a name="st_o315"><a name="0805139000022"><a name="80512-0019.htm_spnew3"><a name="0805139001008"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>
 I am happy to give exactly the same undertakings as Lord Darzi gave in another place. <i> [Interruption.]</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State says, &#147;Thank goodness for that.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para10"><a name="0805139000023">The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) is right that cloning is outlawed. I would like to reassure  <br>

hon. Members that I am speaking on behalf of the Government at this stage, not as an individual, as that way of speaking seems to have drifted in and out of the debate. The Bill is a means of ensuring that effective regulation applies and that we can undertake research. As the hon. Member for Buckingham said, the Bill will not force anyone to undertake research using embryos, whether admixed or otherwise. The controls that the measures put in place will ensure that other avenues of research will be considered as part of the research licensing process. Before a licence is given, the licensing authorities will have to consider other areas or forms of research in which the same issues could be pursued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para11"><a name="0805139000024">Several issues have been raised in the debate, and I shall do my best to answer some of them in the time available. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) talked about true hybrids, which were allowed in the 1990 Act for testing the fertility of sperm by mixing it with a hamster egg, and for related research. Any licence application will have to pass the usual tests of satisfying the HFEA that it is necessary or desirable for a statutory research purpose and that the specific use of embryos is necessary. That will give a great deal of protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para12"><a name="0805139000025">The Bill will bring all forms of true hybrids under the regulation of the HFEA, and it will be for the HFEA to decide whether such hybrids should be licensed. We are talking about wider types which will be licensed only under the specific research licence. If we do not bring those processes within the Bill&#146;s protection, we will not be able to express views or control; the law will be silent about the developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para13"><a name="0805139000026">I turn to the point on what is called the need for a father.</p>

<p><a name="st_o316"><a name="0805139000027"><a name="80512-0019.htm_spnew4"><a name="0805139001009"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 Will the Minister give way?</p>

<p><a name="st_o317"><a name="0805139000028"><a name="80512-0019.htm_spnew5"><a name="0805139001010"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>
 I should like to make some progress. The hon. Gentleman will want to return to that issue, and there will be a great deal of discussion on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para14"><a name="0805139000029">To retain the reference to the need for a father would be inconsistent with other legislation that has been passed by Parliament to recognise civil partnerships and to remove discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation. In addition, Parliament would be seen as sending out the message that clinics must consider the need for a father. The code of practice, on which they rely at the moment, could not be relied on to amend that practice in future, because of the clearly stated views of Parliament. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) explained eloquently and in great detail why that change is necessary. There are further issues to do with the welfare of the child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para15"><a name="0805139000030">If women are discouraged from approaching legitimate services, they might be encouraged to make their own arrangements. A loophole in the 1990 legislation was that it did not prevent the rise in the amount of sperm supplied by internet-based firms. We have already acted to bring those activities under regulation. Properly licensed services can give the  <br>

necessary assurances of quality and safety, along with important access to future requirements with regard to identifying parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para16"><a name="0805139000031">With regard to artificial gametes, I can confirm that the Government do not intend to amend the Bill. Our position is set out in the Bill, and there will be no further amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para17"><a name="0805139000032">On the question of birth certificates, and of telling children that they are donor-conceived, we have made it clear in another place that we would carry out a review within four years of the Bill coming into force. It is therefore a bit difficult for me to explain what has already been done, as I shall have to wait until the Bill has been passed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para18"><a name="0805139000033">With regard to the translation of stem cell research into therapy, the Government have made it clear that an amendment is not necessary. The Bill will enable research to progress speedily, but with proper scrutiny. The development of treatments will be able to take place under the controls in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para19"><a name="0805139000034">My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) spoke passionately about access to IVF in the national health service. As she knows, that is not necessarily within the remit of the Bill, but the Government are taking steps to deliver exactly what the House expects to see, which is not only that the NICE guidelines relating to three cycles are delivered, but that proper social criteria are universally used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para20"><a name="0805139000035">The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe spoke of his experience of proposing and preparing for the 1990 legislation. He told the House how it was necessary to deal respectfully with all human tissue, and that is precisely what we are trying to do. The 1990 Act did not attempt to provide a detailed definition of an embryo and, after 17 years and one legal challenge, we have to face that issue now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para21"><a name="0805139000036">I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith) is passionately committed to the issues that she identified in the debate. It will come as no surprise to her to learn that I do not necessarily agree with the points that she made, but I want to assure her that no attempt is being made to airbrush fathers from the process. We need to recognise that family structures have changed, however, and it is not for clinicians to make decisions about those family structures or to make those judgments. It is for the House to ensure that every child is a wanted child, a loved child and a supported child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80512-0019.htm_para22"><a name="0805139000037">A number of other issues have been raised. My hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale also raised the question of saviour siblings. I know that she feels very strongly about these issues, and I have a feeling that if she had been in the House in 1990, she would not have supported the proposals at that time.</p>

<p><a name="st_o318"><a name="0805139000038"><a name="80512-0019.htm_spnew6"><a name="0805139001011"><b>Geraldine Smith:</b>
 I want to ask the Minister about birth certificates. Will we reach a position in which two mothers appear on a birth certificate, but no father? How will a birth certificate be worded if two lesbians have a child, and one of them appears on the certificate as the second parent? What will the certificate actually say?</p>

<p><a name="st_o319"><a name="0805139000039"><a name="80512-0019.htm_spnew7"><a name="0805139001012"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>

 I am grateful for this opportunity to raise with my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury the impact of the work force change programme on my constituents, especially those who work in the Newport office of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. In the light of significant new developments, I shall be asking my right hon. Friend to look again at plans to relocate staff from the Newport office. Many thanks to my right hon. Friend for responding to the debate, because I know that she is extremely busy at present; I thank her, too, for affording me opportunities recently to talk about the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para0"><a name="0805139000914">Over the past 18 months I have worked closely  with groups of dedicated staff from a number of Government agencies, including HMRC in Newport and the Valuation Office Agency, who have been faced with a series of overlapping reviews in the name of gaining greater efficiency. Although I and undoubtedly all taxpayers applaud the drive to ensure value for money in Government services, those reviews have been marked by lack of co-ordination, shifting goalposts and contradictory outcomes, leading me to consider that such actions are largely counter-productive in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para1"><a name="0805139000915">I pay tribute to the professionalism and dedication of the staff in Newport who have worked as civil servants for many years. I pay tribute, too, to the Public and Commercial Services Union in Wales, which has campaigned alongside staff to highlight their concerns. The fear is that dedicated employees who have a track record of success may be forced to leave the service. In the short term, staff face an uncertain future and in the longer term, the objectives of the Welsh Assembly Government to move jobs out of Cardiff to benefit the whole of Wales have been trampled underfoot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para2"><a name="0805139000916">In Newport, we find ourselves in a particularly incongruous position. Some HMRC staff in Newport are being moved to a location on the outskirts of Cardiff, outside reasonable daily travel by public transport. At the same time, the VOA, which has also just concluded a review of its office locations, will move into part of the offices that the HMRC has vacated, use of which was deemed inefficient by the HMRC. During the debate, I want to examine how much more efficient the review and its outcomes could be if a more co-ordinated approach were considered. I ask the Minister to look again at the situation in Newport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0805139000917">The overall objective of seeking out inefficiencies and improving services may be necessary but many more problems have been created by the unco-ordinated review on top of review approach. Back in 2004, Gershon focused on the objective of releasing to front-line services major resources from activities that could be done more efficiently, but he was at pains to stipulate that the savings should not be achieved at the expense of service delivery. Gershon repeatedly emphasised the need for joined-up approaches as the key to securing an efficient future for service delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para4"><a name="0805139000918">In HMRC in Newport, a local departmental review was launched just weeks before the HMRC-wide work force change programme began the department&#146;s  <br>

review of the Cardiff urban centre. That confused staff and demonstrated a lack of joined-up thinking and planning from the start. There are a number of concerns about the fact that Newport was even included in the Cardiff urban centre. HMRC initially asserted that it was within the 25 km boundary of the Llanishen site. However, later documentation puts the Newport office at 28 km from the Ty Glas office in Llanishen. I fully appreciate that is a difference of only 3 km but the boundary has to be drawn somewhere and if Newport was outside the boundary it should have been included in the cluster group of offices now being considered, not in the Cardiff urban centre review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0805139000919">The outcome of the review was issued by the work force change team in February and the conclusion was that Newport HMRC should</p>
<a name="80512-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="0805139000996"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;withdraw from Crown Building and relocate staff in...Cardiff by spring 2010&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para6"><a name="0805139000920">The move will result in difficult if not impossible public transport options and thus increased reliance on cars, which will have an impact both on traffic in an already congested commute and also on the environment. Staff will face large parking problems as the Cardiff office is in a residential area that is notoriously congested. I understand that management has no responsibility for providing parking, and those with young families and caring responsibilities will face particular difficulties in getting there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para7"><a name="0805139000921">The initial review revealed that more than 90 per cent. of staff from Newport faced travelling for more than an hour to work. That calls into question the decision to opt for relocation. Following the review, Paul Grey stated, in a reply to a staff hot-seat question, that HMRC expected that most people would find it easier to travel to a central office, and that the majority of staff would travel by public transport. In this case, that is clearly not true.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para8"><a name="0805139000922">Given a set of criteria, the staff in Newport were able to demonstrate successfully and in great detail why moving the whole Newport team was not an effective or efficient option, in view of travel issues and the impact on staff, service and the environment. I have learned that a significant proportion of the staff have successfully made individual cases for why they should not be moved, citing unreasonable travel requirements, or caring or other responsibilities. I would like to thank HMRC for looking in detail at each of those cases and for taking seriously the concerns of employees. The members of staff concerned are understandably grateful for that reprieve, despite concerns about how the split of the team will work in practice, and how it will affect their future employment. However, that does not negate the bigger question that I am posing today about the nature of the reviews and the failure of the Department to take a more holistic approach to seeking efficiency; in fact, in many ways, it reinforces my point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para9"><a name="0805139000923">If more than 50 of the 124 members of staff will now not be transferred to Llanishen, additional arrangements will be made for them. That calls into question the whole premise of the review and reveals the failure of HMRC to undertake the promised full equality impact assessment, which could have revealed in the early stages of the process that 41 per cent. of staff have disabilities, that 31 per cent. are part-time, that 66 per cent. are women, and that a high number of staff would be unable to transfer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para10"><a name="0805139000924">HMRC has announced the closure of the Newport office by 2010, with some staff expected to transfer to Cardiff. The HMRC presence planned for Newport is an inquiry centre with three members of staff. Experienced staff who are now to be retained in Newport will also have new working arrangements. At the same time, the Department for Work and Pensions announced plans to relocate Cardiff members of staff to Newport, so civil servants will literally cross each other on the M4 to travel to new places of work as a result of relocation decisions. In addition, as I have already mentioned, the Valuation Office Agency announced, following its review, that it sees Newport as one of its strategic locations and will move into the office currently populated by HMRC staff. The valuation office will also recruit 50 new members of staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para11"><a name="0805139000925">I very much welcome the decision by the valuation office and the additional jobs, but it is hard to see how the Treasury is saving any money whatever by relocating staff from Newport to Llanishen, given that the valuation office will occupy the office space, and that a proportion of HMRC staff will have to be located there. According to the work force change programme, there would be a &#163;470,000 saving if the building were vacated. The valuation office will take up one floor, so the savings will be smaller than anticipated if the building is not fully vacated by HMRC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para12"><a name="0805139000926">In addition, there are costs associated with prolonged journeys. Many staff who will relocate will be eligible to claim money for the additional travelling. Many members of staff report to me that the travel allowance will have a knock-on effect on their tax credits, and those are the people who report that they are affected by the abolition of the 10p tax band.</p>

<p><a name="st_o325"><a name="0805139000927"><a name="80512-0021.htm_spnew1"><a name="0805139001859"><b>Nia Griffith (Llanelli) (Lab):</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree that a number of HMRC Llanelli staff would experience acute difficulties in transferring to other offices, and that by the time that the additional excess fares that would have to be paid are taken into account, plus the cost of keeping the Llanelli office open with a skeleton staff, there would be virtually no saving from closing the Llanelli office? The decision is particularly difficult given that Llanelli is in an objective 1 area. It seems quite unjustifiable in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="st_o326"><a name="0805139000928"><a name="80512-0021.htm_spnew2"><a name="0805139001860"><b>Jessica Morden:</b>
 I agree with my hon. Friend entirely. She has campaigned vigorously on the issue, and has been a feisty advocate for her constituents. I will come on to the point about the Welsh Assembly shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0805139000929">I struggle to see how the changes will bring about the desired savings and efficiencies, but they will have a negative impact on staff and, importantly, on front-line services. I also want to focus on the impact that the proposals are having on Newport as a city. Newport is a regenerating and developing city. The council, Newport Unlimited&#151;our regeneration company&#151;politicians and business leaders are working hard to make Newport a prime location for investment and for doing business. The ongoing success of Newport&#146;s regeneration has resulted in its being ranked 7th in the UK tables showing the predicted economic strength of cities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0805139000930">Success in attracting new employers, investment and jobs is shaken each time a high-profile decision is taken by a Government agency to buck the trend and take not only jobs, but front-line services such as the  <br>

employers&#146; section, out of Newport. In addition, the National Assembly for Wales has a clear policy that public sector jobs and the benefits that they bring to an area should be spread out of Cardiff to other parts of Wales. Will the Minister comment on the steps that were taken to work with the Assembly during the making of those significant decisions?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para15"><a name="0805139000931">Over the past 18 months there has been a lack of co-ordination between Departments and agencies involved in conducting the reviews and making decisions, and a reluctance to consider alternative or more holistic solutions. During the consultation period I was pleased to work with a number of partners including Newport council to explore alternative solutions, such as the collocation of services. However, these independently run reviews, with specific parameters, are too inflexible to consider cross-boundary solutions, ignoring the joined-up approach whose aim was identified as the key to success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para16"><a name="0805139000932">In the light of the situation that I have outlined, will the Minister review as a matter of urgency the decision to relocate HMRC Newport? In particular, what thought was given to the wider consequences, such as the impact on Newport or the wider aims of the National Assembly for Wales? Given the outcome of the interviews with employees, would it not be wise to reconsider the whole decision? In a recent hot-seat question from staff to management, staff were told that the decision to vacate an HMRC office would be reconsidered if significant new information came to light. In view of the fact that, as I understand it, more than 56 out of 124 staff are now to remain in Newport, would it not make sense to rethink the move to Cardiff and allow all staff to continue their careers and public service in their present location?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para17"><a name="0805139000933">I understand that the Newport office has just been given a major national project looking at 400,000 historical employer cases. Given the expertise and experience of staff there, would it not make sense to give them also the national employer work which, I understand, is looking for a home, and to make Newport truly a centre of excellence?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para18"><a name="0805139000934">Finally, I urge the Minister in future to ensure that the Department and its agencies consider a more practical and holistic approach so that agencies and Departments work together to create joined-up solutions that will make real efficiency gains, improve services and, crucially, value the staff.</p>

occasions. That is a formidable representation when it arrives in the office all at the same time. The force of the arguments was not lost on me or on HMRC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para20"><a name="0805139000937">As my hon. Friend is aware, as a result of pressures from Ministers&#151;she mentioned Gershon&#151;and other reforms, Revenue and Customs is being required to increase its effectiveness while making efficiencies. Because of the changing demands on the Department, HMRC estimates that it will have up to 40 per cent. too much accommodation. I acknowledge the justice of the case that my hon. Friend makes about the need for Government as a whole to be coherent about decisions affecting public sector job distribution. I shall come to that in a moment, in greater detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para21"><a name="0805139000938">In order to manage the pressures on it while responding to new and changing customer demands, HMRC is making significant changes to the way it carries out its business. For example, many customers now choose to telephone HMRC offices or use the internet to file returns or make claims. As a result, for some years very little work directly connected to the local community has been done in HMRC buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para22"><a name="0805139000939">Although it is right for HMRC to keep its network of inquiry centres, it is also right for the organisation&#146;s senior management to look at its back-office operations. They must ensure that those are run as efficiently and effectively as possible. In some work areas, that is done best by concentrating work in large units, but in others the best solution to meet customer needs is a more mobile work force.</p>

<p><a name="st_o328"><a name="0805139000940"><a name="80512-0021.htm_spnew3"><a name="0805139001862"><b>Nia Griffith:</b>
 Given that so many things can be done from local areas, does the Minister agree that there is no particular logic in favour of centralising things  in the biggest cities, where there are the most job opportunities? Jobs could be maintained and created in the areas that most need them, such as objective 1 areas, if the offices in those places, rather than those in the big cities, were kept open.</p>

<p><a name="st_o329"><a name="0805139000941"><a name="80512-0021.htm_spnew4"><a name="0805139001863"><b>Jane Kennedy:</b>
 My hon. Friend&#146;s point relates to keeping public sector jobs in certain locations for economic reasons. My constituency on Merseyside has benefited from objective 1 status, so I understand the arguments for that. However, as I shall explain, HMRC has a responsibility to the taxpayer to ensure that it achieves the best possible arrangement of its resources. HMRC is subject to enormous pressures to change how its staff work. The benefits gained by people working together in larger offices, so that they can be more flexible about the priority of work and the areas of work that they cover, are essential to the efficiency of HMRC in responding to public demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para23"><a name="0805139000942">As I will explain, those pressures mean that HMRC is required to look at issues across the particular business&#151;whether in respect of VAT, income tax or corporation tax. All those different sectors have been looking carefully at how best to use their resources&#151;in this case, particularly human resources&#151;to deliver an ever-improving service to the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para24"><a name="0805139000943">There must be an emphasis on improving compliance by focusing resources on the risk with which the organisation is dealing in respect of different taxes and customer groups.

intra-Community fraud, which we call more prosaically &#147;carousel fraud&#148;. That resulted in a threat to the Revenue of some billions of pounds; there was a sudden escalation in that particular type of fraud and HMRC had to respond quickly. That brought about pressures in parts of the organisation. HMRC representatives tell me that to be able to respond rapidly and efficiently to such pressure, it is better that staff work together in larger groups, rather than according to the approach recommended by my hon. Friends the Members for Newport, East and for Llanelli.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para25"><a name="0805139000944">I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East will accept that HMRC values the face-to-face contact that the public appreciate, and it is determined to maintain that. I reassure her that, in respect of the decisions for Newport, the HMRC inquiry centre services will be maintained in their current location or nearby. Staff in Newport will not be required to commute to an office beyond reasonable daily travel, and there is an established process for managers and staff, which she has described. I am grateful for her welcome for the way in which HMRC has managed and responded to staff representations. The process is open, transparent and accessible to the trade unions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para26"><a name="0805139000945">The systematic process of review designed by HMRC involves consultations and announcements on decisions, and is being implemented across the whole UK. As we heard from my hon. Friend, in February the decisions on Newport were announced to all staff and trade unions, and all Members with a constituency interest were notified at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para27"><a name="0805139000946">Newport was reviewed as part of the larger Cardiff urban centre. The proposals to rationalise work and office space across this urban centre were put forward for consultation in June last year. It is not true to say that a blanket policy of moving jobs from more rural and less highly populated areas into urban centres is being applied. The process is very much influenced by experience of what HMRC sees on the ground, and decisions have been adjusted according to the representations that it received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para28"><a name="0805139000947">Let me briefly outline some of the factors that have been considered in reaching the decision to vacate Newport. Cardiff urban centre has four offices accommodating some 3,100 staff. HMRC expects its staff requirement to reduce to around 2,800 by 2011. The decision to consolidate work on one site within this urban centre&#151;Ty Glas in Cardiff&#151;was based on HMRC&#146;s strategic requirements, the excess of accommodation, and the continuing drive to improve customer services across all its business areas. Although my hon. Friend may not agree with HMRC&#146;s decision to vacate Newport, the Department has an obligation to spend what is ultimately taxpayers&#146; money to good effect. The decision factored in the latest travel and diversity data available, and managers within HMRC are in the process of discussing with individuals their own personal circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para29"><a name="0805139000948">I well understand the concerns of some people about any extra travel time that they may face and their dependency on the availability of transport links from their homes. My hon. Friend is right that the analysis undertaken by HMRC to support its recommendations was extensive. It recognises that although an analysis of travel times for staff suggests that 88 per cent. of staff  <br>

in the Newport office are within reasonable daily travel of Ty Glas by car, a majority of staff may not be able to make the journey by public transport. In order to move to the more efficient structure that HMRC needs, it will relocate all staff who can reasonably make the journey to Ty Glas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="80512-0021.htm_para30"><a name="0805139000949">For those who cannot move, the department is looking at how best to accommodate them while continuing to provide them with suitable work and offering a variety of support&#151;for example, assisted home moves for pre-surplus staff to fill specialised posts elsewhere in the department, a public sector release scheme which offers grants to staff leaving to train for front-line public sector jobs, and perhaps moves to suitable jobs available in other Government Departments. I welcome the fact that the Valuation Office Agency has been able to work together with other departments to ensure that the best use is made of the Government estate in Newport. There may even be opportunities for staff to transfer between the two departments. My hon. Friend cited the example of jobcentre staff moving one way up the motorway as HMRC staff move in the opposite direction. In fact, this will create opportunities for staff to transfer between the departments, and I hope that that will prove helpful.</p>

meetings have been arranged between HMRC and Welsh Assembly Government officials at the end of this month to discuss the consultation process in advance of its next stage. Officials have been made aware of the policy of the Welsh Assembly in this regard. I expect the review of the remainder of HMRC locations in Wales&#151;cluster and individual locations&#151;to begin in June. HMRC will engage with the Welsh Assembly and with other Government Departments, where appropriate, during the course of consultation.</p>

I believe that the process of change will be broadly for the long-term benefit of her constituents in Newport. I acknowledge that such public sector jobs are of particular value in a place like Newport, but none the less, the changes that HMRC is making will be for the long-term benefit of the customers that it serves. It would not be right if taxpayers&#146; money were used to support public sector jobs in a way that would be unjustifiable if it were closely scrutinised with regard to efficiency. Notwithstanding the disappointment that my hon. Friend will feel on the decision on Newport, I hope that she will support the organisation in the future and encourage staff to be committed to the overall change, which will be for the benefit of the customers whom they serve.</p>
