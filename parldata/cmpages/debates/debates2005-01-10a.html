<p><a name="qn_0">1. <a name="50110-01_wqn0"><b> Mr. Peter Luff  (Mid-Worcestershire)</b> 
 (Con): If he will make a statement on the future size of the Royal Navy.  [207374]
</p>



<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50110-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 We are adapting and modernising the Royal Navy into a versatile maritime force that is structured to meet the challenges of the changing strategic environment of the 21st century. Our investment will see the Navy&#039;s capability enhanced through the procurement of new aircraft carriers, Type 45&nbsp;destroyers, Astute class submarines and amphibious support vessels. That represents the largest shipbuilding programme in decades. Our latest plans for future Royal Navy force levels were detailed in Cmd 6269&nbsp;on future capabilities, which was published by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence last July.
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50110-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Luff: </b> 
 I was glad to hear the Minister refer to the new aircraft carriers. When exactly do the Government 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 2</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>mean to finalise the plans to build those, and what is the exact timetable for their procurement? Are the Government sure that they have the cash to construct those aircraft carriers? Can the Minister confirm or deny the plausible report in <i>The Times</i> last week that they can be built only at the cost of a reduction in the Typhoon fighter programme?
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50110-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The programme, as has been explained time and again from the Dispatch Box, is currently going through its assessment phase. Proceeding in that way will ensure that we get that part of the early procurement stream right, which is part of the new smart acquisition philosophy. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would support that, although he would not have done so when his party was the Government given that much of the legacy of problems that we have is based on poor procurement decisions taken then. We are trying to ensure that all the steps in the procurement process are correct and accurate, and we seek to get things into service on the dates that we set&#151;2012&nbsp;and 2015.
</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50110-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend will be aware of the strong links between the north-east of England and the Royal Navy, not just in building of some of the finest ships but in supplying men and women to serve. Does he agree that the expertise of those men and women has once again been demonstrated in the past few weeks by the response of the Royal Navy in Sri Lanka and south-east Asia?
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50110-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 That is an appropriate and timely question, and I pay tribute to those who are building our warships and those who are serving on them throughout the world and carrying out an important role in a troubled part of the globe. The frigate HMS Chatham, which carries two helicopters, and the support ship RFA Diligence have linked up off Sri Lanka and are co-ordinating with an observation, liaison and reconnaissance team that has been deployed to Colombo. They will shortly be joined by RFA Bayleaf, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 3</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which will have the capacity to carry fresh water and aviation fuel, as well as sustaining Diligence and Chatham. HMS Chatham began work today to bring assistance to the east of Sri Lanka. They are carrying out important humanitarian work, and a range of other initiatives are taking place, some of which involve other members of our armed forces. I pay tribute to each and every person serving alongside civilian organisations in the area to bring humanitarian aid.
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50110-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Peter Viggers  (Gosport)</b> 
 (Con): The number of standing tasks undertaken by the Royal Navy has been reduced from seven to six and is to be further reduced to four because of the shortage of ships. Bearing in mind the retirement of two Type 42&nbsp;frigates and a Type 23, and given the slippage in the in-service date of the Type 45&nbsp;to 2009, how can we be sure that we have enough ships even to fulfil four standing tasks? Is this the right time to reduce the Navy&#039;s presence, when the maritime stability that the Royal Navy is able to provide worldwide is so very valuable?
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50110-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman should have listened to the earlier answer. We are engaged in the largest warship-building programme for many years. That is being done to ensure that we have the capability to meet the threats of the future. That, of itself, means that we have to consider whether the legacy of ships that we have should be retained or decommissioned, and decisions on the contingent tasks expected of them have been taken on the basis of military assessments of what the threat level will be. In the view of the military advisers in the Royal Navy, what we seek to do is deliverable and achievable and will enable the Royal Navy still to rank among the very highest in the world.
</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50110-01_spnew6"><b> John Robertson  (Glasgow, Anniesland)</b> 
 (Lab): May I congratulate my right hon. Friends the Minister of State and the Secretary of State on all their work in securing ships for the Clyde, and say on behalf of workers on the Clyde how grateful they are for the jobs? Both my right hon. Friends know, however, that the most important time is when the steel gets cut, as we then know that the ships will be built. Can the Minister of State tell us when the first steel will be cut for the carriers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="50110-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I cannot. If I could, we would have announced it. Obviously, that is a very important announcement. I know that my hon. Friend takes a close interest in this matter, and is assiduous in representing not only his constituents&#039; interests but the interests of shipbuilding overall in the UK. He recognises the importance of these programmes, as he did in his question. When we move through the assessment phase, the next part of the process will get under way, and we will see that steel being cut. I am sure that there will be cheers throughout the UK on that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50110-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Gerald Howarth  (Aldershot)</b> 
 (Con): Is it not now clear that the Government&#039;s ill-judged plans to cut the number of frigates and destroyers from 32&nbsp;to 25, described by the First Sea Lord in post as &quot;a painful cut&quot;, will inhibit severely the UK&#039;s ability to respond to unforeseen circumstances such as we have witnessed in the Indian ocean? Does the Minister of State agree that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 4</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the size of the Royal Navy needs to take into account the ability of Britain&#039;s armed forces to respond to such disasters? On the deployment of HMS Chatham, which he mentioned, when did the Secretary of State authorise that deployment? Is there any truth in the report in <i>The Sun</i> today that the Government plan to send a fleet of 12&nbsp;ships next week, apparently including both aircraft carriers, on a mercy mission? If that is true, where are those ships to come from as they are not there at the moment?
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50110-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I do not think that I should respond to speculation in any newspaper, even one as illustrious as <i>The Sun.</i> I cannot give the precise date at which the decision was taken on HMS Chatham, but it was taken immediately we were aware that we had capabilities in the region to meet needs there, and that it would serve a good purpose. I can obtain the precise date for the hon. Gentleman and write to him accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">I take note of what the hon. Gentleman says about the First Sea Lord&#039;s comments. We recognise, and we have always said, that the current process of transition across all three parts of the armed forces is painful. To get to the new, however, we must also deal with legacy issues. If I read him correctly, he is saying that he would keep every capability that we have currently, plus engaging on the same shipbuilding programme on which we are engaged, and possibly even more so. How will he afford that? What is his budget? Is it not better to be a bit more realistic, recognise that this is the biggest warship-building programme for decades, and pay tribute to the MOD and Ministers for achieving that?

</p>



<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50110-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): </b> 
 The armed forces&#039; principal role in Iraq is helping to provide the security conditions for reconstruction and political development. We are focused on developing the capability and capacity of the Iraqi security forces, and 115,000&nbsp;Iraqi security personnel are now trained, equipped, and operating across Iraq. On the recommendation of the General Officer Commanding, we will soon be deploying the extremely high readiness reserve battalion for Operation Telic, which is 1st Battalion the Royal Highland Fusiliers, from Cyprus to the Multi-National Division (South-East) for a limited period in support of election security. Four hundred extra troops will be deployed to Iraq.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50110-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 UK armed forces have also contributed directly to reconstruction, working with the Department for International Development, the US Project and Contracting Office and the Iraqis. We have supported some 1,120&nbsp;quick impact projects, including repair of essential transport services, the refurbishment of hospitals and schools, and the emergency infrastructure programme.
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="50110-01_spnew13"><b> Hugh Bayley: </b> 
 Unlike Conservative Members, I am pleased that British forces have played a role in training Iraqi security forces. May I ask my right hon. Friend how well those Iraqi forces trained by Britain have been performing the difficult tasks of dealing with the extremist terrorists who want to stop the election taking place?
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="50110-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right to give significant praise to those Iraqis who are risking their lives day in, day out for the future of their country. They are working hard to ensure that the date of 30&nbsp;January is kept to and that democratic elections can take place. It is obviously our responsibility, as part of the coalition in Iraq, to support that effort and that is what we are intending to do. My hon. Friend is certainly right: across the country Iraqis are working hard in the future interest of their country. We want to give them as much training as they require in order to assume full responsibility for their own security.
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50110-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Keith Simpson  (Mid-Norfolk)</b> 
 (Con): The Secretary of State decided to slip out this substantial announcement during Defence questions and I fully appreciate, Mr. Speaker, that it placed you in a difficult position. This is an important statement in the lead-up to the elections, when the security situation in Iraq is very serious indeed. It is not sufficient for the Secretary of State to do this; it should be a statement. Many colleagues on both sides of the House would like the opportunity to press him on this. Will the Secretary of State give a guarantee that he will come back to the House and turn this into a proper statement so that all colleagues today might&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50110-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. I do not want the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) to tell me how to do my job&#151;he just would not know where to start. The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) did not take as long as the Secretary of State on his question. The Secretary of State&#039;s reply was long and I have given some leeway to the Front Bench. That is the way I do things, so the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green will not tell me what to do.
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50110-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 As Opposition Front-Bench Members well know, the force to be deployed to Iraq for a limited period to deal with election security is held at very, very high readiness specifically for that purpose&#151;something that is well known to Members on the Opposition Front Bench, so their supposed outrage is entirely synthetic. To suggest that coming to the Dispatch Box and making a statement is somehow slipping out an announcement, is, as they well know, nonsense.
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="50110-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Simpson: </b> 
 I think that the Secretary of State has missed the point. This is a serious issue. It is obviously 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 6</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a further deployment. Does he not accept the fact that Members on both sides of the House see it as a good supporting issue in terms of the cuts of the four infantry battalions that he only announced before Christmas? In fact, it seems to me and to Opposition Members that it means that we require more infantry, not the cuts that he has carried out.
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="50110-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 Again, the hon. Gentleman knows full well that those forces were held in Cyprus before Christmas at the time when I was making the announcement to which he has referred, so this has no relevance whatever to the question of adjustments in the infantry&#151;no relevance at all. He knows that. All that he is doing, once again, is making the cheapest political points&#151;party political points&#151;out of something that is very important and very serious.
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="50110-01_spnew20"><b> Dr. Gavin Strang  (Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh)</b> 
 (Lab): While the tasks of troops are clearly a matter for military leaders in Iraq, will my right hon. Friend indicate whether any movement of the additional forces&#151;to the north, to Baghdad, to the so-called Sunni triangle&#151;would require a decision of the Prime Minister on his recommendation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="50110-01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 All these matters are obviously discussed in detail with the Prime Minister. A major deployment to Baghdad would certainly involve a decision by the Prime Minister on my recommendation, but I assure my right hon. Friend and the House that no such decision has been taken, or is indeed in prospect.
</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="50110-01_spnew22"><b> Mr. Paul Keetch  (Hereford)</b> 
 (LD): The statement slipped out by the Secretary of State is indeed outrageous, because it comes at a time when newspaper reports in the United States talk about their forces becoming hit squads, when a senior US general is visiting Iraq to determine the process and the role of forces there and when our Prime Minister has said that he is in discussions with President Bush about the future role of British forces in Iraq. The announcement today should have been properly determined and discussed by the House of Commons through a statement, not simply slipped out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Finally, does the Secretary of State realise that if he is deploying troops inside the British sector to support our purposes&#151;our own force protection&#151;Liberal Democrat Members and people throughout the country would accept it, but to deploy forces, potentially, outside the British sector will not receive the wholehearted support of many people in this country?
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="50110-01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman missed the answer that I gave to the previous question&#151;perhaps he prepared his question well in advance of today&#039;s Defence questions. But this is Defence questions and I simply do not understand why in the course of Defence questions&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Gentleman looks at the Order Paper, he will see that four of the first six questions are about Iraq, giving right hon. and hon.

 My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to that appalling murder, alongside a number of others that have regrettably occurred. As my hon. Friend said, it demonstrates that those who perpetrate those appalling acts are trying to undermine the fabric of Iraqi society and our efforts to support the election process due to take place on 30&nbsp;January, by trying to murder and intimidate those who are trying to build other aspects of a civil society.

 To support the process of commercialisation of Basra airport, the UK Ministry of Defence is providing air traffic control, communications support and fire and rescue services to the Iraqi Ministry of Transport. In addition, we continue to support the training of key airport personnel and assist in the installation of new equipment. The reopening of Basra airport represents a boost to the reconstruction efforts in southern Iraq and will help to bring further economic regeneration. Basra airport received its first commercial flight, organised by Iraqi Airways, on 1&nbsp;January 2005, and the first Hajj flight from Basra to Jeddah took place on 3&nbsp;January 2005.

The process of improving conditions is continuing, and the assistance being provided by British forces is part of that. On my last visit, shortly before Christmas, I had detailed discussions with the governor about the commercial benefits that he anticipated would flow to Basra and the south of Iraq from opening the airport, which is why we were so determined to get the first commercial flight in as soon as we could.

 Shortly after my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced NATO&#039;s initiation of ISAF&#039;s expansion across northern Afghanistan last June, a new NATO plan for ISAF came into effect.

The force supports the Afghan Government&#039;s counter-narcotics strategy. For example, it collects intelligence and disseminates the intelligence that it encounters on narcotics.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Government as one of the poorest in the country, the maintenance of links such as the civilian air service operating from RAF St. Mawgan is particularly important for the area, and for joined-up government. Short-term decisions on military deployment should not outweigh the long-term needs of the military at RAF St. Mawgan&#151;nor, indeed, should they put at risk domestic civilian services.

The airfield is part of the review of 73&nbsp;airfields, including 50&nbsp;prime airfields, which are being examined in terms of future aircraft capability. If a decision were made to place that capability at St. Mawgan, it would be a significant boost and boon to the local area and economy. However, there may be a knock-on effect for the civilian use of the airfield. The issues are therefore complex, and we must work our way through them, recognising the importance of the aerodrome to the area. I shall meet the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon.

 The Ministry of Defence provides a high standard of support to legitimate defence exports. The Defence ministerial team plays a full part in this work and Ministers have continued to promote UK defence exports vigorously.

However, the UK Government are supporting BAE Systems&#039; Archerfish bid in the current US one-shot mine disposal competition.

<a name="stpa_0">In the early hours of 26&nbsp;December, the earth moved along some 1,200&nbsp;km of the sea bed, creating first a sea in retreat, then a sea borne along by a wave of such force that it literally obliterated not just the area of the coast at Aceh nearest to it, but land over 3,000&nbsp;km from its epicentre. It was a force of nature so unimaginable in its power and catastrophic in its impact that it quite simply washed the life out of villages, towns, tourist resorts and anything alive on the water in areas across the entirety of the Indian ocean. It affected Indonesia, Sri Lanka, south India and the Andaman and Nicobar islands, the Maldives, Thailand, Burma, Malaysia, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, the Seychelles and Bangladesh.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-03_para2">
<a name="stpa_1">The estimated number of people killed now stands at over 150,000, with millions of people forced away from their homes. As well as the devastating loss of life and immediate suffering, there are significant longer-term implications. Many people have lost their means of earning a living. Fishermen have lost their boats and nets; farmers&#039; crops have been destroyed; roads, bridges and buildings are damaged or destroyed, as are coastal areas where livelihoods are dependent on tourism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-03_para3">
<a name="stpa_2">We should begin by expressing the total unity of the House in giving our deepest condolences for the loss of life in those countries directly affected by the tsunami, and to all in this country who have lost family members, friends and colleagues in the disaster. Scarcely any of us here will not know someone whose life has been touched by this event. None of us will have not been moved to tears as each night we saw, with mounting horror, the human tragedy that followed the natural disaster.

I shall deal first with the loss of British lives, secondly with immediate humanitarian help for the countries concerned, and finally with the longer-term issues of redevelopment and reconstruction.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-03_para6">
<a name="stpa_5">Let me begin with our own citizens. The number of confirmed dead is now 51. The number of category 1&nbsp;of the missing&#151;that is, those highly likely to be lost&#151;is, including the 51, now 453, up from 443&nbsp;last Friday. Of those, 371&nbsp;are in respect of Thailand and 50&nbsp;in respect of Sri Lanka. The numbers in category 1&nbsp;have stopped rising so rapidly. Not all of them will prove actually to be dead, though many may. The category 2&nbsp;figure, relating to those unaccounted for in the region but not in the &quot;highly likely&quot; category, now stands at 871, down from over 2,000&nbsp;late last week. Previous experience, I am advised, tells us that that figure may never fall to zero.

<a name="stpa_7">There are 75&nbsp;police officers working in Thailand and Sri Lanka, both to assist in an international effort to recover and identify the dead, and to give specialist advice to our Foreign Office teams in those countries.

<a name="50110-03_para9">
<a name="stpa_8">Sadly, many victims were swept away by the force of the tsunami and their remains may never be recovered. In other cases, and as time goes by, forensic identification of the remains becomes extremely hard. DNA testing may be required and that will take time. I know that that will only add to the agony of the families concerned. I am afraid, however, that no short cuts are possible. The pain and upset that could be caused by mistakes would be even worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-03_para10">
<a name="stpa_9">The Foreign Office has funded the deployment of portable mortuary facilities to the disaster areas in Sri Lanka and Thailand and is working closely with international undertakers to facilitate the repatriation of bodies once they have been positively identified. British officials and police officers are now working with the families of the victims to repatriate remains where appropriate and to help the injured to get home. The Foreign Office has assisted affected families with the cost of repatriating remains; immediate medical expenses for those seriously injured; medical evacuation; and return travel for two members of the victim&#039;s family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-03_para11">
<a name="stpa_10">The emergency call centre took over 40,000&nbsp;calls at the peak, and has taken over 135,000&nbsp;in total. Over 200&nbsp;family liaison officers have been appointed to support every family of British nationals we think are highly likely to have been involved. I should explain that that figure is lower than the number of likely deaths because some families have unfortunately lost a number of relatives in this terrible tragedy. We are also looking to provide family liaison officers for families in the affected countries where appropriate and are supporting families in the UK who have lost family members who lived in those affected countries, particularly in Sri Lanka, where over 30,000&nbsp;people were killed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-03_para12">
<a name="stpa_11">The Foreign Office has also ensured that there are full reception arrangements at airports for people returning to the UK. That includes tailored medical attention where necessary, assistance with getting home and access to psychological and emotional support services. The British Red Cross has also established a helpline for victims of the disaster and their families and a family support network for those affected.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_12">I would like to say some words about the Foreign Office, police and other staff involved in this operation. The complexity of the operation is obvious. The grief of the families is manifest and absolutely understandable. There could not be circumstances more taxing. There will inevitably be mistakes made or unintended insensitivity in certain cases. However, I am clear that those staff on the whole have done a quite magnificent and exceptional job and I would like to express our heartfelt thanks to them.

The next day, DFID began airlifts of tents and plastic sheeting in response to an urgent request from the Government of Sri Lanka. A series of airlifts followed, including approximately 80&nbsp;tonnes of water donated to the Maldives and enough basic emergency medical supplies to Indonesia to treat 100,000&nbsp;people for three months. We focused our immediate effort on support to the United Nations humanitarian organisations, the Red Cross movement, non-governmental organisations and a range of practical actions, such as delivery of urgently needed relief items, including water, water containers, tents and blankets and plastic sheeting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-03_para15">
<a name="stpa_14">As time has passed, it has become clear that the biggest challenges are in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. The UN is leading the international humanitarian response, and Britain is supporting the UN co-ordination and logistics effort to improve delivery of assistance. In Indonesia, we have provided equipment to help establish the UN field office in Banda Aceh, plus five helicopters and some vehicles to the UN for use in the Aceh province. We have also provided two experts for its assessment team, two UK emergency teams and three military operations teams, which are working closely with local government and partner nations to assess needs. We also have a range of medium and heavy-lift cargo aircraft&#151;including RAF Hercules and Tristar aircraft, and a number of helicopters&#151;involved in delivering aid to the region. We sent some five flights to Indonesia, carrying almost 4,000&nbsp;family tents. We are putting together plans for further airlifts, from both Europe and other regions, of relief materials to the region. We are also deploying two fully equipped and manned helicopters from the Gurkha battalion stationed in Brunei.

<p>
<a name="50110-03_para16">
<a name="stpa_15">One of the main challenges in both countries is distributing the massive amount of aid provided. UK forces are playing an important role in this. We are providing significant airlift capacity, including one RAF C-17&nbsp;plane and five C-130&nbsp;planes. Two naval vessels&#151;Chatham and Diligence&#151;have been providing assistance off Sri Lanka, together with their Lynx helicopters.

The British Government&#039;s contribution is as follows. I have agreed that the Government will increase their pledge to the immediate humanitarian response from &#163;50&nbsp;million to &#163;75&nbsp;million, with an additional &#163;25&nbsp;million from the Treasury&#039;s central reserve. None of this, incidentally, has been taken from our existing development programmes. Of this &#163;75&nbsp;million, around &#163;30&nbsp;million has already been disbursed to the UN and to the non-governmental organisations. Our share of EU budget money allocated is a further &#163;15&nbsp;million; gift aid tax relief amounts, roughly, to a further &#163;15&nbsp;million. We will also make a special donation to offset the VAT on goods sold to raise money for the tsunami appeal, and DFID has offered to pay the cost of air freighting equipment and supplies paid for by donations from the public. Six flights have already departed; another goes tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-03_para20">
<a name="stpa_19">In addition, the G7&nbsp;is agreeing to an immediate moratorium on debt repayments by afflicted countries, for those that request it, until a full needs assessment is completed. The suspension of debt servicing in 2005&nbsp;for Indonesia alone will, for Britain, total over &#163;70&nbsp;million. So all in all, around &#163;200&nbsp;million of British Government money has already been committed or spent. But as I indicated last week, we still have to await the World Bank&#039;s full assessment of the long-term reconstruction needed. In all likelihood, that will require further disbursements. In addition, we will continue to meet any immediate requests for humanitarian assistance. I might add that the provision of so much military equipment also has a cost, which the Government rightly bear.

The world conference on disaster reduction will consider in Japan later this month how that and other similar needs can be met. In addition, I have asked the Government&#039;s chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, to put together a small group of experts to advise me on the mechanisms that could and should be established for the detection and early warning of global natural hazards.

<a name="stpa_38">In respect of the numbers of dead and the figures, different countries have dealt with that in different ways. It is a difficult dilemma. Had we put out right at the beginning the overall number of missing&#151;the people in the region&#151;it would have been 7,000. That could have caused quite unnecessary upset and alarm. We waited until we thought we were in a better position, when the numbers had come substantially down.

<a name="stpa_39">We shall carry on updating people regularly on the numbers. The interesting thing is that over the past three days, the figure of 443&nbsp;in category 1&nbsp;of last Friday&#151;that is, those highly likely to have been involved&#151;has risen by only by 10. It was rising at a far greater rate in the few days before that, when it virtually doubled in a week. I am passing on the advice given me by experts working in the area in saying that there has to be caution even about these figures. There will be people who were in category 1&nbsp;who have, fortunately and happily, turned up and come out of it. There will be people in category 2&#151;currently there are 871, but that figure is down from more than 2,000&nbsp;late last week&#151;who will come through.

For that second category&#151;the 871&#151;we cannot be sure what will happen ultimately because people may remain on that list for a long period, but that does not necessarily mean that they have died in the disaster.

The G8&nbsp;deliberations and the Commission for Africa report on which the Government are working, with other countries and people around the world, will deal with trade, but will also deal specifically with the main killer diseases and with two issues that are not often put properly on the agenda in respect of Africa&#151;conflict resolution and governance. Those matter, too. What is important is to have a comprehensive package to put forward. That package will be backed up; for the coming financial year, the Government have trebled aid to Africa from what it was a few years ago, and that is a major commitment. In my view, however, unless those other issues are dealt with as well, the public will lose heart about whether the money that they are putting into aid is actually going to be properly spent. That is why the measures in relation to conflict resolution and governance will also be a very important part of what we put forward.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50110-05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Charles Kennedy  (Ross, Skye and Inverness, West) (LD):</b> 
 I, too, thank the Prime Minister for his detailed statement this afternoon. On behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends, I extend our complete sympathy and condolences to all those at home and abroad who have lost loved ones on such a colossal scale.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_44">Despite the acres of television coverage over the past two awful weeks, it still seems hard to believe that, on our first day back after less than three weeks away, we should be having these exchanges about such monumental loss of life from such an unpredictable natural catastrophe, which has encompassed so much of the globe in the intervening period. The Prime Minister was surely right that there can be no one in the House who has not had direct contact with constituents, friends or family members who have been caught up in the aftermath of this catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_45">One person from my home area, where I have been spending the recess, Mr. David McCallum, was distraught because his son, daughter-in-law and grandson were in Thailand at the time. Initially, he had great difficulty, as did so many, in making contact through the emergency lines. He wanted me to put on record, however, that once those lines were up and running, he found them extremely helpful. I was glad that the Prime Minister went out of his way to pay tribute to those who have been manning those services. Given the scale of the catastrophe, its instantaneous nature and the difficulty of communications due to the destruction of infrastructure, their contribution has been positively heroic. We should all say that clearly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_46">That heroism has also been matched, as the Prime Minister rightly said, by the instinctive, spontaneous generosity of the British public. I therefore hope that, although the Prime Minister used the phrase &quot;British 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 29</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government money&quot; in his statement, he would be the first to acknowledge that all British Government money, whether charitable or collected through taxation, is the British public&#039;s money, whatever source or means it comes through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_47">In terms of the lessons that the Prime Minister, the international community and all of us must draw, does he agree that this kind of global catastrophe underlines yet again the need for international responses through international institutions. Some predictable voices elsewhere, not least in north America, have been saying yet again that this is an example of the indolence or incompetence of structures such as the United Nations. Is not the Secretary-General correct to re-emphasise that the United Nations is but the sum of its constituent parts? The emphasis must therefore be to ensure that aid pledged is aid given and that the technological support made available is deployable by the United Nations through its agencies. The challenge to individual member states is to make that institution and others work better for the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_48">On the United Nations, the Prime Minister referred rightly to the excellent contribution that the International Development Secretary made in a very considered speech before Christmas. Will one item for the International Development Secretary&#039;s New York discussions be the possibility of the UN establishing a well-trained, well-equipped, well-resourced standing rapid reaction disaster relief force, with a view to the future? While not being able to cope instantaneously with any disaster on such a scale, such a force would none the less have a standing infrastructure that could be mobilised more efficiently than is the case with the present more ad hoc approach of individual member states.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_49">In terms of our leadership of the G8, will the Prime Minister agree that this country&#039;s response should be viewed not just as Britain in its own right but in terms of the role that we must play in the pivotal chair that we occupy, over this year of all years, against this backdrop? As well as dealing with the aftermath of this disaster, will he also therefore ensure that the agenda that he was rightly putting forward for the British chairmanship of the G8&nbsp;is not deflected but enhanced as a result of the additional concentration of minds that must take place when we see the natural challenges on us as people?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_50">On the question of money pledged and money delivered, can the Prime Minister say more about putting in place formal tracking systems for aid pledges so that Governments can be held to account? An example that has been cited recently was the last earthquake in Iran where $1&nbsp;billion was pledged, yet Iran says that only $17.5&nbsp;million ever found its way directly to the affected area. That is a lamentable reflection on all the countries involved and on the delivery mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_51">On debt relief, we very much welcome the Government&#039;s pledge to commit &#163;100&nbsp;million a year to write off debts owed to the UK by the poorest countries. Will that pledge be dependent on the conditionality of previous debt relief measures? Surely, the Prime Minister will agree that we must make sure that the money saved through debt relief is used to build basic poverty alleviation systems in the debtor countries. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 30</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>That, too, will be something on which the international community will look to us to give a lead in the G8&nbsp;during the coming 12&nbsp;calendar months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para8">
<a name="stpa_52">This has been a most hellish and unimaginably grief-stricken period. The grief and grieving will be endless for so many, but what we can do, and what the House of Commons can help to contribute constructively through practical measures, will go some way at least to giving people the sense that their politicians are responding to the most fundamental human needs of all.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50110-05_spmin0"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his constructive response and ask him to pass on our thanks to Mr. McCallum for his kind words. It is worth pointing out that the maximum number of 999&nbsp;calls in any day across the whole UK is approximately 25,000&nbsp;and the centre was receiving 40,000&nbsp;at its peak. The heroism, as the right hon. Gentleman rightly described it, of the staff everywhere is a tremendous tribute to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para9">
<a name="stpa_53">It is clear, and was clear in the days immediately following the tsunami, that the UN is the proper body to take things forward, and in my conversations with President Bush, he has entirely understood that. In any such situation, people want to make as immediate a response as they possibly can and obviously the United States will be a major player, particularly in respect of Indonesia, in getting help to them, but there is widespread acceptance everywhere that the United Nations is the appropriate body to lead this. That raises the issue of whether it is also the body with the right capability. The points that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development was making in his speech before Christmas are similar to the issue of ensuring that there is a standing capability able to go into action at any point in time. Over the last few years, in our own country, we have established the so-called Cobra process, which allows people to be pulled together quickly. That is not capability that needs to be in a state of constant readiness, but it needs to be able to be deployed in a ready state, if necessary. That is one of the issues that the UN will look at over the time to come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para10">
<a name="stpa_54">It is important that we are not deflected from our G8&nbsp;responsibilities in respect of Africa. Yes, we shall certainly use the G8, as we have set out, to push forward the programme on both Africa and climate change; we have made those two things the centrepiece of our G8&nbsp;presidency. In the G8, our relationship with both America and the European Union will be immensely important in taking that forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para11">
<a name="stpa_55">On the amount of aid that will be spent, it is interesting that we have already spent &#163;30&nbsp;million of the &#163;50&nbsp;million that we immediately allocated; it is now up to &#163;75&nbsp;million. I think the money will be spent in this case, but it is important that we track it to ensure that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-05_para12">
<a name="stpa_56">Finally, on the moratorium on repayments&#151;the servicing of the debt&#151;those things will be looked at in the immediate and longer term at the meeting that will, I understand, take place on 5&nbsp;February. We will play our full part in those discussions and attempt to put in place a long-term framework that backs up the UN reconstruction efforts.

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50110-06_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ian Taylor  (Esher and Walton) (Con):</b> 
 The Prime Minister was right to talk about the efforts to avoid such a catastrophe in the future. Will he ask Sir David King, the chief scientific adviser, to consider the role of clusters of satellites? From my knowledge of the space industry, I know that it is possible to detect surface heights and changes in sea level. In this case, even with terrestrial warning systems, there probably could have been a 90-minute warning to people to get away from coastal areas. That is an essential way to give confidence to people when they go back to those regions that, next time, they will have a warning.
</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="50110-06_spmin0"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 That is a very good point. Sir David King will, of course, look at the role that satellites can play. It is interesting that he informed me that the costs of providing such systems are not prohibitive in any way at all. Although we talk about this as being a natural disaster that was not preventable, some of its consequences undoubtedly would have been preventable if different systems had been in place.

Will he look into their fears that aid to Sri Lanka is not being distributed equitably&#151;concerns that were exacerbated by the decision not to allow Kofi Annan to visit the badly hit Tamil areas during his recent trip to Sri Lanka?
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50110-06_spmin1"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I think that there will be a lot of concerns: once people have given, they will want to know that what they have given will be properly used.

 Does the Prime Minister recognise that many people in this country have families and relatives in the affected countries, some of whom would like to go out to assist in the reconstruction effort and to comfort their families but cannot because of the immigration regulations? For example, Mr. Sasikumar, who is from Sri Lanka, lives in my constituency and is a hard-working newsagent. He has been in this country for six years and was granted political asylum. His application for British citizenship was submitted over a year ago, but it has yet to be determined, thus preventing him from going out to comfort his mother and family, as his father was killed. Is it possible that cases of that type, where there are compassionate grounds, could be fast-tracked?
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="50110-06_spmin2"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I can certainly look into that, since I am sure that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituent will not be the only one in that position, although there may be complications as he is an asylum seeker. I will certainly look into that and let the hon. Gentleman know.

Although there have been immense difficulties in distributing aid in Banda Aceh, it is now beginning to get out, and the British Government have been very positive in the help that they have given there. However, in the medium to long-term, could the House have a quarterly report on progress on reconstruction, debt relief and tariff barrier changes, not just for Indonesia but for the other affected areas, because, for most of us, the disaster is beyond our comprehension?

I cannot be unique in having a constituent who lost a member of his family and who for two whole days was unable to get through. When he got through to Bangkok, his query was referred back to London, then to Hendon and then to Glasgow. Does the Prime Minister think that we did as well as we could have done, and if he does not, will he take steps to ensure that, the next time there is a disaster, it is easier for distressed people to talk to another human being, instead of getting the engaged tone or a recorded message?

Will he also consider how people in this country with skills that are much needed in the areas hit by the disaster can be helped to take part in voluntary schemes, so that they can go overseas and assist wherever possible?

One of the things that we are discussing with the NGOs and aid agencies that are most active in the area is how we can facilitate volunteering. We will look at that, too. Many, many people&#151;we have been inundated with calls&#151;have expertise in particular areas and want to use that in the countries concerned.

 One reason why people have been so generous in giving is probably the graphic nature of the pictures that have been sent back. I should like to think that the Prime Minister would join me in paying tribute to those brave reporters who have brought the pictures and radio stories back under very difficult circumstances.

We know that dry goods, medicines and household goods such as soaps and toiletries are in warehouses around the country, waiting to be shipped.

 On the latter point, that is precisely what we are doing. We are trying to mobilise international support behind what would be a G8&nbsp;plan.

It is important also that we are careful for the future about what messages we are sending out.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. You will recall that during Defence questions today the Secretary of State for Defence, responding to the second question, took it upon himself to make a substantive announcement about the deployment of more troops to Iraq. You witnessed the reaction on the Opposition Benches and the silence on the Government Benches. No formal notice was given in the question asked, which was about post-war reconstruction, not troop deployment, nor did the right hon. Gentleman ask to make a statement, even though in the past the matter would have merited a full statement. The only notice that the House had was the shamelessly trailed information in the media over the weekend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_64">I seek your advice, Mr. Speaker.

On this occasion, we understand that an extra 650&nbsp;troops are to be deployed to Iraq, but we have no further details of their objectives or their location. That is unsatisfactory&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Someone is saying that we are in favour of it; we probably will be, but how can we know until we know the details of what the Government are proposing?

You, Mr. Speaker, showing exquisite balance throughout the subsequent supplementary questions, called the same number of Opposition Members as Government Members. On such occasions, would it be appropriate, when there are many Opposition Members seeking to question the Government, for the balance to be suspended, to enable the Secretary of State properly to be held to account?

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_68">The central purpose of the Bill is to improve the local environment, which directly affects people&#039;s quality of life. In my Department&#039;s five-year strategy, which we published last month, I set out our key objective of achieving environmental leadership. That is at the heart of our international agenda, but care for the environment begins at home.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_69">When asked what is most important to them about the environment, most people mention the state of their own neighbourhood. That is not to say that there is not general concern about instances or levels of pollution, or concern about environmental hazards. When asked whether they have anxieties about the environment, the vast majority of our fellow citizens answer yes, but go on to talk about their locality, and especially about comparatively small-scale defacement of streets and parks, about run-down and decaying areas and about litter and dumping, over which it appears to them that no one takes action and no one cares.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_70">Contrary to the reasoned amendment, that concern is felt and expressed just as much in rural areas as in urban areas. I was surprised to learn from their amendment that the Opposition appear to be so little in touch with concerns in rural areas as not to realise that.

<p><a name="st_50"><a name="50110-08_spnew7"><b> Paddy Tipping  (Sherwood) (Lab):</b> 
 Are those concerns reflected by the generously endowed Labour Benches this afternoon, with Labour Members representing rural and urban areas, compared with the sparse attendance by Opposition Members?

<p><a name="st_51"><a name="50110-08_spnew8"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to remind the House that there are about 180&nbsp;Labour Members in rural and semi-rural constituencies. I have long believed that this was in notable part due to the fact that people living in those areas felt that their concerns were not understood. They feel that their concerns are better understood now. He is right to point out that that feeling is reflected in the Chamber.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_71">If we are to create a genuinely sustainable society, we must tackle the more local aspects of environmental degradation and damage as well as dealing with our contribution to global warming. The Bill is an integral part of our environmental strategy. It is also an integral part of the Government&#039;s strategy for dealing with antisocial behaviour. The damage done to the community by such behaviour is clear: dirty streets, burned-out cars and piles of fly-tipped rubbish have a self-evident effect. What may be less immediately obvious is the financial aspect of such damage. It costs 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 41</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>local authorities and other agencies, and thereby the taxpayer, more than &#163;3&nbsp;billion a year. The greater and, in some ways, more damaging costs may be hidden, as they are not evident in the physical appearance of our streets and neighbourhoods or in any effect on council tax or other bills. That greater cost lies in the contribution of such behaviour and of the attitudes behind it to wider criminal behaviour and to making a community feel neglected, powerless, unsafe and insecure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-08_para8">
<a name="stpa_72">The Labour party has long taken the lead in identifying and tackling that complex continuum of behaviour, which ranges from comparatively low-level environmental offences such as dropping litter and fly-posting to spraying graffiti, vandalism and more serious crimes. To deal with crime effectively, we have increasingly recognised the need to tackle the full range of criminal and antisocial behaviour. It is essential that we do not ignore low-level offences and allow a degraded local environment to give both victims and offenders the message that antisocial behaviour does not matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-08_para9">
<a name="stpa_73">The measures in the Bill should help all those involved in local communities, rural as well as urban, to create neighbourhoods in which people are happy to live&#151; cleaner, safer and greener communities. That means clean and safe streets, well-designed public buildings and spaces, welcoming parks and village greens, and a countryside free of fly-tipped waste. All those contribute to people&#039;s sense of well-being and to their overall health. The purpose of the Bill is to contribute to people&#039;s quality of life. Our belief that it will do so is based on extensive consultations led by my Department over the past two years, including our &quot;Clean Neighbourhoods&quot; consultation last summer, which aimed first to identify the problems and then to explore the solutions.

<a name="50110-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_74">The measures in this Bill respond directly to what local authorities and others told us in the consultation about obstacles to the enforcement of existing legislation, why some provisions are difficult to use, and about the changes that are needed if authorities are to tackle antisocial behaviour and environmental problems effectively. The Bill gives them the new powers and better tools for which they asked. It also gives new powers to parish councils so that the most local level of our democratic structures can play a part in making things better. Again, that recognises that there are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 42</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>problems in rural areas and that the best chance of tackling them is to empower parish councils to act in their own locality.

 My right hon. Friend has just mentioned an important part of the Bill, in which I declare an interest as a town councillor. Does she agree that it is wrong to regard the problem as either rural or urban, because waste goes from one area to another, usually, but not always, from urban to rural areas on the outskirts of larger cities? We must therefore tackle the problem overall, and does she agree that one way of doing so is by looking at the first tier of local government?
</p>








<p><a name="st_55"><a name="50110-09_spnew3"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Yes, I do. The issue that my hon. Friend and others have identified reflects the concerns of their contacts in local communities. Within the farming community, for example, there is widespread concern about the impact of some of those problems, and he is mindful of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_75">The Bill requires crime and disorder reduction partnerships to tackle environmental crime where it is a priority in their area. That is something that the best partnerships are already doing, but others have been slower to recognise the evidence of the impact of such crime and to take action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_76">I should say at once that we do not want to be prescriptive about the strategies that those partnerships are required to develop. Where environmental crime is not much of a problem, we do not demand that it feature in a strategy&#151;the whole point of the partnership approach set out in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is to tackle offending as it affects individual communities&#151;but where local environments are degraded, and especially where antisocial behaviour has taken root, we do expect local partnerships to tackle the problem robustly. Our approach, which has been strongly endorsed by senior police representatives, should ensure that local partnerships consider all the issues leading to crime and disorder in their communities, including environmental crime. To help them do so, we have drawn on the results of our consultation to give greater powers and greater flexibility to authorities and agencies to tackle such problems.

<a name="stpa_78">Nuisance and abandoned vehicles often blight urban and rural communities alike. The Government intend to secure a major reduction in their number. The continuous registration scheme launched last year has resulted in a 65&nbsp;per cent. reduction in the number of untaxed vehicles, and there has been a 30&nbsp;per cent. reduction, for example, in abandoned vehicles in Kent following the national launch of Operation Cubit, which is a partnership between the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, local authorities and the police and fire service to speed up the disposal of abandoned vehicles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-09_para5">
<a name="stpa_79">The Bill will also contribute to the Government&#039;s nuisance vehicle strategy, strengthening the existing powers of local authorities to remove abandoned vehicles from the streets and enabling them for the first time to do so as soon as an abandoned vehicle is identified. This should significantly reduce opportunities for arson and vandalism. Deliberate arson of motor vehicles costs some &#163;230&nbsp;million pounds a year. Common sense alone suggests that most of them are likely to be abandoned vehicles, so speedier removal should help to cut costs and reduce incidents that are both a nuisance and a danger.

 I welcome the Bill, and especially this part, which will be of great assistance to many in my constituency. May I ask the Secretary of State two questions about this part? First, has she responded to the recommendation from the Environmental Audit Committee that local authorities should have ease of access to the DVLA database to identify the owners of abandoned vehicles? That was a key recommendation, to which the Government have not yet responded. The Bill is an opportunity to deliver it. Secondly, although I welcome the extension of getting rid of vehicles from streets to areas to which the public have access, one of the problems in my area is vehicles abandoned on farmland, which become the responsibility of the farmer. What does the Bill have to say about that?

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="50110-09_spnew7"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Both the issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised might be best explored in Committee. I take his point about the database. There has been some discussion about whether and to what extent access creates a problem, but we believe that the powers that we are giving will assist local authorities. If, when the Bill is explored in Committee, there is any suggestion&#151;and evidence to back it up&#151;that it is defective in some way, we will look into that. We discussed fly-tipping in rural communities earlier, and I am well aware that, as the hon. Gentleman says, abandoned vehicles are also a problem in some parts of the country.

<a name="50110-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_80">The Bill allows authorities to tackle a not uncommon neighbourhood problem by making it an offence to repair or sell a vehicle on a road as part of a business. It will also make dealing with offenders more cost-effective, securing better value for money for the taxpayer. It is both expensive and time-consuming for local authorities to have to prosecute offenders through the courts, and their full costs are often not recovered even in the case of successful prosecutions. We are told that that is one key reason why authorities can be reluctant to prosecute for environmental crimes. To allow and encourage better enforcement, the Bill significantly increases the number of offences for which fixed penalties can be used as an alternative to prosecution.
</p>

<a name="50110-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_81">The Bill makes a number of other changes that should promote enforcement.

 As my hon. Friend says, some authorities have used those powers well while others have been reluctant to do so. As I have said, there has been extensive consultation with authorities. That is part of the Bill&#039;s message. Although there are aspects that Members will want to discuss in Committee, we have done as much as we feel we can to address the major concerns of authorities, and to make it possible for them to use these powers to tackle problems that cause such distress in their communities. Having made the powers available, we hope and expect that authorities will use them when such problems arise.

 I should have thought that existing powers could be used if the noise and difficulty were considered to be so great, but other powers in the Bill relate to noise, and it may be possible to explore the issue as the Bill proceeds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_82">I said a moment ago that local authorities would be able to retain the receipts from fixed penalties. Another important point is that in most cases they will be able to vary the amount of penalties to reflect local conditions. There will also be a power in all cases to offer discounts for early payment. Again, therefore, we have tried not just to incentivise enforcement but to give authorities much greater flexibility to shape their enforcement policy to what they judge to be local needs. To go back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard), that will remove the excuse, if one may put it that way, for not using such powers, because local authorities will have much more flexibility to shape policy to local circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_83">In the same vein, reflecting the desire for local solutions to local problems, we are extending the power to issue fixed penalty notices to parish and town councils and to the equivalent community councils in Wales. Those notices will cover a range of offences relating to litter, graffiti, fly-posting and dogs, all of which can degrade neighbourhoods.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_84">Parish councils may often be best placed to deal with those essentially local problems. We recognise that not all parish councils will want or be able to take advantage of those powers, but others will welcome them and already have the necessary skills and resources. Extending powers to issue fixed penalty notices will strengthen the ability of local communities to deal with those problems. Parish councils, representing as they do our most local level of government, are often best placed to understand both the causes and the needs of the victims of such crimes.

<a name="stpa_85">Everywhere, litter is a growing problem, and the Bill contains a range of measures to help to tackle it. Under current law, littering on a footpath is an offence but littering in a private garden or in a river is not. We will close that loophole by making it an offence to drop litter anywhere, including on private land and rivers, lakes and ponds. That will make it clear once and for all that dropping litter anywhere is unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_86">All hon. Members will probably be familiar with the particular problem of littering on patches of open land. We will give local authorities a new power to require the owner or occupier of land that is heavily defaced with litter to clear it and to prevent it from becoming heavily littered again. That will replace the current system of litter control areas, which local authorities tell us they find burdensome, which they rarely use and which applies only to specific types of land.

<a name="50110-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_87">On the streets, litter control notices can help in dealing with litter generated by businesses such as fast food outlets.

<p>
<a name="50110-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_88">We will also give local authorities new powers to control the distribution of flyers and leaflets, both of which can contribute to street litter, although I say at once to ease anyone&#039;s anxiety that political leafleting will not be affected.

<a name="stpa_89">Graffiti often degrades our communities and is often the result of young people using spray paints illegally. The Bill tries to reduce the problem at source by reinforcing existing legislation banning their sale to those aged under 16, and it will also make it easier to prosecute retailers who sell spray paints to that age group. The provisions are in addition to the provision in the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003&nbsp;that addresses the removal of graffiti in public spaces through graffiti removal notices. The Bill will extend that to cover fly-posting&#151;another highly visible blight on our communities. As the Environmental Audit Committee pointed out in its report, the problem of fly-posting might be exacerbated by its potential commercial advantage in terms of low-cost event advertising. To help local authorities deal more effectively with illegally displayed advertisements, we are making it more difficult for those who benefit from such illegal advertising to avoid charges simply by claiming that they did not consent to it. We will also make it easier for local authorities to recover the cost of removing fly-posters.

<br>&nbsp;<br>fly-tipping&#151;is a real problem in both town and countryside. As well as degrading the local area, it can have environmental and health risks, so we are also providing a range of measures to strengthen the legislation on, and penalties for, fly-tipping. That will enable the Environment Agency and local authorities to deal more effectively, and immediately, with those responsible. We intend to send out a clear message that this is a serious environmental crime that will not be tolerated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_91">The Bill will make it more difficult for those who transport waste illegally to evade the law. The circumstances in which enforcement agencies can currently stop, search and seize vehicles that could be involved in fly-tipping are somewhat limited, so we will widen and simplify their powers to do so. We will strengthen the courts&#039; powers to deal with fly-tippers by raising the maximum penalty in a magistrates court to &#163;50,000, and by harmonising the penalties for fly-tipping hazardous and non-hazardous waste to a maximum of five years in prison and/or an unlimited fine. The courts will also get additional sentencing powers.

<p>
<a name="50110-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_93">Finally on waste, we will reform the recycling credit scheme, the original purpose of which was to encourage local authorities to recycle household waste. The scheme does not sit comfortably with the newer economic and regulatory measures that we have put in place to promote recycling and re-use. Reform of it will allow local authorities to agree alternative ways of encouraging recycling, as fit best with local circumstances. That increased flexibility will itself contribute to sustainable waste management, and will promote better working between waste authorities, the community and businesses. It ties in well with the announcement in our five-year plan of novel ways to increase recycling through a major new retailer recycling initiative in conjunction with supermarkets, which will be launched this year; and with a Waste and Resources Action Programme project to pilot, in conjunction with supermarkets, new approaches such as financial incentives, discount vouchers and new technology. Recycling has already more than doubled since 1996&#150;97, and we are working hard with local authorities and other partners to build on that.

<a name="stpa_107">The Local Government Association has estimated that local authorities spend &#163;35&nbsp;billion a year on moving abandoned vehicles. The Environment Agency has estimated that fly-tipping costs the UK economy &#163;150&nbsp;million a year. Indeed, ENCAMS has suggested that the number of individual local authorities that have to spend more than &#163;40,000&nbsp;to deal with fly-tipping has quadrupled. The Greater London Assembly says that London boroughs and transport companies spend &#163;13&nbsp;million a year on graffiti removal, on top, of course, of what private individuals and businesses spend.

<a name="stpa_108">Part of the problem of waste is the result of our failure to achieve better performance in relation to recycling. Britain recycles only a quarter as much household waste as Germany does and within the total recycling rates achieved by Britain, there are huge variations from one local authority to another. Conservative-led Daventry recycles 44&nbsp;per cent. of waste, closely followed by Conservative-led Lichfield. That puts to shame Labour-controlled Sunderland, Labour-controlled Manchester and Liberal Democrat-controlled Liverpool, each of which musters a paltry 2&nbsp;per cent. waste recycling rate.

 I will be less selective, then. The 10&nbsp;worst local authorities, none of which managed to recycle more than 4&nbsp;per cent. of its waste, consist of nine Labour authorities and one Liberal Democrat authority. None of the worst performers is Conservative. By contrast, of the 10&nbsp;best-performing local authorities, which all recycle more than 27&nbsp;per cent. of waste, or seven times as much as the worst ones, five&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;are Conservative authorities, four are in no overall control and one is Liberal Democrat. Not a single one of the best performers is a Labour authority.

 I would be horrified if we had not continued to make progress as a country in raising the recycling rates, and what is absolutely clear is that that improved performance is almost entirely the result of Conservative local government. Conservative authorities are consistently achieving recycling rates above the national average, and the national average is consistently being held down by Labour local authorities. I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to make that point even clearer than I had already done.

 The hon. Gentleman is describing who is responsible for the better recycling rates. Worcester city council, which is Conservative controlled, has improved the rate of recycling from about 6&nbsp;or 7&nbsp;per cent. to 17&nbsp;per cent. as a direct result of a &#163;400,000&nbsp;grant from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to recycle household waste. Who does the hon. Gentleman view as being responsible for that improvement&#151;the Conservative-controlled council or the Labour Government?
</p>








<p><a name="st_84"><a name="50110-12_spnew5"><b> Mr. Yeo: </b> 
 Clearly, what happens locally is the direct responsibility of the council. The hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting point, however: he suggests that funding from central Government is one means of achieving better waste management. I wonder if he can recall a single reference to any such link in the Secretary of State&#039;s half-hour speech&#151;I think that that was how long she spoke for. The Government are giving significant extra powers to local authorities in the Bill, but they are not providing a single penny to assist those authorities to make use of those powers.

<p><a name="st_85"><a name="50110-12_spnew6"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 May I point out to the hon. Gentleman that considerable resources have been made available through the spending review and various Budgets by the Government?

May I also point out to him that, in relation to his litany of who is and is not doing well&#151;I accept that some councils are not doing well, although they are of every political party&#151;one of the principal reasons for improvement in a local authority&#039;s performance, apart from the kind of funding to which my hon.

 Let me correct the Secretary of State. As I pointed out, but as I will repeat, not one of the worst performing councils is Conservative. Nine of the 10&nbsp;worst are Labour, and one is Liberal Democrat. She has made a further interesting point, however, by drawing attention to the resources provided by the Government. We all know that funding for local government has now been grossly distorted for political reasons by the Labour Government, to provide more funding for their friends in urban, traditional Labour areas&#151;the very authorities that are falling down on the job in relation to recycling.

<a name="stpa_109">I want to return to the resourcing issue so that we are absolutely clear on it. The Secretary of State said that previous spending rounds had provided extra money for local authorities, which, of course, I accept. Is she saying, however, that the settlements already made reflect the extra costs that local authorities will incur if they choose to exercise the powers under the Bill, or are they expected to rebalance their budgets to use those powers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_89"><a name="50110-12_spnew10"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 We do not accept that local authorities will face substantial extra costs, for a number of reasons. First, we are talking about powers for local authorities, not duties&#151;they are not required to exercise them, and I have little doubt that unless they believe that the exercise of such powers will be cost-effective, they will not choose to do so. Secondly, as I pointed out earlier, they will be able to retain fine income, so that if there are serious problems, they will have resources available to deal with them. In many cases, we are simplifying and providing greater flexibility, so that powers, which in some cases already exist, can be more effectively exercised. In those cases, local authorities are already resourced to carry out such activity. In many cases, there may be a net saving to local authorities. Certainly, we do not anticipate substantial extra burdens.
</p>








<p><a name="st_90"><a name="50110-12_spnew11"><b> Mr. Yeo: </b> 
 We are teasing out some interesting information. First, the Secretary of State has just admitted that some of the powers in the Bill are not really needed, as local authorities already have powers to deal with the problems. Secondly, it was widely suggested by Labour Members that achieving better performance was linked to extra money. Now the Secretary of State is saying that there will be no extra money, and no substantial extra costs to bear. I think, however, that that statement acknowledges that there will be some extra costs involved, and it will be interesting to see what the Local Government Association says about that. Then, most tellingly, she said that there would not be duties, only powers. That seems to lead us directly to the conclusion that if local authorities are merely to be given extra powers but no extra money, it is widely assumed on the Government Benches that they will be able to do no more than they

Does he have concerns that his local authority, or others, are spending much time and energy chasing around dealing with abandoned cars and fly-tipping and sorting out with the Environment Agency who is responsible for what&#151;whether it is major fly-tipping and thus the Environment Agency&#039;s responsibility or minor and thus the authority&#039;s?

 As the Bill tightens responsibilities, and as it is supposed to be helpful, does my hon. Friend find clause 47&nbsp;curious? It removes the requirement to contract out waste disposal functions. I can understand from a dogma point of view why the Government might take that on, but it is a very specialist area that involves huge capital costs generally. The contracts are long. The regulations and complications are intense and encyclopaedic. I am slightly worried that some mind-bogglingly dull local authority, of the wrong political complexion, will grab the provision with both hands and blunder in, with no competition, at great cost and great danger to its local people.

<a name="stpa_111">The need for action is clear from the statistics that I quoted and the background that I have outlined, where I think there is common ground between the Secretary of State and me. What is less obvious is how the Bill actually helps. As I said earlier, I welcome a number of its provisions. Preventing people from running a used car business that involves parking their stock in front of other people&#039;s houses will be welcomed in many neighbourhoods, including some in my area. Even though I represent a largely rural constituency, there are some London overspill areas and estates that were formerly entirely council housing, and that problem has arisen in some neighbourhoods. In that respect, as in many others, however, I wonder whether existing powers, if properly utilised, would not be sufficient to tackle the problem.

<a name="stpa_113">Taking the enforcement issues first, the Bill will give local authorities extra power to deal with the growing problem of abandoned vehicles.

In the circumstances, it seems unlikely that more than a handful of successful prosecutions will be brought. Even if local authorities can keep the proceeds of the fixed penalties levied on those who abandon vehicles, there is still a risk that the cost of pursuing offenders will exceed the income that they may generate. Local authorities must either burden council tax payers further or simply ignore the problem, despite the changes introduced in the Bill.

<a name="stpa_127">Let me mention some of the groups that I met. Kay Henshaw and her neighbours on Wigwam grove, Hucknall were fighting for the removal of litter and fences and for trees and grassland to be maintained properly. When the people in Rainworth were asked for their priorities, they wanted cleaner and safer streets, more trees, more flowers and better maintenance of grassland. The people who formed the Ollerton traffic action group wanted to stop traffic ingressing into their area. I also met farmers such as the Hammond family, who farm close to Bestwood country park, who were concerned about fly-tipping and abandoned cars on the urban fringes.

<a name="50110-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_128">My hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Mr. Challen) made a good point about the importance of urban fringes. We must build on the work of the Countryside Agency to ensure that our urban fringes are more than places where cars go to die and are not the final recipients of refrigerators. Urban fringes offer exciting opportunities. Reforming the system of paying farmers gives us an opportunity to intervene.

<a name="50110-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_129">I argue strongly that people support the Bill because they know what happens when their neighbourhood is blighted. We all know too well what happens where streets are littered, where pavements are cracked and not repaired, where gardens are overgrown and where cars are abandoned or are repaired on the street. The Bill tackles that for the first time. It is in those neighbourhoods that we get crime and antisocial or nuisance behaviour. People feel strongly that if we can build cleaner, greener, stronger communities, and if we can adopt an attitude of no tolerance not only towards crime but towards environmental crime, we can build better communities. That is what inspires people. What hard-working people want is a better environment&#151;a better place to bring up their children.

It will not be easy, but there are indications in the Bill that we are going in the right direction. There is a clear recognition that the problem cannot be solved by one Department, one agency or one group of people. The measures in the Bill are closely intertwined with those for dealing with antisocial behaviour. We have to take a comprehensive

If we believe in localities, we must trust local people to make decisions, and we must be big enough to recognise that the decisions that they make will not always be those that we would make. It is right that things should be different in, say, Nuneaton, Newcastle and Nottingham. There are different problems and different solutions, and we must empower people to move towards those solutions.
</p>

<a name="50110-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_133">We need to involve people in this process. First, we must empower local authorities, which are increasingly recognising the importance of high quality streets and communities. But they must not be shy of involving local people in those discussions because, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, people know the needs in their area, and they know the solutions, too. Local authorities need to think more strategically. They need to empower local groups to take action themselves. We must move forward on the new localism agenda. We should not be afraid of volunteerism. These are people&#039;s streets; these are people&#039;s communities; these are people&#039;s problems. We must help them to find solutions.

<p><a name="st_111"><a name="50110-14_spnew8"><b> Paddy Tipping: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. The issue is one of trust and devolving resources. We must ask people how they would spend the money, and the response will differ across the country. To be candid, we have not been good at doing that, but I hope that we will get better at it.

It has not worked because, at times, there is a clear conflict between the need to deny a venue for antisocial behaviour and people&#039;s legitimate right to take a short cut to school, to work or to the bus station. Many of the details of gating orders will be set out in regulations to be published later by the Secretary of State. I think that the Standing Committee should analyse the provisions so that we can be sure about simple matters such as who does the gating, who pays the costs of gating and who maintains the gates.

Alongside the provisions of the Bill, we must drive forward a programme to ensure that people understand the significance of clean, green and prosperous communities. Cleanness and greenness will increase the prosperity of neighbourhoods, so that they are places to which people return rather than places from which they flee to rural areas.

The Government have a good record on recycling: people said that we would never reach the 17&nbsp;per cent. target, but we are on track to do that and we shall do more. Alongside the current measures, however, there is a strong case for financial instruments so that people who recycle more are rewarded in some way&#151;perhaps by a reduction in their council tax. I have examined the long title fairly closely and I believe that the issue is one that the Standing Committee may discuss at some length.

The Bill contains new measures on all those problems. It gives people the tools for the job. We must provide the resources and find the processes that will make it work.

 Let me make it clear at the start that we welcome the Bill. All the evidence that we have seen suggests that the penalties are not strong enough to deal with problems such as fly-tipping, graffiti and the sheer volume of rubbish on our streets. In several Adjournment debates, the House has discussed how to deter people from committing environmental crimes. We know that action is needed. Although the Bill has drawbacks, the problems can be dealt with in Committee, resulting in an improved Bill.

<br>&nbsp;<br>systems for legislation. Now, we are left to tidy up. We have had a slew of legislation on tangential issues. The Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003&nbsp;was introduced solely to deal with reducing biodegradable waste, but it could have done so much more: it could have covered littering, fly-tipping and many of the other issues dealt with in the Bill. The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, which the Bill would amend, could have dealt more effectively with graffiti and fly-posting. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment is to be dealt with in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill, rather than in a planning Bill. I get the feeling that we are taking the populist approach of giving people what they want ahead of the general election, but we know that people are asking for much of what is in the Bill, so while we regret that many of the issues have not been dealt with before, we will support the Bill that includes them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_139">We want clean and safe communities. It is essential that there is much better management both of the big problems, such as fly-tipping and the damage it causes, and of the smaller, more mundane problems of littering and chewing gum that cumulatively spoil our environment. When a neighbourhood is littered, when graffiti is present and where fly-posting is rife, the area is degraded and degenerated. When we fail to dispose correctly of the products that we have used or no longer require, we have a mess on our streets, in our rivers and in our countryside.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_140">The Government have a mess on their hands now. Total municipal waste increased by 19&nbsp;per cent. between 1997&nbsp;and 2003. We are at the bottom of the European recycling league and municipal waste is continuing to increase. Our streets are littered with more abandoned cars than ever before: in the past two years their number has increased by 37&nbsp;per cent. to more than 300,000&nbsp;a year. The amount of high-level radioactive waste has increased by 9&nbsp;per cent. and no one knows what we are going to do with batteries. Fly-tipping continues to increase&#151;by how much we do not know. Last summer, I forecast that fly-tipping would increase as a result of DEFRA&#039;s last-minute approach to the provision of facilities for hazardous waste, but the Government say that it has not&#151;their figures do not show an increase. I went back to the people who were reporting the increase&#151;the farmers on whose land lorry-loads of asbestos have been dumped. They tell me that, if they report the matter and the perpetrators are not caught, the authorities charge the farmer for tidying up, so they say nothing. There is a slew of unreported waste littering our commons, our farms and our countryside. It must be dealt with, which is another reason why we support the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_141">I have met farmers who have repeatedly been stuck with the problem. Even if they have seen someone dumping waste on their land, the Environment Agency has not had the resources to follow up on detection so that it can secure a conviction and penalties. Under the Bill, the Environment Agency will continue to face a shortfall in its resources for detection. Getting a conviction and penalties is great, but detection is extremely important.

Construction waste must be better managed and we must introduce legislation to deal with that issue, but the Tories oppose that approach. Will they be happy when construction waste continues to appear on farmland, in quarries and on commons? Is that what they want? They do not want to deal with fly-tipping on farmland, even though the National Farmers Union supports the Bill. Are they no longer talking to farmers?

<a name="stpa_145">The Local Government Association, which is chaired by the Tories, is backing the Bill. As I have said, the Tories are not doing so in the House.

Westminster city council&#151;I think that it is Tory run&#151;spends &#163;90,000&nbsp;a year on removing chewing gum. There are 300,000&nbsp;pieces of gum in Oxford street, but nothing is being done to change the disgusting habit of throwing used chewing gum on the streets.

We must consider what happens when they no longer need access, but we must also make sure that the emergency services fully support such gating. They must be provided promptly with information and maps so that they know which roads are open and which are not. Too often, the police are not provided with such information, and they lose the opportunity to catch miscreants because they do not know where to go.

<a name="50110-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_165">We welcome action on light pollution, but there are worrying exemptions. In Committee, I hope that we can discuss permissive action. BAA invited us to take part in an environmental safari at Gatwick airport, so that we could see how it had attempted to reduce light emissions and make the transition to lighting from renewable energy sources. It has undertaken a voluntary initiative to save money and reduce light, but exemptions should be introduced only after consultation. They should not be automatic, because much more needs to be done. If a car showroom is opened close to a residential area light is shed everywhere. The problem is not picked up in the planning application, and it is only when the garage has opened that the council says, &quot;We never expected that to happen.&quot; People need lighting for safety purposes, but it should be directed downwards, not outwards and upwards.

After a weekend of devastating storms and floods leading to loss of life and huge damage&#151;the House will sympathise with the distress experienced by the people of Carlisle&#151;the Government have missed the opportunity to tighten local government powers on climate change adaptation and mitigations. Climate change is the responsibility not just of national and international Government but of local government. We are concerned about the way in which fixed penalty notices will work and we need to look at that in Committee. On Thursday, we will debate the report by the Select Committee on Environmental Audit on some issues covered by the Bill which, in general, we support. It needs to be improved, but it is definitely time to introduce it.

 I very much welcome the Bill, not least because tackling environmental crime has been a constant theme of my time as a constituency Member.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-16_para12">
<a name="stpa_167">The very first lobby that I received after becoming a Member of Parliament in 1987&nbsp;was from tenants of the Silwood estate in Deptford, who came to see me because 10,000&nbsp;tonnes of spoil and waste had been dumped on the fringes of their estate. I soon learned that environmental authorities had limited powers to deal 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 68</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with the problem. Although I castigated them for failing to do so, I knew that it would be difficult for them to achieve very much. I was warned early on of the personal danger that I would face if I tried to tackle the criminals who were dumping the waste. A year later, I won a place in the ballot for private Members&#039; Bills, and introduced powers to register waste carriers and to stop illegal carriers and dumpers in the Control of Pollution (Amendment) Act 1989. Since then, those powers have passed to the Environment Agency, but it is often local authorities and vigilant constituents who identify the criminals, which is why local authorities such as Lewisham have campaigned for extended powers for local authorities to tackle fly-tipping. I am delighted that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and her colleagues have responded positively and introduced a raft of powers to do so in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-16_para13">
<a name="stpa_168">Other people&#039;s rubbish is a constant affront to most residents, and local authorities have a hard task dealing with the antisocial behaviour of a minority of residents and businesses. The courts may not regard leaving piles of rubbish in plastic bags on the landings of communal blocks as a serious matter, but such behaviour is soul-destroying for other residents. It is also hazardous, as bags leak, break, stain the walkways, create smells and physical hazards, and attract vermin. Lewisham council has secured two convictions for such offences and has 13&nbsp;prosecutions pending. The council has been using existing legislation but very much welcomes the fixed penalty notices in the Bill, which will enable it to deal much more effectively with residents and businesses that leave their bins and rubbish in the wrong place. Likewise, the extension of responsibility for clearing illegally dumped waste to landowners as well as occupiers offers the prospect of clearing up those gardens with which we are all so familiar in private properties that are often vacant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-16_para14">
<a name="stpa_169">Local authorities need to tackle other sources that give rise to fly-tipping, such as local businesses that fail to produce waste transfer notices and arrangements. Using existing legislation, Lewisham council has secured 10&nbsp;convictions over the past year, with more pending. But Nigel Tyrell, head of environment at Lewisham council, points out that for a large waste producer it could be cheaper to pay the proposed fixed penalty fine of &#163;300&nbsp;than to have a contract with a bona fide waste collection scheme. Local authorities will have to judge whether the existing legislation or the new fixed penalty fines are more appropriate in such instances to secure behavioural change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-16_para15">
<a name="stpa_170">The illegal commercial waste disposal operators continue to cause most damage. Recently, residents on the Honor Oak estate in my constituency reported frequent sightings of a lorry that pulled off the main road into their garage area, switched its lights off, deposited a load of rubbish and quickly drove away, its licence plate completely covered with mud. That is the kind of operator that local council officers want to get their hands on. I am delighted to see new powers in the Bill for the immediate searching, seizing and impounding of such offending vehicles. All too often in the past, such criminals have evaded justice, particularly when the driver was able to say that he was acting on his employer&#039;s instructions. The removal of that defence is significant. It was excavation work in docklands 20&nbsp;years ago that began the massive fly-tipping of spoil 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 69</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in Deptford. The much welcomed development of the Thames gateway now poses a similar problem for Lewisham. We will need all the new powers in the Bill to combat today&#039;s criminals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-16_para16">
<a name="stpa_171">Lewisham has a proud record of environmental activity and already includes the environment in its crime and disorder reduction partnership. Over the past nine months Lewisham has removed more than 5,000&nbsp;items of graffiti within six days of their being reported, which amounts to 30,000&nbsp;sq m of graffiti. It has held 15&nbsp;graffiti-busting days with residents, councillors and local businesses, reduced the average time to remove fly-tips to 1.7&nbsp;days, removed 538&nbsp;untaxed vehicles and 1,165&nbsp;abandoned vehicles, and&#151;despite the fears of the Opposition that this is so difficult&#151;successfully prosecuted 30&nbsp;people for the abandonment of their vehicles and 83&nbsp;people for fly-tipping and litter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-16_para17">
<a name="stpa_172">The new power to remove and crush hazardous vehicles will have a significant positive impact on our street scene, and new powers to deal with people repairing vehicles on the road will also be extremely welcome to residents who have to live alongside those nuisances, but although car repair shops are, thankfully, not on every street corner, litter and graffiti often are. It is a sad reflection on our society that the Government must legislate further to tackle those scourges and use yet more taxpayers&#039; money to clear up after the minority of vandals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-16_para18">
<a name="stpa_173">I hope my right hon. Friend the Minister will see that the extension of litter offences is backed by a public information campaign aimed especially at young people. I hope, too, that residents will appreciate that council sweepers cannot return every five minutes to sweep up the litter of wrappers and fast food boxes constantly dropped outside newsagents and takeaways. Litter clearing notices and street litter control notices will, I know, be used to great effect locally. I am particularly pleased to see the power to restrict the distribution of fliers, handouts and pamphlets that can end up as litter. Recently, on a walkabout on the Crossfields estate in my constituency, I saw great bundles of fliers placed on the bottom step of the concrete staircases to the flats. In no time at all, such fliers are blowing all over the landscaped public areas of the estate and should definitely be banned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-16_para19">
<a name="stpa_174">Along with graffiti, fly-posting is probably the other offence that most ruins a local environment and creates an air of neglect, dirt and criminality. Lewisham council has half a dozen cases pending under current legislation, but that legislation, requiring the council to show that the beneficiary consented to the fly-posting, is highly deficient. The new powers should transform the council&#039;s ability to tackle this offence, which is particularly extensive in Lewisham.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-16_para20">
<a name="stpa_175">The Bill is excellent. It tackles the many offences that ruin our local environment and cause such irritation and hardship to our constituents. As I have described, my borough is extremely active on a wide range of issues covered by the Bill and will undoubtedly do much more when it is given the new powers. It will also make excellent use of the revenue that it is able to retain from fixed penalty notices. All efforts to deter, detect and punish those involved in environmental offences are to be applauded, but we will never be able to do enough to keep our neighbourhoods clean unless we change attitudes and behaviour. I warmly welcome the Bill and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute briefly to the debate. I shall concentrate on the animal welfare aspects of the Bill, about which I questioned the Secretary of State during her opening remarks. Many colleagues in the House know me best for my partiality to cats, as I have been chief executive of the largest feline welfare charity in Britain. I am delighted to see the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) in his place. He is a distinguished supporter of cat protection. However, the subject of my remarks tonight is dogs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_176">As a result of my work with cats, I have frequently come into contact with the dog welfare charities in our country, particularly the larger ones, such as the Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club. Because of that contact, a number of them have raised with me their concerns about the content of the Bill. They are not against the Bill and they are not cynical about it, but they have concerns, which they have also expressed to my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), who is a remarkable champion of animal welfare. I am delighted that he is present, and I hope that he will catch Mr. Deputy Speaker&#039;s eye to raise our concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_177">The Minister kindly wrote to us during the parliamentary recess. His letters during a recess are always welcome and make relaxing reading. On page 2&nbsp;of his letter he extolled the fact that the Bill would bring in a &quot;simplified system&quot; for dealing with stray animals. The Bill repeals section 3&nbsp;of the Dogs Act 1906, which gives the police power to seize stray dogs in public places. The Bill also amends section 150&nbsp;of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which gives the opportunity for dogs to be taken to police stations when they are found. The responsibility will pass from the police&#151;not that they were dealing with it exclusively&#151;to local authorities. That may well work, but a number of us have reasonable doubts. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh), who will represent the Opposition in Committee, will press the Government in detail. I wish I could be there to support her, but as I shall be chairing the Committee considering the Identity Cards Bill next door, I shall have to wait for the breaks to find out what progress she is making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_178">The council dog warden scheme is remarkable. There are many dedicated men and women out there in the most dreadful conditions and weather, in poky little vans, doing a great deal to round up stray dogs and find their owners or, if they cannot, have the dogs taken into care. The dog wardens, who are represented on a number of animal welfare charity forums, do a splendid job for pretty poor pay and in dreadful working conditions. They do that job pretty well 9&nbsp;to 5, Monday to Friday. There are exceptions, but not many.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_179">Out-of-hours cover is necessarily provided by the police. Although the Government will doubtless elucidate this in Committee, I can find no reference in the Bill to what will happen after 5&nbsp;pm or before 9&nbsp;am and on Saturdays and Sundays, when council dog wardens are not available. No doubt the Minister will also tell us the cost involved, but that too is not really dealt with in the Bill.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 71</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_180">Where will a wandering dog be taken? If a dog is worrying children in a park, who will come? Most people would think of calling the police, for not enough dog wardens are floating around local authority areas for them to be on patrol as often as the police should be. In many of our constituencies, there is likely to be confusion over who is responsible for controlling stray dogs that worry children in public play areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_181">In an excellent briefing, which I hope will be given to those appointed to the Committee&#151;if not, I shall ensure that they receive it&#151;the Kennel Club poses a number of very good questions about that, and about the cost issue. A 1998&nbsp;independent study estimated the council cost at some &#163;15&nbsp;million, but the O&#039;Dowd report on police costs suggested &#163;1.8&nbsp;million. I am no mathematician, but even I can work out that there is a bit of a gap between &#163;1.8&nbsp;million and &#163;15&nbsp;million. Clearly it is difficult to put a figure on this, but it is incumbent on the Government to do so if they expect the House to change arrangements that have been in force for so many decades. I hope that the programme motion will give the Committee an opportunity to consider the issue in some detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_182">It is not clear whether, once the police arrangements have gone, enforcement of care for strays will become a local authority responsibility 24&nbsp;hours a day, seven days a week. There is no such requirement in the Bill. I hope the Minister will tell us whether he will issue guidance to councils, and what enforcement will be possible if councils have neither the money nor the will to carry it out themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_183">Animal welfare charities do a phenomenal job in caring for stray dogs. Obviously everyone knows about the RSPCA: I do not think we need blow its trumpet too much. Dogs Trust is undoubtedly a leader in the field, but excellent work is done by the Blue Cross, by a wonderful organisation called Wood Green Animal Shelters, and of course by the Kennel Club, which is the oldest such charity. They have come together in a forum called the Pet Advisory Committee, in which local authority dog wardens are also represented. I hope that, on Report if not in Committee, the Minister will assure us that he and other representatives of his Department have met members of those welfare charities&#151;as well as the Pet Advisory Committee and dog wardens&#151;to establish that the proposals in the Bill will work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_184">This is a big problem. Dogs Trust, known to many as the National Canine Defence League, helps more than 12,000&nbsp;dogs each year in its 15&nbsp;centres. That is an awful lot of stray dogs. It also spends &#163;2&nbsp;million a year on neutering dogs whose owners receive state benefits. More bodies than just local authorities are trying to cope with the problem of unwanted dogs, and Dogs Trust in particular helps council dog wardens. The fact remains, however, that there are more than 5&nbsp;million dogs in this country&#151;although the 8&nbsp;million cats are clearly in the lead&#151;of which about 105,000&nbsp;stray. That is of course a natural instinct; they are not yobboes, and should not be subject to antisocial behaviour orders. They foul pavements, which is also natural. In some respects they even emulate the House of Commons: they make a noise, which for many of us 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 72</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is a natural function. The general public, however, understandably want to see some control, especially those who do not like dogs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_185">I appreciate that the Minister is trying to do something about those problems, but I am sure he will bear it in mind that dogs, in particular, provide an enormous amount of companionship for many of our constituents. They give huge enjoyment, especially to children, and I think they genuinely improve the human lot. When society seeks to control this wonderful species, as it seeks to do in the Bill, we have a duty of care. I have known the Minister for 20-odd years and I believe his intentions are good, but I regret to say that I do not think he has addressed that duty of care in the Bill. As it stands the Bill is simply a shrug, which is not good enough. I hope that he will deal with the issues I have raised&#151;if not tonight, in Committee and on Report.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_187">Gating orders are an urban issue. Planners seem to have designed short cuts and public access routes to facilitate easy escape from the police rather than easy access to local facilities. An example is the alley backing on to the Fairway in Worcester, which links Otley close to Tolladine road. The pathway is unlit and contains two 90-degree turns, so people cannot see from one end to the other. Certain individuals have used that footpath to push over brick walls, damage fences and urinate into people&#039;s gardens. That is unacceptable behaviour, and gating orders might enable us to end such problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_188">I am, however, acutely aware of the potential conflict&#151;raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)&#151;between those who suffer from antisocial behaviour, who are victims of crime, and law-abiding people who just want to go from their homes to local facilities. I would like to know how the Minister expects local authorities and crime reduction partnerships to deal with that conflict. Who, ultimately, will have priority&#151;victims of antisocial behaviour, or those who argue on libertarian grounds that they should have the right to use a footpath? If time limits are imposed, allowing gates to be closed in the evenings or whenever it gets dark, who will be responsible for the prompt closing and opening of the gates?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_189">Gating could perhaps be used as a way of tackling antisocial behaviour on the part of older youths abusing children&#039;s play areas. There is a play area in Barley crescent and Tolladine road, and another in Great Oaty gardens, Warndon Villages. They are designed for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 73</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>children of five, six and seven, but tend to be occupied late in the evening by teenagers and older young people. Those whose homes back on to the play areas are subjected to the throwing of bottles into their gardens, and to fireworks and noise. Playgrounds are set on fire, and unwanted waste is generated. The play areas also attract individuals who seek to capitalise on the presence of groups of young people who may be particularly vulnerable to the selling of drugs and other illegal substances. The detached youth team in Worcester has worked hard, but the local council has failed it in not recognising the problem and in taking so long to establish a strategy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_190">I think that we would all accept that the antisocial behaviour and crime that abandoned cars tend to attract and promote are a real problem. A notice placed on a windscreen is like a green light for vandals, who think, &quot;No one cares. Let us have some fun and damage that car.&quot; I welcome the fact that we will have speedier action on such behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para15">
<a name="stpa_191">In Worcester city last year, 414&nbsp;abandoned cars were dealt with by the local council, so the issue affects areas that are perceived to be nice and middle-class and middle England, as well as more challenging areas. Therefore, I was dismayed to read a month or so ago that the local Conservative ruling group on the city council decided that dealing with abandoned vehicles was not a priority area for action. The Conservatives are trying to put over a party political argument in their motion, but it is one that my constituents will fail to understand.

<a name="stpa_192">Nuisance parking is not a recent phenomenon but it is a growing problem. For example, it is dangerous to sell cars on busy highways such as the London road going in and out of Worcester, and cars parked on the grass verges of streets such as Windermere drive are an eyesore. They reduce and devalue the amenities of the land in that area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-17_para17">
<a name="stpa_193">Litter cleaning notices will be a much welcomed, more flexible approach. We can start to enforce more responsible behaviour, so that wider communities are not disadvantaged by irresponsible individuals. I have walked Teme road and Avon road with the chief executive of the city council. Those areas are a disgrace and certain individuals are letting down the neighbourhood. Although one-off measures such as bulk waste or refuse collection are used to make an immediate clear-up, within a few months the area goes back to its normal state because there is no regular enforcement.

<a name="stpa_194">That is why I welcome the fixed penalty notice scheme and the different treatments that the council can apply. If the litter and waste are seen to be detrimental to the amenity of the locality, the local authority can take action, rather than having to wait to see whether an environmental health hazard is posed by all that litter and waste. The work of good local councillors such as Geoff Williams and Roger Berry in those areas can be supported by the Bill.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;Current legislation lays responsibility for dealing with stray dogs jointly between the police and local authority. The Environmental Protection Act lays a duty on local authorities to appoint a person to deal with stray dogs, hold them for a period of seven days and then to dispose of them, usually to a re-homing organisation such as Dogs Trust. This person is usually called the Dog Warden or Animal Welfare Officer.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">In practice in most local authority areas the Dog Warden service is active during normal&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. working hours.

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">However at night and at weekends when the Dog Warden service is not available the police have a duty to accept stray dogs. Usually the Dog Warden collects such dogs when they come back on duty and become responsible for their care. Because most dogs stray by accident and most are exercised in the evenings and at weekends it seems likely to Dogs Trust that a significant proportion of stray dogs will stray during the same period. This supposition is borne out by anecdotal evidence.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_208">Clauses 55&nbsp;to 58&nbsp;deal with streamlining the dog control byelaw system.

<p><a name="st_129"><a name="50110-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Patrick Hall  (Bedford) (Lab):</b> 
 I want to discuss the deeply antisocial act of abandoning vehicles, and initially to draw on the experience of a constituent of mine, Mr. Chris Meadows, who is co-director of a company that manages an apartment building in Bedford. Over the years, the company has paid hundreds of pounds to have abandoned cars removed from its car park. In order to identify the owner, it writes to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency giving a description of the vehicle and its registration number and requesting the name and address of the registered keeper, for which a fee of &#163;2.50&nbsp;is payable. On receiving 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 77</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the information, the company writes to the keeper, who invariably does not reply. It then instructs a private contractor to remove the vehicle, the cost of which is &#163;30.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_210">Bedford borough council will take instructions from private property owners to remove such a vehicle, but the fee is &#163;88.13. The council sends an officer to inspect the site and, depending on the state of the vehicle, a decision is taken whether to remove it within 24&nbsp;hours or seven days. The appropriate notice is stuck to the vehicle, which in itself can attract acts of vandalism, thereby rendering it a greater hazard than it was originally. If a seven-day notice is attached, removal takes place a little later than that and the vehicle is stored for some 10&nbsp;days, or possibly for a lot longer if it is still taxed. If no one claims it at the end of the relevant period, the council sells it to a breaker for disposal. The whole process can take a few weeks. The costs are borne by the landowner and, as I have suggested, they are much too high, as my constituent has discovered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_211">In cases where a vehicle is abandoned on private land&#151;perhaps in a prominent location&#151;and is likely to become a hazard, and where the owner is not known or is not prepared to co-operate, councils have to place a 15-day notice on it. In those circumstances, cost recovery can prove very difficult indeed, which explains the reluctance of some councils to act in such cases. But where a council does act, it is the council tax payer who invariably foots the bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-18_para14">
<a name="stpa_212">The Bill, combined with other legislative changes that I shall refer to later, will assist in improving the way in which abandoned cars are dealt with. The key is the speed and scope of action. Instead of waiting seven or 15&nbsp;days, councils will henceforth be able to remove a vehicle immediately, which in practice will mean within 24&nbsp;hours. Of course, councils can so act now, but only in respect of vehicles that are found to be in a dangerous or wrecked state.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-18_para15">
<a name="stpa_213">It was pointed out earlier that because the Bill establishes a discretionary power rather than a duty, it need not be acted on. However, it is pretty certain that it will create a general expectation among the public&#151;and, I hope, among councils&#151;that the common practice will be the removal of such vehicles within 24&nbsp;hours: removal not only from the public highway and public land, but from private land, unless, of course, the landowner has given permission for the vehicle to be there.

I am sure that the Government intend that such areas be included, but the wording of clause 11&nbsp;is far from clear in that regard. I look for reassurance on this point&#151;perhaps right now.

<p><a name="st_130"><a name="50110-19_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Perhaps I can offer my hon. Friend that assurance. I agree that it is important for people to understand where legislation applies, and it is frequently the case that people get confused and wonder which 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 78</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>areas are intended to be covered. I will be happy to give further chapter and verse about that when we debate the issue in Committee. I certainly underline the importance of the point that my hon. Friend is raising.
</p>








<p><a name="st_131"><a name="50110-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hall: </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that helpful intervention. I also look for assurance that the Bill will deal with the issue of deliberate abandonment, about which I believe the courts have set some tests. That will be essential if the welcome idea of serving a fixed penalty notice on a known perpetrator for abandoning a vehicle is to become an effective deterrent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_216">Finally, I want to stress the efficacy of keeping accurate records of car ownership&#151;or, more precisely, of the registered keeper of vehicles. The Finance Act 2002&nbsp;amended the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994, and from January 2004&nbsp;brought in continuous registration, which involves a monthly computer check of vehicle licensing by the DVLA. It has the ability to fine people up to &#163;80&nbsp;for not renewing or declaring a statutory off-road notice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_217">I know that my constituent, Mr. Meadows, hoped that this change in the law would require the registered keeper to be responsible for the costs associated with the vehicle in addition to the licence fee. I understand that, technically, it does not do that, but since the change was enacted, the DVLA generated an additional 4&nbsp;million vehicle licensing, registration and SORN transactions in the first nine months of last year in comparison with the first nine months of the previous year&#151;a considerable increase in business. More people are coming within the system and more accurate records mean that more people are traceable when it comes to parking fines or towing-away costs for abandoned vehicles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_218">It has to be acknowledged, however, that it will still be difficult to tackle people who deliberately operate outside the system&#151;those who give false names and addresses and who frequently change address. They are the very people who disproportionately cause problems to everyone else through criminal and antisocial behaviour involving vehicles&#151;not paying the road tax, for example, not registering ownership or not insuring vehicles, never mind abandoning them when they are no longer needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_219">The reforms proposed in the Bill and the benefits of continuous registration will put the squeeze&#151;if I may use that expression&#151;on abandoned cars, but will not remove the need for more and more effective on-road enforcement. Thus, savings that should follow from speeding up the process may well need to be absorbed elsewhere. As to people who operate outside society and rely on false identity, we will not have the means to make life more difficult for them unless and until we introduce something that is not mentioned in the Bill&#151;a system of identity cards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_220">In conclusion, I welcome the Bill, and especially its provisions to deal with abandoned cars. It proposes constructive steps, as I see it, without pretending to offer a total solution. It is part of a process. In my view, that process is in tune with my constituents&#039; aspirations to tackle antisocial behaviour and improve the quality of the public realm.

 I was rather perplexed when I saw that the Opposition were going to vote against the Bill. It seems to me that the problems that the Bill deals with are equally likely to occur in the northern parts of the rural area of my constituency as they are in the urban areas, and I would have thought that that was the same throughout the country.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_222">One of the main points of the Bill is to give local authorities the ability to construct an overarching strategy to tackle many of those issues. The fact that powers are currently spread across different authorities and agencies is what brings the conflict into being at the moment, but the Bill is designed to tackle rather than exacerbate the difficulties to which the Opposition allude. I was also pleased to see that the quality of the local environment can be taken into account in crime reduction partnerships. It is important for them to have that ability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_223">I want to discuss part 6, which deals with dogs. Neither of the two Opposition Members who spoke about them is in his place at present, but I am sure that I am not alone among Government Members in having received many complaints about the packs of stray dogs that roam about the estates within our constituencies. They can cause huge problems for our constituents and they are difficult to deal with. The police attach low priority to that problem for understandable reasons: it is not one of their major concerns and looking after packs of dogs is not high among their priorities. Passing responsibility over to local authorities, which are generally more responsive to local needs, is a better way of tackling the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_224">I am not wholly clear about the changes proposed for dealing with dog fouling&#151;another common problem in our constituencies. It appears from a cursory reading of the Bill that the fines can be levied only in places where a dog control area has been established. That seems a retrograde step&#151;I hope that the Minister will be able to give some assurance, either in his summing up or in Committee, that that is not the case. I hope to hear that fines for dog fouling on pavements can be levied throughout our constituencies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_225">Moving on to fixed penalty notices, it is important that they are applied within the scale of fines that courts can levy for similar offences. Not doing so would undermine the belief that there is justice in the system. Once people feel that something is unjust, it undermines public confidence in the system. It is immensely important that people are supportive of the Bill. It is equally important that fixed penalty notices are viewed as an effective deterrent. I generally welcome the idea of allowing local authorities to vary the level of fines, which shows their responsibility and responsiveness to their communities. However, I am not fully convinced that local accountability in this particular case is more significant than the deterrent value of having a clear national tariff. It is another matter that I hope to explore with the Minister in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_226">Similarly, I am unclear about the hypothecation of fines to local authorities and hope to discuss that further in Committee. I understand that it will provide an

<br>&nbsp;<br>important new source of funding and enable local authorities to carry out their duties and responsibilities specified in the Bill. However, I hope that hypothecation will not mean tying down authorities too much, forcing them to use the funds gained from the fines to deliver goals specifically defined in the Bill. I want them to be able to use those funds for other purposes if they so wish. That is the thrust behind the present good idea of allowing good and excellent councils more discretion. I hope that we will continue to allow that to happen. As I understand it, the comprehensive performance assessment includes measures of environmental quality, so good and excellent councils will be in danger of losing their status if they do not achieve in that respect. I feel that that already provides sufficient incentive for councils to act in ways to promote the environment and that the proposals on hypothecation are therefore unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_227">The hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) mentioned clause 47, which gives powers to local authorities to run their own waste disposal authorities. As a former chair of an effective waste disposal organisation that was dismembered, on purely dogmatic grounds, by the previous Conservative Government, I welcome the proposal and hope that some local authorities are able to do that. I fear that it might be too late and that the huge costs involved will prevent it, but at least the proposal removes the pure dogma that existed previously.

It is also important that we continue to educate and raise awareness through the work done by the Wigan-based ENCAMS authority, which enthusiastically supports the Bill, despite the fact that my hon.

 Some of the hardest problems brought to me by constituents at surgeries concern antisocial behaviour and bad neighbours. These problems&#151;noise, litter, abandoned vehicles, graffiti and vandalism&#151;are associated with urban areas but, as many hon. Friends have pointed out, they are not exclusively urban problems.

<a name="stpa_240">I can assure her and the House that I will not do so because I do not want to stop the sensible suggestion that chewing gum be marketed in packaging that allows people to pop it somewhere in the back of the packet so that it is not dropped on the ground.

<a name="50110-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_241">After I said what I did at Prime Minister&#039;s Questions, the Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and Confectionary Association, which represents manufacturers, wrote to tell me that it works closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Local Government Association, the Institute of Waste Management, the Department for Education and Skills and others to find ways to tackle the problem. In particular, it proposes a campaign later this year, paid for by the manufacturers, to try to persuade people not to drop gum on the ground and I welcome that.

<a name="50110-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_242">The manufacturers association asserts that gum litter is caused by the irresponsible behaviour of a minority of chewers. I do not know whether that is true, but if it is, that minority does an awful lot of damage. The LGA estimates that local authorities in England spent &#163;150&nbsp;million last year on removing chewing gum from our streets. The average clean-up cost in a town centre is about &#163;20,000. The hon. Member for Guildford mentioned that Westminster city council spent &#163;90,000&nbsp;last year cleaning Oxford street. That took seven weeks, but within 10&nbsp;days the problem had returned. The council estimates&#151;I wonder which council official was sent out to count them&#151;that there are 300,000&nbsp;pieces of gum on Oxford street.

<a name="stpa_243">I support the polluter pays principle and welcome the Government&#039;s proposal of fixed penalty notices for people who drop litter, including chewing gum. I am glad that local authorities will retain the fixed penalty revenue, but I do not think that that will raise the &#163;150&nbsp;million that it costs to remove the gum. The producers must do more. I am not the sort of person who leaps at the suggestion of putting a tax on producers&#151;there is no guarantee that the tax income would get into the hands of the people who do the clearing up&#151;but I do think that the producers need to do something about their packaging, and I ask the Minister to confirm that the joint chewing gum action group involving the Government and the manufacturers will address the issue.

 The fact that so many Labour Members are taking part in the debate shows how much people care right across the country about the need to tackle pollution, fly-tipping and littering in our neighbourhoods. I welcome the debate, but I wish we were having a proper one, not looking across the Chamber at empty Benches. In my constituency, these matters are just about at the top of the list of what people have to deal with and I welcome the fact that Ministers are bringing real proposals before Parliament. I admit that some areas of the Bill perhaps need more attention to detail, and that can be considered in Committee, but I am pleased that the Government are tackling the issues, sending out a clear message that dealing with litter and graffiti and making our neighbourhoods clean really matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-20_para14">
<a name="stpa_244">We have heard a lot of references to the report of the Select Committee on Environmental Audit, which will be further debated on Thursday. The way in which the Committee has taken evidence and helped to maintain pressure for doing something about problems in neighbourhoods and communities all over the country shows that the issue is one that we really have to tackle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-20_para15">
<a name="stpa_245">When the issues from the debate are looked at in detail, I hope that DEFRA Ministers will be able to use the expertise of the officers of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health to see what needs to be ironed out in Committee. I speak as a vice-president of the institute, which has huge expertise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-20_para16">
<a name="stpa_246">I am pleased that so many different organisations and associations that have been consulted have played a part in shaping the Bill. The fact is that many people support it, from the Local Government Association, ENCAMS and other environmental groups and organisations to working parties set up by, for example, the police. The fact that we have legislation that will remove responsibility for stray dogs from the police to local authorities shows that day-to-day, detailed work done by many people has been acknowledged. I am pleased that the chief constable of Staffordshire, John Giffard, took part in that working party and that there has been progress into legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-20_para17">
<a name="stpa_247">When I speak to my constituents, I learn that whether they feel good about the place where they live, ensure that it is kept clean and have a sense of pride and belonging to a neighbourhood and community is linked to how we deliver on our policies. The public realm should be spick and span and we must have a way of making sure that local authorities implement the new powers the Bill will give them. I hope that the Minister will respond on the points about the money needed for that. I take the point that money will come in from fixed penalty notices to help with the financing of the Bill&#039;s implementation, but it will be important to have some pilot projects through the Environment Agency to show how we can make even more progress and to roll out best practice. It will come as no surprise to the Minister to hear that, when he comes to consider possible areas with the Environment Agency, it will be possible that Stoke-on-Trent will be one of the beneficiaries. The Environment Agency has something like &#163;5&nbsp;million, and we must consider options for achieving a joined-up approach that goes across the areas of responsibility of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="50110-20_para18">
<a name="stpa_248">The Environmental Audit Committee has set up a sub-committee on education and sustainable development. In all my years in Parliament looking at legislation, I have learned that we can legislate until the cows come home, but if we do not carry people with us and help to educate people in the wider sense, we will fail to have the legislation implemented on the ground. I hope that the Department will come back to us on how we can embed environmental education and achieve some environmental literacy about what changes of attitude will mean if we get citizens signed up to a new agenda. How can that be done in the wider education agenda? I hope that the Government will consider that question in some detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-20_para19">
<a name="stpa_249">Earlier, I flagged up the issue of gating. In many areas, there are problems with alleys and keeping refuse out of them. People put refuse out the day after the bin men have been, for example. I welcome what the Bill does in dealing with such antisocial behaviour. Clause 2&nbsp;says that highways agencies and local authorities are responsible for those alleyways, but I am concerned that Stoke-on-Trent has something like 21&nbsp;km of unadopted alleyways, which are back entries to terraced homes. It seems absurd in the 21st century to have alleyways that are effectively gutters for nine months out of 12, with mud and water running down them, no proper drainage and no proper lighting. If someone puts in a new carpet through the back door, it begins instantly to be destroyed because of that. I urge the Government to see whether, in the Bill or in a wider joined-up approach, they could find ways, through neighbourhood renewal or through funding from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, to speed up the way in which we adopt alleyways. Whatever powers are introduced in relation to providing a clean and green environment and neighbourhood, if we cannot deal with unadopted back alleyways, we will not achieve the goal of clean and green neighbourhoods where people feel proud to live. I urge the Government to consider that issue, as well as the cost of drainage and lighting, and the ongoing revenue costs. Certainly, across Stoke-on-Trent, at least 10&nbsp;km urgently need to be adopted. I hope that the housing renewal programme can also help with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-20_para20">
<a name="stpa_250">At the start of this debate, we heard a lot about whether this is a Bill for urban or rural areas. My view is that waste and antisocial behaviour has no boundaries&#151;it stretches across rural and urban areas. From the discussions that I have had with parish councils in Bagnall, Brown Edge, Endon and Stanley, I feel sure that they will welcome the powers that they will have, as a result of this legislation, to deal with such issues.

<p>
<a name="50110-20_para21">
<a name="stpa_251">In an initiative earlier this year, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency came to help us deal with abandoned cars, which was a huge success. Anything that the Government do through this Bill to deal with abandoned vehicles much more quickly, to stop problems such as youths leaving them abandoned on nature reserves and people being injured, is welcome, as they are a blight on our neighbourhoods.
</p>

<p>

<p><a name="st_135"><a name="50110-21_spnew0"><b> Siobhain McDonagh  (Mitcham and Morden) (Lab):</b> 
 I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak in this debate, as I am one of the many Labour Members who have been working hard to get these issues to the top of the agenda. Many of my hon. Friends have spent the past few years using every parliamentary device available, whether private Members&#039; Bills, ten-minute Bills or early-day motions, to promote these issues, because they are of concern to their constituents. I am grateful that the Government have been brave enough to take on these issues, for which many would ridicule us. This is an example of MPs devoting time and attention to reaching out to their constituents knowing long before the policy wonks and editorial writers that the issue was important to people. I am delighted that over the past few years we have been able to introduce more and better measures in the fight against graffiti, abandoned cars, fly-tipping and so on. The Bill is a further move in the right direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_253">In a survey that I carried out not long ago of the views of hundreds of my constituents, I discovered that the principal worries of people in Mitcham, Morden and Colliers Wood were crime and environmental quality-of-life issues such as graffiti, abandoned cars and fly-tipping. Those were the top priorities of nearly two thirds of my constituents. On almost every question, respondents supported the toughest measures, including imposing fixed penalty notices for environmental crimes such as graffiti, vandalism and litter, even on children&#151;not for them the squeamishness of the Tories that we have seen today. Support for new powers was above 90&nbsp;per cent. on almost every measure. That is how strongly people feel about them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_254">Every time we attempt to crack down on chewing gum, however, as my hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley) suggests, we are laughed at by some high-minded commentator. We heard some examples of that from the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess). We know that they are wrong, however, because unlike some we suffer from the same problems that our constituents experience. Because of the work carried out by MPs in giving that information to Ministers, we have seen: action against graffiti and a ban on the sale of spray paints to children; councils getting powers to remove graffiti from street furniture owned by the utilities; continuous registration of vehicles, which has reduced the number of untaxed cars on our streets by two thirds; and powers for councils to check firms&#039; waste removal contracts, so that unscrupulous businesses can no longer just dump their rubbish on our streets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_255">MPs who work hard in their constituencies know that people hate graffiti, litter, fly-tipping and abandoned cars. We know that they want meaningful punishment for people who are guilty of such antisocial behaviour. That is why Back-Bench Labour MPs want the fight to continue, and why we support this Bill. It remains frustrating, however, that many existing powers are not yet in wide use, and that authorities are still only learning about how they can make a difference. I want to concentrate on that issue in the time that I have left.

<a name="stpa_256">My constituents support what the Government are doing, but people&#039;s comments in the survey that I mentioned earlier also give a strong sense of frustration. They need reassurance that new laws will be firmly policed and that there will be a strong chance of the perpetrators being punished. As one couple told me:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;Unfortunately, the reported number of prosecutions for any of these offences is extremely low and, in some cases, non-existent. I believe it is pointless to introduce further legislation which will not be enforced.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_258">People believe that the Government are sincere in our intentions, and support our proposals, but they are concerned about our ability to deliver. They hear stories about lenient punishments that do not begin to cover the cost of the damage caused. For instance, in Merton&#151;of which Mitcham and Morden forms half&#151;Shane Simms admitted damaging buildings including a mosque and graveyards and peppering his tag all over buses, lorries, telephone boxes and many private and business premises around the borough. He caused tens of thousands of pounds worth of damage. The police, Merton council and many others invested hundreds of hours in his case, yet he ended up getting community service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_259">I want the courts to be tougher on vandals, but I also want to ensure that bodies such as Merton council and the police do not spend time and money chasing people who commit vandalism, graffiti or even littering without being able to cover the cost. Unless local authorities can afford to use their powers, we can be fairly sure that these problems will remain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_260">Last year, the Government accepted my suggestion that statutory undertakers must keep their street furniture graffiti-free, and that if they do not, Merton council, and several others in the pilot scheme, can step in, clean the graffiti and bill the companies for cleaning costs. Unfortunately, Telewest is refusing to comply, and Merton has not yet taken action. I hope that it will do so, because this is a dreadful problem, and I do not want Telewest to get away with it. That highlights a difficulty, however, because if councils do not have the front-end resources or the willpower to deal with the issue, or to recover all the costs, such policies will not completely solve the problem. Although other organisations have improved their approach as a result of these powers, it takes only a few antisocial organisations, such as Telewest, for the problem to persist. Similarly, Merton council already has the power to fine people who drop litter &#163;50, but it does not do so&#151;not a single fine has been applied&#151;because the process is complicated, and councils cannot recover the full cost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_261">The Bill will tackle many of these problems. It will enable councils and the Environment Agency to recover investigation and clear-up costs of fly-tipping. It will allow them to recover the costs of returning abandoned shopping trolleys to their owners&#151;I am sure that that will be a source of amusement for tomorrow&#039;s papers. It will allow them to fine businesses that fail to produce waste transfer notes and to keep the receipts.
</p>

<p><a name="st_136"><a name="50110-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Colin Challen  (Morley and Rothwell) (Lab):</b> 
 This is a welcome Bill, which will provide relief to our constituents who daily face the myopic behaviour of a minority of people who defile and demean our local communities. It provides more powers for local councils and the police to tackle the low-level environmental despoliation of our streets and green spaces, and gives local people a greater voice in that seemingly never-ending struggle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_267">My experience on a recent Environmental Audit Committee inquiry into these issues taught me that there is no ready institutional answer to dealing with the antisocial mentality and dysfunctional behaviour that lead some people to make life a misery for their neighbours. When there exists a significant minority of people who simply do not care about the impact of their behaviour on others, it is not easy to bring them into line, but laws that give local communities the protection they need are clearly required. The Bill goes a long way towards addressing that deficiency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_268">I feel obliged to say, however, that the Government&#039;s assumption that extra resources will not, in general, be needed to make the legislation really effective needs to be carefully assessed. I say that even though we now have more police officers than at any other time in history. We now have police community support officers, and as a member of the Standing Committee on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 88</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Police Reform Act 2002, I seem to recall that there were people on both sides of the House who thought they were not a good idea&#151;but how the sceptics have been proved wrong. We have also witnessed some of the largest increases in local government funding, well above the rate of inflation, and next year&#039;s settlement is no exception.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para16">
<a name="stpa_269">There are, however, still aspects that I hope, after this debate and other representations, the Government will consider carefully. In my district, covered by Leeds city council, with a population of 750,000&nbsp;people, we had until recently an innovative and determined Labour-run authority that was bent on investing more in fighting antisocial behaviour. It introduced a noise nuisance hotline and antisocial behaviour crackdowns, helped to secure more PCSOs than anywhere else outside the Metropolitan police area and generally sought to be aware of people&#039;s concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para17">
<a name="stpa_270">Yet antisocial behaviour does not cease, and it seems that money cannot always be saved in tackling it&#151;perhaps it is simply that our expectations are raised. For example:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;In 1998/9&nbsp;the Council allocated &#163;10,000&nbsp;to remove graffiti and illegal flyposting from the city centre, which was more than adequate. In the current financial year, more than twice that amount has already been spent and not all graffiti is being removed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para18">
<a name="stpa_271">Those were the words of John Kearsley, the council&#039;s chief support officer, in evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee in February 2004. He went on to say that at that time there were just 13&nbsp;dedicated environmental enforcement officers to cover the whole city. Clearly, with the extra powers conferred on the council, which will be well publicised, not least by those of us who will be voting for them tonight, public expectations will be raised. New powers do not always mean that extra resources are required, but in this case they will be required, and we shall need to be alert to new ways of finding the money to achieve the Bill&#039;s objectives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para19">
<a name="stpa_272">Let us consider alley gating. The idea of gating off alleyways, or ginnels as we call them in Leeds, is excellent, provided proper consultations are carried out. I can think of several areas in my constituency where the potential for gating is evident, but in one case where a ginnel was gated, the overall design fell somewhat short of a complete solution, as not only the entrances needed gating but the boundaries of the ginnel, adjacent to people&#039;s gardens, needed extra protection. Miscreants will simply go through people&#039;s gardens if the fencing is not up to the job. All that costs money, and the sums are not insignificant. An effective gating system could cost tens of thousands of pounds. In Tingley, in my constituency, I talked to constituents about gating a network of ginnels that connected different streets, the main branch of which was the real problem, but it was fed by tributary paths. In such a case, gating would be an expensive solution and even then, because of its nature, not all residents would want interference with their rights of way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para20">
<a name="stpa_273">To make the powers effective, we will need to find new resources. Certainly, some will come from more effective working at local level, but there are clearly resource issues in both capital and revenue terms, especially if we want more dedicated environmental enforcement officers. On the latter point, it is obvious that noise and

</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para21">
<a name="stpa_274">I want to comment on some other aspects of this excellent Bill. I welcome the extra powers that parish and town councils will acquire to enable fixed penalty notices to be given out for things such as littering. Thanks to the Labour Government, such councils can now make a much bigger contribution to combating such low-level environmental crimes; for example, by helping to fund PCSOs. Once again, Labour&#039;s crime fighting initiatives, despite meeting initial opposition, have been grasped locally by all parties, some of which even pay us the compliment of taking the credit for them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para22">
<a name="stpa_275">The Bill proposes regulations on how the receipts from such fixed penalty income should be spent. I hope that in the early stages such money will be used solely to offset the costs of employing people, such as PCSOs, who have a role in enforcing the law. Such legislation will have a far greater impact if there is a clear causal effect all the way through, so that people can see how transparently and effectively it is working, and that it does not become just another funding stream for the general pot.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para23">
<a name="stpa_276">Some parish councils might like some of the money collected from fixed penalty notices to be spent on all sorts of other things, the impact of which would not be so evident. Where that happened, parish councils might be less likely to improve their overall effectiveness, and might instead try to extend their functions beyond what is appropriate to that level of local government, which after all is funded by the not so accountable means of a precept. I know from local experience that precepts can be greatly increased without a commensurate increase in service delivery. Money has sometimes been used to increase balances at the taxpayer&#039;s expense. I hope that the Secretary of State will ensure that the use of extra powers in lower-tier councils is carefully monitored.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para24">
<a name="stpa_277">I very much welcome the new controls to be placed on the free distribution of printed matter, much of which is distributed on behalf of businesses. Of course, they have to advertise, but far too much of that material ends up on the streets. In my constituency, in the circulation area of a free weekly newspaper, copies are as likely to end up in the garden or on the doorstep as through the letterbox, adding to the litter problem, and in some cases letting burglars know which houses are unoccupied. In the same category, sadly, fall a number of charities, which chuck plastic collection bags on our doorsteps or leave them hanging out of the letterbox. Presumably, the idea is that if people have nothing to put in the bags the collectors will pick them up on their next round, but that does not always happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-21_para25">
<a name="stpa_278">Charities and some other groups are exempt from the provisions of clause 23, but they should not be exempt from the expectation that they should adhere to the standards imposed by statute on others. I would also appreciate it if the Minister would make it plain whether the exemption for religious organisations is to be defined in the Bill in the same way as the protection of religious freedoms is defined in the draft convention on human

<a name="stpa_279">Finally, noise nuisance is addressed in the Bill in terms both of alarms going off and of noise from premises generally. Although those are serious problems, I wonder whether they are on the same scale as what is, I believe, a more prevalent nuisance: noise from cars and other vehicles. Would it be possible to extend the provisions to vehicles? Car alarms seem far more prone to go off than burglar alarms, and the other type of car noise&#151;from monster bass sound systems&#151;is a real and deliberately manufactured nuisance. How many streets are blighted by those mobile noise terrorists, who clearly cannot hear anything outside their vehicles, and who often, because of their semi-blacked-out windows, can hardly see anything either, as they drive around? Such vehicles are almost as bad as the motor cycles that have had the silencers knocked out of their exhausts.

<a name="stpa_280">I do not understand why some people want to advertise their stupidity, but advertise it they do, causing considerable annoyance to residents who just want to enjoy a bit of peace and quiet in their own home. I hope that the Government will ensure that the use of fixed penalty notices for noise pollution can be made more widely available to tackle that problem.

<p><a name="st_137"><a name="50110-22_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bob Blizzard  (Waveney) (Lab):</b> 
 This is a very important Bill indeed. That is demonstrated not just by the number of Labour Members who are seeking to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but by the fact that the public think so too. One does not have to knock on too many doors or stand on too many doorsteps to know that. I rarely come across anyone who wants to discuss the five economic tests for the euro, the Freedom of Information Act 2000, or even the Human Rights Act 1998, but I regularly come across people who are concerned about litter, fly-tipping and abandoned vehicles. Those people will be amazed that there is no interest at all in that tonight among Opposition Members, and they will be shocked that the Conservative party will vote against the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_281">My particular interest in the Bill relates to litter. I introduced two private Member&#039;s Bills on litter in 2001&nbsp;and 2003, and I have always believed that litter is a very serious issue; it is not just unsightly, but a health risk, and it affects urban and rural communities, streets, open spaces, and in coastal constituencies such as mine, our beaches that mean so much to us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_282">It is an important matter in my constituency. My local newspaper, the <i>Lowestoft Journal,</i> has been running a campaign to clean up the streets for some time. People write in and report things to the paper; it focuses on the issue, and the aim is to put pressure on the local authority to do something about it. The campaign has had only limited success, because the truth is that we in this country are not very good at dealing with litter. The culture of litter management is wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_283">Despite having laws that prohibit the dropping of litter&#151;fixed penalties were introduced as long ago as 1990&#151;most of the time, if we are truthful about it, we tolerate that practice. We walk around in it for most of the day, and we concentrate our efforts on clearing it up, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 91</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>at a huge cost&#151;something like &#163;450&nbsp;million a year&#151;but we then complain if the council or someone else does not clean it up properly or effectively. That approach is rather like that taken by Sisyphus: it offers no solution at all. There is evidence that the more effective and efficient we are at clearing away litter, the more of it is dumped, especially in terms of fly-tipping and abandoned cars. We have not tackled the problem at source, and we have not seriously enforced our litter laws.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_284">The Government doubled the fixed penalty fine to &#163;50, but, as I said in introducing one of my private Member&#039;s Bills, no more than about 3,000&nbsp;fixed penalty notices were issued a year. I have further details. I apologise to my right hon. Friend the Minister for the figures that I gave earlier; they relate to the period before November 2003, when the Local Government Act 2003&nbsp;came into force, but they make the point about how bad the then situation was. Only 76&nbsp;out of 359&nbsp;local authorities issued any fixed penalty notices at all, and of the 1,366&nbsp;notices that were issued in that period, 624&#151;nearly half&#151;were issued by just five authorities. So if authorities take litter seriously, they can get down to dealing with it, but most authorities do nothing about it at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_285">The problem has been that those local authorities have not had the resources to carry out the enforcement because they had to pay the money raised by the fines to central Government. In fact, very little money reached central Government because hardly any enforcement was taking place. So when I proposed those private Member&#039;s Bills, I introduced the simple idea of allowing local authorities to keep the revenue from the fixed penalties to provide an income stream for enforcement&#151;in other words, as has been said, to make the polluter, not the taxpayer, pay for dealing with the problem of litter. I was delighted when the Government incorporated that idea in the Local Government Act 2003, but I expressed concern at the time to my right hon. Friend the Minister about whether local authorities would take up the new powers that were given and spend that revenue specifically on enforcement or in a broader way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_286">The pilot schemes that took place during the year before the 2003&nbsp;Act came into force showed that authorities, such as Newcastle and Manchester&#151;two of the five that had issued fixed penalty notices&#151;could have success, but that even some of the pilot authorities that had signed up to public service agreements did nothing to use the powers that they were given. Since the 2003&nbsp;Act, some progress has been made, but in the year 2003&#150;04, still only 7,500&nbsp;fixed penalties were issued for littering&#151;not a lot nationally for the amount of litter that is dropped on our streets and open spaces.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_287">We know from our own experience that many local authorities&#151;probably most of them&#151;such as my own, Waveney district council, have done absolutely nothing. They have not taken up the new powers. They have not changed their own culture of how they tackle litter. That was picked up in the Audit Commission&#039;s recent comprehensive performance assessment of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 92</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Conservative-controlled Waveney district council that said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;Key areas of weakness include weak performance in maintaining a clean and tidy environment. Street cleaning is not effective in Waveney. The council does not make full use of the range of enforcement powers available although it has effectively used some powers including those to tackle litter on private land. The dog warden service has been discontinued and, although the street wardens tackle a wider range of issues, they do not have the power to issue on the spot fines for dog fouling or littering.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_288">The problem is that the council has not shared those findings with the public, so they are still not aware of what their council should be doing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_289">I very much welcome the Bill. I particularly welcome the measures that deal with litter, specifically the idea that local authorities can decide, within guidelines yet to be given, what the fixed penalty should be, but the default amount will be &#163;75, so we can look forward to some heftier fines, thus producing a bigger income stream for those local authorities that take up that option. Local authorities will no longer have an excuse for not using the powers available to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_290">I welcome the fact that beaches will be defined as areas where the litter law takes effect. I am delighted that it is also proposed that it will be an offence to drop litter on private land as well as on public land. It is a good idea that well-organised parish and town councils will have some powers. It is a particularly good idea that litter authorities will be able to authorise individuals other than their own employees to issue fixed penalty notices, as there have been some problems when using contracting companies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_291">My final point is that there will be no excuse for councils not to take up the new powers, but the Government and, indeed, the House still have a role in ensuring that they take them up. We do not want postcode litter enforcement in this country. I ask my right hon. Friend the Minister whether his Department will carry out an annual survey of how many local authorities use the fixed penalty powers. Will he survey the number of enforcement officers employed by each local authority and the number of fines issued by each local authority? May we please have a league table, which is monitored? Perhaps we should consider penalties for not using fixed penalties, but we must change the culture, putting the onus on the polluter, not the taxpayer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_292">Our constituents care about litter, and they want greater action to be taken. They are proud of their neighbourhoods, and they want them to be clean. As taxpayers, they want such action to be taken. They want to make the litter louts pay. If we can focus our efforts on that, we would have cleaner neighbourhoods all around this country.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this important debate on this important Bill. I am pleased in particular to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard), whose constituency is totally different from mine. His is coastal and mine is inland, although this debate points up the fact that we share the same problems to do with the quality of our local environment.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 93</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_293">Most of us remember the European elections in 1999, when the opportunity to take a swipe at the Government was taken by those who did not bother to vote or who did not vote Labour. Notionally, almost every Labour seat gained in 1997&nbsp;would have been lost at a subsequent general election if that result in 1999&nbsp;had been replicated. Why am I talking about the 1999&nbsp;European elections in a debate on this Bill? One seat gained in 1997&nbsp;that would not notionally have been lost in 1999&nbsp;was that of Brent, North.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_294">I had a discussion about that result with my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner), who is not present but is aware that I was planning to refer to him. That led me to import into Reading, East what became known as the Gardiner method. I have spent almost every weekend since knocking on doors in my constituency. I am not unusual in that; many hon. Members are regularly to be found on the doorsteps&#151;otherwise we would not be standing here this evening referring to what our constituents tell us on such occasions. However, most MPs use the roving surgery method, whereby leaflets are delivered and people are asked to put one in their window if they want their MP to call on them. The MP and their team then call on those displaying the leaflet. The Gardiner method is different: everyone gets a leaflet saying that their Member of Parliament is coming to see them, and every door is knocked on. Every household is contacted and asked whether there is anything at all that they want to raise with their MP.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_295">This is not the occasion to enter into a debate about the merits of different methods of contacting our constituents, but the Gardiner method produces an unprompted view from my constituents on what bothers them, and that brings me to today&#039;s debate. What have been raised most with me are the very matters with which the Bill is concerned: abandoned vehicles, fly-tipping, fly-posting, graffiti, dog mess. I believe that that experience is shared by my hon. Friends. I echo the regret that so few Opposition Members are present; I imagine that their constituents will have noticed and that when the election comes they will vote accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para15">
<a name="stpa_296">I have often made the point publicly to local journalists in my constituency about what matters to people, and those journalists have expressed surprise that constituents are not more concerned about the war in Iraq or national themes such as the freedom of information. Those are not the things that people raise on the doorstep. If one goes out and talks to people where they live about what matters to them, the issues raised are the subjects of this Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para16">
<a name="stpa_297">That is a powerful argument against those who deride the Bill as not important. We have seen some of that derision reflected in the media. I read in one national newspaper over the weekend that the Bill was a rag-tag piece of legislation, lacking in vision and typical of what might have been expected from John Major&#039;s Government before 1997. I suggest that the journalist who wrote that talks to real people about what concerns them. That journalist will find that the Bill does concern people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para17">
<a name="stpa_298">In March 2001&nbsp;I initiated an Adjournment debate on abandoned vehicles&#151;one of the first occasions on which that issue was raised in the House. Action did follow that debate, in Reading and Wokingham, and nationally. I very much welcome the even greater 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 94</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>powers that the Bill gives councils to remove some abandoned vehicles from the street immediately. The sometimes lengthy delays in removing such vehicles, which become a hazard, concern people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para18">
<a name="stpa_299">I also welcome the powers to deal with nuisance parking&#151;offering for sale two or more vehicles or repairing a vehicle on the road as part of a business. Too many times it has been difficult to get action taken against such vehicles, but the practice has caused problems for small garages in my constituency, which pay for premises and other necessary overheads. People repairing vehicles on the street will also pour unwanted oil down drains, causing environmental problems. The new powers will therefore be welcomed not just by individuals but by small car repair businesses in my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para19">
<a name="stpa_300">I understand why the power to deal with offering vehicles for sale has been applied to two or more vehicles. After all, if someone wants to sell their own car, they might put a sign in the window offering it for sale and we do not want to penalise people for parking their car on the street or in their drive because they are offering it for sale. However, someone in my constituency serially offered vehicles for sale from the roadside at a secondary shopping centre. Each time only one vehicle was on the street, but as soon as it was sold, another appeared. The mobile phone number given to contact if interested in one of the cars was the same in all cases. Colleagues of mine rang the number on more than one occasion and the same person always answered. That person was using the public highway as a garage, causing a nuisance to my constituents and businesses, and the parking space taken up by the vehicle could not be used by those wanting to go to the shopping parade&#151;yet nothing could be done by the police or the council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para20">
<a name="stpa_301">I am concerned that the Bill would not offer an opportunity to deal properly with such a nuisance and I hope that my right hon. Friends will try to find a way to address that problem as the Bill progresses. Perhaps an amendment could be tabled to change the number of vehicles from two to one but include provision about intent to sell as a business. In that way, the nuisance that businesses and constituents have raised with me arising from a single, serial vehicle seller could be dealt with, but ordinary people trying to sell their own cars would not be caught by the provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para21">
<a name="stpa_302">To take issue with the journalist who disparaged the Bill over the weekend, let us consider the new requirement for local crime and disorder reduction partnerships to take antisocial behaviour affecting the local environment into account in developing crime and disorder strategies. That is most welcome, as it will put the views expressed to me by my constituents on the doorsteps of Reading and Woodley at the heart of action by our police and local councils to tackle that nuisance. The concerns expressed to me will be put at the centre of plans to tackle the nuisance that people experience in their everyday lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para22">
<a name="stpa_303">The greater use of fixed penalty notices as proposed in the Bill is most welcome too, particularly the opportunity for local authorities to keep the income from the fines to pay towards cleaning up our environment. I realise that people might use the same argument against that as they do about fines from speed cameras. My response is the same: &quot;If you don&#039;t want to pay the fine, don&#039;t do the crime.&quot; I hope that the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 95</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hypothecation of income from the fines will allow the expansion of services to catch people littering, fly-posting, fly-tipping, painting graffiti and allowing fouling by dogs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para23">
<a name="stpa_304">In particular I welcome the opportunity for parish councils to issue fixed penalty fines in response to some of those problems, and I look forward to Woodley and Earley town councils in my area coming up with imaginative schemes to deal with that nuisance. It is what the people living in those areas want. I just hope that because Woodley is run by the Liberal Democrats it does not suffer the same fate as Woodley centre did when the Liberal Democrats ran Wokingham council and forgot to bid for money for closed-circuit television to tackle crime. I hope that this time the council will be responsive to its residents and that I will not have to run another campaign among local people so that the council does what it should.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para24">
<a name="stpa_305">There is one aspect that the Bill does not cover but which I would like to see in it: the power for local authorities to remove unnecessary street furniture. My constituency covers the entire town centre of Reading. In the main pedestrianised area of the town centre, there are a number of public payphone kiosks. The company that installed the kiosks has gone out of business and it is no longer possible to use them, but they remain in the street, getting in the way of people walking along it. They have been vandalised and so have become dangerous, yet the council is not currently in a position to remove them. Even if it did remove them, who would pay for doing so? The non-existent company cannot do so; perhaps the taxpayer would have to pay. I want a power in the Bill to remove third-party street furniture in the interests of safety and amenity. It would follow the philosophy of the rest of the Bill if the council were able to claim against the company responsible, or even against the administrators or receivers, for the cost of removing redundant third-party street furniture.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para25">
<a name="stpa_306">I welcome the provisions on fly-tipping. Far too many people think that they can avoid their responsibilities to the environment by dumping their rubbish. They cost all the rest of us, because we have to pay for the removal of such rubbish.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-22_para26">
<a name="stpa_307">This is an important Bill for tackling the problems that affect people where they live. It is an example of this House and our Government doing best what they should do: introducing legislation to make the lives of ordinary, hard-working people in this country better.

It is incredibly frustrating to see a car sitting in the same place for 15&nbsp;days and for it to be vandalised or set on fire by youths. It costs this country &#163;230&nbsp;million to deal with burnt-out vehicles. I can think of many other uses for that money. It costs Stevenage borough council &#163;100,000&nbsp;to deal with abandoned cars.

We have a master-servant mentality because I know that someone else will pick up after me, as someone said to me in Stevenage. The man who pulled up near me when I was walking my dogs on a country lane and who chucked out an entire McDonald&#039;s dinner also thought that someone else would pick up after him.

 I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support the Second Reading of this Bill. Many of the proposed measures, which have

<br>&nbsp;<br>been mentioned by my colleagues, will be of great benefit to people in my constituency who continue the suffer the effects of antisocial behaviour and the damage that litter, graffiti, fly-posting, fly-tipping and abandoned cars inflict on our environment, to name just a few of the things that the Bill will tackle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_319">We all want to live in a pleasant environment. We want clean, safe streets. Yet when an area becomes untidy and unloved, it is easy for those who live there to lose the respect for it that they once had. Once graffiti and litter take control, it often becomes too difficult to take pride in a street. The majority of the population do not litter, abandon cars or scribble graffiti on walls and buildings. They deserve the support and protection of their local authority and the Government in cleaning up the place. The Bill is for the majority of decent, ordinary people who want to live in a clean, safe environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_320">There is no doubt in my mind that we face a greater problem than we did many years ago, and there is no doubt about the need for the Bill. I certainly remember that, as a child, I would not have thrown litter on to the street. On the contrary, everything disposable&#151;sweet papers, cans, packets of crisps&#151;was put into our pockets or bags and placed in a bin at the first opportunity. Now, sadly, it is common to see people come out of a newsagent, rip open their packet of cigarettes and discard the wrapper on the street, without a single thought about the cost of clearing up the mess. Cigarette butts, too, are a filthy but common addition to street litter, and I am pleased to note that they are now being classed as litter. Despite existing laws, there are few cases of fines for littering, so it is clear that local authorities need more powers to tackle the problems that affect our towns and local environments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_321">That is one reason why I welcome the Bill, and I am both surprised and saddened that the Conservative Opposition have decided not to support it. I listened carefully to the opening remarks of the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo). Not only did I hear nothing about what the Conservatives might propose, but in many cases I heard the hon. Gentleman agreeing with the need for legislation. I remain baffled, as I think most members of our communities will be, about why the Conservatives have chosen not to support the Bill. Of course, Bills often require amendment, but the time to do that, as someone who has been on the Front Bench for many years should know, is in Committee, rather than opposing the whole Bill on Second Reading.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_322">One reason that the Conservatives gave for opposing the Bill is their strange belief that it affects urban communities and ignores rural ones. I would not claim for a moment that Watford is a rural community; it is an urban environment, but it is surrounded by rural communities. Although I do not have many farmers in my constituency, the one or two who do live there have complained for many years about the problem of fly-tipping on their land, saying that they have to pick up the cost and no one is there to support them. I hope that the Bill will provide some comfort to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_323">I also welcome the fact that as Watford is part of Hertfordshire, we have many town and rural parish councils and they will now be given an opportunity to contribute to controlling litter and graffiti through the use of fixed penalty notices. I hope that the parish councils in my constituency, particularly Abbots Langley, will take that opportunity.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-23_para16">
<a name="stpa_324">I want to concentrate on a clause that will make a huge difference to many areas in Watford. Antisocial behaviour has been a particular problem for the people living on the Sherwoods estate. The design of the estate is such that it is dissected by an exceptionally high number of pathways. The community has been working closely with the police over the past 18&nbsp;months to combat antisocial behaviour, and they have welcomed the many powers put into the toolbox for police and local authority use over that time. Dispersal powers under section 30&nbsp;of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, antisocial behaviour orders and acceptable behaviour contracts are among the measures used to try to curb the problems affecting local people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-23_para17">
<a name="stpa_325">The difficulty is that the nature and design of the estate means that youths being chased by the police can disperse very quickly through the pathways. In addition, as many of the paths run along the back or side of people&#039;s properties, they provide easy access to those who want to try unlawfully to gain entry to people&#039;s houses and gardens. That does not help when one is trying to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. On top of that, Hertfordshire county council&#039;s difficulties with lighting contracts means that many of the areas and paths on the estate do not have sufficient lighting. All that means that, sadly, the estate has suffered from antisocial behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-23_para18">
<a name="stpa_326">Earlier last year, the residents association, which formed to try to unite in dealing with those problems, asked the county council to make the relevant orders to close some of the pathways. The plan had been agreed by residents and the police, and although some routes would be gated, others would be left for people to use. The community had even been told that money was available to make sure that those gating orders could be made. However, under the current legislation the task is not so easy. The county council told residents that it had to put out a notice to inform various organisations of the plan, including the Ramblers Association, the Open Spaces Society and the British Horse Society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-23_para19">
<a name="stpa_327">Anybody who knows Watford, and in particular some of the estates, will know that it is not an area where one frequently sees ramblers. Even smaller is the chance of anybody using the paths in the middle of a housing estate for horse riding. I would not have believed it possible that the community&#039;s wishes could be thwarted by those organisations. Sadly, however, it was possible. Despite the attempts by Hertfordshire county council to reach a compromise and my attempts to contact the organisations&#039; head offices, we were unable to reach an agreement on the paths that the residents wanted gated, even though there would have been a sufficient number of paths left for people to use.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-23_para20">
<a name="stpa_328">The responses that I received from the organisations were varied. The British Horse Society merely acknowledged my letter and told me that it would be writing to me with more detail and in more depth in due course. That was in October, and I am still waiting. The Open Spaces Society sent what was, frankly, a rather arrogant letter that completely missed the point. In displaying such arrogance, the organisations seem to forget the people who have to endure the problems of antisocial behaviour and live, day in and day out, with the difficulties that result from the environment in which 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 100</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>they live. They should make the decision, but others may decide that there is a greater principle at stake, keeping a pathway open rather than simply closing and gating it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-23_para21">
<a name="stpa_329">I hope that the Bill, in which I have great confidence, will provide people on the Sherwoods estate and elsewhere in Watford with an opportunity to have gating in areas where it is needed to tackle antisocial behaviour.

<p><a name="st_141"><a name="50110-24_spnew0"><b> Dr. Alan Whitehead  (Southampton, Test) (Lab):</b> 
 Like many hon. Members, I have puzzled about why the Conservatives decided to oppose this excellent Bill tonight, and I have come up with an explanation, which I shall advance later. However, I might excuse the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo), as I got the&#151;perhaps entirely erroneous&#151;impression that he was winking at us while making his introductory remarks and that, in fact, he did not believe a word that he was saying. I might be entirely wrong about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_330">This weekend, I spoke to residents of the Saltmead estate in my constituency. Although it is a well-appointed estate, the residents expressed considerable concern about graffiti, fly-posting, litter and other problems. If I told them that there was a Bill before Parliament that could make a real difference but that the Conservatives in the House of Commons argued that there was too much emphasis on urban areas so they would oppose it, they would not believe me. Residents around Gover road want a cutway and bridge closed or gated under the new legislation. The council thinks it does not have the powers to do that, even though the cutway and bridge seem to serve the sole function of enabling people to cause damage and run off undetected. If I told the residents that there was a Bill that would allow legal gating of that cutway and bridge, but that the Conservatives opposed it because they were worried about producer responsibility for chewing gum manufacturers, they would again not believe me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_331">Some have characterised the Bill as a number of disconnected measures, but it is a deeply connected Bill. It is about liveability&#151;the ability of communities to live well on the basis of shared respect for their environment and for the circumstances in which they live. All of us hear in our surgeries about how our constituents&#039; lives are being made hell by noise, graffiti or antisocial behaviour, and how their community is, as they see it, being degraded by fly-tipping, litter, abandoned cars and so on. Each act is carried out, often with no thought, by individuals who take the rights that they gain from living in a community but who, for some reason, decide on the occasion of their act that the responsibility that goes with it is not for them. Or they think that one such act&#151;one van load of waste tipped in a field, one car abandoned in a car park, one tag on a wall announcing, &quot;KBK kicks butt&quot;&#151;will make no difference, but it does.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_332">I liken that sort of behaviour to irresponsible driving. We all drive&#151;or at least, most of us do&#151;on the same side of the road not only for our own safety, but for the benefit and mutual convenience of others. We do not consider that the nanny state has forced us all to drive on the correct side of the road and&#151;with some exceptions&#151;we do not think that a brief episode of driving on the wrong side of the road will go unnoticed. It does not, and it causes disproportionate disruption to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 101</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>all the other considerate behaviour on the road, so it is not surprising that it is an offence. Environmental crime should be an offence for the same reason.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_333">Whether one calls it social capital or, as some have, the neighbourly society, it is a method&#151;in this Bill, a positive one&#151;of maintaining and strengthening the cohesion of society and liveability for the whole neighbourhood. The signals given by abandoned vehicles, fly-tipping, graffiti and litter are that that cohesion is falling away&#151;that it does not really matter, that people can get away with worse and that there are no real responsibilities to be contemplated. I was interested to read a little while ago a statement that seemed to sum up that view, which said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;The neighbourly society&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. inducts the individual into the community and the community sustains the neighbourly society&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What we see in too many neighbourhoods is a vicious cycle of disorder leading to insecurity then to community breakdown, then into the retreat of socializing influences and therefore to further disorder.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_334">That quote is drawn from a speech made to the Centre for Policy Studies by the shadow Chancellor, the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin). It is clear that senior Conservatives will the end, but not the means. Do they support the view set out by the shadow Chancellor that there is a connection, that there is a cycle and that communities must be able to support themselves and to expect that, when they are attacked, they can defend themselves? That is the essence of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_335">Significantly&#151;at this point, I offer my promised explanation&#151;it is local councils, parish councils and town councils that are the subject of the powers and measures set out in the Bill. The police will have powers to confiscate fly-tippers&#039; vans&#151;an imaginative measure&#151;but waste authorities will have new powers to manage recycling, and district councils will have powers to remove abandoned vehicles quickly and effectively and to deal with fly-posting. Local government bodies will, among other things, be able to restore errant shopping trolleys to their rightful location&#151;a measure that Southampton city council tried, but was unable, to implement under section 5&nbsp;of the Local Government Act 2000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_336">The end, if we order the means of getting to the end, is an issue about the public role. It is about the community and public space&#151;roads, public buildings, parks and common lands and the space in which the public move and enjoy interaction with others. If we will the end, it is that public space that is the area in which society works well or does not work well. We have to will the end through public measures and the efforts of public authorities through which the liveability of communities thrives or declines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_337">I am minded of the call for minimal government that we have heard yet again from the Opposition. On every occasion their recourse is to the market. Their definition of politics is essentially about the private individual in his or her private sphere. In an intervention, the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) bewailed the idea in the Bill that section 32&nbsp;of the 1990&nbsp;legislation should be turned off so that local authorities would not be forced to put out waste disposal contracts to third party companies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_338">The explanation is that public authorities acting together, acting imaginatively and bringing forward new ways of thinking about waste disposal, is an 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 102</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>infinitely superior way of going forward as compared with the straitjacket that was imposed by the 1990&nbsp;legislation. I would like other sections of the 1990&nbsp;legislation, especially those relating to variable charges for local authorities in terms of collecting waste, also to be turned off. Perhaps that is another matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_339">The issue of the private individual in his or her private sphere is perhaps at the heart of the opposition to the Bill. However, the Bill lies at the opposite of all that. It looks instead further to empower the community in the shape of its elected local organisations. That is not just to hold the line but to move forward the liveability of communities. That in reality is the common sense of community. People know that their lives can be greatly enriched by co-operation with their neighbours and by the shared sense of what their community is. They know also that that fragile enterprise is potentially prey to the actions of perhaps one or two who free ride on that community&#039;s efforts and actions. They want the measures that are set out in the Bill and they know that the market will not produce them for them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_340">I commend the Bill. I hope that those who vote against it will think long and hard when they talk about the community and its rights and responsibilities. They will have failed their own communities just as if they had gone out and dumped a car or plonked a pile of rubbish in a lay-by.

<p><a name="st_142"><a name="50110-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Borrow  (South Ribble) (Lab):</b> 
 I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate. Having listened earlier to the statement from my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister about the Indian ocean disaster and the earlier questions and answers on Iraq, many of us could be forgiven for thinking that we are dealing with an unimportant area of public concern. However, Labour Members, especially those who have served as local councillors, know that many of the issues dealt with by the Bill are at the heart of people&#039;s concerns. I welcome the Bill especially because it has the support of the Local Government Association. Many of the Bill&#039;s provisions stem directly from the concerns of those who have the responsibility of running local authorities at district, council or parish level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_341">Many of the measures set out in the Bill build on legislation that is already in place. Part of the problem, which many of us recognise, is that existing powers are difficult to operate and implement. If, through the Bill, their implementation can be speeded and made easier, and in many instances significantly strengthened, we shall be doing a good job of work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_342">Why is the Bill important now? Why is it not, as the Conservatives say, a measure only for urban areas? The headlines in the press would have us think that graffiti, litter and abandoned vehicles are all about run-down urban areas. My constituency is semi-rural with an unemployment rate of 1&nbsp;per cent. South Ribble borough council in my constituency recently conducted a survey and discovered that the vast majority of its residents thought that South Ribble was a good place to live. It has good schools, low unemployment, nice housing and good health services. However, 24&nbsp;per cent. of local residents thought that clean streets and litter were a high priority&#151;only 1&nbsp;per cent. less than the 25&nbsp;per

<br>&nbsp;<br>cent. who thought that crime and disorder was the most important issue. Crime and disorder, litter, clean streets and the environment are important in a constituency such as mine because issues that were of concern years ago have been dealt with. Residents have good schools and jobs, and we have low unemployment, interest rates and inflation. South Ribble is a nice place to live. However, when I knock on people&#039;s doors or meet them at coffee mornings, they talk to me about things that matter in their immediate neighbourhood. For example, they are worried about the ginnel in Penwortham that local youths use when going to and from school. It is covered in graffiti and terribly unpleasant, and a lady has been to see me regularly over the past seven years to try to get it cleaned up. The existing powers, however, make it difficult to deal with the problem properly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_343">My constituents are worried about cars that are abandoned in rural areas and not cleared away quickly enough. They are worried about litter, not just in town centres but in otherwise pleasant neighbourhoods. Sometimes, people allow their property or land to become an unsightly mess covered in litter or graffiti. No one seems to have the power to do anything about that&#151;the argument is that it is private land or property so, unless it is a health hazard, nothing can be done. However, under the Bill, local authorities will be able to tackle the problem. Residents in the area who care about their homes and gardens and look after them, and who do not repair their vehicles on the street leaving oil everywhere, do not want their neighbourhood to depreciate in value or look a mess because one or two people fail to look after their properties and act as good neighbours. If the Bill makes it easier to deal with some of those problems, we should support it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_344">These are not simply issues for urban areas&#151;all of them are raised in the 11&nbsp;villages in my constituency time after time. When I write my weekly column for the rural issue of the free paper in my area, I will take great delight explaining to residents that the Bill is opposed by the Conservative party. I am sure that my probable Conservative opponent in the general election will be questioned about whether she supports her Front-Bench spokesmen, who continue to oppose the Bill.

<a name="stpa_345">I welcome the proposal to introduce greater powers to gate alleys. Lancashire county council has lobbied me for the past two years to try to secure powers to gate alleys throughout the county. It is a major issue in many Lancashire towns and I am glad that the Bill tackles it. I listened with interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Claire Ward), who talked about the problems of footpaths on an estate. Before I came to the House, I was a councillor for 10&nbsp;years in Preston and one of my biggest bugbears was an estate with lots of little footpaths. The residents agreed that some of them should be closed to make the area more secure and safe, but every time that we tried to do something about it the ramblers and other organisations lodged an objection, so we did not succeed. If the Bill allows us to tackle the problem, that will be an important step forward.

They are proactive. They do not simply do the minimum. They look at ways in which they can make a difference. Several of the parish councils in my area&#151;Hesketh Bank, Becconsall, Tarleton and North Meols in particular&#151;are putting together village design plans with a vision of how their communities will develop. They are just the sort of parish councils that will want to take up some of the powers in the Bill to develop and lead their communities. That is as it should be.

<a name="50110-24_para17">
<a name="stpa_347">I welcome much in the Bill. It will be a major step forward. It may seem trivial to some, but the fact that the powers were suggested by local authorities that have to deal with the problems at grassroots level means that there is a strong possibility that the Bill will improve the situation. If I have one concern&#151;I should like my right hon. Friend to consider this&#151;it is whether there will be sufficient resources for the measures in the Bill to be fully implemented by local authorities, and whether the Department should monitor the extent to which local authorities make use of the powers when the Bill is enacted, to ensure that we have got it right. There is little use in us here in Parliament passing good legislation that gives powers to make things happen if those who have been given the powers fail to use them.

 I begin by expressing my astonishment that on an issue that affects the quality of life of millions of ordinary people, so few Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members wished to speak or even to attend the debate. As the newest Member of the House, I find it unbelievable that there are only two Members of the Conservative Opposition on the Front Bench and only one Member on the Liberal Democrat Benches.

They want me to deal with ugly and neglected buildings and thoughtlessly planned alley gates and rat runs, which help breed and nurture crime, drug dealing and antisocial behaviour on their estates. During my street surgeries I see all too clearly how bad planning and environmental neglect and decline prove to be barriers to opportunity and fulfilling potential.

<a name="stpa_350">I welcome the Bill, not least because I know that it will work by and large. I know it because my constituency has already started to implement some of the measures. Hartlepool is a forward-looking town. It has made great leaps forward with regeneration initiatives such as the new deal for communities and neighbourhood renewal. With Labour the largest group in the local authority and, to be fair to him, an independent mayor&#151;under Labour councillors&#039; guidance&#151;who has passionately embraced the Government&#039;s agenda of neighbourhood and environmental renewal, street-based policies are making an impact. In the past 12&nbsp;months the local authority has responded to 362&nbsp;complaints about graffiti, and has issued 89&nbsp;fixed penalty notices for littering. More than 450&nbsp;abandoned and untaxed cars have been removed from the streets of Hartlepool, which has led to a 65&nbsp;per cent. reduction in overall vehicle-related crime in the town and a 55&nbsp;per cent. reduction in vehicle arson. The Bill will help my local communities to build on that success, and to achieve even more.

Crime in Hartlepool has fallen dramatically in the past nine months, by between 35&nbsp;and 40&nbsp;per cent., thanks to enthusiastic embracing of the Government&#039;s policies by the police and other agencies; but this measure will make a specific, real difference.

<a name="50110-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_352">As a result of the Bill, a hit list of all untaxed cars will be provided through a planned initiative between the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the local authority. That will provide a quick response, and instant removal when that is appropriate. A direct link to a range of agencies&#039; files and databases will help the council to ensure that crimes such as fly-tipping, dog fouling, littering, noise nuisance and damage to street furniture are tackled quickly, thus preventing the rot from seeping in and leading to neglect and long-term decline. I hope that advances will also be made to ensure that fast-food outlets work alongside the local authority and others, so that we no longer see pizza boxes and kebab wrappers after the pubs shut for the night.

It also provides much stronger&#151;and welcome&#151;powers for parish councils to impose fines for litter and to ensure that they, like local authorities, play a role in making their areas safer and cleaner. I find it disappointing that other residents groups and agencies are not empowered to take the initiative in the same way.

However, I am sure that such moves to improve the neighbourhood and own a part of it would take place in Hartlepool anyway, thanks to the dynamic leadership provided in the residents group by John Reid and in the PCT by Gerald Wistow. Obviously there would need to be strict controls in relation to governance and accountability for residents associations&#151;I agree with the Minister and the hon.

 I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality on bringing it before the House. Its full significance will probably not be appreciated for some time but it will be as important as the Janner legislation of 1945&nbsp;to 1951&nbsp;on town and country planning and the legislation introduced by Arthur Skeffington during the Wilson Government to improve our environment.

We explain that the Speaker and his deputies have enormous difficulty meeting the needs of all 659&nbsp;Members, who want to speak on a range of issues. We even have the phrase, &quot;There is mileage on the clock.&quot; If Members have spoken too often in the Session, they are less likely, rightly, to get preferment and to catch the Speaker&#039;s eye.

Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo), when he tried to explain why he was going to vote against Second Reading and to commend that course to his colleagues. He did not offer any alternatives to ameliorate the problems of vandalism, fly-tipping, graffiti and litter, which are a terrible blot on our environment and a source of great irritation to Labour and Conservative voters alike. He did not make any proposals. To be fair, he said that existing powers could remedy the problems, but he did not tell us how he would ensure that those powers were triggered and what mechanism there was to flag up with all the various agencies that they should exercise their powers. I think that he is wrong, but he did not tell us or, more important, Conservative voters how he intended to tackle the issues that we are trying to deal with tonight. He owes it to the electors to explain why the Conservative Opposition voted against a measure that I would have thought and hoped commanded support across the political spectrum.

In fact, two thirds of the borough of Thurrock has very attractive green belt land, but of course it does suffer from the main problems that have been referred to this afternoon, including the dumping of waste on both public and private land. I welcome the fact that the Bill will remove discrimination between private and public land, put the burden of payment on the polluter, and impose significant sanctions on those who pollute and who dump controlled waste in particular. Indeed, such sanctions even include the seizing of vehicles when this crime is committed.

Often, it is some of the best people, but who live in some of the poorest areas, who have to endure such problems. Cars that are put up on bricks for weeks and months on end constitute a real danger for small children. I welcome the measures in the Bill, which will streamline the action to be taken, but I ask that the Minister give me some assurance on this issue. When the police want to conduct a forensic examination of a stolen or vandalised car, its owner is sometimes charged for its impounding. That is wholly unsatisfactory, and I hope that this problem can be dealt with in Committee or in conjunction with the Home Office. People who have already lost out by having their car stolen or vandalised should not be further disadvantaged by being charged.

Contamination from dog excrement poses a considerable danger, particularly to children and to people&#039;s eyesight.

We have a legislative opportunity to ensure that horses that are taken in by local authorities are redeemable by their owners only if and when they pay the full cost.

The wonderful regions of Northern Ireland and its rich coastline should be enhanced by this legislation.

Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)&#151;the extent of cross-party arrangements in local government, particularly in the Local Government Association, in the light of the fact that the official Opposition have decided to vote against the Bill on Second Reading. One of the advantages of finishing early is that the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) will have every opportunity to urge her arguments. If she had a bag carrier besides the Opposition Whip, we might still be able to get the Opposition in place to persuade them of the merits of voting in favour of the Bill on Second Reading, even if, quite rightly, they call us to account in Committee.

<a name="stpa_372">Politicians are to some extent catching up with the general public. For a long time, they have viewed quality of life issues as crucial to how they live their lives, so we need to catch up with them. In my area, an active community campaign was initiated by Liz Hall. I know that my right hon. Friend was able to respond to a debate initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda), in which we examined the relationship between urban centres and surrounding rural or semi-rural areas. It showed how much we were dependent on each other. This lady, Liz Hall, off her own back about nine months ago, called a community meeting in her village of Harescombe, to which people in some of the other villages&#151;Haresfield, Edge, Painswick and so forth&#151;were invited. The aim was to consider why they were having so many problems with fly-tipping in the beautiful woods of Cranham, Edge and Sheepscombe. The meetings continue to this day; in fact, there is one tomorrow. If I can get away from this place, I would like to attend it to advance some ideas on how further to bear down on an unacceptable form of antisocial behaviour.

You or I, Mr. Deputy Speaker, may not be partial to having the odd tyre, mattress or bedstead thrown over into our habitats, but the great crested newts are even less partial to that, so we will have to be very careful how we do it on Sunday. That is the nature of working together to try to solve these problems. The essence of the Bill is not the consensus that is beginning to evolve between the parties, but the consensus between communities, the Environment Agency, the police and local authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_376">Mention has been made of parish and town councils, but smaller district authorities such as mine in Stroud have taken on board the antisocial behaviour agenda. I pay tribute to its antisocial behaviour co-ordinator, Colin Peake, who has highlighted the need to deal with fly-posting. While I would not say that he has cleared our streets of awful posters advertising nightclubs, he has a way of taking down the details, going to clubs and saying that the posters are their responsibility. On a Sunday, he goes to car boot sales and collects all the placards, puts them in the boot of his car and reminds the people concerned that they might like to collect them. If they do it again the next week, action is taken. He has a clear rule: they can have the placards up for 48&nbsp;hours, after which those concerned have to go and pick them up. Otherwise, they cannot put them up again. Colin Peake needs support; the Bill is about co-ordination and making sure that someone like him can be supported by the political class and by the community.

<a name="stpa_377">Clearly there is a resource issue&#151;no one is pretending that these things are cost-free&#151;but it will not be a great one if we can share the costs around. We must make it clear that the police being asked to take on additional responsibilities does not mean that another layer of authority is washing its hands of an issue and giving it to the police, and vice versa if we are talking about the care of stray dogs, for example. There is a need for genuine partnership, and that must be action, not just words.

<a name="stpa_378">Like all Bills, the proof will not be in the law or in the amendments that we table, but in how it is seen out there. As my hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_379">Some of us would argue that we should have had the wherewithal to be doing this some time before, because quality of life issues are gaining salience, not as a result of a selfish motivation but because of people&#039;s pride in their community. We are a more materialistic society; therefore, there is more waste that we have to deal with, and we must deal with it at source. In these days of extreme weather changes, one sees, sadly, that some of the waste that is allegedly fly-tipped is down to the wind blowing people&#039;s refuse. We have to look at a better way of integrating waste collection and disposal with other services.

<a name="stpa_382">There is no evidence in the Bill of a joined-up approach to government. It straddles at least three Departments&#151;the Home Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, who has obviously been engaged in other matters for the past week, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The Secretary of State waxed lyrical about the new powers being granted to local authorities and the Environment Agency. However, she went so far as to say that while she was imposing and creating new offences and responsibilities, they should not be taken as duties. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to set out for the House&#039;s information what new resources have been allocated and what financial assessment has been made, particularly in view of the fact that the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay), sharing the view of the Law Society, pointed out that it will, in many cases, be the poorer and more deprived members of society, who are least able to pay, who will be penalised. The Minister will, I am sure, hope to confirm what the Secretary of State said about there being no additional resources and no pump-priming. Seemingly, therefore, there will be no recognition of the new powers and the increased costs.

<a name="stpa_383">The Secretary of State said that in certain instances the Bill relieves the police of powers in relation to nuisance. That raises the question whether it will transfer resources from the police to local authorities to enable them to use those powers. A constant theme has been requests to local authorities to take on more powers, but what recognition have the Government given to the costs of empowering local councils. For example, there is the need for staff training and providing staff with the tools to do the work set out in the Bill.

That raises the risk that the legislation could be used by authorities to justify the towing away of a vehicle to an off-road location in the interests of congestion management, following the provisions of the Traffic Management Act 2004, which grants such powers to local authorities and Highways Agency traffic officers. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will be aware of the concerns raised by the Royal Automobile Club and the AA and would wish to respond on that point.

What consultation with councils will take place on fixed penalty notices? Many councils and local authorities have expressed concerns about how the provisions will apply, and are concerned that there will not be a full and frank consultation. Will he confirm that he has not unintentionally and inadvertently discriminated in relation to the immediate removal of abandoned vehicles from urban areas, which the Bill explicitly empowers local authorities to do, whereas in rural areas, landowners are to remove them at their own cost? Surely the Government would intend powers to be applied uniformly in rural and urban areas.

I must confess that chewing gum has a certain dental function, and the company has an education policy and works through schools, scouts and guides. It is undertaking market-based research and is looking into more biodegradable forms of gum. It would be the first to accept the advice to consumers, which was followed religiously under the last Conservative Government but seems to be on the wane under the Labour Government: &quot;Wrap it and bin it&quot;.

The fines are set too low. The powers are not real powers&#151;they do not impose duties, as the Secretary of State told the House earlier. The procedures used are too cumbersome. The Bill fails to put rural and urban areas on an equal footing. It is unclear how fine revenue raised will be allocated. Will there be full consultation, not just with local authorities but with waste disposal companies? Will the Minister consider favourably our proposal that some of the moneys raised from fixed penalty notices should go to raising awareness of responsible waste disposal companies, so recycling the money rather than simply putting it into general local authority finances?

I have undertaken environmental work with young people, and a couple of days seem quite long. Ten days sounds very long; 100&nbsp;days seems courageous in the extreme. What did I find when I visited Manchester on day 99? Did I find exhausted staff and people who were demoralised by having bitten off more than they could chew? No, I found councillors and officers exhilarated by the exponential growth in community involvement&#151;the engagement of local communities, the increasing activity as people realised that they had time to get involved and that the issue was being taken seriously by a strong local authority.

Councillor Clarissa Holland, in the ward of Splott, has worked with the citizens of Bayside. They have been affected by the ingress of youngsters from outside the area who have done an enormous amount of damage to the local community. The people of Splott made use of antisocial behaviour orders and exclusion orders, working with the police and the local authority.

So, an area may have a problem that is leading to lots of fines being levied, but none of the money comes back to the local authority.

<a name="stpa_426">The hon. Lady rightly referred to Travellers and their impact on some communities&#151;something that I have experienced in my constituency. She also made the case for greater flexibility in deciding whether to contract out waste functions. Greater clarity in waste disposal targets and improvements brought about by the Government, particularly the comprehensive performance assessment, which has been mentioned several times, make the narrow requirement that the Bill will remove unnecessary. I look forward to discussing in Committee some of the other concerns that she highlighted.

<a name="50110-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_427">My hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard) called on local authorities to use the powers that are given in the Bill. I assure him that I 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 122</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>believe that there is a strong will among local authorities to do just that. I sit on the Central Local Partnership, which is chaired by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. With my ODPM colleague, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning, we have co-chaired a working group with a variety of interests, including local government, on sustainable communities. The Local Government Association has been deeply involved with this work. I believe that it will strongly support not only the passage of the Bill, but its implementation to good effect throughout the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_428">I believe that there is a will to use the powers that are set out in the Bill. Issues such as the comprehensive performance assessment will encourage that, as will the fact that a short while ago we published the third ENCAMS report. We never previously had a proper comparison year on year to tell us whether things were changing for the better or the worse. We now have that information. We also have best value performance indicator 199, which measures performance by local authorities. Finally, we have the annual survey of the use of fixed penalty notices. At present, there is a 70&nbsp;per cent. response, but one that we want, with local government, to be improved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_429">The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) suggested in an intervention that the Government had not responded to the recommendation for access to Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency data. He is incorrect, as the Committee was in the first instance. The DVLA makes available to local authorities a website for such inquiries. It started rolling out free online access to its vehicle records for inquiries about abandoned vehicles in September 2002. About 220&nbsp;local authorities are now connected to the service. I would encourage local authorities that are not already making use of this facility to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_430">My hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) said that she was delighted that the Government had been brave enough to take on these issues. I was impressed by the findings of her constituency surveys that showed that two thirds of responses identified problems with litter, graffiti, gum and abandoned cars as priorities. Her constituents want the new laws that we are now providing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_431">My hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Mr. Challen) rightly referred to the determination of Labour councillors in Leeds to tackle local environmental issues. I have spoken to several of them about these matters. The powers do not require extra resources in general. We have made it simpler for local authorities effectively to undertake their work without placing greater weight on their responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_432">My hon. Friend referred to the accountability of parish councils, as did the hon. Member for Guildford. My confidence that we are adopting the right approach reflects the experience of the past three years. The National Association of Local Councils and the Society of Local Council Clerks, nationally and at regional level, have shown great leadership. That is reflected at local level by many parish councils.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-29_para16">
<a name="stpa_433">I know that Conservative Members are not interested in parish councils, but we on the Government Benches are, and we are seeing their reflected performance as a result of local community leadership. There are about 7,000&nbsp;parishes, and 10,000&nbsp;if we take into account 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 123</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>community councils in Wales. There are plenty of poor examples, but elected accountability is a requirement for a quality parish council. Peer support is helping to create a cadre of hugely effective parish and town councils.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-29_para17">
<a name="stpa_434">My hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Claire Ward) said that antisocial behaviour in a community that wants to help itself requires the use of exclusion orders and antisocial behaviour orders. She is right. Having created antisocial behaviour orders at the Home Office, I am always happy to hear of their success. I have seen the orders make a real difference in local communities. My hon. Friend is right to say that no one measure will change everything and that proportionality and logic have to be brought to bear. I am saddened to hear of an obstruction put in the way of a local solution in closing off an access that is a problem in my hon. Friend&#039;s area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-29_para18">
<a name="stpa_435">Like everything, these powers will strengthen the ability of local authorities comprehensively to tackle crime, disorder and damage to the environment. I commend the Bill to the House.

<p><a name="st_182"><a name="50110-33_spnew0"><b> Mr. Robert Syms  (Poole) (Con):</b> 
 The debate today is on Porton Down and the case of my constituent, Douglas Shave. I am pleased to have this opportunity to put on record a little about his experiences. He is not unique&#151;the House has heard many similar stories in the past about how national servicemen were treated in the late 1940s and 1950s at Porton Down, and I am sure that Members will want to bring up this subject again on many other occasions. I have been struck since I managed to obtain the debate by the number of Members who have stopped me in the various Corridors of this House and recounted individual cases of people who went through tests and believe that that has had a detrimental impact on their health and on their lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_436">I was hoping for the attendance of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Atkinson), but he is stuck in traffic somewhere between here and an airport and sends his apologies. When I was carrying out research for this debate, I found that he had initiated a similar debate on behalf of his constituent, Michael Paynter, in 1996. However, I note the attendance of several Members in the Chamber. It is not unusual for only one or two Members to attend Adjournment debates held at this late hour, but there are half a dozen Members here and I know that they have all taken an interest in the topic and spoken on it in this place in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_437">The hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall) is in his place and the Under-Secretary of State for Defence and I are happy that he should make a brief contribution after I have finished and before the Minister replies. No doubt he will sweep up some points that I may miss.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_438">My constituent was born in 1931. He was called up for national service on 2&nbsp;November 1949&nbsp;and joined the Royal Air Force. He did his basic training followed by trade training and his final posting was as a leading aircraftsman at the education department at RAF Bicester. He was transferred to Porton Down on 8&nbsp;August 1950, following a station notice requesting volunteers for common cold research&#151;a story that we have all heard before. I know that those who have looked into the matter have said that it was one for local bases and that no notices have survived the passage of time, but my constituent was certainly under the impression that he was doing common cold research.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_439">The advantage for Douglas was not necessarily additional pay or leave, but the fact that his family come from the west country&#151;from Dorset&#151;and Porton Down was a little closer to home. That is why he took the opportunity to volunteer at Porton Down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_440">Mr. Shave was at Porton Down between 8&nbsp;and 14&nbsp;August 1950. On 9&nbsp;August 1950, he and three other national service volunteers were put into a chamber wearing gas masks. Following the introduction of the gas, the nerve agent GE&#151;ethyl sarin&#151;they were told to remove their gas masks. Further tests were carried out during the following days. Those facts were confirmed, in a letter of 16&nbsp;March 1998, by Dr. Hall, who was then the technical director of the chemical and biological department of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency at Porton Down.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_441">My constituent states that soon afterwards he experienced skin problems that the RAF tried to treat. Unfortunately, there are no records of that. He was discharged in 1951&nbsp;with an exemplary service record, which is on file. Since then, he has suffered severe eczema. Many national servicemen who went through those tests suffered neurological and a range of other problems, but severe eczema for 50&nbsp;years is extremely painful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_442">My constituent has major scarring to his back. He told me that when he joined the RAF he had a face like a baby&#039;s bottom, but on occasions his facial eczema has been so bad that he has had to use make-up to cover it. It has been extremely difficult to deal with that problem over the last 50&nbsp;years. He found it difficult to hold down employment with other employers. His first job, in the 1950s, was in management for Odeon-Gaumont theatres, but due to the severity of his facial skin condition he had to resign on 18&nbsp;November 1954.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_443">My constituent has suffered from recurrent ill health. As a result, he started up his own business in which he was successful. He has had a successful family life; he has a wife and grandchildren. It was only in 1998, when Dr. Hall, the technical director of DERA, told Mr. Shave that he had experienced sarin nerve gas, that he heard what the tests were about. It was quite a shock.
</p>








<p><a name="st_183"><a name="50110-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. John Bercow  (Buckingham) (Con):</b> 
 My hon. Friend&#039;s description reflects the experience of my constituent, Mr. Peter Carpenter of Haddenham, who went to Porton Down in 1951&nbsp;for a similar purpose. To underline the point that my hon. Friend made, my constituent was given no protective clothing or gas mask&#151;unlike the Army personnel who were similarly engaged but properly protected. He was taken to a field. He held a white rabbit in a cage and witnessed a controlled explosion. The rabbit had a seizure and died.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_444">Subsequently, my constituent felt ill but was told by Army personnel and professors, who undertook no tests or examinations on him, that he would shortly be better and could return to his regiment. He suffered lost teeth, aches, pains and deteriorating joints and discovered only in the 1990s that he had been exposed not to the common cold virus, but to sarin. Is not that a disgrace?
</p>








<p><a name="st_184"><a name="50110-33_spnew2"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 My hon. Friend did very well to put on record the difficulties that his constituent has faced. There are many cases of people finding out very much later in life what happened to them, thus filling in part of the jigsaw of their treatment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_445">Mr. Shave has been a constituent of a number of MPs, including my hon. Friends the Members for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Atkinson), who have written to Ministers over recent years. Unfortunately, my constituent&#039;s application for a war pension has been dismissed. He is a member of the Porton Down Veterans Support Group, which has been very active. He is, frankly, amazed that there has not been a public inquiry or even an apology for how they were treated during their time at Porton Down. Standards were different in those days, but I do not understand why we should not look at what went on to try to find out more about what happened 50&nbsp;years ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_446">Some progress has been made. There has been openness in the release of DERA records from Porton Down. That is one of the reasons why my constituent 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 138</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>has found out what happened to him, and the same applies in the case mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow). A medical assessment programme has been set up. The Medical Research Council has offered to fund studies into the conditions suffered by Porton Down veterans. The Wiltshire constabulary has carried out an investigation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_447">Indeed, an inquest has been held into the death of Ronald Maddison, with a corner&#039;s verdict of unlawful killing. Following 64&nbsp;days of testimony and 4,000&nbsp;pages of documents, that was the jury&#039;s finding. That may be subject to judicial review, so the Minister may not wish to say much about it, but many of the veterans of that time certainly feel aggrieved that the Government are seeking a judicial review on a decision that they feel is a sign of hope for most of the rest of them. Indeed, I have received a number of e-mails. One of them was forwarded to me from my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), from Barry J. Barnes of Pirbright, Surrey, who was one of those who gave evidence to the Maddison inquest, and he wanted me to raise that issue.
</p>








<p><a name="st_185"><a name="50110-33_spnew3"><b> Mr. Paul Tyler  (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> 
 Is it not a fact that the Maddison case is crucial for all those who were affected&#151;including the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituent and that of the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) and, indeed, others&#151;because it shows that none of them gave informed consent? They gave consent, but it was not informed. In those circumstances, their consent must surely be null and void. That must be the critical legal issue, and it is why the Maddison case is so important for other victims.
</p>








<p><a name="st_186"><a name="50110-33_spnew4"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point, and some of his constituents have suffered in this way, as have those of many Members. It may be for a longer debate in future when Members may have an opportunity to put all those individual cases, but people did not know what they were signing up to, and that may have had an impact on their lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_448">I hope that the Minister will abandon the MOD line, set up a public inquiry and look into what happened to those young men. I certainly hope that he has had the opportunity to look into the case of my constituent, Douglas Shave, who did his duty by his country. I do not think that he had the full information, which may well have been the reason why he has suffered for 50&nbsp;years from very severe eczema, which has been very painful and has certainly impacted on his quality of life. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bedford, who will make a brief contribution and whom I admire for his campaigning on this issue, will pick up any point that I have not picked up.

<p><a name="st_187"><a name="50110-34_spnew0"><b> Mr. Patrick Hall  (Bedford) (Lab):</b> 
 I thank the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms), as well as the Minister, through his private office, for allowing me a few minutes. Like the hon. Gentleman, I come to this issue through a constituent of mine&#151;Mr. Peter Parker, who joined the RAF under national service and served as an aircraftman between 1951&nbsp;and August 1953. Towards the end of his service, he recalls seeing an official notice seeking volunteers to attend CDEE Porton. His recollection is that both the notice and the advice that he 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 139</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>obtained that related to it was very clear that the process he faced posed no risk to his health and, indeed, that he would be serving his country by participating in a programme of research into curing the common cold.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_449">Mr. Parker was assisted in his decision to volunteer by being offered a 48-hour pass, plus 10&nbsp;shillings. He attended a gas chamber on 4&nbsp;May 1953, and while there, 20&nbsp;mg of the nerve agent sarin was applied to a piece of cloth on this forearm. That gave him a terrible headache for many hours. Thankfully he recovered and got on with the rest of his life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_450">Mr. Parker did not know that a potentially lethal nerve agent had been applied to him; nor could he have known that two days later on 6&nbsp;May 1953, at the same place, aircraftsman Ronald Maddison would die from the same process. He did not know any of that until approximately three years ago when he received a telephone call from Wiltshire police under Operation Antler.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_451">Mr. Parker is one of hundreds of Porton Down veterans, many of whom believe that what they experienced has had a damaging impact on their health. I accept, though, that we must await the outcome of the epidemiological study, which I am very pleased to note the Government are funding, but that is not the only issue. There is another important matter at stake: my constituent believes that he was deceived&#151;that he was not in a position to give informed consent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_452">I believe that my constituent is right to want that issue to be addressed. I believe that he deserves an apology, and possibly compensation. Above all, what Mr. Parker, Mr. Shave and hundreds of other volunteers who passed through Porton Down over three or four decades deserve most is the truth. Given the circumstances, that has to mean an independent judicial and public inquiry. I have written to my hon. Friend the Minister about that. I hope that he recognises the force of the argument. In all decency, after 50&nbsp;years, it is surely time for the truth to out.

<p><a name="st_188"><a name="50110-34_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Ivor Caplin): </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) on securing this debate to discuss the case of his constituent, Mr. Douglas Shave, who participated in the service volunteer programme at Porton Down during the summer of 1950. I join him in welcoming other Members to this debate. There is a huge attendance for a late-night Adjournment debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_453">The House is aware of the concerns of some of the former Porton Down veterans that have recently been widely aired in the media following the conclusion of the inquest into the death of Ronald Maddison. However, we should note that this debate is to raise the personal concerns of Mr. Shave. I intend to deal with the specifics of that case in my response. I hope, however, that the House will also reflect on the written ministerial statement that I made on 21&nbsp;December. That set out the Government&#039;s position in relation to Porton Down and the legal process that is being undertaken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_454">Throughout Porton Down&#039;s history, some 20,000&nbsp;volunteers have participated in the service volunteer programme, with many participating more 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 140</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>than once. I mention that because it sets in context some of the numbers that have recently been reported. The past 30&nbsp;years have seen more than 5,000&nbsp;volunteers helping in the service volunteer programme, and currently between 100&nbsp;and 150&nbsp;volunteers a year are participating. The programme is aimed at ensuring that protective measures issued to our troops to counter the threat posed by chemical and biological weapons are safe and operationally acceptable prior to their introduction into service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_455">As part of the volunteer programme, some volunteers, particularly during the 1950s, were involved in studies to evaluate the effects of very low concentrations of chemical weapons agents such as nerve gases and mustard gas on the ability of unprotected personnel to operate normally. It is important to emphasise that the general purpose of the programme was not hidden. Other volunteers were involved in trials to develop effective clothing and medical counter-measures to protect service personnel, or to assess the ability of personnel to function with new equipment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_456">Not only was the programme essential; I know that the House will agree that it was also crucial that it was carried out in the safety of a controlled environment, with full medical and scientific back-up. I am in no doubt that the knowledge and the technology of the very complex field of chemical and biological defence could not have advanced without the contribution of volunteers participating in the service volunteer programme. I once again reiterate the gratitude that I and my predecessors have expressed towards all those who took part.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_457">I am pleased to say that the vast majority of the service volunteers who participated in the programme are quite unconcerned about their attendance. Indeed, there is no evidence of any pattern of specific long-term ill health in former volunteers. A peer-reviewed paper has been published assessing the health of participants in the programme, as part of the independently run medical assessment programme based at St. Thomas&#039;s hospital. I note that Mr. Shave has been an attendee. The study concluded that there were no unusual patterns of disease or any unusual diseases occurring as a result of exposure to agents at Porton Down. Although I appreciate that that does not ease the suffering of Mr. Shave and others who suffer poor health, experience has shown that there is considerable value in providing reassurance where possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_458">In addition to the medical assessment programme, we are also funding an epidemiological study being conducted under the auspices of the Medical Research Council. The study, which will track mortality and cancer incidences over many years, will conclude in 2006, and I can confirm that the results will then be published.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_459">Given the ongoing level of publicity and media coverage regarding Porton Down volunteers, including the publication of Porton Down&#039;s free helpline number, which was initiated in 1998, I might have expected to receive a large number of inquiries for information. The reality is that that has not happened. Only just over 1,000&nbsp;individuals have approached Porton Down for more information. I believe that Mr. Shave was one of the first to use the system.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Jan 2005 : Column 141</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_460">Of those, like Mr. Shave, who have inquired about their involvement in the programme, some have done so out of curiosity or as a result of publicity, and others because they have health concerns. Whatever the motivation, once an inquiry is received, staff at Porton Down begin the painstaking search of numerous experimental record books for details of the particular inquirer&#039;s participation in the programme. Those details are sometimes complicated and often difficult to interpret, but every effort is made to provide the clearest explanation to the inquirer. A formal written response is sent to the inquirer, together with an invitation to visit Porton Down to view the original record books and discuss any concerns with current members of staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_461">Although I do not believe that Mr. Shave has accepted this invitation, I know that quite a few former volunteers have done so, and indeed some have made several visits. I believe that these visits have been successful, not least because we have been able to give details at the same time of the services offered by the medical assessment programme and potential eligibility for war pensions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_462">One of the accusations, made by the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler), relates to how the trials were conducted. Volunteers for the service volunteer programme were drawn principally from the three services and were recruited through notices posted widely at military establishments. In the 1950s and 1960s, intakes were requested from individual arms of the services at specific times of year. The precise mechanisms for recruiting volunteers were arranged by the services themselves, not by Porton Down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_463">I note that Mr. Shave previously said that he volunteered to participate in studies on the common cold and not nerve agents. However, the chemical and biological defence establishment at Porton Down has never carried out work on the common cold. That research was undertaken at a Medical Research Council unit on the other side of Salisbury. Extensive independent searches by the Wiltshire police during the five years of its Operation Antler investigation have been unable to locate any evidence to indicate that Porton Down scientists involved in the service volunteer programme recruited individuals on the pretext of common cold research.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_464">There have again been calls for a public inquiry. Although I appreciate the concerns of veterans, I am not convinced that a public inquiry is appropriate. It cannot address the central question of whether volunteers have suffered unusual mortality or illness. Only the study to which I have already referred can accomplish that. For this reason, we should await the conclusion of the study.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_465">Mr. Shave is recorded in the experimental record books as attending Porton Down for one week in August 1950&nbsp;when he participated in a single study. That study involved Mr. Shave being exposed to a low concentration of the nerve agent GE, or ethyl sarin. The records detail the acute short-term effects experienced by Mr. Shave from five minutes to five days following exposure. After five days, the records state that he was fit to return to his unit. I understand that he was provided with a comprehensive letter from Porton Down in March 1998&nbsp;detailing the entries in the experimental books. Subsequent to that I believe that he requested, and was provided with, copies of the entries in the experimental books and a further letter clarifying the dose of GE that he was exposed to. He then attended the medical assessment programme in April 2001&nbsp;where he received a thorough and comprehensive medical examination.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_466">I accept that Mr. Shave&#039;s application for a war pension was rejected. That was on the grounds that there was no connection between his skin condition and the trials that he took part in at Porton Down. Mr. Shave appealed against this decision, but I understand that he has not replied to letters from the pensions appeal tribunal. He was therefore informed in writing on 13&nbsp;October that his appeal was struck out. However, the Veterans Agency will consider reinstating his appeal if he contacts it directly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50110-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_467">The Ministry of Defence does not appear to have had any further communication from Mr. Shave raising any specific concerns that he may have. I suggest that if he does wish to discuss any pressing issues he should accept the invitation to visit Porton Down and take the opportunity of an open discussion with Porton Down personnel. Perhaps I can rather cheekily suggest that he may wish to be accompanied by his Member of Parliament.
