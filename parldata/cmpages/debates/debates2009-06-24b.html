 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that answer. NATO&#146;s Secretary-General said that the problem in Afghanistan was not too much Taliban, but too little good governance. Over the next four years, nearly half the Department&#146;s funding to Afghanistan will be channelled through that country&#146;s Government. What steps will the Secretary of State take to ensure that corruption in that country is tackled effectively?</p>

 There are two dimensions to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question. First, he is right to recognise the significance of governance, which is one of the four identified priorities for the approximately &#163;510 million that we will spend between 2009 and 2013. I concur with the view that it is not the strength of the Taliban but the weakness of the Government that poses one of the significant challenges&#151;along with others&#151;that NATO and the Afghan people face in the years ahead.</p>

First, in relation to UK funds, we are working through the Afghan reconstruction trust fund, which is independently audited by recognised accountants from outside the country. We have a degree of confidence in those systems. We are also supporting efforts to strengthen the capacity of the Government, because corruption is a consequence and a cause of the poverty affecting Afghanistan.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s question has a number of aspects. We recognise that there is a powerful connection between the interests of the people of Afghanistan and those of the people of Pakistan. In the statement that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made to the House on 29 April, it was made clear that we are taking a joined-up approach in what is colloquially called the &#147;AfPak&#148; strategy, because there is a strong strategic interest in having a stable and secure state on both sides of the border.

However, I have obtained an internal DFID memo that reveals that the Secretary of State&#146;s predecessor was clearly warned about anticipated problems with the fund before Ministers signed off &#163;20 million for it.

 We are always seeking to ensure that UK taxpayers&#146; money is used effectively and properly, whether through the UNDP or other parts of our aid programme. It is right to recognise that the review that was published identified weaknesses within the UNDP&#146;s approach regarding co-ordination, a focus on short-term rather than long-term priorities, and the need to simplify and strengthen financial rules. It is on that basis that we have acted. The review is not a secret document; it is available on the UNDP&#146;s internet site, and I can assure the hon.

 The Prime Minister has been caught absolutely red-handed. He made a statement to the House about capital expenditure growing every year and the fact is that it is being cut.

 I have explained to the House that money has been brought forward to 2008-09 and 2009-10. Instead of having expenditure of just &#163;30 billion in 2008-09, it is &#163;38 billion. Instead of expenditure of less in 2009-10, it will be &#163;44 billion. We took the decision to advance public expenditure to deal with the recession.

 In the answer before last, the Prime Minister talked about the year 2007-08. In the last answer, he talked about the year 2008-09. Those years have already happened. He said at the Dispatch Box last week that capital expenditure would grow between now and the Olympics. The figures are in the Red Book, on page 226. Capital expenditure will be &#163;44 billion in 2009, falling to &#163;36 billion, then to &#163;29 billion and then, in the year of the Olympics, to &#163;26 billion. There is no other way to cut it. There is nowhere else he can hide. He must stand up, explain that he got it wrong and say that what he told the House last week was wrong.

It compares with the recession years under the Tories, when capital spending was only &#163;12 billion or &#163;16 billion.

It covers all issues that refer to the conflict itself, the causes of the conflict, and the reconstruction after the conflict. The inquiry will be set up on the basis that it will be allowed to have all the evidence and materials, whether classified or not, that it needs to look into the matter.

When giving evidence to the Speaker&#146;s Conference on improving diversity, Mr. Campbell suggested that we get rid of the provision in the Mental Health Act 1983 that Members of Parliament who are sectioned for a mental health problem lose their seat. Will the Prime Minister take steps on that measure and end stigma against people with mental health problems?</p>

Secondly, in statements, I ask the Front Benchers to stick to their allotted times. I also ask that the Back-Bench Members taking part each confine themselves to one, brief supplementary question. In the same vein, I hope that Ministers&#146; replies will be kept to a reasonable length.

 That will be the subject of some of my speech and perhaps some of the Foreign Secretary&#146;s. The issue is not so much that the Government have altered Sir John Chilcot&#146;s powers; it is that they have now placed on him the burden of coming up with the proceedings and rules for the inquiry&#151;including how much of it is to be heard in public. If I continue with my speech for a little, there will be an answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90624-0005.htm_para0"><a name="09062480000220">The Government&#146;s basic defence of their inquiry proposals is that many of us asked for a Franks-style inquiry and that that is what they consider they have produced. In fact, it is necessary to have only the most cursory acquaintance with the Franks inquiry to know that several of its attributes, which were important in making its processes and findings acceptable to Parliament and the public, were completely missing from the Government&#146;s proposals and how they went about them. Meanwhile, the one attribute of the Franks inquiry that almost everyone outside the Government regarded as no longer appropriate&#151;its having been conducted behind closed doors&#151;was the very one that the Government chose to continue with. I shall come to the point about openness or secrecy in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o136"><a name="09062480000221"><a name="90624-0005.htm_spnew1"><a name="09062480001025"><b>Mr. Oliver Heald (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b>
 Does my right hon. Friend agree that another concern is that only recently the Government proposed that inquests could be held privately, without being open to the public gaze? Those proposals were later changed, but suspicions were raised about what the Government were up to.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a related point, although not one immediately relevant to the motion. It was a good point, but I will carry on explaining the comparison with the Franks inquiry. It is possible for the House to understand how and why the Government went wrong on the issue only if it is aware of how the Government went about the consultation in advance of last Monday&#146;s announcement, and how that contrasts with the consultation that followed the Falklands war and preceded the Franks inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90624-0005.htm_para1"><a name="09062480000225">The Franks inquiry was characterised by wide and lengthy consultation by the Government of the time with the Opposition parties. That led to broad agreement on the nature, scope and composition of the inquiry in advance of its announcement. In fact, in the debate on the Franks inquiry, Denis Healey, the then shadow Foreign Secretary, went out of his way to praise Baroness Thatcher, the then Prime Minister&#151;something that we would all admit he has hardly ever done in his life. During that debate on 8 July 1982, Denis Healey said:</p>
<a name="90624-0005.htm_brev0"><a name="09062480000777"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I must pay tribute on behalf of the other parties in the House to the fact that she consulted all of us about the procedures, the terms and the composition of the inquiry.

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90624-0005.htm_para3"><a name="09062480000227">In contrast, on this occasion, the Prime Minister initiated only limited consultation with Opposition parties&#151;and then ignored most of the points that we made. Ministers therefore have no excuse for thinking that what they announced had the agreement of the Opposition. Asked last Tuesday on the BBC &#147;Today&#148; programme whether the Opposition had agreed that the membership of the committee of inquiry was right, the Foreign Secretary replied:</p>
<a name="90624-0005.htm_brev1"><a name="09062480000778"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Yes but my understanding is...I was in Brussels yesterday, but the err...&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90624-0005.htm_para4"><a name="09062480000228">That was the transcript, but he did say yes. I hope that he will acknowledge today that in claiming that the Opposition had agreed the membership of the inquiry, he was not making an accurate statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90624-0005.htm_para5"><a name="09062480000229">Let me be clear about this. On the Friday afternoon, the Conservative party was given the inquiry proposals to be made on the Monday. That gave no time for any face-to-face meetings between Opposition leaders and Ministers, or even among ourselves. Nevertheless, we made several criticisms of the inquiry proposals. Only one of them was taken fully on board by the Government. They had intended that the inquiry should be able to look back no further than late 2002, but they accepted our suggestion that the date should be put back to 2001, bringing in the period following the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90624-0005.htm_para6"><a name="09062480000230">However, we also argued, as I believe did others, that the inquiry sessions should be much more open, and indeed open whenever possible&#151;the exact formulation that the Prime Minister chose to ignore but has belatedly been constrained to accept. We also called for an interim report from the inquiry in early 2010, given the unnecessary delay in its establishment and the Government&#146;s transparent intention to delay the publication of findings until after the last possible date for a general election&#151;a manoeuvre that itself reduces public confidence in the inquiry process. An interim or earlier report would help to remedy that. That point, too, was ignored by the Government.</p>

 Although I believe that the openness of the inquiry has already been acceded to, the important point is the one that the Public Administration Committee has raised. That is the suggestion of having a two-tier inquiry, one to deal with the general issue for a long period and one to concentrate, in a short report produced in perhaps a matter of six months, on Britain&#146;s involvement. The key issue is the torment of the families of the fallen&#151;did their loved ones die in vain? Was Britain deceived in going into the war? That can be reported on very rapidly.</p>

 I do stand by my vote and my speech on that occasion. No doubt when the inquiry reports, we will all have time to reflect on who was right and who was wrong. That is one of the reasons for having an inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="90624-0005.htm_para8"><a name="09062480000236">I was running through the points that the Opposition made over the weekend of consultation before the announcement. We said that the membership of the inquiry, while encompassing people whom we had no call to criticise, seemed to us too narrow. We said in particular that some experience of ministerial office was desirable. The following Monday, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition also made the point that military experience was desirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="90624-0005.htm_para9"><a name="09062480000237">We further pointed out that the inquiry, as proposed by the Government, would consist of four nominees, none of whom was a woman. The Government went a small way to meeting part of the objection by adding Baroness Prashar to the inquiry membership. I hope that the Foreign Secretary will acknowledge that his statement on the &#147;Today&#148; programme that the five people were approached before the Cabinet Secretary went to talk to the Opposition parties was inaccurate. The fifth, Baroness Prashar, was added only when it was pointed out to Ministers that they had proposed an inquiry too narrow in its membership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="90624-0005.htm_para10"><a name="09062480000238">In many ways, I am sorry to make these points to the Foreign Secretary, because he is normally perfectly good at consultation with the Opposition. Clearly he was misinformed and not properly briefed on what was happening by a Downing street that does not share his willingness to consult on and agree matters with the Opposition. Let us hope that that emboldens him when he comes to his next opportunity to depose the Prime Minister, which normally recurs about every 12 weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="90624-0005.htm_para11"><a name="09062480000239">The upshot was that the consultation with the Opposition was inadequate and unnecessarily short. Nor did the Prime Minister even bother to consult the armed forces about how an inquiry into this country&#146;s largest military endeavour since world war two should be conducted. The Chief of the General Staff, Sir Richard Dannatt, stated last week that he was not privy to the discussions about how the inquiry would be conducted.</p>

Although we absolutely agree that learning lessons for the future is the primary purpose of the inquiry, a positive prohibition on its apportioning blame seems to us an unnatural and unnecessary restriction on any normal discussion of what happened in the past.

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="90624-0006.htm_para25"><a name="09062480000307">Those are the words of the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks in March 2008, and I agree with him on how the inquiry should be conducted. It will have complete freedom to write its own report. The Government&#146;s case today is simple: Sir John Chilcot&#146;s inquiry and his proposed method of conducting it will meet all reasonable aspirations for an Iraq inquiry. The combination of his remit and his membership, plus expert advisers, and his commitment to public sessions for as much of the proceedings as possible will deliver to the country an inquiry of insight and value. Yes, the Government have listened. There is a balance to be struck between speed and confidentiality on the one hand and comprehensiveness and transparency on the other. The balance now proposed by Sir John Chilcot is new, but the Government believe that it will be effective and that it deserves strong support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90624-0006.htm_para26"><a name="09062480000308">The right hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that there have been four previous debates on an Iraq inquiry. There have been four demands from the official Opposition in each case, and they will be at the heart of my remarks today, in addition to my answers to the points that he has just made. The first demand was that the inquiry should be comprehensive. The hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), who is here today, said in the most recent debate on the matter, on 25 March, that the inquiry should have</p>
<a name="90624-0006.htm_brev14"><a name="09062480000799"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the fullest remit, including the run-up to the war, the conduct of the war and the preparation for, and conduct of, the post-conflict period&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 25 March 2009; Vol. 489, c. 362.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90624-0006.htm_para27"><a name="09062480000309">The second demand was that the inquiry be independent. Each of the three motions on the subject moved by the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks&#151;in June 2007, March 2008 and March 2009&#151;has referred to the need for an inquiry by an independent committee of Privy Counsellors. The third demand was that the inquiry draw on expertise from outside the world of politics. The right hon. Gentleman said in 2006:</p>
<a name="90624-0006.htm_brev15"><a name="09062480000800"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A committee of seven Members of Parliament would necessarily be a partisan committee and the credibility of its findings would be correspondingly reduced.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 31 October 2006; Vol. 451, c. 182.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="90624-0006.htm_para28"><a name="09062480000310">The fourth demand was for a Franks-style inquiry. In motions, amendments, and speeches, the right hon. Gentleman has insisted that the inquiry be modelled on the 1982 Franks inquiry. The truth is that all four points are reasonable and serious and all deserve proper consideration. All draw on precedent as well as on common sense and all will be addressed in my speech today.</p>

 I will return to the point about the public sessions. First, I want to deal with the scope of the inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90624-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09062480000328">The concern has been to ensure that the inquiry is able to address itself to all aspects of preparation for the military campaign, the military campaign itself, and post-conflict stabilisation and reconstruction. That is important. At various points, there have been allegations, for example, that the inquiry would not be able to look at the run-up to the war, or the decisions taken in Basra in 2006 to 2008. Those concerns are not well founded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90624-0007.htm_para2"><a name="09062480000329">The Chilcot inquiry has the widest possible remit. The committee will be free not just to examine all the evidence, as I will set out, but to pursue what it considers are the most important issues. The scope is deliberately not limited. As the Prime Minister said last week:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="90624-0007.htm_para3"><a name="09062480000330">Secondly, on the question of independence, the Prime Minister wrote to Sir John Chilcot on 17 June assuring him of the Government&#146;s commitment to a thorough and independent inquiry.

The Cabinet Secretary has written similarly to Departments. Access to papers in official archives will be similarly unrestricted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="90624-0007.htm_para5"><a name="09062480000334">In the previous debate in the House, I was asked whether the committee&#146;s access to documents would include all Cabinet papers. I confirm that that will be the case. We have also been asked whether that includes access to papers from foreign Governments held by the Government here. Again, I confirm what the Prime Minister has said: that will indeed be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="90624-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09062480000335">On ensuring that witnesses give evidence with the greatest possible candour, Sir John has confirmed that he and his colleagues will consider whether it is possible to have a process whereby evidence is given under oath, taking into account the non-judicial nature of the inquiry.

 I thank my right hon. Friend for giving way. Who did the Prime Minister consult about the composition of the inquiry, whether it would meet in public and its modus operandi&#151;for example, in hearing evidence under oath?

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="90624-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09062480000345">My question is simple: does it require an inquiry to understand the fundamental flaw and the frustration that the military finds, which was echoed by General Robin Brims, who was the commander of 1 (UK) Armoured Division and in charge of the forces in Basra? He said that we went into Iraq and, a month later, it was clear that the looting would start, the gangs would form and the militias would be created because there was no plan for peace. Will the Secretary of State now acknowledge that we need a huge overhaul and an examination of the relationship between the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development? The world of warfare has changed from cold war to stabilisation operations. That is the fundamental frustration with our military, which is getting blamed for what happened in Iraq because the war fighting went well, but the peacekeeping was an absolute failure.</p>

 In the first debate on Iraq in which I participated after becoming Foreign Secretary, I talked about the precise fact that the success had been in winning the war, but not in winning the peace. I also talked about the fact that there were plans, as we now know, for how the process of peace building would be taken forward, but if those were not binned, they were certainly sidelined in the US Administration. All those issues, which are precisely about stabilisation and reconstruction, will be at the heart of the inquiry.</p>

 The Foreign Secretary mentioned a moment ago the fact that Sir John Chilcot has been told to see whether there are ways in which he can produce evidence under oath. Mine is a genuine inquiry: can the Foreign Secretary tell me under what authority or power Sir John could do that, other than under a statutory inquiry procedure, or, indeed, by being given a power to do so by legislation passed by the House?</p>

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman knows well that the Inquiries Act 2005 sets out what is effectively a quasi-judicial procedure that may be appropriate for an inquiry that is set out to mediate between competing interests, but that is not what this inquiry is about. That Act also assumes legal representation for all parties concerned and restrictions on who may be questioned. For those reasons, among others, we chose the inquiry.</p>

He spoke of military insight, but the more he described the work of the committee members, the more evident it became that they possessed a large amount of relevant expertise. Sir Lawrence Freedman is the official historian of the Falklands campaign, Sir Martin Gilbert has written extensively on military matters, Sir Roderic Lyne was private secretary for defence and foreign affairs, and Sir John Chilcot was permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office.

the conduct of the inquiry to ensure that those who appear before it do so with the greatest possible candour and openness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="90624-0007.htm_para17"><a name="09062480000372">There are trade-offs on the public nature of the inquiry in the context of intelligence and other matters mentioned by the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks. He referred to the Franks report and the starring role of Denis Healey in the 1982 debate. He will also remember that Lord Callaghan described the Franks inquiry as a whitewash. Private inquiries are sometimes described as a whitewash, but other people have described the Hutton inquiry, which was held in public, as a whitewash. The truth is that if people have decided in advance what they are going to conclude, they will describe either a public or a private inquiry as a whitewash.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="90624-0007.htm_para18"><a name="09062480000373">I think that Sir John Chilcot has anticipated precisely the points that were raised by my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt). Let me go through them. Sir John has set out four main parts of the inquiry, combining public and private aspects. First, there is examination and analysis of documentary evidence, which will be crucial to decisions on the course of the inquiry, including decisions on the selection of witnesses and detailed lines of questioning. It will, by definition, occur in private. Secondly, there is the question of public proceedings. Sir John Chilcot has said that it will be essential to hold as much as possible of the proceedings in public, consistent with national security and the candour of written and oral evidence. The Prime Minister and Sir John Chilcot have had close to the front of their minds the strong and legitimate interest especially of families of those who lost their lives in Iraq, and Sir John has made clear his determination to facilitate the public or private presentation of views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90624-0007.htm_para19"><a name="09062480000374">Thirdly, there is the question of private proceedings, which will be important in allowing examination of matters relating to national security. Classified information will be protected and witnesses will be able to speak without fear of legal action. Intelligence questions obviously fit into that category. It is also important to protect the position and relationships of current public servants, while ensuring that the committee is given the full benefit of their expertise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="90624-0007.htm_para20"><a name="09062480000375">Fourthly, and much unheralded, as Sir John has pointed out, there is the publication and debating of the final report. The Prime Minister made clear last week that all relevant evidence should be published, except when national security or similar considerations prevent it. Sir John has confirmed his determination to follow that pattern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90624-0007.htm_para21"><a name="09062480000376">The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks asked whether the Government supported those points. I confirm what the Prime Minister said in his reply to Sir John Chilcot the day before yesterday. The answer is yes, we do support the approach that Sir John has set out, and, as I said at the beginning of my speech, we have listened to the points that have been made.</p>

 I do not think that my hon.

There will be the sifting of evidence that I have described, but when it comes to the hearings and evidence sessions, as Sir John Chilcot made clear in his letter to the Prime Minister earlier this week, as much as possible will be held in public. I am not going to put a percentage on it, but Sir John&#146;s intention is plain.

My hon. Friend has been in the House longer than I have, and I certainly would not seek to prevent him from articulating his views further at any stage in the future, but I would interpret his support for the amendment as an indication that he believes, as I do, that for all the comings and goings of the past 10 days, the Chilcot approach now meets all reasonable aspirations for a comprehensive, independent, thorough inquiry into the Iraq conflict and its aftermath.</p>

In the light of the Prime Minister&#146;s subsequent letter of 17 June, Sir John Chilcot considered the best way of conducting the inquiry.</p>

We have been agreed that it should be broad ranging and independent and draw on non-political expertise. That is the model that we have proposed. We also now have a widely respected chairman setting out the foundation of his approach and the balance between public and private hearings, with as much as possible in public. The result is an inquiry that can fulfil the mandate given to it of learning lessons that strengthen our diplomacy, our military and our democracy.</p>

Sham outrage, and never mind bandwagonism, are good reasons to vote down the Opposition motion. An even better reason is that the Government amendment offers the country an inquiry that meets the needs of the country, and I commend it to the House.</p>

I and my party have repeatedly and regularly argued for an open, independent and thorough inquiry. What we want is not a closed, Franks-style inquiry, nor an inquiry designed to protect the former Prime Minister&#151;or, indeed, anybody else&#151;but one that is capable of arriving at the facts and displaying them openly. Every time we have argued for that&#151;which has been over many years now&#151;we have been met with a degree of prevarication from the Government; there has always been one reason after another why the time was not right to have this inquiry. Possibly the most disingenuous was that, in the very latter stages of British troop involvement in Iraq, it would somehow cause a massive diversion of military attention if we were to hold an inquiry in this country into the causes and conduct of the conflict in Iraq. It was argued that that would distract the military authorities from their role in Iraq. However, at the same time, we were massively increasing our involvement in Afghanistan. That, apparently, was not any sort of distraction at all.</p>

It is quite clear that conduct before the war is quite different from the conduct of the war, which is quite different from the peacebuilding operation. It is perfectly proper for the inquiry to consider those matters separately and in turn and to produce interim reports. I see absolutely no reason why, in the first instance, it should not consider the matters that preceded the involvement of the United Kingdom in this conflict and report on that. It does not need to take a huge amount of time from now for that to happen. I strongly commend to the inquiry that it phases its work in such a way. If we can assist by giving an indication from this House that that would be our preference, I think that we should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para7"><a name="09062480000449">The Iraq war was, in the view of many of us, a quite massive failure of British foreign policy that was aided and abetted by those on both sides of the House who were not prepared, perhaps, to consider the evidence with sufficient assiduity. It is essential that we form a view, that we learn from experience and that we provide the truth, as far as we can, by means of this inquiry. That will help all those who have enormous concern about the conduct of the war&#151;they expressed it at the time and have expressed it since&#151;all those who have been involved through the military and who have seen at first hand the difficulties, and all those who wanted the rebuilding of Iraq to take place with greater coherence of strategy and policy than was the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para8"><a name="09062480000450">Until we have a proper open, transparent, rigorous public inquiry into these matters, those lessons will not be learned. That is why I will recommend that my right hon. and hon. Friends support the motion tabled in the name of the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks. I hope that the House will speak clearly on this matter,  <br>

 Following that injunction, I think that we should all try not to revisit the substantive arguments about the Iraq war, on which we all took vigorous and divergent positions. For myself, I anticipated that I would support the Iraq war. I was a great admirer of the former Prime Minister&#151;as, indeed, I am a great admirer of the current Prime Minister, and as I will be of any future Prime Minister from the Labour Benches&#151;but I was also taken with the courage of his devotion to the cause of liberal interventionism and of trying to do good against evil in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para9"><a name="09062480000454">I was therefore in the market for military adventure, but the problem was that I could not follow the logic of the argument. I am sure that many others shared that problem. When we talk about the inquiry, the central and abiding questions that it has to engage with are as follows: how did we get from 9/11 to March 2003? How did we get from the twin towers to the invasion of Iraq? What was the policy narrative that took us from one to the other?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09062480000455">Everyone has constructed their own narratives about these events, some of which will remain forever unverified. For example, I think that we shall never know about the legality of what was done. The nature of international law is such that we shall never come to a settled view on that. We can discover more about the process by which the Government took legal advice and so on, but I do not think that we will ever settle central questions of that kind. However, I do think that what we will be able to discover will enable us to understand far better the policy process that took us from 9/11 to the Iraq war. Further questions involve what happened after the invasion, and why we had so much trouble managing the peace in the years that followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para11"><a name="09062480000456">The inquiry needs to tell us all that because, as has been said, public confidence in our governing process has no chance of being restored unless we can find a narrative that people can test. They need to feel that the process has at least been properly interrogated and examined, and an inquiry is absolutely essential for that purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para12"><a name="09062480000457">One of the difficulties with what the Government announced was that they seemed not to understand that that would be a central purpose of the inquiry. It is, of course, absolutely pivotal that we learn all the lessons, and the Government were right in the way that they established the scope of the inquiry and its extensive period. However, to think that the inquiry would be just about learning lessons&#151;important though that is&#151;is to fail to understand what its several purposes have to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para13"><a name="09062480000458">Inquiries always have several purposes, but a major purpose of this inquiry must be the one that I am describing&#151;to get inside the policy process so that we can begin to answer the questions that still hang in the air and so contaminate people&#146;s trust in that process. Without wanting to insert my own narrative into the events, I believe that an inquiry therefore has to be a huge process of decontamination, as it were, of the decline in trust occasioned by what happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para14"><a name="09062480000459">As I said in an earlier intervention, we are in much better place now than we were just a few days ago.

I think that I have known him well enough and long enough to know when his heart and mind are fully engaged in what he is saying. I think that he had to say what he said but, if I may say so, I do not think that he quite believed it.</p>

I do not say that with any pleasure, but it is simply the fact of the matter. The terms of the Opposition motion are entirely right, and the only thing that would constrain me from voting for it is the certain shamelessness on their part in putting it forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para16"><a name="09062480000461">With his usual ingenuity, the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) sought to explain what his party really wanted when it called repeatedly for a Franks-style inquiry.

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para19"><a name="09062480000466">Should the inquiry be public or private? Anyone who has thought about that for a moment will understand that, 30-odd years after Franks, it is not possible to announce that an inquiry of this kind on a central public policy issue could be conducted entirely in private. We have only to sniff the air to know that that is not doable any more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para20"><a name="09062480000467">It is right to say that, after Hutton, some people will damn all inquiries even before they start. Yet the Hutton inquiry operated in public and had its own website: all the material was posted there for people to interrogate for themselves, and the sky did not fall in. Government did not become impossible, and in the present circumstances it was just not sustainable&#151;and nor should it be&#151;to announce an inquiry into the Iraq war and say that it would be held entirely in private.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para21"><a name="09062480000468">The composition of the inquiry is well worth attending to, as several hon. Members have noted. What is the best balance of expertise that will be required? How will the inquiry be conducted? There is much merit in thinking about segmenting the inquiry. The huge, dominant issue has to do with the run-up to the war and the decision to go to war, but a second issue is what happened with the preparation for after the war. What was the cause of all the trouble then?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para22"><a name="09062480000469">I can see that it would be possible to conduct the first part of such an inquiry in a much shorter time than the whole thing would need. It may well be that Sir John Chilcot will think that a sensible way to proceed, but he certainly could have been pointed in that direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para23"><a name="09062480000470">I want to repeat, very quickly, the point that I made in my intervention on the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), as the House needs to understand why it has been marginalised in these matters. I set out the position under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 because it inserted Parliament, albeit in a formal sense, in the centre of the process involved in setting up an inquiry. That process gave an inquiry all the powers of a High Court judge. All the procedural rules were in place, and the inquiry had all the authority of Parliament behind it. That was converted into a parliamentary resolution, with terms of reference. What we have done is to allow the Executive to remove Parliament&#146;s residual role from the process of setting up an inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para24"><a name="09062480000471">When our Select Committee looked at this, we were particularly concerned about circumstances where Governments did not want to set up an inquiry, but having one was in the public interest. In those circumstances, how could Parliament itself initiate the process of having an inquiry? For a time, that was the issue with Iraq. It looked as though the Government were less than keen about having an Iraq inquiry, and Parliament did not have any mechanism to bring one about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90624-0009.htm_para25"><a name="09062480000472">Now we have had the announcement on the Iraq inquiry, but Parliament has not been involved in the process of thinking about some of the issues&#151;about purpose, terms of reference, composition and so forth. That would have been the normal procedure until the previous position was abolished. I thus invite the House of Commons as part of its general project at the moment of reclaiming&#151;</p>

 I am grateful to be called, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I shall be brief, as many of the points I wished to raise have already been made, as is the nature of such debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90624-0010.htm_para0"><a name="09062480000475">It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright). I listened to him with great care, but he was wrong on one point, when he said that he had not heard that we had been calling for sometime for a judicial inquiry. In fact, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) moved a motion on 4 June 2003, calling for such an inquiry, and I supported him on it. I moved a motion on 16 July 2003 and again on 23 October 2003, each of which called for a judicial inquiry where the proper rules of evidence could be applied. It was on that latter occasion when the then Foreign Secretary said, &#147;No, we cannot have one; it will take too long, and it will go over the election so the people will not be able to make a judgment&#148;. We also had a running motion on the Order Paper on every sitting day between July and October. We made our position quite clear&#151;we wanted an open and comprehensive inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90624-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09062480000476">If I may say so from the outset, I am a great respecter and admirer of Sir John Chilcot, who was permanent secretary in the Northern Ireland Office when I served there. I think he has tremendous ability, but we must not ask him to do the impossible. In some ways, by leaving the remit as vague and open as it is now, we are in danger of doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90624-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09062480000477">I want to see an inquiry that, after six years and despite those earlier calls, will finally bring closure to the issue of Iraq. We started to call for an inquiry so early not just because of the fog of war, but because of the fog of the nature of the evidence, which meant that there were disputes, disagreements and controversies about the actual truth. Although I and my party&#151;or most of it&#151;voted for the war, I felt that it was essential for the British people to understand what had happened. One way or the other&#151;whether I was right or those who argued against me were right&#151;the British people had a right to know. That is why it is so important that, on this occasion, we get this inquiry right. If we end up with another inquiry that leaves disagreements, doubts, confusion and upset, we will not have served the British people as I believe that we should.</p>

 Flight-Lieutenant Stead was killed in the Iraq war when his Hercules did not have the proper suppressant foam. His parents, who live in my constituency, wrote to me to say:</p>

hope that it is not left to the witnesses to decide what counts as a matter of national security, but that the committee itself makes that decision. I hope that the committee will apportion blame and I am delighted that the Foreign Secretary has agreed that it should be allowed to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90624-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09062480000481">Above all, however, I hope that the inquiry will be able to take evidence that will answer the key questions. There are so many that I cannot rehearse them all, but what was the extent and nature of the intelligence and the advice given to Ministers on which judgments were made before and the during the war? Was the equipment given to our troops during the war&#151;this applies to the question asked of me by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)&#151;sufficient for purpose? Were we doing what we needed to do for our troops or not? Was there ever a reconstruction plan for after the war&#151;one of the great disputed questions? In America, it is said that there was no plan; it was junked. When I asked the then Foreign Secretary about that before the war, he said that there was a reconstruction plan. If there was such a plan, why were we never told about it after the war? If there was no reconstruction plan, why were we assured before the war that there was such a plan?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90624-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09062480000482">That is why the matter of evidence on oath is so important. We have already had a number of inquiries, but they have not settled those disputes, questions and uncertainties. None of those inquiries was conducted under oath. Even the Hutton inquiry, which had all the appearance of being a legal inquiry, did not have the power to take evidence under oath. The reason for taking evidence under oath is that if we are to satisfy people that they are hearing the truth, they must know that they are hearing, in terms of the oath, not just the truth, but the whole truth and nothing but the truth. If they do not hear it and if it can be shown that they have not heard it, there is a legal sanction that can be taken against the person who has misled the committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90624-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09062480000483">If we are not to go down the road of a judicial inquiry, I say to the Foreign Secretary that we need to look very closely at the powers this House needs to give the inquiry that is set up. In my view, we need a short piece of legislation to allow this inquiry to summon witnesses and to apply the oath to them on the understanding that if anyone misleads the inquiry, the full sanctions of the law of perjury can be applied. We must make sure that on this occasion, the inquiry brings this matter to closure. If it does not, we will have missed an enormous opportunity and after so many people have waited for so long for this inquiry, I think they will feel incredibly betrayed.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary rightly referred to the fatalities of the war, including the hundreds and thousands of Iraqis who have died. We are now debating the British intervention in the war.

That figure rises to 4,318 if we include civilians, and to a total of fatalities among the coalition as a whole of 4,632.

Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) that although I recognise the scale of the civil war in Iraq between the Sunni and Shi&#146;a and that issues of terrorism are relevant, the suggestion that those who still believe that it was right to oppose the war are in any way less opposed to terrorism than others is not at all helpful. My hon. Friend should understand that.</p>

 If I gave the impression that there are hon. Members who do not condemn terrorism, I am sorry and I apologise, but time and time again, those who opposed the war mention the hundreds of thousands who undoubtedly died, but do not give sufficient emphasis to the fact that those are due to terrorist action, certainly not to the killings carried out by the occupation forces.</p>

 Many of those who cautioned against the war said that there was a grave danger of the outbreak of chaotic violence. I think that passing off responsibility for bringing that about&#151;and all the deaths that flowed from it&#151;by saying that it is all due to terrorism is not good enough.</p>

Let us not have any doubt about the scale of the opposition to this intervention among the military. There is no question about that.

The Opposition propose that the remit of the inquiry be broadened so that it goes back to 2001, and we welcome that, but I hope that there is not the slightest suggestion that the intervention in Iraq had some logistical follow-on from 9/11. The al-Qaeda presence was virtually non-existent. I say that as someone who had the privilege of serving on the Intelligence and Security Committee when the previous Prime Minister, Tony Blair, asked it to look into that issue, so I will not make too much of it. We know what happened: the US and the whole of the west looked strong after 9/11. It is a hard thing to say, but there was a sort of glow and invading Iraq destroyed all that. It was a huge boost to al-Qaeda and other forces.</p>

I have no doubt that Baroness Prashar will be a diligent member of the committee, but who does she represent? She is the parliamentarian. Were the official Opposition consulted about the parliamentarian on the inquiry? Was there a deal only in terms of the sex of the person who would represent the British Parliament? Baroness Prashar will certainly not represent the House of Commons, so that issue is of interest. What is the position of parliamentarians in relation to the inquiry?</p>

 I asked the question in the context not just of our being Members of the House of Commons but of our role when people go before the inquiry.

The concession has been agreed; the committee will meet in public and in private. It must always be accepted that in an inquiry of this nature not all the evidence and intelligence material will be put in the public domain. It is only sensible to recognise that. All the briefing and material provided in the run-up to the decision to commit British forces to the invasion was secret. Some more of that material may be made available, but no one can seriously expect that it will all come out.</p>

That will not help anyone. I am sure that there are people who are still as absolutely committed in their support for the invasion and the occupation, just as there are those equally committed the other way. The process is not about political point scoring. We need a report about which we can say, &#147;Yes, they really went into this thoroughly and made it as available as possible to Parliament and the British people. They made a judgment on the lessons for Parliament, which supported the Government who committed us to go to Iraq.&#148;</p>

 The hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) put his finger on it when he said that 30 years after Franks it was inconceivable that anyone should have thought that such an inquiry could be held in private. He knew that, I knew that and the whole House knew that, so it prompts the question why the Prime Minister was of a different mind. Given that he had months to determine the announcement he would make, why did he ever conceive that the inquiry would be acceptable if it was heard in private?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="90624-0010.htm_para19"><a name="09062480000504">Who did the Prime Minister consult beforehand? We know it was not the armed forces&#151;they have made that clear. We know they wanted to give their evidence in public. I do not say this in a partisan way, because ultimately the Prime Minister is a rational person, but one has to conclude that there was only one rational explanation for his hoping to get away with it, and the House must forgive me for saying it: we will be having a general election within the next 11 months. If it was possible for the evidence to be heard in private, the media would have no way of maintaining interest over that period. There would be interest only when the inquiry eventually reported, with the election having gone one way or the other. Now that the inquiry is to be in public, there will be constant opportunities, as witnesses come forward, to report anything of newsworthy interest. As there is no other rational explanation, I can only assume that that is what the Prime Minister had in mind.</p>

We were told that the armed forces would not wish to give their evidence in public, yet a series of generals, air marshals and admirals made it clear that that was not remotely their view.</p>

I have to declare that I do not have an interest. Although I have a legal background, I have not practised as a lawyer since 1978, and if I needed a lawyer, I would not instruct me.

the only basis on which anyone would wish to be accompanied by a lawyer. When I gave evidence to the Scott inquiry on so-called arms to Iraq, I did not find it necessary to be represented by a lawyer. The idea that lawyers are necessary if there is a public inquiry is not remotely correct.</p>

Even in retreat, however, the Prime Minister was very foolish. He started by allowing his spokesman to say that the issue was not theological. He then said that the matter was for the chairman of the committee to decide, but that was not the case. The fundamental question of whether an inquiry should be public or private is for the Government to recommend to the House so that a decision may be reached accordingly, with the chairman of the committee no doubt accepting that view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="90624-0010.htm_para23"><a name="09062480000508">We then saw the somewhat sad statement in a letter to Sir John Chilcot, when the Prime Minister was beginning to move ground, that it would perhaps be appropriate for the bereaved to give their evidence in public, if they wished. Perhaps they will but, as we all know, whether the bereaved give their evidence in public is the least important issue. The crucial consideration is whether those who sent the relatives of the bereaved to fight in the war give their evidence in public.</p>

Baroness Prashar&#146;s biographical details&#151;chairman of the Judicial Appointment Commission, chairman of the Parole Board for England and Wales and director of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations&#151;are no doubt those of an impressive person, but they are not remotely comparable to those of a former Chief of the General Staff or First Sea Lord, or a person with military skills.</p>

I welcome the fact that the Foreign Secretary set out today, at the Dispatch Box, that that is no longer the Government&#146;s position. The Government know that they could not sustain such an intolerable position. A lot of reference has been made to the Franks committee, but that was not so constrained, because it was for the committee to decide whether to criticise the Government. It concluded that it should not, but that was its decision, not one that had been imposed on it. It is highly desirable that such a situation should apply now. I cannot recall the number of occasions on which Tony Blair said, &#147;I accept full responsibility for the war&#148;, which implied a major concession, but then went on to defend everything that he had done. Let us see whether he was entitled to do that. If the committee takes the view that he was not, it would be improper to prevent it from expressing that judgment.</p>

The inquiry will have to look at that context, so it is wrong that there is an arbitrary date of 2001. I questioned the Prime Minister about that when he gave his statement.

It was alleged that 500,000 children died as a result of those sanctions. The context was a policy of containment. There has to be an assessment of why, when action was taken in 2003, there was support for it in some quarters but opposition in others, including opposition from people who had been quite happy to support the bombing of Iraq without a Security Council resolution in 1998, yet who, in 2003, suddenly found that to be a resigning matter.

That is the importance of the inquiry. It is time&#151;we should have done it earlier&#151;to clear the way on that, to get at least some closure for all of us, and to start rebuilding politics.

have seen those statements unwind in front of our eyes. That is an important factor, because the issue is not just about the inquiry. We have a crisis in this Chamber. We have so given away the idea that we Back Benchers, rather than the Front Benchers, should control what is done that we have handed everything over to the Executive, whatever party is in power. I think that we are beyond the point where we can play party politics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="90624-0011.htm_para17"><a name="09062480000533">The fact is that we should have sat down and considered the matter properly, and we should have come to the conclusion that in this day and age, it is not feasible, as the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) said, for us to hide anything away from the public. If we have learned anything at all in the past three to four weeks, we have learned that, now, anything other than openness simply will not wash. The days of deference and respect, and the belief that politicians behind closed doors will always come to the right decision, will no longer wash with the British people. The only way for us to clear the air is to have the inquiry fully in public. The default mechanism of the inquiry should be, &#147;Everything in public, unless,&#148; and the &#147;unless&#148; needs to be reasoned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90624-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09062480000534">I am concerned that we are leaving it to somebody who is not elected to make a decision about what the inquiry will do, which is fundamentally wrong. Have we in this House so lost a sense of ourselves that we do not want to put an elected Member of Parliament on a committee of inquiry into a war that we voted for in this Chamber, and for which all of us, myself included, have to answer? Why do we not have a politician, or two politicians, on the inquiry? Why are we so ashamed that we give way to a baroness? Whatever her credentials&#151;my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea mentioned them&#151;she is not elected. We are elected. We are the ones who have to be accountable to our electorate. Why are we not on the committee? We have nothing to be ashamed of. We should be on the committee because it would give it a cutting edge. I hope that the Government will think again about that. It would be an opportunity to rebuild respect in Parliament if somebody from this place went on that committee and made a statement about the passion that Parliament feels on the issue. That is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90624-0011.htm_para19"><a name="09062480000535">Beyond that, I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend and other learned Members who have said that the composition of the committee is simply not good enough. Three issues need to be looked at by the committee. The first is the reasons for the war. The hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes), the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, wants to take the inquiry much further back in time, and there is an argument for that, but I have to say that the number of people whom he wanted to be called might mean that it went on for another 15 years, and I do not think that we want to go down that road. That is a little caveat. The political reasons for the war are critical and need to be looked at. That is why we need politicians on the committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="90624-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09062480000536">The second issue that needs to be considered is the military, its equipment, and whether there were sufficient resources for the task. Without a member of the military, or even someone who was recently in the military, it will be impossible to reach a proper conclusion. Witnesses are not good enough; we need some interpretation on that committee. That is why a military person or ex-military person should be on it.</p>

On that issue, we should perhaps draw on people from the Department for International Development and others who were involved. I remember that when I was Leader of the Opposition, we had a debate or two about the plans for the aftermath. The composition of the committee is not good enough. We need to reinforce it from the House and from the military.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90624-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09062480000538">My second point is about the oath. We need to take back the power to set up an inquiry that has the power to take evidence under oath. I would be happy to give such evidence&#151;everybody should be. The public now believe that unless something is said under oath, it is not necessarily to be trusted. We must do everything we can to make sure that the inquiry&#146;s findings are demonstrably evidence that can be trusted, otherwise there will be more cries that it has not worked.</p>

Without that, we will not have credibility. The issue is as much us and our weakness in this place as it is the inquiry. It demonstrates to us more than ever before that we need to draw back powers to the Chamber, the House and the Back Benches so that once again we stand as the elected representatives of the British people, so that their anger, fear, vexation and concerns can be represented in the Chamber. The terms of an inquiry should not be dictated by an Executive who may have political motives for deciding that it should or should not take place in certain circumstances. I hope the Government will rethink the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90624-0011.htm_para24"><a name="09062480000540">Ultimately, we must allow the British people to decide whether the war in Iraq was worth while, whether it should have been undertaken, and whether that was done for the correct reasons. If they can reach a good conclusion on that, respect for politicians will rise and we will have reached a point where we can close the issue and move on. Like justice, politics cannot just be done.

perplexed the House as to what has happened since the war, but the central issue for those who were here and voted or did not vote for the war and took that awesome responsibility is whether the House at the time was deliberately misled into an illegal war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90624-0011.htm_para27"><a name="09062480000544">In that essential question two things stand out above all and must be discerned. The first centres on the so-called Downing street memorandum in July 2002, many months before the war began. It is a clear minute, and it shows that our man&#151;Q&#151;who was at the time in Washington, Richard Dearlove, reported to the then Prime Minister in these terms:</p>
<a name="90624-0011.htm_brev6"><a name="09062480000817"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Bush wanted to remove Saddam through military action justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90624-0011.htm_para28"><a name="09062480000545">That was the clearest possible statement, which was echoed in the House almost exactly word for word, although he did not know of the minute, by Robin Cook at the time that he made his resignation speech&#151;that what was happening was that the facts were being fixed around policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90624-0011.htm_para29"><a name="09062480000546">That is the first thing that requires the Prime Minister of the day to go before the committee on oath and without immunity in order to be cross-examined about that, because he came to the House almost immediately afterwards and not a word of that reached the ears of those who were listening to him and were deciding on the issue of war. It is not the only internal memorandum, but it needs to be answered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90624-0011.htm_para30"><a name="09062480000547">The second matter is the legal advice that was given to Cabinet, to the House and to the House of Lords. On 7 March, the Attorney-General produced an opinion that has now, like drawing teeth, been made public. That opinion was hedged with doubt throughout on whether the war was legal. Any lawyer reading it would read both between and on the lines that the Attorney-General had the gravest possible reservations about the legality of war without a United Nations resolution. Seven days later a completely different opinion was given to Cabinet and subsequently was given in the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90624-0011.htm_para31"><a name="09062480000548">If the first opinion had been made public at the time, it is highly unlikely, in my view&#151;we have one distinguished member of that Cabinet in the Chamber, and she will be able to tell us herself&#151;that that Cabinet universally would have voted for war in those circumstances. That is the second matter that requires investigation.</p>

Both are absolutely central. They can be dealt with without months of preparation, on oath and in public. There is no lesson to be learned here. The lesson of whether or not to mislead the House is a lesson very quickly learned, and the answer is simple: do not mislead the House when dealing with the intelligence and the background to war. That is what we need to decide&#151;not the lessons for tomorrow, but the facts of the past.</p>

It has also been responsible for a wave of matters that are in themselves trivial&#151;bath plugs, paperclips, and the like. What is the reason for that?

The terms of reference are not in themselves a matter of deep jurisprudence, because they are perfectly simple: the inquiry should be open; on oath and without immunity. What is more, those against whom criticism or indictment may be made must be warned of that fact and must be represented&#151;yes&#151;when they give evidence before the committee.</p>

The last time that I spoke in a debate about Iraq, I took up my 10 minutes to recite the names of the 179 people who have fallen, and they are the main reason why we need this inquiry and why their loved ones are crying out for closure. There are, in the main, two groups: those who believe that their relatives died in a noble cause and possibly resent the idea of it all being churned up again; and a great group&#151;possibly a majority&#151;who are tormented by the idea that their loved ones died in vain, and that there was no reason for us to be involved in that war.</p>

It is not our job to do the work of the historians of the future; our job is to answer the question of whether we, in this House, were deceived when we took our decision in March 2003. It was an extraordinary decision, perhaps the most important of our political lives. For the first time ever, Parliament was deciding on whether we went to war.

The other, long inquiry into what happened for years before and years afterwards can go on. We should also have an inquiry that focuses not on whether the war was going to take place&#151;it was going to happen anyway&#151;but on why Britain was a collaborator in Bush&#146;s war.

how they are mishandling the issue now by trying to put Labour Members into an arm lock and make them agree to something to which we do not agree. We want another look at the issue. We want a substantive motion before the House, another debate and a chance to decide; as the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green said, we decide on so little.</p>

However, we made an awful mistake&#151;without there having been a Division on the matter&#151;in deciding to send troops in a surge into Helmand province. We had a debate on the subject, but in Westminster Hall. At the time, only seven soldiers had been killed in Afghanistan. As a result of the surge, there was also a surge in casualties; now not seven but 169 soldiers have died, and the number is increasing every week as part of a war that is going nowhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="90624-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09062480000577">During the brief debate, the futility of the decision to go into Helmand province was compared to that of the charge of the Light Brigade. Now more soldiers have died in Helmand than died in the charge of the Light Brigade. Surely we need to debate that issue as parliamentarians. Surely we need to say that, in respect of future and current conflicts, Parliament should assert itself. We should cry out, &#147;For goodness&#146; sake, can you justify this war? Can you justify a future conflict, possibly led by America, against Iran or wherever else?&#148; Obama is now President of the United States, so there is hope that good things will come. The man is an intellectual, far removed from his predecessor. I believe that he has great ideals and a clear vision of world events. It is hoped that the rest of the western world will follow in the slipstream of the path that he is taking.</p>

The decision that we took in March 2003 haunts many Members here now. We will make decisions in the future, but we have to make them in a way that reflects the views of our constituents. There is talk of this inquiry being similar to the Franks inquiry. Despite the problems of the Belgrano, that inquiry was into a war that generally united the nation; the nation was generally behind the Falklands war. The Iraq war, however, bitterly divided the nation, probably as no war has in our history&#151;no previous war brought out 2 million people on to the streets.</p>

As a Parliament, we were fooled by those dossiers and the Front-Bench speeches. The issue must be fully investigated and illuminated, and that must happen rapidly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="90624-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09062480000581">I have had the privilege of being part of two inquiries into Iraq, first the Intelligence and Security Committee&#146;s inquiry and then the Butler inquiry. Both were constrained by the fact that it was our business to examine the use, gathering and consequences of the intelligence that we got, rather than the bigger picture. However, as I shall explain, we were shown very much more than was covered by those narrow parameters. The hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) is absolutely right that there was a lot of frustration about what we had seen but were unable to report on because of the terms of reference that we had been set. That reinforces the point about terms of reference needing to be properly set by the House so that Sir John Chilcot, whom I wish well and with whom I worked on the Butler review and before that in Northern Ireland, is not in any way hamstrung by not being given adequate and full instructions and conditions under which he can do his job properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90624-0012.htm_para24"><a name="09062480000582">I turn first to the military aspect of all this, which is probably the least complex, although obviously it is very important. The operation itself was largely successful. There will be lessons to be learned, and they can all come out. For instance, issues relating to logistics, the lack of the right equipment and equipment not arriving on time must all be thrashed out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90624-0012.htm_para25"><a name="09062480000583">Perhaps most important and controversial of all is the reconstruction phase. I remember my noble Friend Field Marshal the Lord Inge chuntering away beside me, as we were going through the motions in the Butler review, about how there had been no plan for what we did when we had beaten the Iraqis and won the war, as was obviously going to happen.</p>

 The military keep implying that it was the fault of the humanitarian agencies that there was no reconstruction, but if the military occupy a country, they have to prevent disorder from breaking out. That is a military task, and I underline that their trying to pass the buck as though disorder were the fault of the UN or the Department for International Development really is not good enough.</p>

 That is not what I was saying. I was saying that there was not a comprehensive plan as to how to handle Iraq once the war was over. That was largely in the hands of the United States, which was taking the lead in all this, and I know that some of our Ministers tried manfully to get the US to focus on the matter. All of that needs to be examined in the Chilcot inquiry. Our inquiry saw quite a lot about that peripherally, but it was not actually our business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="90624-0012.htm_para26"><a name="09062480000586">That brings me to the point that others have forcefully made. Why is there not somebody with military expertise as a member of the inquiry? It is not good enough that there are advisers, assessors or whatever we like to call them. We had an army of them behind our inquiry, but it is no good having a senior retired military commander giving advice if he cannot put pertinent questions from his own area of expertise the moment the subject comes up. That gap in the composition of the committee ought to be filled.</p>

of the answers, because we were shown all the evidence. We had to go into the legal aspects of the matter from an intelligence point of view, and we reported on that. However, we were constrained from reporting on them other than from that point of view. I remember that when we asked the Attorney-General a specific question, he said, &#147;Well, there was no intelligence aspect to that question, so I do not have to answer it.&#148; Sir John must have a broad canvas to work on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90624-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09062480000588">I have seen advice from the Attorney-General that I do not believe the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) has seen, because it was not shown to the Cabinet. Some of it was leaked, and all of it was given to us, but we were constrained from reporting on it. That was not for reasons of national security but because if we had tried to, someone would have said that it was none of our business. That needs to be put right so that the Chilcot inquiry can examine all the matters that I have mentioned.</p>

Papers laying everything out have flown between very senior Government representatives and Ministers, which will make certain people&#146;s eyes water when they see them. Our inquiry saw all those things, and the Chilcot committee must see them and be able to report on them. Five or six years on, it is not a question of national security any more. It is about what advice was given to Ministers and what their reaction to it was&#151;did they accept it, or did they ignore it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90624-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09062480000590">One issue to consider is the resignation of a legal adviser to the Foreign Office, who was not content with the Attorney-General&#146;s advice. That is in the public domain, but the reasons behind it are not. That may explain why the FCO was largely excluded from the latter stages of the discussions and the decision taking, most notably when Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, met President Bush in Washington with his coterie of No. 10 advisers and Sir Christopher Meyer, our ambassador there, was excluded from the meeting. If it is not the job of Her Majesty&#146;s ambassador to be there to report from the American perspective, I do not know what is, but he was not permitted to go to that meeting. I shall not repeat myself, but we have seen the accounts of that meeting, whereas others who should have seen them have not. Sir John must be able to bring all that out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90624-0013.htm_para5"><a name="09062480000592">My last point is about the intelligence, political and machinery of government aspects that led to the way in which the decisions were taken, which we were able to report on more substantially. In fact, our comments on that were perhaps some of our most trenchant. Perhaps the hon. and learned Member for Medway did not get the bit in mandarin, because we were highly critical of the style of government that had led to no notes being taken and no record being made.</p>

There are reams of papers that explain and reveal how the two were interacting in that relationship and how that led to certain decisions being taken that, if they had been presented differently, might have been taken differently. There were crucial reports of the key moments in the decision-making process. First, there was the meeting between the Prime Minister and the President in Texas, at President Bush&#146;s ranch in Crawford. Then there was the meeting between the Prime Minister and the President in Washington from which Sir Christopher Meyer was excluded. Then there is a series of documents written by Sir David Manning, the Prime Minister&#146;s adviser on overseas and foreign policy. Those documents are crucial to understanding the way in which all the decisions were made. The press have speculated about them&#151;sometimes correctly, sometimes incorrectly&#151;and some have been leaked. Having seen them all, I know how crucial those documents are for the Chilcot inquiry to be able to do its job properly.</p>

I also accept the obvious statement that there should be public trust in the committee. The many people who have lost family members&#151;sons and daughters, for example&#151;in warfare in Iraq should be able to feel reassured that the committee will try to get as close to the truth as possible in asking why we went to war and what all the consequences were.

 I have already said that I recognise the necessity for an inquiry that should be far more public than private. If the hon. Gentleman had been a Member of the House, there is no doubt, as he has just suggested, that he would have voted against. However, few Members have changed their mind and the vote is important&#151;he is wrong&#151;because, as the critics would say, it was the vote in the House of Commons that legitimised our military intervention.

the destruction of weapons of mass destruction. In my view, that is very relevant: if the chief weapons inspector, Dr. Blix, had issued a report stating clearly that he and his team were satisfied that the weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed, there would have been no basis for going to war. Yes, he wanted more time, and I am not suggesting for a moment that he wanted military intervention then, but I am saying that, at the time, such a report was not forthcoming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90624-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09062480000613">Saddam had a history of playing cat and mouse with the weapons inspectors. We know that the weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed, but he had used them before the invasion of Kuwait. Let me say this about Kuwait: some Members&#151;not those on the Conservative Benches, but some of my hon. and right hon. Friends&#151;who were so much against the vote to go to war in 2003 were equally opposed to the liberation of Kuwait. Although it had been authorised by the United Nations Security Council, and although Saddam had committed an act of blatant aggression, they opposed the military action taken in 1991. I took a very different position. Some would say that it was unfortunate that the whole of Iraq was not liberated at the time, but most of us understood the reasons why it was not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="90624-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09062480000614">The accusation about regime change suggests that any reference to it must be derogatory. However, there are those who recognise, as I did, that Saddam ruled over a terrorist regime&#151;a totalitarian dictatorship, brutal and murderous&#151;and that sanctions were not working, but were undoubtedly inflicting great damage on numerous people in Iraq. That is what the critics said at the time. Not only were they against military intervention; they were against sanctions, which they said should be dropped. I had to concede that sanctions were causing great hardship. The question that arises for us is how such a regime can be changed. I entirely accept that there was no authorisation and no legitimacy for regime change unless there was justification in the form of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

 I was not trying to argue either for or against regime change. What I was saying, and what I think the Chilcot committee needs to consider, is that it is illegal in international law. That is a fact. The question is, was it driving the policy, or was the policy driven by something else?</p>

 I do not deny that regime change is illegal. However, in 1979 both Cambodia and Tanzania were liberated from the outright tyranny of the Pol Pot regime and Amin. That was regime change, and I do not recall any Member condemning it 30 years ago. What happened in Kosovo was a form of regime change, and was outside the authority of the Security Council. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway, who is not in the Chamber now, was strongly opposed to it, but I was in favour. I urged that action be taken against Milosevic and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and I would hardly start apologising for that now. There is a problem over regime change, and how we can help people who are suffering under tyranny and murderous oppression.</p>

 In the short time that is available&#151;let me put on record that I still resent the guillotining of everything, and believe that it is one of the reasons for the diminution of the authority of the House of Commons&#151;I want to focus on why we need an inquiry. I shall argue that the reasons are so profound that the inquiry must take place in public, the inquiry team must be strengthened&#151;as has been argued, it should contain military and legal representatives, as well as a senior politician&#151;and witnesses must give evidence under oath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90624-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09062480000619">Some have commented that we do not need an inquiry because the books have been written, the documents have been leaked, America has changed its policy, and there is therefore nothing new to be said. I agree that those who have read the books and scrutinised the leaked documents already know the truth. Nevertheless, it would be deeply shameful if the House of Commons never required an official inquiry, with the aim of putting on record the truth of why we went to war and reflecting on what that says about, first, the unreliability of the British system of government and, secondly, the obsessive focus on staying close to the United States of America, which dominates the foreign policy thinking of both new Labour and the official Opposition. Even the Liberal Democrats, despite their honourable record on the war, are not entirely free of it. That is the explanation of the error, and if we do not attend to those matters, similar errors will be made in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90624-0013.htm_para21"><a name="09062480000620">I believe that because of the &#147;nodding donkey&#148; approach to American foreign policy right or wrong, the United Kingdom&#146;s contribution to resolving some of the complex and fearsome problems of the coming decades will be extremely limited, and I think that that humiliates us. This is an enormously profound and serious question. As I believe the inquiry will show, if we went to Iraq because we wanted to please President Bush&#151;or because Tony Blair wanted to please him&#151;there is a danger that that error will be repeated. Happily, America, after a big semi-revolution, has changed its President and completely changed its policy, and Britain follows along with the new President. I prefer the new President, of course, but we did not even have a debate or discussion about whether we should change our policy. How humiliating is that?</p>

 I made an intervention earlier in which I stressed the importance of the relationship between the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development and mentioned that the British forces were concerned that there might be no plan involving DFID. Can the right hon.

 I cannot confirm that date, but I can confirm that when I heard the rumour&#151;but did not see the legal document&#151;that the Attorney-General doubted the legality of the war, I warned my staff of the consequences of that, which I think was entirely proper. That is part of the shame of it all, but I shall come on to the preparations. There were preparations that were then all junked, because of the hubris and deceit that went into preparing for war.</p>

That is a very important consequence of the inquiry that needs to flow to the House of Commons. I do not advocate hostility to the United States, of course. Indeed, I think that if we had spoken truthfully to the United States at the time, we would have been a better friend. I yearn, however, for an honest appraisal of the dangers the world and the UK face and an intelligent discussion of the contribution we could make, working with others, to the establishment of a more equitable and just world order, capable of dealing with the disorder that will come to us because of climate change. It is also my view that if we do not do better in bringing justice to the middle east, the capacity of the international system to co-operate to deal with these challenges will be broken and weakened, with desperately serious consequences for all of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90624-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09062480000624">We need an inquiry that forces all parties and the public to face up to the fact that we got involved in Iraq because George Bush and the neo-conservatives wanted to overthrow the unpopular regime of Saddam Hussein&#151;regime change&#151;and establish a friendly power in Iraq, so that they could relocate American bases in the middle east, dominate the Gulf and have close relations with a country that contained a large proportion of the world&#146;s remaining oil. As has been said, all of that is laid out for all to read in the documents published by the Project for the New American Century, which many of those who became senior figures in the Bush Administration had signed up to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="90624-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09062480000625">Of course, the US expected the invasion of Iraq to be popular with Iraqis and therefore thought that it would help to stabilise the middle east. The only problem was that international law, laid down after the second world war under the leadership of President Roosevelt and with the support of Prime Minister Churchill, did not permit that, and thus the lying became necessary in order to do what the neo-conservatives thought to be right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="90624-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09062480000626">I did not know that Tony Blair had the published documents of the Project for the New American Century drawn to his attention&#151;they were certainly not drawn to the attention of the Cabinet&#151;but I think that he was desperate to be close to George Bush and worried that he would not be because of the closeness of his relationship with President Clinton, and that he therefore gave his word early on that Britain would be with him in the planned invasion of Iraq. From that, it all flows: the exaggeration of the threat from weapons of mass destruction to give an excuse for war, because regime change is not legal.</p>

international law. They wanted to keep the UK with them because the majority of US citizens said yes to war in coalition, but not alone. The UK had to pretend to respect international law, and that led to the game that was played at the United Nations. We should all remember that the UK ambassador to the UN, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, whom I like and admire enormously, gave a shameful undertaking on behalf of the UK when the first resolution was passed that there was no automaticity&#151;no authority for war&#151;without another resolution. However, the UK went on to argue later that the first resolution gave authority for war. That was deeply shameful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90624-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09062480000629">I remain deeply shaken by the way in which the interpretation of international law was manipulated to fit the policy. The first legal opinion, which was leaked and is now a matter of public record, was kept from the Cabinet. That was a complete breach of the ministerial code, but who enforces the code? It is the Prime Minister. The second legal opinion was concocted at the last minute by an Attorney-General who was a crony of the Prime Minister, put into the Lords by the Prime Minister and made Attorney-General by the Prime Minister.</p>

 I am not following the right hon. Lady in her criticisms, but if memory serves me correctly, there were 44 meetings of the Cabinet between September and when we went to war. The Attorney-General attended only two of them. Did the right hon. Lady, who was there, find it strange that in that legal morass, the Government&#146;s legal adviser was never there?</p>

I now know that he did, and I conclude that the arrangements that we have for ensuring UK compliance with international law are unsafe. The way in which the Attorney-General is appointed is unsafe, and our constitutional arrangements need restructuring. That is one of the important issues to which the inquiry must attend.</p>

Indeed, it is sometimes suggested that because of my doubts about the war, I prevented such preparations from being made in the Department for International Development, although how I could be responsible for US policy I am not sure.

Department made preparations, liaising carefully with the State Department, the UN and other international actors. Then, just a couple of months before the planned invasion, President Bush passed responsibility for post-war reconstruction to the Pentagon and set up the new agency, the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance&#151;ORHA. All the State Department preparations were junked. There was no liaison with the UN or with the international community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90624-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09062480000635">At the time, Andrew Natsios, then head of the US Agency for International Development, said that the danger in post-war Iraq would be chaos, and if we sacked everyone in the Ba&#146;ath party, no institutions would function. He said that it was crucial that only the top people went and everyone else was left in place. That advice was wiped away and we got exactly what he predicted. That was incredible. In the run-up to the war, I thought, &#147;This cannot happen in a nation like the US&#151;they have Harvard, Yale and Princeton-educated people. We cannot make such an error.&#148; But the hubris was such that it was believed that the invasion would be welcomed and that there was no need for international co-operation.

I could never quite understand what our influence&#151;or lack of it&#151;was in the whole process. We had a vested interest in getting it right, but somehow seemed not to have any view on it.

There were other ways of bringing down Saddam Hussein. We could have got rid of the sanctions, or indicted him like we did Milosevic and let the Iraqi people help to do it. None of the other options were considered. This is a disgrace to our history and it shows that our institutions do not work. We need an inquiry that will lay out everything from which we can learn the lessons about decision making and our role in the world, so that we never ever again engage in such actions, which have left terrible destabilising effects on the wider middle east.</p>

 With respect, Mr. Deputy Speaker, 10 minutes of most Back Benchers is more than enough, but there are odd occasions when it is not enough. The speeches of the right hon. Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates) who has vast experience and of the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) should have been extended. They were extremely important to this debate and this 10-minute rule should give you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the flexibility to allow a moment or two for important, decisive speeches in a debate.

It is evident from the period of time when there was not a single Government Member on the Front Bench and from the body language of the two Ministers who now are on it when the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood was speaking. They were sneering and nudging, utterly oblivious to the fact that her speech will be listened to and read by millions tomorrow and given real weight, while what they have to say will be treated, if they are lucky, with derision.</p>

When, in 2005, I was elected as the first left-of-Labour Member of Parliament in England for 60 years, I was elected because of Iraq. The Labour party&#146;s membership has halved because of Iraq. Millions of Labour voters have left them and new parties&#151;some of the left and some of the right&#151;are proliferating and strengthening, in substantial part because of Iraq. That has happened not directly, but indirectly because of the poison that the Iraq question has caused to pulse around the British body politic.

We have no chance for that catharsis, because either Tweedledee or Tweedledum will rule the country when the general election comes. That is a disaster for us, and it makes the inquiry much more important than it might otherwise have been. That is why we ought to have a real inquiry.</p>

The more the Foreign Secretary adumbrated their distinguished characteristics, the more I saw a parade of establishment flunkeys&#151;Sir Humphrey This and Sir Humphrey That.

He and his neo-con friends were the people who made the then Prime Minister&#146;s bullets for the war. Gilbert hailed Bush and Blair&#151;imagine, they are already two of the most discredited political figures in the world, and history has not even started on them yet&#151;as akin to Roosevelt and Churchill.

Why cannot the former Foreign Secretary Lord Hurd, with his vast knowledge of international affairs, be on the inquiry? Why should Parliament be represented by a woman I have never heard of? I have sat in this place for 23 years, and I doubt whether anybody here, other than those with the privilege of knowing the lady personally, could tell us anything that she has ever done. How can she represent Parliament in this great debate&#151;this great inquiry?

The Foreign Secretary said that he cannot put a percentage on which parts will be in public and which in private. Well, given how loth most people in the country are to believe anything the Government say, that ought to be a significant warning signal. They say that Chilcot can look at the scope for making people take oaths, but without oaths the whole thing is meaningless. Tony Blair is right that he answers questions on Iraq all the time. It is the truthfulness of the answers that is the problem, not the fact that he has the brass neck to answer. His problem is the punishment that he would have to face in this life if he answered questions untruthfully under oath. This is not worth the paper it is not written on unless there are legally enforceable powers to subpoena, to bring witnesses and documents, and to force people giving evidence to do so under oath.</p>

Although a few semi-extinct volcanoes are prepared to identify themselves with what they did, that this was a blunder is a conventional wisdom that is shared if not in this building, then among the vast majority of the population as a whole.</p>

I know that we do not like that sort of thing in this country&#151;things are usually swept under the carpet and finessed&#151;but this is new territory. Events such as the expenses scandal have left the country seeing our House with such odium, and this country&#146;s political class so naked, that the old ways will not do. If the inquiry finds people guilty of misleading Parliament, the Queen, the armed forces and the public, they will have to be held accountable. There will have to be a trial, which will have to be held under oath, and that will lead to punishment if there are convictions at the end&#151;nothing less will do.</p>

We were also told that he had links with al-Qaeda, but we now know that the only link was that al-Qaeda tried to kill him. We were given those reasons for going to war, but what we have learned since then has proved our fears and concerns right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90624-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09062480000678">I remember attending an anti-war rally in Glasgow that was one of the biggest rallies in the history of Scotland; 70,000 people participated in it, and they were all angry. They all felt that the war was unnecessary, unjustified and probably illegal. I also saw more than 1 million people marching on the streets of London, opposing the war. The inquiry must answer the question: why did the British public better understand the crisis and get it right, while our Government got it so wrong, despite having access to both UK and US intelligence services reports, on top of several UN reports, including the investigation by the respected Hans Blix?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90624-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09062480000679">The inquiry must help to answer the unanswered questions raised during the years of the war. It must be an inquiry unlike any conducted before, with full access to all Government papers and the ability to call any witness. Crucially, it should be fully independent of the Government, and its remit should cover more than just the period of conflict; it should also cover the periods that led up to it and followed on from it.

With regard to timeliness, although the committee is not due to report back for a whole year, I firmly believe that a job as large as the one that it has been tasked with is not something that we can afford to rush into. After all, we have already seen the terrible consequences of having rushed into the war. I am sure that no one will argue that it is in the interests of the House or the public that the committee should be hindered in any way while conducting as detailed and as accurate a report on the Iraq war as is possible, least of all by having unnecessary time constraints imposed on its work.</p>

I accept that it is difficult to strike a balance between the interests of transparency on the one hand and national security on the other. None the less, I share the concerns of hon.

Crucially, the inquiry should not only highlight our interests, but show a genuine interest in the well-being of the Iraqi people. It is not enough to analyse what went wrong during the war, nor is it enough to report on its aftermath. The only way for so detailed an inquiry to be truly beneficial to this House is for it to include recommendations on the various ways that we as a nation can help to improve the living standards of ordinary Iraqi citizens. The inquiry must look at the huge humanitarian problems created, such as the millions of refugees who were forced to flee to neighbouring countries, the terrible human rights abuses that occurred in Abu Ghraib and the alleged cases of extraordinary rendition. I cannot stress how important it is for all those issues to be investigated as part of the inquiry. We cannot allow them to overshadow all the good that has been done in Iraq with regard to humanitarian assistance, infrastructure and economic projects, and, most importantly, democratic government for its people.</p>

The Leader of the Opposition has already stated that, even knowing what he knows today, he would still have gone to war with Iraq.

 The justification used by Government and others since the war has been varied. We have heard explanations that Iraq is a much better place, and that there was a need for regime change, despite the fact that regime change is illegal under international law. But we cannot get away from the fact that the main justification for war at the time was weapons of mass destruction. It is therefore blatantly obvious to the majority of people outside this place, if not in this place, that we went to war on a false premise. There were no weapons of mass destruction. The reason why the UN weapons inspectors could not find such weapons is that they did not exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90624-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09062480000688">I mention that for two reasons. The inquiry should focus on how the decision was made to go to war, given the lack of concrete evidence as to the existence of weapons of mass destruction. Also, I agree with other Members when they say that the Government simply do not get it. They have completely missed the point. Outside this place, there is a real sense of anger and of betrayal that the country and Parliament were misled when it came to justifying, at the time, the case for war. That sense of betrayal and anger has been reinforced by what is now, subsequently, seen as the enormity of the folly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90624-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09062480000689">There can be no doubt that Iraq was the biggest foreign policy disaster since Suez. It was flawed in conception, execution and legacy; it brought about the death and/or displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq; it radicalised parts of the Muslim world against us to the extent that it has increased the risk of terrorism against residents of this country; and it brought about, within Iraq, the penetration of al-Qaeda, which had not been a presence there prior to the invasion. The west has suffered an historic loss of political and moral prestige, not just through the invasion, but through such issues as Abu Ghraib, which has not helped our cause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90624-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09062480000690">Last but not least, the enormity of the suffering that the death or injury of so many of our troops has caused is now clearly focused in people&#146;s minds. The troops did everything that was expected of them; my hope&#151;our hope&#151;is that the inquiry will explore whether Parliament did everything that was expected of it. It must not only find the truth, but be seen to find the truth. That is why I, for one, believe that only a fully public inquiry will purge that anger and sense of betrayal, which is so keenly felt outside this place and in this Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90624-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09062480000691">I believe that there cannot be any private sessions. History shows that sessions in secret do not necessarily reveal the truth; difficult questions do not get answered. A clear example is the 45-minute claim. At the time, the then Prime Minister made great play of the fact that our forces were within 45 minutes&#146; striking reach of chemical weapons. We still do not know to this day how that claim was inserted in the dossier itself, but we do know that the intelligence services did not think that the evidence and intelligence warranted the claim&#146;s inclusion in the draft dossiers leading up to the first official draft dossier of 10 September 2002, when it was included.</p>

 I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman and shall be as quick as I can. Does he recall that on the afternoon of 10 September 2002, the <i> Evening Standard</i>, in response to that dodgy dossier, made it quite clear that that information had previously been in the public domain through the International Institute for Strategic Studies and was not worth the paper that it was written on? In the subsequent six months to March the following year, therefore, it did not form the case that we decided upon in this Chamber on the 18th of that month. That was not the case at all.</p>

 With respect, I think that the hon. Gentleman has missed the point; the point is that the intelligence services themselves did not think that the issue merited inclusion in the dossier. At the meeting of 9 September, at which spin doctors were present, the decision was made to upgrade the claim, despite the lack of evidence. The strongest word that the intelligence services could bring forward was &#147;indicates&#148;&#151;in other words, there were &#147;indications&#148;. That was vastly firmed up and included in the dossier after that meeting.</p>

That is why I firmly believe that there should be no private sittings during the inquiry. If we do not know what the questions are and we get answers that are largely redacted out, that will not satisfy the public anger and sense of betrayal about the war and the reasons why we went to war. If the Government are to purge that sense of betrayal, they have to do everything that they can to put the sittings into the public domain. Even written parliamentary questions to the Cabinet Office about who was responsible for including the 45-minute claim met a blank refusal. We want to know the answers, because the claim was an integral part of the case for war at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90624-0015.htm_para24"><a name="09062480000700">There are two key questions that the inquiry needs to answer about how the decision to go to war was made.

The second is about how the evidence of weapons of mass destruction came to be so exaggerated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90624-0016.htm_para0"><a name="09062480000701">We all know that war should be the weapon of last resort, but on this occasion it was not. Why were the UN weapons inspectors not given more time? Many believe that the decision to go to war was taken well in advance of our vote in this place in March 2003. Many papers are available&#151;some have been alluded to in this debate&#151;that suggest that the decision was made by President Bush and the then Prime Minister Tony Blair back in April 2002 in Crawford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90624-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09062480000702">There are minutes and briefing notes for Ministers with regard to that meeting, dated July 2002, that clearly make the point that the decision had been taken and that the question was about how it would be justified to the public. The point that the then Prime Minister was making was that he had to justify the decision and that the WMD claim was perhaps the route to take. Those documents have never been denied by the Government. Again, it all begs the question how the political system and constitutional safeguards&#151;party control, collective government, parliamentary democracy itself&#151;failed so spectacularly on that occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90624-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09062480000703">The other issue on which the inquiry should remain firmly focused is how the evidence was &#147;sexed up&#148;&#151;to use that unfortunate phrase&#151;once the decision had been taken. We must remember that previous inquiries did not fundamentally address that point. The Hutton inquiry, for example, cleared the Government of sexing the evidence up because it believed that the dossier was at all times under the control of the Joint Intelligence Committee. However, all the evidence since, which we have had to drag from the Government&#151;through freedom of information requests or the intervention of the Information Commissioner&#151;is that spin doctors were at the very heart of the drafting process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="90624-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09062480000704">The fact that a spin doctor produced the first full draft of the dossier, one day before John Scarlett&#146;s official draft of 10 September 2002, is evidence of that. Scarlett himself acknowledges that he had considerable help from John Williams, the senior press officer at the Foreign Office at the time. Such questions need to be answered by the inquiry. But they will not be truly answered, and the sense of betrayal cannot be purged, unless the inquiry is made fully public.</p>

 I welcome the fact that there is going to be an inquiry, but I share the feeling expressed by other hon.

I am quite happy to acknowledge that the terms of reference that the Prime Minister has set are unnecessarily and unhelpfully restrictive, both on the membership and make-up of the inquiry team and on its remit. However, it will be down to this House to determine whether we collectively are willing to run with something that, at the end of the day, will only add to the discredit and disbelief among the general public about the standing of the House. It is we collectively who are on trial, and I hope that Members will think carefully about that when they decide how to vote on the motion.</p>

It does not help any of us for such a wide remit to be set that it becomes impossible for the committee to report before the next general election.

Dominique de Villepin was here, and he set out the French perspective. Scott Ritter, a former head of the United Nations Special Commission weapons inspectors, came here and set out what the inspectors already knew about the destruction of both Iraq&#146;s capabilities and its potential to deliver weapons of mass destruction. He gave UNSCOM&#146;s evidence to Members who were interested. Denis Halliday, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator, came and told us what a devastating mess we were already making in Iraq and how disastrous it would be to compound that error.</p>

It set out the degree of international evidence available that contradicted all the claims that were coming out of Downing street. The inquiry therefore needs to address how, in the face of that evidence, this House could be bounced into a war of choice.</p>

My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) referred to the secret Downing street memo produced on 23 July 2002 by David Manning and Matthew Rycroft, the Prime Minister&#146;s foreign policy adviser at the time.

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="90624-0016.htm_para10"><a name="09062480000714">The then Foreign Secretary, for instance, said:</p>

That absence of legality and the cynical manipulation of a case for a war of choice must be the focus of the inquiry&#146;s work.</p>

Because he is no longer a Member of the House, I no longer have to fear being ejected for saying what many people believe: we were misled and the House was misled on a matter so serious&#151;life or death, peace or war. That is why it is our responsibility tonight to get to the heart of the matter, both the specifics of the Iraq war and how our democracy and our machinery of government were so terribly undermined. We have to establish the truth and ensure that that never happens again&#151;and yes, if as a result of that the inquiry believes that it must attribute blame, it should be free to do so if there is individual culpability, as many of us believe.</p>

Members. On the motivation for the war, I believe that WMD were the pretext. As we have heard, various minutes and the Downing street memos that have emerged subsequent to the Butler inquiry suggest clearly, as Wolfowitz said, that WMD were simply the bureaucratic rationale.

 In March last year, on another occasion when we debated the need for an inquiry on Iraq, the Foreign Secretary expressed surprise at my reservations about the credibility of the inquiry chaired by Lord Butler. In the speech that I made later in the debate I set out my concerns, which I will not repeat now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para0"><a name="09062480000746">When that inquiry was set up, we already knew of Lord Butler&#146;s form from his evidence to the Scott inquiry. When asked about the less than full information being provided in parliamentary answers, he said:</p>
<a name="90624-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="09062480000837"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;You have to be selective about the facts.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para1"><a name="09062480000747">Commenting to the inquiry on other parliamentary answers, he added:</p>
<a name="90624-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="09062480000838"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It was an accurate but incomplete answer. The purpose of it was to give an answer which itself was true. It did not give the full picture. It was half an answer.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09062480000748">We must ensure that the inquiry that we set up following today&#146;s debate gives the full answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09062480000749">Given the outcome of the Butler inquiry, it is appropriate to consider what we know about the chair and members of the current inquiry&#151;especially as we heard from the Foreign Secretary today that, having first announced an inquiry to be held in private, the Government are now putting their faith in Sir John Chilcot to conduct the inquiry in an acceptable manner, telling the House that the Chilcot approach meets all reasonable expectations. I think that today&#146;s debate demonstrates that that is not the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para4"><a name="09062480000750">We also learnt from the Foreign Secretary today that Sir John Chilcot went along with the proposal for the inquiry to be conducted in private. In contrast, Sir John is now saying that as much of it as possible should be held in public. That is good, but what message does it convey about his objectivity and impartiality, given that he was apparently happy to accept an inquiry conducted in private? Surely it should have been perfectly obvious to everyone&#151;at least those with no interest in a cover-up&#151;that that would not do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09062480000751">By accepting such a condition, Sir John&#151;a retired civil servant and as such someone who could be regarded as an establishment figure&#151;failed to exert his independence. He does not seem to be the sort of person who robustly evaluates evidence and arrives at careful conclusions. Indeed, as a member of the Butler committee, he must have gone along with the remarkable decision to support the Government&#146;s claim that Iraq had sought to procure uranium from Africa, ignoring the conclusion of the International Atomic Energy Agency that the allegation was unfounded. Moreover, it did so without giving any reasons for disagreeing with the IAEA, and without addressing probing questions that I and the former Member for Blaenau Gwent, Llew Smith, submitted in our dossier to the inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09062480000752">I am not the only person who is raising questions about the selection of Sir John to chair the inquiry, as we heard in earlier comments from the Opposition Benches. In an article in last Sunday&#146;s edition of <i> The Observer</i>,<i> </i>Professor Philippe Sands talks of the role of the chairman as crucial, but says &#147;questions abound&#148; about the choice of Sir John. He asks:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09062480000753">as is, perhaps, indicated by his acceptance of an inquiry in private. Philippe Sands continues:</p>
<a name="90624-0017.htm_brev3"><a name="09062480000840"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This is a view I have heard repeated several times. More troubling is evidence I have seen for myself.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09062480000754">He then refers to the occasion when the Butler committee took evidence from the former Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith, on 5 May 2004:</p>
<a name="90624-0017.htm_brev4"><a name="09062480000841"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The uncorrected transcript shows some members of the inquiry pressing him hard.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09062480000755">Let me now turn to the other members of the inquiry team. Sir Roderic Lyne is a former ambassador to Russia. He retired in 2004 and took up a number of posts in the private sector. He was a special adviser to BP, which currently has major interests in Iraq. Regardless of whether that represents a conflict of interests, it does not help public confidence given the concern that we went to war for oil.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09062480000756">There are also two historians on the committee. Sir Lawrence Freedman is a military historian and professor of war studies. <i> The Scotsman </i>reports that he previously praised Tony Blair&#146;s attempts to influence US foreign policy in the run-up to the war&#151;attempts at influence that proved fruitless. The other historian, Sir Martin Gilbert, compared George W. Bush and Tony Blair to Roosevelt and Churchill in an article in <i> The Observer </i>in 2004. Both historians could be seen as establishment figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09062480000757">Another member of the committee is Baroness Usha Prashar. She has a virtuous CV but, as other Members have said, would it not have been more appropriate to include Members of this House? Public confidence in the inquiry would be enhanced if its membership included at least one Member who has questioned the decision to go to war. Some names have been mentioned in the debate; I suggest my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), as I think he would be an excellent choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09062480000758">I would also like to suggest another member. John Morrison was an analyst at the Ministry of Defence with wide experience of the British intelligence community. When he retired in 1999, he took up a post as the Intelligence and Security Committee&#146;s investigator, but he was sacked after he was interviewed, with the Committee&#146;s agreement, on &#147;Panorama&#148; in July 2004. In that interview he referred to the &#147;collective raspberry&#148; that went around Whitehall when the Prime Minister stated in the UK dossier of September 2002 that Iraq&#146;s weapons of mass destruction posed a serious and current threat. John Morrison said that</p>
<a name="90624-0017.htm_brev5"><a name="09062480000842"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Prime Minister was going way beyond anything any professional analyst would have agreed.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09062480000759">The former chief of defence intelligence and former deputy chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, Air Marshal Sir John Walker, worked with Mr. Morrison and has expressed concern about the non-renewal of his contract. The ISC had previously described Mr. Morrison as a valuable asset to the Committee. Sir John is reported as saying:</p>
<a name="90624-0017.htm_brev6"><a name="09062480000843"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;John Morrison is an extremely experienced and extremely good intelligence operative. I have the highest regard and respect  <br>

for him. He has broken ranks, together with people like Brian Jones and David Kelly, because of a considerable concern about what was going on. If...people of John Morrison&#146;s calibre...break ranks it is very serious.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09062480000760">He also said that it was beyond belief that Mr. Morrison was going because his contract was up and that he would be surprised if pressure had not come from No. 10 after the embarrassment of the &#147;Panorama&#148; criticisms. A member such as John Morrison would add credibility to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09062480000761">It is essential that we have an inquiry in which all shades of opinion in this House and the public can have confidence.

 It seems a long time since 15 February 2003. Much has changed for me in that time. I was then not an elected politician&#151;I had not even been elected to Leeds city council, never mind as a Member of Parliament. I was one of the many&#151;perhaps as many as 2 million&#151;who marched on the streets of London in an unprecedented display of public protest that the Government were even considering taking this country into an illegal war. I was joined by my then girlfriend&#151;now my wife, I am happy to say&#151;who was one of the many who were not political people and who had never protested before in their lives. She took to the streets because she was so concerned about what might be done in her name.</p>

But the reality is that, not long after that march in February 2003, this House, which at the time seemed so immune to and out of touch with what the country felt, voted to approve the invasion of Iraq.</p>

We do not need an inquiry to tell us that.

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09062494000020">I share the concerns that have been expressed about extending the remit of the committee. We must consider what happened afterwards, but we must first get closure for this country on why we went into the war in the first place. I echo the comments made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson), who talked about punishment. We are now talking about having a one-year jail sentence for Members who abuse their expenses. What punishment should we have for a Prime Minister who deliberately misled the House of Commons and the British public into an illegal and immoral war? That is a question that we should be asking as part of the process. We simply cannot hide from it.</p>

We still see his hand on the shoulder of the current Prime Minister. The sad reality is that although George W. Bush is discredited and did not get away with the illegal invasion of Iraq, as usual, &#147;Teflon Tony&#148; did. The only way to change that is to get him in front of a public inquiry, under oath, and finally get to the bottom of that decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para24"><a name="09062494000022">If anyone doubts what I have said, the former Prime Minister, at the same Dispatch Box from which he misled the people of this country, once said something that was entirely untrue about me. He never had the decency or honour to apologise for that. What hope do we have that he will ever apologise for his disastrous decision?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="90624-0017.htm_para25"><a name="09062494000023">There is a lot of talk about whether Tony Blair influenced the decision to have the inquiry held in private. I think that just about everyone on the Government Benches realises that that has done them a great deal of damage. Frankly, it does not matter, because Tony Blair&#146;s legacy is that it does not matter what the truth is, but simply how it is presented. Let me quote a supporter of the war, Bruce Anderson, from <i> The Independent </i>on 22 June. He said:</p>

The only way to get evidence given under oath is by the House passing a swift Act of Parliament to facilitate an extraordinary, one-off inquiry. I think that I am only person in the House to have given evidence to the Hutton inquiry. None of that evidence was given under oath, and I shall say more about that in a moment.</p>

Not one of those so-called &#147;inquiries&#148; was held under oath, and as a member of the FAC, I can say that extracting the truth was like extracting teeth from a whale. Every obstruction was put in our way. There were redactions in the report, as was mentioned earlier. The Butler inquiry was held behind closed doors, and we do not really know what evidence it received. We can look at the report, but no evidence was given under oath.</p>

No evidence was given under oath to that inquiry either, and our witness statements are covered by the 30-year rule. My humble little witness statement will not be seen for 30 years; neither will the witness statements of the Defence Secretary at the time, the right hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon), or of the then Prime Minister, or of people in the security and intelligence services see the light of day&#151;unless, of course, this new inquiry is independent and appointed under the tribunals of inquiry legislation.</p>

Actually, I do not want a Saville-type inquiry and I am not advocating such an inquiry, as it is not necessary. The Saville inquiry related to one traumatic and heart-rending incident, but in terms of the volume and level of deceit, the Iraq war is much bigger than the awful events in Londonderry a quarter of a century ago&#151;I am not minimising what happened there, of course. Saville&#146;s was a judicial inquiry, at which people had to give evidence under oath, and the same was true of the Lawrence inquiry. If I may go back in history, Winston Churchill gave evidence under oath at the Gallipoli inquiry. Although that was a long time ago, it is the sort of inquiry that is required to deal with the Iraq war today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para0"><a name="09062494000037">Why am I so upset by the Government trying to spin the yarn that, somehow, evidence can be given under what I think they say is the equivalent of an oath? That cannot be done and the Government know it. If I am wrong, let the Minister tell me where I am wrong when he replies to the debate. The fact is that the oath not only makes people tell the truth, but protects those who are being leaned on by superiors and other agencies. History would have been different if evidence had been given under oath to the Foreign Affairs Committee and, I believe, to the Hutton inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09062494000038">I regret to say this, Madam Deputy Speaker, but the problem is the Prime Minister. The fact is that he does not understand that he does not understand. He came along last week to announce the inquiry and he handed it down like tablets of stone. What he basically said is, &#147;We are the Government, so we decide.&#148; That simply will not do. Things have moved on since last week. We were told that it was going to be a Franks-style inquiry&#151;quite wrongly, I think, for reasons I have explained&#151;but it has now mutated into something completely different. The Prime Minister and, downwards from him, his advisers, were panicking, so he wrote to Chilcot and asked him to see what he could do about having some sessions in public, using what is said in their phrase to be some &#147;equivalent to the oath&#148;. There is no equivalent to the oath; there would be more value in the wolf cub&#146;s promise than what they are proposing. That is the fact of the matter. There is no such equivalent to the oath and the Prime Minister knows it. <i> [Interruption.]</i><i> </i>If the Minister thinks I am wrong, I repeat my call for him to explain when he replies from the Dispatch Box what this equivalent is that will have the force of law and criminal sanctions if it were ever to be abrogated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09062494000039">As I have said, the Prime Minister does not understand that does not understand. The real test of all the stuff he has been saying about rejuvenating Parliament&#151;he almost puts the blame on the rest of us for bringing Parliament into disrepute&#151;is whether he is prepared to acknowledge that this Parliament has the right to decide the nature of the inquiry into why and how it was misled on the Iraq war. I am buttressed in my arguments by many of the people the Prime Minister relied on to say what a good idea a Franks-type inquiry would be. One after the other over the past seven days, those civil servants and members of the judiciary, for example, have said that that idea is nonsense. A few nights ago, I cheered when General Mike Jackson said on &#147;Newsnight&#148; that evidence to the inquiry must be given under oath. It showed that the Government cannot hide the fact that some military people who have seen the conflict and seen the evidence knew what was going on. They say this must be an independent inquiry and that evidence must be given under oath. Why does the Minister not understand that? Why does his boss the Prime Minister not understand that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09062494000040">It is time the Minister went behind the Chair and phoned the Prime Minister to tell him to accept the motion. If the Prime Minister does not do so, he may win the vote&#151;I am not certain&#151;but he will certainly lose the debate. The arguments for an independent inquiry will go on and on and on until one is conceded.</p>

House until 2005, and it is humbling to listen to the sincerity, passion and candour of those who lived through the experience of having to vote in the House on such a weighty and solemn a matter as sending our country to war. I have not had that responsibility, so it is with some trepidation but, I hope, a degree of humility that I offer my remarks about the motion on the inquiry that faces the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09062494000042">I intended to confine my remarks to the structure, nature, procedure and terms of reference of the inquiry, and not to venture into the substantive aspects of the question relating to the merits of the war in Iraq, but inevitably the two are connected. Nobody can deny that the events and circumstances of the Iraq war were of the greatest magnitude in the history of our nation&#151;far greater, I submit, than the events and circumstances of the Falklands war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09062494000043">One of the reasons I suggest the Iraq war is of greater magnitude is that it presents itself as a much greater and more complex series of questions and problems for the House and for history. It presents in that way because it raises much more fundamental questions, including questions of constitutional breakdown, as many Members have already said. How we came to the war includes the role of the Attorney-General and an analysis of how the Attorney-General interacts with the Government of the day. It includes complex questions of law, such as what was known to those who were advising the Government on the status of the war in international law. It raises questions of the House and its prerogatives, and of the accountability of the Government to the House. How can the House prevent itself from being&#151;as some would say&#151;deceived by evidence that has been exaggerated or distorted, when it cannot see the underlying documents?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09062494000044">The Franks inquiry certainly never had to contend with the question of constitutional breakdown, because the Falklands war presented itself in a fairly simple light. There were questions about the defects in intelligence and, some might say, about a defect in the Government&#146;s conduct of policy running up to the war and the invasion by the Argentines, but what was never questioned&#151;at least not by an overwhelming majority of the nation&#151;was the justification for going to war in the Falklands islands in the first place. There was never a question of the constitutional processes by which that war had been undertaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09062494000045">I recall as a young man listening to the wonderful debate in 1982 in which Michael Foot gave a great speech pledging his support and that of the Opposition for the vindication of those little islands and their population against the bullying of a larger nation that had taken international law into its own hands and made a mockery of it by invasion. The war we are dealing with in the inquiry raises much more fundamental questions and will have a much stronger effect on history than the war fought in 1982.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09062494000046">It is precisely because of the multiplicity of aspects that the methods the Government have chosen to set up the inquiry are so fundamentally lacking. Let me explain. There are no terms of reference. Those we have seen, and which one can espy in the Prime Minister&#146;s statement, are non-existent. They have not been debated by the House. They have not been subject to the to and fro&#151;the forensic testing and struggle&#151;across the Floor of the House to ascertain and define precisely the instructions  <br>

that the inquiry must follow. That is wrong and does not do justice to the complexity and gravity of the circumstances of the Iraq war because many of us might disagree about what central questions should be the focus of Sir John Chilcot&#146;s terms of reference. We cannot leave it to a bunch of civil servants, however distinguished they might be, to decide the fundamental questions to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09062494000047">The hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) defined the central question as he saw it: how the House came to be deceived by a series of exaggerations and distortions. However, others might see the inquiry&#146;s central question as military unpreparedness and the Government sending our troops into war ill-equipped&#151;and in many cases unequipped&#151;for the kinds of warfare with which they had to contend. They are not the only considerations&#151;others might see the aftermath of the war as the central question&#151;but this House ought to decide the central questions for the inquiry and define the terms of reference. It is only through the democratic process of debate in the House about the terms of reference that the public can have any confidence that they have been established transparently and objectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para12"><a name="09062494000050">I want to say something about the procedure. Historians are generally not especially experienced at interrogating live actors&#151;I hope that that statement is pretty uncontroversial. I have no doubt that the two historians on the panel are especially good at interpreting historical documents and evidence, but I would be surprised if they had much experience of winkling out the truth from a reluctant and sometimes even self-deceived witness. There is one forensic tool&#151;I would say this, and I declare an interest&#151;that is guaranteed to winkle out the truth from a Minister or anybody else: cross-examination. Cross-examination by a skilled and experienced cross-examiner is an indefeasible tool in the hands of an inquiry. It is absurd&#151;it is fantasy&#151;to propose that creating the conditions of secrecy will somehow lead to a cosy, fireside chat in which the likes of Alastair Campbell will be induced to confide their secret heart to the listening committee. It is only with the forensic tool of cross-examination that we can hope to get the bottom of many of the complex and thorny issues with which the committee will be challenged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para13"><a name="09062494000051">If the Government are to have cross-examination and to get to bottom of this, there has got to be an oath. It is no use suggesting, as the Foreign Secretary appeared to do at one point, that an oath can somehow be administered informally. If an oath is to mean anything, it must have legal consequences, and the legal consequences of telling a lie on oath are prosecution for perjury. If an oath is to be administered, it must be done in circumstances that leave no room for any doubt that telling a lie will be visited with all the penalties of the law, namely a prosecution for perjury. That is why I agree with the hon. Member  <br>

for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) that the only way is to have an oath. The only way is to have cross-examination. The only way is to have the inquiry in public when compelling interests of national security do not require otherwise.

 I shall be extremely brief, Madam Deputy Speaker.

There is an hour and 10 minutes of this debate left, and to be frank to the Government, whatever the outcome of the vote tonight, the inquiry is now in disarray. If it cannot command the cross-party support of the House, it will not command the support of the people outside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09062494000056">Many arguments have been set out&#151;on the lack of terms of reference, on the lack of consultation with, and involvement of, the House on that, on the composition, on the remit, and on oaths. The oath is absolutely critical. As my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) has said, the equivalent to the oath will elicit the equivalent to the truth. The whole point of the exercise is to try to get to the truth. As my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock says, I wonder whether, in view of the new practices that we are trying to introduce in Parliament, tonight could be the one occasion when a Minister contacts No. 10 and says, &#147;The game&#146;s up. What we need to do now is try to find consensus in the House on this important issue.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90624-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09062494000057">This started with a tragedy. I voted against the war after one of the most heart-rending debates that we have had. It was heart-rending because at every Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time since then, a Prime Minister has announced the names of the fallen in Iraq and Afghanistan; I think that the Iraq war led to the climate that enabled the Government to go into Afghanistan. Now, we are going from tragedy to absolute farce.</p>

When he announced, the following day, that there would be an inquiry on Iraq, I was absolutely heartened.

If we cannot address the central question of whether the House and the country were misled by individuals, so that we can expose what went on, learn the lessons and move forward, we will not have cleaned the record of this Government, or be able, as a Government, to make such consequential decisions about life and death in future.</p>

Let us get out of the trenches tonight and start talking about what the real needs of the country are. The real need is for honesty. To be frank, I follow what was said by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Galloway). We need an inquiry that brings forward the truth, no matter what the consequences. Many of my constituents feel that there has been a war crime; they feel that there was an act of criminality involved. If there are consequences that lead to our own Nuremburg or to The Hague or whatever, let us at least explain to our people that we recognise that possibility, and we are willing to examine the issue, no matter what the consequences.</p>

 Further to the poignant arguments that my hon. Friend is making and that the House should consider, does he accept that some of us know John Chilcot, and we know that if he is put in charge of deciding whether something is public or private, depending on national security, he has an elastic concept of national security? He stretches it to cover many things, and in the past has stretched it to cover up many things.</p>

 In today&#146;s debate we have gone beyond the examination of the individuals appointed to conduct the inquiry. So many doubts have been expressed across the House about the individuals who have been selected that the Prime Minister should convene a meeting of the leaders of the various parties to see whether we can gain consensus about the composition. Yes, I agree with hon. Members who have argued that the terms of reference should be determined not by the party leaders, but by the House.</p>

To restore that, we need to start again. I repeat the request of my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock. This is the last hour that we have to restore the credibility of the House and give some credibility to the process of examination of the issue of Iraq. I appeal to Ministers to withdraw the Government&#146;s proposals. Whether by accepting the Opposition motion or not, the Government should say tonight that they will start again, involving all parties in an open and properly transparent process of arriving at a new inquiry that will have the confidence of the House and the country.</p>

 As I look around the Chamber, I see that I am probably the junior Member. Today Members have made some of the most powerful and incisive speeches that I have heard in the more than three years I have been here, and that shows the importance of the decision to go to war with Iraq. I have considered why I came to this House, and the main reason is that I could not get 55,000 people into the Chamber. So I have come on their behalf, to express their views and concerns.</p>

But I cannot accept the fact that the policy of the Government is being made by people who are not elected to the House. The Government came here and made a statement on the Iraq inquiry, which they said would be in private, and someone unelected then changed the mind of the Prime Minister. That cannot be right.</p>

However, the inquiry has been on the books for a considerable time. For the sake of a few more days, we must hold fire and allow the House to make the decision on the composition, remit and powers of the inquiry. If we do not, its very legitimacy will be lost. That legitimacy is needed to put at rest the minds of the families of those who have been killed and injured, and for the sake of the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi people who died during the war. We must make sure that the inquiry has the legitimacy of public debate.</p>

But I would rather that the press had a field day with a public inquiry than made things up because the inquiry was held in private.

That must be the main focus of the inquiry, but many of my constituents are concerned also about the strategy of the war and the fact that we had no exit strategy. We did not really know how we would leave Iraq, and in fact there is still a lot of answering to be done about that.</p>

 It is a pleasure to speak at the end of this important debate. Right hon. and hon. Members have made some powerful arguments, to which I hope the Government have listened. I wish to place on record my concern about what the outcome of the inquiry will be, because some basic schoolboy errors have been made in Iraq that we could learn from. We do not need an inquiry to understand where mistakes have been made, but we are now leaning on one to tell us that. I wonder why the Government are not learning some of the lessons that could already have been put into effect in other theatres of operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="90624-0019.htm_para10"><a name="09062494000086">For example, we know that the justification for going to war in the first place was based on what the Americans wanted to do. General Tommy Franks was told by President Bush to make preparations for a potential war in Iraq back in November 2001, when he was in charge of the United States Central Command, having just succeeded in launching the invasion in Afghanistan. We know that the evidence of weapons of mass destruction was based on a single source, an Iraqi chemical officer who went into a German refugee camp. That was never authorised or seconded, but it ended up being translated into the claim of the existence of tactical weapons that could be used in 45 minutes and possibly hit Cyprus.</p>

It allowed us to return to a previous resolution, resolution 678, written 11 years earlier in 1990, to allow the use of force. Huge mistakes were made, and I hope that the inquiry will pull them out. We walked blindly into a war with Iraq, which turned out to be a massive distraction from another operation that had already started, in Afghanistan, which is still ongoing.</p>

Once the decision to go to Iraq was made, I was astonished to learn&#151;but pleased with the honesty of the right hon.

I have had a discussion with General Robin Brims, the commander of 1 (UK) Armoured Division, who said that in April 2003 he went into the middle of Basra when the dust had settled and knew straight away that things were going to go pear-shaped. He knew that gangs would be formed and militias created, simply because there was a massive vacuum as there was no plan. He did not know what to do except watch very sadly as the security situation deteriorated.</p>

 Just to make this clear, I have not said that there were no plans. Detailed plans were made with the State Department, the UN and other international agencies. The hon. Gentleman is from the military. DFID and the humanitarian agencies cannot bring peace in an occupied territory&#151;that is a military job. I do not honour the attempt to pass over to the humanitarian agencies the responsibility for the chaos after the invasion.</p>

 The right hon. Lady is actually making my point for me. Whose responsibility is it to make peace? Is it the military&#146;s? The military provide the security on top of the hill. Something else has to happen in the village below, however, to ensure that the reconstruction takes place, that the schools are built and that the electricity is turned on&#151;all the things that are involved in nation building. That is not the role of the military, although I would like it to be; rather, it was the responsibility of DFID. The right hon. Lady admitted to sending a diktat to the directors in her Department saying, &#147;Do nothing. We&#146;re not even sure that this war is legal.&#148; I admire her consistency in the matter, but it does not help anybody in military uniform being sent over the start line by this Government then to realise that once the war fighting has stopped, we do not have a plan to keep the peace.

By 2007, the situation had deteriorated so much that we had become part of the problem. We went from liberators to occupiers. A personal friend of mine who was leading 2nd Battalion the Rifles was made to leave Basra palace with his tail between his legs because he had become part of the problem. He had to return to the comfort of the air base, never to participate in proper patrolling again. Why? Because we did not have the plan for peace. That is the big lesson to be learned by the Government, but we do not need an inquiry to learn it. That is the point that I am stressing. I am afraid that we are making exactly the same mistakes in Afghanistan.</p>

General Petraeus has said that it is no longer good enough simply to defeat the enemy; we have to go further and enable the local. Until we get that into our heads, we will continue to fail as we are doing.</p>

post-conflict stabilisation operations. As we have heard, DFID does not do that either. DFID does what it says on the tin: it tackles poverty. There is therefore a huge void that needs to be filled if we want not only to win wars, but to win the peace as well. At the moment, we are winning wars but losing the peacekeeping. Those are the lessons that we can learn without the need for an inquiry.</p>

I would like a huge overhaul of the way in which we approach post-conflict operations. It is no good trying to get soldiers to maintain a level of security when they see the demise of the infrastructure around them, with nobody willing to step forward and do the job.

 My hon. Friend is making a powerful case, with which I strongly agree.

 My hon. Friend makes such a valid point. That is the level of detail that needs to be looked at. It is not just the justice system that is important, however; it is the training of the police and the armed forces. Who is doing that now? Our armed forces are doing it, because of an absence of anybody else. Let us bite the bullet and recognise that our military are in the best place to do that. Our Royal Engineers are capable of making the roads and rebuilding the schools and so forth. They are capable of showing the locals that they mean business&#151;that they want to help and then to go home.

Yes, of course, it would help; but boy, we could have learned those lessons many moons ago. I am pleased to see the Secretary of State for Defence in the Chamber now. I stress that we need to wake up to our capability and to what we are doing. The Americans have done so, but we have not. Until we do so, we will struggle to win these campaigns after the war fighting has finished.</p>

I hope that these blatant errors will be recognised and acknowledged by the inquiry so that lessons can be learned, although I am afraid that some of the errors are already being repeated in Afghanistan.

 I have been present at virtually every debate on Iraq for the past seven years. I never thought that, seven years on we would still be debating the legality of, and responsibility for, the war, and how to conduct a proper investigation into it. The image of Parliament has suffered enormously over the past few weeks&#151;nay, the past few months. If we fudge this issue tonight and decline to hold the kind of open, public, legally based, oath-taking, subpoenaed inquiry that is required, yes, there will be a report&#151;some kind of bowdlerised version of what happened will be produced by a group of Privy Counsellors, and everyone will go away and say, &#147;That&#146;s fine&#148;&#151;but the demand for an inquiry will still be there, culpability will still be sought and the responsibility will still rest on those people who took us into the conflict.

The 1 million and more people who came to London on that day in 2003&#151;and the millions more around the country who attended local demonstrations, wrote to their MPs, sent e-mails, signed petitions or simply expressed an opinion against the war&#151;felt very let down by Parliament on that occasion. They also felt very let down by the political system, and a whole generation of young people have now been radicalised to question the effectiveness of this place and to wonder what is the point of a political system that can take us into a war that turns out to be illegal and then blinker its eyes to the consequences. We need to take some serious decisions tonight.</p>

During the activities of the Stop the War Coalition, I have had the good fortune to meet many military families who have joined Military Families Against the War.

Nevertheless, there is such a concept and it revolves around the UN charter, a real and credible threat to an individual country, and the UN itself. If resolution 1441, as we were told later, gave us the authority to go to war, why did the Foreign Secretary and others put such great effort into getting a second UN resolution that was then not possible?

I suspect that we might be getting the opposite, which is an inquiry with terms of reference that allow it to operate in secret and on Privy Council rules, that do not give it the power of subpoena or inquisition, and that do not give it the power to point to the legal responsibility for going to war.</p>

 This has been an excellent debate, and has featured some outstanding contributions. A wide range of issues have been discussed: the terms of reference, the question of oaths, the question of public versus private hearings, the membership of the committee, blame apportionment, and the concept of an interim report.</p>

The time frame now goes back to 2001, and we welcome that. If we are to believe what we have heard today, most of the committee&#146;s deliberations will now take place in public; private hearings will be held only when national security is involved.</p>

Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) said that the inquiry would be in disarray, and that if it did not command all-party support in this House it would be difficult for it to command respect in the country.

A number of speakers drew attention to the contrast with what happened in the case of the Franks report. The Prime Minister has had limited contacts with other political leaders and Committee Chairmen. With an important issue such as this&#151;on which there has been genuine division in the country, mirrored by division here in Parliament&#151;consensus is all the more important, but the Prime Minister seems to have lacked the personal capability, humility and skills to seek consensus on such a momentous issue. Perhaps that is the fatal character flaw that condemns his Government to ultimate defeat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="90624-0020.htm_para6"><a name="09062494000121">One of the key questions that raised a great deal of passion was the basis on which evidence should be given. There was an interesting and, indeed, passionate discussion of whether it should be given under oath. I must confess that, having listened to a number of learned Members setting out their rather different cases, I am not entirely sure what the legal status of oaths would be in the inquiry as it is currently proposed. The Minister should clarify that. There was widespread concern&#151;including that expressed by the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)&#151;that unless evidence was given under oath, the credibility of the inquiry itself could be fatally undermined. Having heard strong feelings in the House, what do the Government intend to do? They have changed their minds on a number of other issues over the past nine days.</p>

We have now seen a U-turn&#151;a welcome U-turn, it must be said&#151;not least because of the motion that we tabled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="90624-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09062494000124">The most impressive speech was made by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell), who listed a number of substantial questions that the inquiry should consider. He pointed out that many of the most politically controversial issues did not involve national security and could therefore be discussed in public, and that there was absolutely no reason other than the politics for that not to happen.</p>

She asked whether Sir John Chilcot had been consulted in advance of the Prime Minister&#146;s statement. The Foreign Secretary replied that Sir John had had no objection to the Prime Minister&#146;s statement, but that in the light of the Prime Minister&#146;s subsequent letter it had been decided to hold some more public hearings.

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="90624-0020.htm_para13"><a name="09062494000130">The committee is, after all, looking into a war&#151;its conduct, its manning and equipment, and the tactics employed. It will also have to look at the interaction between our war-fighting capability and our reconstruction capability. If it has no senior military membership, how can it fully interpret the military evidence given to it? For example, we have had inquests into the deaths of service personnel that have put the blame on the late procurement of body armour. The inference was that that occurred late because the Secretary of State at the time did not want to send a political signal that the Government had already decided to embark on war in Iraq. Few more serious charges than that can be levelled at a Minister or Government. Those issues will have to be dealt with very clearly and forensically in the inquiry, because we need to learn lessons as we are still at war in Afghanistan.</p>

There are lessons that we need to learn from the events that led up to Operation Charge of the Knights in Basra about how we handled intelligence and how it was interpreted. To summarise, those who were there say that, ultimately, the decision was that we were &#147;in Palermo, not Beirut&#148;; in other words, we were dealing with criminality rather than insurgency. We know, however, that the intelligence coming upwards was that it was an Iranian-inspired, religious-driven insurgency, so how did we come to the conclusion that we reached? How did we get ourselves into that corner? Was it the result of a failure to interpret intelligence? If so, we must be very concerned about that for Afghanistan. Or was there in any way some interference with the process, so that the conclusion that was reached was the one that was most favourable  <br>

Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) made an impassioned plea for there to be one or more political figures on the committee. As he said, it was politicians in this House who voted to go to war in Iraq, so we are intrinsically involved by our own actions and decisions. It would at the least be of benefit to have senior figures on the committee who understand how government works and how decisions are taken, if the committee is to make a proper evaluation of the evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="90624-0020.htm_para16"><a name="09062494000133">We were told that no MPs would be on the committee because we would be partisan. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) said in his opening speech, the members who have been named already are hardly disinterested bystanders. Sir Lawrence Freedman has written extensively on the war in Iraq, and Sir Roderic Lyne has not only commentated on the war but was involved in the efforts to secure a second United Nations resolution ahead of the war. These are not non-partisan, disinterested figures. If they are not, why are Members of Parliament being excluded from the process, when we are the ones who carry the can for the decision that was taken by the vote?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="90624-0020.htm_para17"><a name="09062494000134">There was a lot of debate about whether we should have an interim report, and there is a widespread belief that the timing of that report is designed to minimise adverse comment about current or former Labour Ministers during a general election period. As the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife pointed out, this Government and Prime Minister seem incapable of distinguishing between Government embarrassment and the national interest. There is no reason why we cannot have an interim report or reports, depending on how it is carried out. The House needs to be given an assurance tonight that the committee will be able to issue such reports during the course of its deliberations, if it believes that it is in the public interest to do so.</p>

Today the Foreign Secretary gave us a new line, when he said that the inquiry could praise or blame anyone it likes. That is another U-turn, and one for the Minister to confirm when he speaks.</p>

through the debate. It was well expressed by the hon. Member for Cannock Chase and it echoed from Carmarthen, Billericay and Torridge and West Devon. It was that this House should have ownership of the terms of reference of this inquiry, not the Prime Minister.

 As my hon. Friend says, the inquiry needs to be independent, and, in the way that it is structured, it will be independent. It will have the force of that independence and it will get at the facts.

His speech was long on critique, but short on substantive differences with the Government on where we are today. He acknowledged that, since a week ago on Monday, the Government have consulted; he said that we had listened and that the outcome was what he had been calling for. If the accusation is that, as a Government, we have listened and moved, I plead guilty. I make no apology for saying that. I say that because the inquiry  <br>

 Let me make some progress, then I will give way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90624-0021.htm_para0"><a name="09062494000161">I ask those of my hon. Friends who might be considering voting against the Government to look at the Opposition&#146;s motion and our amendment. There is very little difference between the two. The only substantive difference&#151;we are both now talking in terms of openness&#151;is that the Opposition call for a wider and more diverse membership for the inquiry. There are arguments for and against that. I ask my hon. Friends whether that difference is worth defeating the Government this evening. I do not believe that it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="90624-0021.htm_para1"><a name="09062494000162">On the question of the oath, I understand the House&#146;s concern. That is why the Prime Minister asked Chilcot to look at the matter. In his letter of 21 June, Chilcot said:</p>
<a name="90624-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="09062494001382"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I will indeed, as you suggest, examine how best, given the non-judicial nature of the inquiry, a formal undertaking can be given by witnesses that their contributions will be complete, truthful and accurate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="90624-0021.htm_para2"><a name="09062494000163">It is clear that the Prime Minister understands the concern and that Chilcot gets it and is seeking a way to deliver. I think that we should support him on that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o383"><a name="09062494000164"><a name="90624-0021.htm_spnew1"><a name="09062494001453"><b>Andrew Mackinlay:</b>
 But there is no way to deliver that. The Prime Minister knows that, Chilcot knows it and anyone in this House with a bit of brain knows it too. Without a statutory base, there is no way that the oath can be administered so that a person who abrogates it commits perjury. The Minister knows that, I know that, so take it back.</p>

<p><a name="st_o384"><a name="09062494000165"><a name="90624-0021.htm_spnew2"><a name="09062494001454"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 With the greatest respect, I must tell my hon. Friend that the problem with a statutory judicial inquiry, based on the experience that we all know, is that it would take years. It would involve legal representation for every witness and cost hundreds of millions of pounds, and it would not get to the answers that people are looking for.</p>

<p><a name="st_o385"><a name="09062494000166"><a name="90624-0021.htm_spnew3"><a name="09062494001455"><b>Sir Menzies Campbell:</b>
 If the House resolves to give the inquiry the authority to compel witnesses and to put them on oath, that is exercisable against any witness. Why is the House not being asked to provide that safeguard, so that the inquiry commands public confidence?</p>

<p><a name="st_o386"><a name="09062494000167"><a name="90624-0021.htm_spnew4"><a name="09062494001456"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 In all the debates that we have had on this matter in recent months, the Franks inquiry has been cited as the model for getting to the heart of these matters. That is certainly what the Opposition argued, but that inquiry was not conducted with witnesses under oath. No one has argued either plausibly or persuasively this evening that the absence of the oath prevented that inquiry from getting at the truth. Nevertheless, we have asked Sir John Chilcot to look at the matter.</p>

 I think that we are making unnecessarily heavy weather of this. We have made enormous progress and consensus is within our grasp. All that my hon. Friend the Minister has to say is that, having learned the lessons of the consultations with Sir John Chilcot, he or the Foreign Secretary will come back to the House to announce the formal terms of reference for the inquiry and how it will be conducted. If he were to say  <br>

that, and those points were to be incorporated in a substantive motion, he would carry the whole House with him.</p>

 I know that my hon. Friend is not driven by partisanship on this issue, and he makes a very reasonable case. We have to vote this evening on the motion before us, but we will report back to the House once those consultations and deliberations have taken place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="90624-0021.htm_para3"><a name="09062494000170">I turn now to the arguments advanced by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews). He made some very serious accusations about the Government&#146;s conduct in the run-up to war, saying that the Government had deliberately misled and deceived the House. I was a Foreign Office Minister during the run-up to the war. I was not looking at the dossier, but I did look at the raw intelligence almost daily. I was persuaded by that to the extent that my biggest fear as we went to war was that chemical weapons would be used on our troops in Iraq. I would not have reached that conclusion unless I found the evidence persuasive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="90624-0021.htm_para4"><a name="09062494000171">The conspiracy theorists say that this was all a plot and that we misled people. Yes, the intelligence on which we formed our views was wrong, but the intelligence of every advanced intelligence agency in the world&#151;even in those countries opposed to the war&#151;reflected the same view and conviction.</p>

<p><a name="st_o389"><a name="09062494000172"><a name="90624-0021.htm_spnew7"><a name="09062494001459"><b>Mr. Duncan Smith:</b>
 May I return the Minister to the central issue? It is not about the war itself, but about how we inquire into it. Whether one is in favour of it or not, the reality is that the Minister must come back to the House with a substantive motion, as the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) said. Sir John Chilcot could be told to do everything that we have described, but is it not important the he gets a vote from us? Does it not matter to him whether the inquiry gets the endorsement of the House of Commons?</p>

<p><a name="st_o390"><a name="09062494000173"><a name="90624-0021.htm_spnew8"><a name="09062494001460"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 Over the past 10 days, we have genuinely listened to the views and criticisms expressed. We have rightly moved, and Members now have opportunity to make a judgment on that. That is why we are having a vote, and I urge Members to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="90624-0021.htm_para5"><a name="09062494000174">The right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) said that we did not consult the armed forces. That is emphatically not true. The Chief of the Defence Staff, as the head of the armed forces, was consulted and was content with the form of the inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="st_o391"><a name="09062494000175"><a name="90624-0021.htm_spnew9"><a name="09062494001461"><b>Sir Malcolm Rifkind:</b>
 The Minister says that the Government have been in listening mode and that they want to go along with the armed forces, so will he now accept the overwhelming view on both sides of the House that someone with a military background should be a full member of the committee of inquiry? If he is not prepared to accept that, will he explain why not?</p>

<p><a name="st_o392"><a name="09062494000176"><a name="90624-0021.htm_spnew10"><a name="09062494001462"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 Because I believe that there is sufficient expertise on the committee of inquiry. Sir John Chilcot has made it clear that some military experts will come forward both to give advice to the committee and to question witnesses. If we put that alongside the expertise and experience of the members of the committee, I believe that we have a basis of a way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="90624-0021.htm_para6"><a name="09062494000177">In conclusion, the inquiry we propose closely matches what the Opposition and many hon. Members have asked for. The Opposition have consistently called for an independent Franks-style inquiry. The inquiry we propose is modelled on Franks, but it goes further. The Opposition have called for Parliament to have the opportunity to debate the findings of the inquiry, which is precisely what we have proposed. However, the Prime Minister has rightly granted significant discretion to the chairman of the inquiry and has specified that the inquiry should be conducted in a way that delivers maximum candour, openness and efficiency, and maintains full public confidence while avoiding damage to national security. The Prime Minister also made it clear&#151;rightly, in my view&#151;that Sir John and his colleagues should be able to decide how best to achieve that.</p>

 Having started on the basis that we did, the Prime Minister and the Government, as I have said, have rightly listened to arguments about hearing evidence in public. That is why the Prime Minister asked Sir John Chilcot to consider evidence being heard in public, and Sir John has now stated that as many of the proceedings as possible will be held in public. We strongly welcome that. That has been the major point of contention in the debate of the past 10 days, and the Government have listened and moved on it, so I urge Members to support us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="90624-0021.htm_para8"><a name="09062494000183">A number of Members have asked whether the inquiry will have access to all Government papers. I can confirm that that will be the case, to ensure that we get to the bottom of the matter. The inquiry has as wide a remit as possible to enable it to get at the facts. The inquiry is tasked to look at the totality of our engagement in Iraq over an eight-year period, and it has a far broader remit than any remotely comparable inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="90624-0021.htm_para9"><a name="09062494000184">As I said earlier, this is not about indictment, although if blame is to be apportioned, it will be. The fundamental issue before the House, and before the inquiry, is that it is crucial to the future conduct of our operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere that we genuinely learn the lessons from the conflict in Iraq. I believe we have the ability to do that.</p>

 The debate provides me with an opportunity&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>After you have been congratulated again by the Members who are at the Chair, Mr. Speaker, the debate provides me with the opportunity to wish you well. I understand the congratulations, and I wish you well in your very difficult task and recognise the courage that you have displayed in taking it on. My job tonight, however, is to talk about assaults on taxi drivers and the need to protect them further than we might have done so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="90624-0022.htm_para11"><a name="09062494001335">I set the scene by pointing out that violence against taxi drivers has increased sizeably over the past decade. To be fair to the Government, they have recognised that on a number of occasions. I might add, however, that the increase is linked&#151;there is now some evidence of the linkage&#151;with the rise in late-night drinking in our major town centres, given the unsociable hours that taxi drivers work and the fact that people come out of clubs at 3 or 4 o&#146;clock in the morning and then spend perhaps another half an hour in the kebab house before seeking a taxi. Those two factors are important in the increase in violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="90624-0022.htm_para12"><a name="09062494001336">I do not need to tell the Minister about the vital importance of taxis to the transport industry. However, that importance is not well understood by many in local government. For instance, five or six years ago, Northamptonshire county council undertook a multi-modal study costing some &#163;750,000. It might surprise the Minister to know that taxis were not included in that study, yet we are talking about an industry that employs 340,000 people. The latest figures to hand show that there are 71,500 Hackney cab drivers and more than 250,000 private-hire drivers. The industry makes about 700 million taxi journeys a year, which means an average of roughly 11 journeys for each member of the population. About &#163;3 billion is spent on fares each year. We are therefore talking about a sizeable industry that plays a major role in our public transportation. It is important to recognise that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="90624-0022.htm_para13"><a name="09062494001337">I do not need to tell the Minister that taxi drivers are often alone with their customers in their cabs, and are therefore highly vulnerable. We need to bear that in mind quite seriously. Taxi drivers work on the front line of transportation and in the late hours, not least because no other transportation is available then. Their customers are unknown to them and they often pick them up in the very dimmest of light. Whereas the Minister and I might be able to spot an undesirable customer in the light of day, it is difficult for taxi drivers to do that.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090624/debtext/90624-0023.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para0"><a name="09062494001338">Taxi drivers also take home groups of more than one person. Late at night, their customers are often the worse for drink. Those are difficult circumstances for any service provider to deal with customers in. Taxi drivers carry out a vital function in some of the most difficult circumstances that we might imagine, and they pay a price. Taxi drivers are under attack. The figures are not only clear; they are quite horrifying. There were 51 murders in the private-hire and Hackney cab industry over a 15-year period, which means an average of a little over three a year. That is a frightening figure in an  <br>

industry that is about providing a service during antisocial hours to a customer base that often has no alternative. In truth, that might be a comment on our society, although it is not my purpose to talk about that this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para1"><a name="09062494001339">Let me give some examples of taxi drivers who were murdered. In May 2006, 37-year-old Mahmood Ahmed, a family man, was found stabbed to death in a country lane in Keighley. The post-mortem revealed that he had been hit hard on the head with a blunt instrument from behind&#151;that is an important fact. In May 2007, in Gravesham, Kent, a 70-year-old grandfather, Gian Chand Bajar, was attacked and had the proceeds of that evening&#146;s work stolen. The attackers then took his taxi by force, ran over him and left him to die in the street. He died in hospital, and his car was found abandoned, having been set on fire, a mile from the site of the attack. In 2005, Mr. Colin Winstone, aged 44 and from Bristol, was found dead after being stabbed outside the Old Fox Inn at Easton, Bristol. Those three cases illuminate the fact that these are family people doing an important job, who meet a violent end that horrifies us all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para2"><a name="09062494001340">In addition to murders, there are thousands of attacks. Only last month in the Halifax area, a taxi driver named Amjad Farooq, aged 35, was violently attacked. He sustained serious head injuries, was beaten unconscious, had his car stolen and was hospitalised for a considerable time. In June 2009&#151;only this month&#151;another driver, whose name I was unable to get, was robbed at knifepoint by three men in Burnage, Manchester. In November 2008, another taxi driver recovered at home after being struck over the head with what was believed to have been a handgun. He was attacked by two men in Normanton, Derby, who then drove off in his taxi.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para3"><a name="09062494001341">Those are just three examples&#151;six altogether, including the murders that I have mentioned&#151;of the thousands of incidents that are inflicted on taxi drivers every year. I would like to make the point that race is a major factor in this issue. Although only one third of the trade&#146;s drivers are from our ethnic minority communities, two thirds of the attacks are on people from those communities. I know that the Minister does not need me to underline that point to him, as he is aware of it and understands the horror of that aspect of these crimes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para4"><a name="09062494001342">Sadly, taxi drivers lack faith in justice system, and many attacks are not reported. A survey carried out in Portsmouth in 2008 showed that, of the 396 drivers who responded, 60 per cent. had been a victim of crime in the past 12 months. It also showed that 70 per cent. admitted not reporting incidents to the police, and that the most common reason for that was that they did not think the police would be interested. We need to take that on board. Rightly or wrongly, that is the general impression that people have, and we have to deal with that. We cannot afford to have a sizeable part of our community believing that the police are not interested. Action needs to be taken in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para5"><a name="09062494001343">As I have said, taxi drivers do not have faith in the justice system. Equally, the evidence suggests that, in certain parts of the country, the relationship between police and taxi drivers is simply not good enough. That is a pretty disturbing indictment, yet that is what the evidence shows. I fear that we are not in a position to refute it, but we are in a position to try to do something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o513"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para6"><a name="09062494001344">The cost to the nation of dealing with attacks on taxi drivers is remarkably high. The estimated cost of investigating the 51 murders over 15 years was &#163;77.7 million. The cost of each investigation of violence against a person in relation to taxi drivers was &#163;3,036 for each attack. That is quite a lot of money but, bearing in mind the crime, it is a price that we have to pay. It is, however, a price that we would wish not to pay. I know that the Minister feels the same. If we add social security and loss of earnings, the total cost to the country over those 15 years is sizeable. I have been given a figure, but I think that it is a mistake, so I shall not read it out, because I do not want it to go on the record. A sizeable amount is involved, nevertheless, and we need to take that into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o514"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para7"><a name="09062494001345">There is action that we can take to help taxi drivers. There is a need for automatic protection between taxi drivers and their customers. That means screens in hire cars. Screens could be purchased to stop attacks from the rear, which is where many attacks emanate from in non-Hackney cab taxis. There would be a double benefit because, sadly, there are reports of unwanted sexual approaches made to young ladies late in the night and screens would stop that happening. There are good social reasons to encourage a simple answer for authorities that give licences to taxi cabs, and it would be easy to introduce a requirement to ensure that screens were fitted in non-Hackney taxi cabs&#151;if we were willing to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para8"><a name="09062494001346">In March, Mr. Bryan Roland, general secretary of the Private Hire Association, fully endorsed in an open letter Safe Shield or shield-type products in cabs for those very reasons. However, and surprisingly, some councils will not permit the use of screens. That is quite remarkable. The Minister looks quizzical, but that is the information I have. I will write to him about it, although I am glad that he was as surprised as I was when I learned of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para9"><a name="09062494001347">Screens are an aid to cutting violence against taxi drivers, as is CCTV. In Sheffield, a local taxi company had problems with assaults on its drivers. Over Christmas 2006, it suffered 400 incidents of violence. It was so worried that it paid for in-car cameras&#151;an expensive exercise. The result? In 2007, only six incidents occurred. What a tremendous deterrent and a 98.5 per cent. reduction on the previous year thanks to CCTV. In Blackburn, Lancashire, there were 140 crimes&#151;one for every five such vehicles on the road. Fourteen cars were fitted with CCTV equipment as part of a pilot scheme, with council help. That increased security for drivers and passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o517"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para10"><a name="09062494001348">There are ways to deal with these problems, therefore, and the London Taxi Network is another. The Minister will know that 4,500 London taxi drivers signed up to Dial-a-Cab and Radio Taxis Group, which provided enhanced security. I could go on. He will also know about the Taxi Marshals scheme. It is another way in which local authorities in particular can help in this respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o518"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para11"><a name="09062494001349">I bring your attention, Mr. Speaker, to an Adjournment debate that I held on this very subject on 1 May 2008. On the point about CCTV, I said:</p>
<a name="90624-0023.htm_brev0"><a name="09062494001395"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There are problems, however. The units cost between &#163;700 and &#163;1,000 a car, and we know that most taxi drivers are self-employed and do not have that sort of capital. I am told that the cost of production is only &#163;80 and that the rest is maintenance and back-up.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 1 May 2008; Vol. 475, c. 547.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o519"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para12"><a name="09062494001350">I asked whether the Government would look into that. I did not receive an answer at the time, so I hope the Minister can come back with information that would be encouraging to taxi drivers vis- -vis the cost and perhaps with ways that we can help to encourage the purchase of CCTV cameras.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o520"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para13"><a name="09062494001351">A year ago, I asked the Minister who responded to the debate about local authorities encouraging the use of screens. It might almost be in the Government&#146;s thinking to say that screens ought to be fitted as a basic requirement in non-Hackney cab taxis. Will this Minister be kind enough to come back to me on that issue?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para14"><a name="09062494001352">I ask the Minister to consider ways to improve relationships between taxi drivers and the police, if only to get rid of the perception among taxi drivers that the police do not care. Perhaps the police could do a little more to protect both the safety of taxicab customers and, equally important, that of their drivers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o522"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para15"><a name="09062494001353">As I said at the beginning of my speech, I feel that the Government have a responsibility. The drinking laws changed, and the House quite properly accepted that, but that change has had results with which most other people must be unhappy. We must address the side-effects of the increasing late-night drinking in our towns and cities, which has led to more attacks on taxis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o523"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para16"><a name="09062494001354">I believe that taxi drivers seek real and meaningful answers and, perhaps, action from the Government. I hope that the Government will be able to give us some reassurance, and give the taxi drivers who serve our community in such an important way a little confidence that we may do a bit more to minimise a problem that is clearly of great import to their industry.</p>

 I join the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) in welcoming you to your new position, Mr. Speaker. We both look forward to catching your eye on many occasions in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o524"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para17"><a name="09062494001356">I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for initiating the annual event at which he rightly holds the Government to account on the serious issue of what we are doing about the safety of taxi drivers. I think it important for him to do so. I read the <i> Hansard </i>report of last year&#146;s debate on the subject, and I have news of some of the progress that we have made over the past 12 months. In preparation for the debate, I not only did the usual things such as speaking to officials but read a couple of editions of <i> Private Hire and Taxi Monthly</i>, which includes a section in which victims of the assaults referred to by the hon. Gentleman describe what happened to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o525"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para18"><a name="09062494001357">The debate is of interest not only to people who work as taxi and private hire vehicle drivers, but to all who are concerned with the safety of people who work in the transport sector. It is truly appalling that drivers who are, after all, providing a service for the public should be fearful about the prospect of getting through the working day unscathed, or, worse still, should have to endure abuse or violence. That is why we are keen to do what we can to help. I hope that once the hon. Gentleman has heard what I have to say about the progress made last year he will, with renewed vigour, ensure that this is an annual event, so that he can take us to task and make us go even further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o526"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para19"><a name="09062494001358">We have now published the findings of our national research on the personal security of taxi and private hire vehicle drivers. Reading the <i> Hansard </i>report of last year&#146;s debate, I noted the frustration that the hon. Gentleman experienced in trying simply to obtain an executive summary of the research. It was particularly depressing to note from that research that Asian and other ethnic-minority drivers appear to have been subject to higher levels of abuse, much of which is racist in content. It was equally depressing to note that very few such incidents are reported to the police. I shall say more about that later, but let me now pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for highlighting the fact that a disproportionate number of victims are from ethnic minorities. There is no reason at all why they should suffer more than anyone else. No one should suffer as a result of crime, irrespective of ethnicity or faith.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o527"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para20"><a name="09062494001359">Although the report has assisted our understanding of the issues, we have also undertaken a constructive initiative to help taxi and private hire vehicle drivers to enhance their own personal security. We have prepared and published guidance for drivers, in a convenient leaflet form, on measures that they can take in order to stay safe. In recognition of the differences between the trades, we published two separate leaflets, one for taxi drivers and one for private hire vehicle drivers. We distributed many thousands of copies through local licensing authorities to ensure that every taxi and PHV driver in the country could have one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o528"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para21"><a name="09062494001360">The principle underlying the leaflets is that those who serve the travelling public are entitled to do their work in safety and without abuse. The leaflets include practical advice on how to reduce the risk of violence, and also identify action that should be taken to deal with threatening behaviour and attacks. They were drawn up with the help of the taxi and private hire vehicle trades. That is an example of our consulting rather than imposing our own ideas and solutions. We have also published guidance for crime and disorder reduction partnerships on ways in which they can work with the transport industry&#151;including the taxi and private hire vehicle trades&#151;to help to reduce crime and the fear of crime. That includes attempting to reduce the number of assaults on taxi and private hire vehicle drivers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o529"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para22"><a name="09062494001361">The best practice guidance that the Department produces on taxi and private hire vehicle licensing is a useful tool in assisting local licensing authorities in drawing up suitable licensing policies. The hon. Gentleman referred to some initiatives, including the installation in cabs of measures to improve drivers&#146; personal security, such as CCTV or having a screen between the driver and the passenger. The guidance urged local authorities to look into that, which is why I was surprised that the hon. Gentleman mentioned an example of a council discouraging it, and I want to investigate that and write to him about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o530"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para23"><a name="09062494001362">We are now consulting on a revised version of the guidance. We propose that it should encourage local licensing authorities to draw up signs or notices that drivers could display in their cabs setting out what passengers can expect from drivers and what drivers should be able to expect from passengers. That is a new initiative, which we hope will appeal to local licensing authorities&#151;and to such an extent that they will want to produce their own notices in consultation with the local trade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o531"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para24"><a name="09062494001363">We know that fare disputes are a major cause of potential confrontation between passengers and drivers&#151;a reading of the trade journals highlights that. We would hope that the advice in the leaflets, together with any local notices that licensing authorities decide to produce, will lead to a reduction in the number of such disputes. On the subject of fares, the hon. Gentleman will be pleased to learn that we are in discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers on ways to raise awareness of the legal position on &#147;bilking&#148;&#151;the commonly used term for passengers making off without paying their fare. As a number of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s friends are taxi drivers, he will know that that is a big issue in the industry, and a source of huge tension. We hope ACPO will be able to help in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o532"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para25"><a name="09062494001364">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that we have taken a number of actions to reduce the number of assaults on taxi and private hire vehicle drivers. However, we are not complacent, which is why it is important that he continues to hold us to account. We know that far too many drivers are still putting up with verbal, and, indeed, physical, abuse far too often&#151;let alone the murders to which the hon. Gentleman has referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o533"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para26"><a name="09062494001365">I believe that the key to reducing the number of assaults is effective partnership-working at local level. The taxi and private hire vehicle trades need to work with the local police, licensing authorities and community safety partnerships to highlight their concerns and to seek suitable solutions. That may lead to the funding of in-car CCTV cameras, for example, or shields between the driver and the passenger compartment, or to the deployment of taxi marshals at taxi rank hot spots. I know that Northampton has taxi marshals, so the hon. Gentleman will be aware of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o534"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para27"><a name="09062494001366">I know that there are a number of such initiatives around the country, and I urge the trade to learn the lessons from the good practice that already exists, and also to be aware of the potential sources of funding for security measures. That could be local authority funding, community safety partnership funding or even&#151;the hon. Gentleman will enjoy this&#151;EU funding. We must not cut off any funding routes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o535"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para28"><a name="09062494001367">It should be borne in mind that the sort of measures that would enhance drivers&#146; personal security might also have a beneficial effect on passenger safety. For example, a lone female at a city centre taxi rank in the early hours of the morning might appreciate the role of a taxi marshal in maintaining order at the rank, and the use of CCTV and security shields in saloon car taxis and private hire vehicles might provide passengers with an added degree of reassurance&#151;a point made by the hon. Gentleman in his excellent speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o536"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para29"><a name="09062494001368">I reiterate what I said in last year&#146;s Adjournment debate about violence against taxi and private hire vehicle drivers: those in that trade should report all incidents to the police and the appropriate local community safety forums. The report that I mentioned earlier made it clear that many incidents go unreported to the police, and that is a tremendous shame. I recognise that reporting incidents means time away from work, and some may fear reprisals, but non-reporting also means that the police can be unaware of the type and scale of the problems that drivers face. I accept that the police need to redouble their efforts to win the trust and confidence of taxi drivers, as they have done in other areas of our society, so that more crime is reported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o537"><a name="90624-0023.htm_para30"><a name="09062494001369">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that progress has been made since last year, but that there is no magic silver bullet or panacea that will solve these problems. It is a terrible shame that we live in a society in which people still think that they can abuse taxi drivers verbally or physically and get away without sanction from the criminal justice system. We look forward to working further with the trade, the police, local licensing authorities, the Home Office and the hon. Gentleman to ensure that we can find solutions to some of the challenges that he poses. I again congratulate him and thank him for raising these important issues.</p>
