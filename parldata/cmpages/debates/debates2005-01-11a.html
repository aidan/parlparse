 (Lab): If he will make a statement on the operation of the welfare to work forum in Glasgow.  [207428]
</p>



<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50111-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Scotland  (Mr. Alistair Darling): </b> 
 The Government&#039;s measures, such as the new deal, have been very successful in moving people from welfare into work. However, more needs to be done and we will continue to work with the Glasgow welfare to work forum, as well as with others.
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50111-01_spnew0"><b> Ann McKechin: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend will be aware of the ambitious plans of the welfare to work forum to create 30,000&nbsp;jobs in the city by the end of 2010. Given the current favourable economic conditions and, as reported in this month&#039;s <i>Insider</i> magazine, the massive growth in profits of the top 500&nbsp;companies in Scotland, I believe those plans are achievable, but it will require the closest co-operation between all public agencies&#151;here at Westminster, the local authorities and the Scottish Executive. Can my right hon. Friend assure me that his Department will be actively involved in working with the forum to achieve success for Glasgow?
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50111-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Yes, I can. My hon. Friend is right: what is striking about the forum in Glasgow is the common interest between not only public bodies and others with a long history of trying to help people get into work, but also private sector companies, because they realise that it is in their interest that we expand the work force so that we have more people available for work. It is worth bearing in mind what has happened over the past few years with the new deal: in Glasgow, nearly 5,500&nbsp;lone parents, 1,400&nbsp;adults, more than 25,000&nbsp;people with disability and 1,600&nbsp;people aged over 50&nbsp;have moved from welfare into work thanks to the new deal. Many other measures can be taken, but there is a big difference between 10&nbsp;or 15&nbsp;years ago, when the then Government either ignored unemployment or thought it an inevitable fact of life, and the situation today where there is universal determination to get as many people into work as possible.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50111-01_spnew2"><b> Sir Archy Kirkwood  (Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</b> 
 (LD): The Secretary of State is right to acknowledge the valuable work that has been done both through the active labour market policies promoted by the Government and through the forum, as was rightly raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Ann&nbsp;McKechin), but does he not think it slightly strange that training providers are not part of the forum? He is right to say that the commercial sector has a part to play, but there are no training providers on the forum itself. Furthermore, there is no flexibility about some of the funding streams. Up to &#163;90&nbsp;million may be available to the forum but there is little flexibility in how it can use much of that money. Would not access to training providers and more flexibility in the use of funding make the Glasgow welfare to work forum even more effective than it is now?
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50111-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I am sure that is something the forum would like to consider. I know that the hon. Gentleman, through his experience of chairing the Select Committee on Work and Pensions, will be well aware of the fact that the Department has shown itself open to looking at new ideas in relation to funding. Let me give him an example: the pathways to work programme, which has been very successful in pilot form in getting people into work, is being extended across the whole country and it will include Glasgow.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will continue to keep flexibility under review. The main thing, however, is to concentrate on getting as many people as possible into work, and, especially in Glasgow, the comparatively high number of people on incapacity benefit who really do need to be helped into work as quickly as possible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50111-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Marshall  (Glasgow, Shettleston)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that the foundation for the welfare to work forum is the tried and tested new deal? Is not it the case that the Liberals opposed the funding of the new deal and that the Tories will abolish it? In contrast to those shameful policies, will the Secretary of State ensure that the necessary resources continue to be made available to tackle the scourge of long-term unemployment and to provide education and training to the youngsters who so desperately need it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50111-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend. The new deal will remain the foundation of everything we do to help people into work. It is worth bearing in mind that employment in Scotland has risen by 174,000&nbsp;people since 1997. Many of us in Scotland remember what happened in the 1980s and the early 1990s when hundreds and thousands of people were condemned to unemployment, we had a second generation of people growing up who had no experience of work and there was precious little help from the then Government. As for the Liberals, my hon. Friend is right&#151;they are in favour of the new deal, but they were actually against the means of funding it, which is a typical Liberal attitude towards such matters.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 145</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>report entitled &quot;Riding the Benefits Roller-coaster&quot;, which raised serious concerns about the rigidity of the existing system for incapacity benefit and concluded that claimants fall between gaps in the system when their conditions change? What are the Government doing to help people on incapacity benefit get back to work rather than penalising them?
</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="50111-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 As I said just a few moments ago, the Department for Work and Pensions has piloted a programme known as pathways to work, which is specifically designed to help people who are on incapacity benefit to get into work. The pilot scheme has shown that it is much more successful than conventional programmes, precisely because it offers help that is tailored to individuals. I visited a scheme in Renfrewshire a few months ago, with the First Minister, and we met a number of people who had taken part in the pilot scheme and had been got back into work. They had been given help and assistance that they would not receive under conventional schemes. That all shows that, when a Government are determined to work with others to help people into work who, historically, have simply been dumped by the system, we can make a very real difference. The fact that there are now record numbers of people in work, including people coming off incapacity benefit, shows why it is so important to stick with the new deal and not to do away with it, as the Tories would do, so returning us to the days of very high unemployment, when a whole generation of people were simply written off by the then Government.

</p>



<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50111-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Scotland  (Mr. Alistair Darling): </b> 
 So far as reserved issues are concerned, the introduction of identity cards across the United Kingdom is, of course, a matter for my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. Decisions on the use of identity cards to access devolved services in Scotland are the responsibility of the Scottish Executive.
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50111-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Reid: </b> 
 This most appalling Bill will give the Secretary of State dictatorial powers to order people to attend at a specified place and time to have their fingerprints and other biometric information recorded. Given the cost and time of travelling to the passport office in Glasgow from many parts of Scotland, will the Secretary of State assure the House that facilities will be available locally to allow people to attend to have fingerprints and biometric information taken&#151;for example, at local post offices?
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50111-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me notice of the question that he intended to ask, which I saw on page 6&nbsp;of <i>The</i> <i>Press & Journal</i> today<i>.</i>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50111-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 It just about gave me sufficient time to find out the answer<i>.</i> I am glad to say that, as the House may be aware, the Home Office is piloting what will be necessary to implement the ID card scheme in Glasgow. One of the things that it is considering is a mobile facility to enable people to record their details without having to travel, in this case to Glasgow. In any event, when biometric passports are introduced, which, I think, will be in about 2008, it will be necessary for people to attend to have those details recorded. As far as I am aware, the Liberals are not actually against biometric passports, but&#151;who knows?&#151;we could be wrong about that as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">I remind the House that the Bill provides for a database to be established to make it possible to have identity cards in the future. For my part, I cannot see anything wrong in principle with people being asked to identify themselves for various transactions. After all, most of us are asked to identify ourselves in respect of various transactions several times a week. It would be a tragedy if, at this stage, we were not to take those steps because they might be absolutely necessary in 10&nbsp;or 12&nbsp;years&#039; time. If the Liberals had their way, the country would be ill-prepared to guard against security problems, fraud and so on. So what is proposed is entirely reasonable.

Members take them off when they enter the Chamber, but I do not have a problem with wearing it whenever. Does my right hon. Friend agree that Scotland deserves to live in security, with protection from fraud and petty crime, just as much as the citizens of the rest of the UK, and that ID cards must therefore be introduced UK-wide?
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="50111-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Of course, the provision of identity cards is reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament&#151;that is why the Bill applies across the whole country&#151;but my hon. Friend is right: increasingly it will not be unreasonable to ask people to identify themselves if they wish to use public services. After all, as I said just a few moments ago, every one of us probably has to identify ourselves when we go to the bank and when we buy things in the shops, and that is not a great imposition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">In relation to security, increasingly, whether we like it or not, not just in this place but elsewhere as well, it will be necessary for people to be satisfied about the identity of individuals, and I do not think that there is anything wrong with that in principle. The problem that the Liberal Democrats have is that they are in favour of security in principle, but rather like their policy on the new deal, they are against the practical means of achieving it.

</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50111-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Of course, thanks to the money that we have made available to Scotland, because of the economic prosperity that has been built up over the past seven years there are more policemen in Scotland. There are also more teachers, nurses and doctors. So as far as public services are concerned, we can provide that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">In relation to identity cards, the fact that the hon. Gentleman disagrees with me comes as no surprise. It is hardly news that it may be necessary to have an ID card to access benefits, for example, in Scotland in future. Does he say that there is anything wrong with asking someone on benefits to identify themselves? The Scottish Executive have made it clear, however, that they do not propose to require the use of ID cards for accessing the NHS in Scotland. That is an entirely proper decision for them to take. However, I repeat the point: what is wrong in principle with people identifying themselves so that others are satisfied they are entitled to use services? I defy him to answer that. I see nothing wrong with that in principle and cannot for the life of me understand why he takes such a ridiculous attitude.

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="50111-02_spnew7"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 I suppose that the hon. Gentleman is still on a learning curve on fishing. There are different circumstances in different countries, but I also want to draw to the attention of the House the fact that, despite all the evidence to the contrary, the Conservative party in Scotland announced yesterday that it intends to withdraw from the common fisheries policy. The hon. Gentleman said that that is &quot;not some silly proposal&quot;, but it is. If the Conservatives withdrew from the CFP, they would have to negotiate with a range of countries. Fish in the sea do not swim around with little flags saying &quot;I&#039;m a British fish&quot; or &quot;I&#039;m a Norwegian fish&quot;. The Conservative party must get real about fisheries policy.

 I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not accept that fish stocks have stabilised, although some stock levels are still critical. The conservation measures adopted in the various packages are beginning to work. Not only did the hon.

If ever something was foolish, it is the way in which the Conservative party allows its Euroscepticism to undermine the good negotiations on fisheries policy and their outcomes, which have been accepted and applauded by the industry.

Does she agree that the people best placed to manage Scotland&#039;s fisheries are fishermen themselves, not politicians in Edinburgh, London or Brussels?
</p>








<p><a name="st_30"><a name="50111-02_spnew11"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 The way to manage our fisheries stocks across Europe is to make sure that we have a balance between conservation and fishing.

 Since 30&nbsp;November, 67&nbsp;devolution issues have been intimated to me: 36&nbsp;devolution issues related to criminal matters, including pre-trial delay, self incrimination under section 172&nbsp;of the Road Traffic Acts and satellite monitoring of fishing vessels; the remaining 31&nbsp;devolution issues related to civil matters, almost all of which concerned prison conditions.

 Is the Advocate-General aware of any discrepancy in the Scotland Act 1998&nbsp;that means that it is essential for the Prime Minister to declare his stay with a pop star, but that it is not essential for the First Minister to declare his stay with a political pundit?
</p>

 No.

 Many of those cases&#151;for example, the pre-trial delay cases&#151;were copycat cases in which I had examined the legal issues in detail in relation to other cases. In one or two of those cases, I intervened and appeared in Privy Council to deal with the legal issues. Such matters depend on the type of issue and whether the issue has been raised before. I did not intervene on any of the particular issues intimated to me in the past month, but some of those issues have been raised in other cases, one or two of which I have intervened in.

 The important matters that my hon. Friend raises relate to policy, not legal issues. Policy discussions would not normally be carried out by me but by the relevant policy Ministers, including my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland.

<a name="50111-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_7">It may be of some assistance if I give an overview of legal regulatory matters as I see them at the moment. My hon. Friend will be aware that although gambling is a reserved matter, Scottish Ministers exercise some powers as a consequence of Executive devolution. The Bill proposes that the Gambling Commission will regulate commercial gambling and issue operating and personal licences. There will be a right of appeal against that to the Gambling Appeals Tribunal. In addition, it is important to understand that licensing boards, which are devolved, will regulate the gambling premises and that the devolved planning structure will apply.

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="50111-03_spnew6"><b> Bob Russell: </b> 
 May I urge the Minister to take a personal grip on this particular issue, as the position to date has been absolutely lamentable? The time that has elapsed since the day that the decision on the private finance initiative for the new Colchester courthouse was taken is longer than the duration of the second world war. If Churchill can win a war in six years, why cannot this Minister build a new courthouse?

 It is certainly a challenge that I am tempted to take up. I have to say, however, that we are at an early stage in contracting for this private finance initiative. I understand the hon.

</p>



<p><a name="st_51"><a name="50111-03_spmin7"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Mr. David Lammy): </b> 
 The claims management sector must be properly regulated. We have given claims handlers one last chance to put their house in order. If they do not, we will consider how formal regulation could be introduced in the context of our consideration of Sir David Clementi&#039;s report.
</p>








<p><a name="st_52"><a name="50111-03_spnew8"><b> Paddy Tipping: </b> 
 Does the Minister accept that in coalfield areas such as mine, claims handlers are causing real difficulties by making unnecessary charges for coal health claims and raising unrealistic expectations about industrial injury claims, and that some of them seem to have intimate connections with firms of solicitors? Many of us do not want our constituents to continue to be ripped off in this way, so is this the last-chance saloon?
</p>








<p><a name="st_53"><a name="50111-03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 Yes, it most definitely is. My hon. Friend will know that last year the Law Society did much work on this with solicitors&#039; firms. The cold-calling, sharp practices and unfair preying on vulnerable people must stop. We have asked the Claims Standards Council to consider the situation and to work with the industry on getting its house in order. If it does not, we will regulate to deal with the gaps.

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="50111-03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Henry Bellingham  (North-West Norfolk)</b> 
 (Con): Am I right that one of the drivers of the proliferation of claims handlers is the no win, no fee rule, which has also led to a big increase in so-called ambulance chasers? What is the Under-Secretary going to do about contingency fees?
</p>








<p><a name="st_55"><a name="50111-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will know that a previous Administration largely introduced the contingency fee regime. We have tried to simplify the regulations. The Better Regulation Task Force considered the matter, we accepted many of its recommendations and we are moving forward.

 (Lab): Companies such as Industrial Disease Compensation Ltd., which is an unscrupulous claims handling firm in the north-east, cannot operate without close relationships with law firms, as my hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 154</b>

</p>








<p><a name="st_57"><a name="50111-03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 I absolutely agree to meet Members who represent coalfield areas. I have regular discussions with the Law Society and have raised such issues with it in the past. I also have upcoming meetings. We take the matter seriously. As I said, the Government are actively considering regulation&#151;but let us meet, continue the dialogue and ensure that we can bring the practice to an end.
</p>








<p><a name="st_58"><a name="50111-03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Oliver Heald  (North-East Hertfordshire)</b> 
 (Con): The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux issued a report last month on the claims farmers&#151;unqualified intermediaries who are engaged in high pressure sales tactics and often mislead the public into ill-conceived litigation. If we consider that report with the comments that have been made, is it not odd that the Under-Secretary&#039;s policy is to allow those people to go further and take over or set up high street solicitors&#039; practices? How will he tackle the abuses?
</p>








<p><a name="st_59"><a name="50111-03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is confused. The Government&#039;s policy has been to ask Sir David Clementi to consider the issues and to act once we have examined his report. We have said clearly that we need the right provisions to ensure that there are no sharp practices on the high street. We are working with the Law Society. David Clementi has specifically considered those matters and we are dealing with the issue; the Conservative Government did not.
</p>

 (Lab): I first raised the problems of claims assessors when I was elected in 1997, but the position has got worse. Claims assessors feed the myth of the compensation culture rather than present the facts. Would it not be more appropriate to regulate now, ask Clementi to reconsider the matter with specific reference to the proposed legal services board and suggest that claims assessors should be brought under its auspices in the same way as other people in practice? Is not the best advice to people who are injured simply to go to a reputable specialist personal injury lawyer, from whom they will get a much better deal than from the crooks?
</p>








<p><a name="st_61"><a name="50111-03_spnew17"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 I know that my hon. Friend has campaigned on those issues for many years. I also know what the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers has said in the past few weeks about the matter. He knows that Sir David Clementi has just reported. We must examine the detail of the report, but we must also let the Claims Standards Council at least to have the opportunity to rectify the position.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 155</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><a name="st_62"><a name="50111-04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Mr. Christopher Leslie): </b> 
 I have received occasional representations on the establishment of a written constitution from some hon. Members in the course of parliamentary questions and debate. However, my officials have no record of any correspondence from the public on the matter since September.
</p>








<p><a name="st_63"><a name="50111-04_spnew0"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 The current British constitution is an amalgam of documents such as Magna Carta, Acts of Parliament, case law and convention. It provides little protection for the rights of citizens, and none for the legacy of Governments. Does my hon. Friend agree that in the face of the Conservative commitment to repeal the Human Rights Act 1998&nbsp;on that far-off day when a Conservative Government are returned to office, all such future reforms must be entrenched in the British constitution so that changes can occur only through special measures such as super-majorities in this place or referendums in the country?
</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="50111-04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 It is not the case that most of our constitution is unwritten. Large parts of it are enshrined in statute law, including the human rights legislation to which my hon. Friend referred and the distribution of powers relating to the devolved Administrations. This is not just a question of the codification of a constitution; it is more about any reforms to it that are proposed. We have a series of reforms for improving the separation of powers between the legislature, the Executive and the judiciary, and they will be put before the House shortly.
</p>








<p><a name="st_65"><a name="50111-04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Andrew Robathan  (Blaby)</b> 
 (Con): If a written constitution were put in place, would the Minister&#039;s boss, the Lord Chancellor, who advocates constitutional change in the other place, still be required to qualify for his job by being either a friend or a former flatmate of the Prime Minister?
</p>








<p><a name="st_66"><a name="50111-04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 I wonder whether that was a slightly facetious question. I suspect that it was, and I shall therefore not dignify it with a substantive answer.
</p>








<p><a name="st_67"><a name="50111-04_spnew4"><b> Tony Wright  (Cannock Chase)</b> 
 (Lab): The Queen once said that she found the British constitution a bit of a puzzle. Would it not help to clear up that puzzle if we began to write a lot of it down? As my hon. Friend the Minister said, this Government have done a lot more writing down of provisions on matters such as human rights and freedom of information. Although it might not have made much sense a long time ago to try to codify the constitution, surely we have now reached a point at which some kind of codification would be sensible. Could not the Government produce a draft, so that we could see what it might propose?
</p>








<p><a name="st_68"><a name="50111-04_spnew5"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 With respect to my hon. Friend, we could spend a great deal of time and effort on such a codification, but I am not convinced that it would achieve a great deal, particularly when there are so many other pressing priorities for legislative time. We need to have an eye to what our constituents want us to spend time talking about in Parliament.

Does the Minister agree that it would serve the British people well if we had a genius similar to that of the founding fathers to protect us from his Government?
</p>








<p><a name="st_70"><a name="50111-04_spnew7"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 This Administration are doing a pretty good job of reforming and improving our constitution; in that respect, I think that we are trying our best. Just because a constitution is written and codified does not mean that it will not be amended or reformed, even in the United States. I do not therefore believe that this question rests on codification. The focus of attention should be more on how a constitution evolves and improves.

</p>








<p><a name="st_72"><a name="50111-04_spnew8"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that reply and I appreciate that some aspects of Clementi have already been discussed today. One recommendation that he makes, which has already been made by the Office of Fair Trading, is that the traditional rules on the way in which the legal profession is organised&#151;with barristers being unable to go into partnerships, and clients having to go to a solicitor before seeing a barrister, for example&#151;impede the public&#039;s access to cheap, high quality legal services. Does the Minister agree that access to legal services is very important and that non-access to them represents an element of social exclusion that we cannot tolerate? Does he also agree that some of Clementi&#039;s suggestions are capable&#151;subject to safeguards about the independence of the profession&#151;of expanding the availability of legal services to our client group, especially to poorer people?
</p>








<p><a name="st_73"><a name="50111-04_spnew9"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 My hon. and learned Friend knows that we have broadly accepted the recommendations of Sir David Clementi, but we have to look at the detail. She will also have heard the discussions that we have had on the matter this morning. It is right that we should find ways of getting outside investment into our law firms, and ways in which lawyers and non-lawyers can work together, but we have to have the right safeguards in place. We must therefore consider in detail the introduction of legal disciplinary practices by speaking to all the stakeholders involved, particularly consumer groups and members of the legal profession.

<br>&nbsp;<br>hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) on legal disciplinary practices, has the Minister formed a view as to whether the &quot;fit to own&quot; suggestion by Sir David Clementi should be implemented by statute&#151;and if so, at what sort of threshold&#151;and whether a maximum stake should be set by law for outside interests in lawyers&#039; practices?
</p>








<p><a name="st_75"><a name="50111-04_spnew11"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s question cuts to the heart of the issues. We have not formed a view, but we are consulting and talking to ensure that we get any such outcome right. He is right that the safeguards regarding the &quot;fit to profit&quot; test are at the centre of the discussion, and if we are to have outside ownership we must get the balance right. We are consulting and talking and I have a round of meetings over the next few months so that we can get into the detail.

</p>








<p><a name="st_77"><a name="50111-04_spnew13"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 If there are particular problems, let me hear about them so that we can deal with them. My hon.

If the Law Society does not have powers, the Government can deal with that.

</p>








<p><a name="st_82"><a name="50111-04_spnew17"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 The reason we have continued the dialogue that we have held, especially with the Catholic Church, is to make the Bill better. We should not forget the many millions of people who will benefit from the Bill. It was because of the dialogue that we had clause 58&nbsp;and were able to rule out euthanasia. It was because of the dialogue that we were able to strengthen aspects of the Bill relating to advance decisions and that we were able to establish that anyone with the motivation of bringing about death&#151;that is at the heart of the discussion about omission&#151;should not be able to do so.

 Although lay magistrates in England and Wales are not remunerated, they receive reimbursement for their travel costs and loss of earnings resulting from the discharge of their official duties. Further resources are not available to change that arrangement at this time.

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="50111-05_spnew0"><b> Richard Ottaway: </b> 
 That relates only to certain magistrates, and it was a fairly mealy-mouthed answer to those who deal with 97&nbsp;per cent. of the crime in this country. The Government impose a huge number of demands on magistrates who do fantastic work both inside the courts and outside, such as extra training in relation to antisocial behaviour orders. The reserve forces get bounties, and councillors get paid and only have to show their face in the council chamber once every six months. Why cannot the Minister remunerate people who do something useful in the community?

<p><a name="st_89"><a name="50111-05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Of course, I agree that magistrates do a fantastic job and we owe them a great debt for their role in the local administration of justice across the country. However, the hon. Gentleman&#039;s plan for remunerating and paying thousands of magistrates is not on our agenda right now. If the Conservative party proposes to add that to its list of spending commitments, that shows how hollow its commitment to the shadow Chancellor&#039;s supposed tax-cutting agenda is. It could not afford the plan and, in fact, it proposes to scrap pretty much all of this particular Department.

 The Modernisation Committee, which I chair, recommended that the House devise a new voters&#039; guide to be sent to all young people around the time of their 18th birthday. The House of Commons Commission has authorised further exploration of this proposal and has stated that it would not authorise the production and distribution of such a guide without the prior approval of the House, which I hope to seek soon.

 I thank my right hon. Friend for that answer. I wonder, however, whether he has read some of the research that reveals that turnout among first-time voters is low because many of those young people simply do not know what to do when they get into the polling station. Such a measure would therefore complement the work of many Members of Parliament, schools and colleges. Were the House to support such a measure, when would he anticipate a guide being sent to new voters?

 I very much agree with my hon. Friend&#039;s point.

There was therefore a degree of concern, worry and intimidation in her question. The sending out of a new voters&#039; guide, possibly in your name, Mr. Speaker, would explain to every young person their democratic rights and opportunities and how to vote.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the Government&#039;s policy towards applications in the courts for injunctions to delay or to prevent the commencement of the Hunting Act 2004.</p>






<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50111-06_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality  (Alun Michael): </b> 
 I am very grateful to my right hon. Friend for his question, because it enables me to provide the House with some clarity in respect of issues that have been rather muddled in the press and other media comment. It might assist the House if I explain the legal and policy background to this issue before coming to the specifics of what we expect to happen in court on 25&nbsp;January. I shall deal in particular with the challenge mounted by the Countryside Alliance to the validity of the Hunting Act 2004, which is based specifically on its argument that the Parliament Act 1949&nbsp;is invalid. We disagree. We do not believe that its challenge will succeed, and we will vigorously contest that challenge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">In view of some confused press comment, I must make it clear that what I am about to say has nothing whatever to do with any possible challenge under the European convention on human rights. Those who suggest that there could be a long delay in commencement from 25&nbsp;January because of a human rights challenge are incorrect and misinformed, as incorporation challenges on human rights grounds are dealt with in our own courts under the Human Rights Act 1998. We do not have such a challenge as yet, but a challenge to the Scottish legislation failed, and we would not expect a different outcome here. In any event, human rights challenges are usually dealt with following commencement of legislation, and there are plenty of precedents. There are two possible avenues of challenge, and they are unrelated, as is our response to them. I want to be absolutely clear about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Let me now come to the Parliament Act challenge. The point of that challenge, to be heard on 25&nbsp;January, is to allow the Countryside Alliance to promote its claim that the Hunting Act 2004&nbsp;is not valid law. We expect that challenge to fail. It is only after the court has decided against that Countryside Alliance claim that any issue of delay becomes relevant. As the chairman of the Countryside Alliance himself made clear, lawyers have already discussed the next steps, as is quite normal in advance of a court hearing. Having failed, the alliance will seek leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. If that is granted&#151;it is a matter for the court&#151;it says that it will seek an injunction to delay commencement of the Act from 18&nbsp;February. As hon. Members are aware, that date is three months after Royal Assent, as provided for in the Hunting Act itself, and the Countryside Alliance intends to seek a delay until after its appeal has been heard.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">I do not know what view the court will take, but we neither oppose nor support such an application if we reach that stage&#151;and for two reasons. First, we want certainty, and supporters of hunting have claimed that there is uncertainty. The right place for their challenge is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 166</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in the courts. We confidently expect to have our view that the Act is valid upheld. We expect the case and any subsequent appeal to be dealt with quite quickly, and no one will then have reason for any doubt whatever or for believing that they might be justified in undertaking activity that is, in fact, illegal. Secondly, we are relaxed because the date of commencement of 18&nbsp;February was neither the Government&#039;s proposal nor what the House voted for. MPs voted for 31&nbsp;July 2006. It is the Countryside Alliance and its representatives in the Lords, through what the media described as the kamikaze option, who rejected that date and insisted on retaining early commencement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">What is in the Act is a matter of fact, and it is for the courts to interpret what is in the Act. I suggest that any colleague who says, in effect, that those who made their bed must now lie on it, should also be relaxed and leave it to the courts. We are confident that the Hunting Act is valid and rightly fulfils the will of the elected Chamber of Parliament. We are confident that the result of the court hearing will uphold that view and do so soon, providing certainty for everyone on all sides of the debate.
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50111-06_spnew1"><b> Sir Gerald Kaufman: </b> 
 Will my right hon. Friend give the House an assurance that there have been no discussions between the Government and the Countryside Alliance on this issue behind the back of the House of Commons, which has expressed its will repeatedly by large majorities? Will he further confirm that, whatever the courts may be able to do, they are not able to change the text of an Act of Parliament, and the Hunting Act lays down commencement three calendar months after enactment on 18&nbsp;November? Will he take it from me and many other Members that we are sick and tired of hearing two voices coming from the Front Bench on this dispute? The House of Commons has expressed its will that it does not want any fiddling or messing about: it wants this Act of Parliament to come into force and to do so without the Government conniving with the Countryside Alliance to prevent it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50111-06_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I urge my right hon. Friend not to give in to any temptation to believe that there are two voices coming from the Government, nor to indulge in conspiracy theories. I am happy to give him all the assurances that he requests on these matters. First, he asked what discussions had taken place. I have confirmed precisely what the chairman of the Countryside Alliance said: that there have been discussions between lawyers about what will happen when a case comes before the court. It is as simple as that. No other discussions are of any relevance whatever.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Secondly, my right hon. Friend asked about what the Hunting Act states. As I have made clear, it states that commencement will be three months after Royal Assent. It is not for me to say what the court will make of that. I simply do not know. Neither am I a lawyer nor do I seek to look into the court&#039;s mind. The court must do its work, just as this House did when it decided on the legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Finally, I assure my right hon. Friend that the Government do not have two voices on this matter. There is only one voice. I have articulated the Government&#039;s position, which has been consistent 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 167</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>throughout. I am very pleased that many hon. Members who worked passionately to bring the Hunting Act into law believe that my approach, which I articulated in December, is right. We want the law to be clear. It is the Countryside Alliance, not the Government, that is attempting to cause confusion, and we want that confusion to be set aside authoritatively by the court. After that, let everyone obey the law of the land.

 That was a pretty pathetic attempt. The hon. Gentleman has introduced nonsense to the debate, and it is clear that he did not listen to the answer that I gave to my right hon. Friend. The Government did not ram through the Hunting Act. The House voted 10&nbsp;times in 10&nbsp;years for the essential content of what is a good piece of legislation. That should be respected, as we now have an Act of Parliament. The Countryside Alliance has every right to challenge it in the courts and to set out its beliefs in a proper and constitutional way. That is what is happening, and we should await the outcome.

 It is important that the democratic will of the House is properly and rigorously defended by the Government. The Minister knows that a case was made at various stages of the Bill&#039;s progress for compensation for those whose livelihoods would be affected by the Act. As the Act is supposed to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 168</b>

</p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50111-07_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 We do not accept that there is a case for compensation. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman and I have discussed that on a number of occasions. I have made my position clear. We do not believe that with commencement on 18&nbsp;February, there is any justification for compensation. Our view is consistent with the view that was taken by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Incidentally, people often say that the Joint Committee on Human Rights found that there were flaws in the Act. It did not, and that has been made clear in the House. Nevertheless, people attempt to spread confusion about that, so I am glad to make it absolutely clear. We recognised that some people&#039;s employment would be affected, so the later date for commencement&#151;we proposed July 2006, and the House agreed with that proposition&#151;would have given everyone time to change their activities, take up drag hunting and consider other ways of ensuring that employment could continue through other equine activities, and so on, but the case against compensation remains strong, even with the date of 18&nbsp;February. That is not the issue today. The question of a challenge is nothing to do with human rights or compensation. It is to do with whether the Parliament Act 1949&nbsp;is valid. We believe that it is. We believe that the Hunting Act 2004&nbsp;is valid and sound, and we will say that clearly in the courts, as we have said in the House. We are being entirely consistent, as always.

 I am not sure what the relevance of the question is. It was the president of the Countryside Alliance who sought to frustrate the possibility of the House of Lords endorsing the date of July 2006&nbsp;which was proposed by this House. The House has taken a clear and reasonable view. The Government have always sought to bring reason into a debate where reason is often in short supply. We continue to do so.

<p><a name="st_16"><a name="50111-07_spnew8"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 No, it does not. It confirms what I said before. We have always known that the Countryside Alliance would make two challenges&#151;one on the Parliament Act and the other on human rights issues, although it has not commenced any such action. The Countryside Alliance has made it clear for several years that that was its intention, so it should come as no surprise to anyone. We believe that the outcome will be clear and simple in both cases and that neither of the challenges will succeed, so I still say my hon. Friend is wrong.

 The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) is right in one thing: there have been two voices from the Government.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement concerning the return to the United Kingdom of the four British citizens detained at Guantanamo Bay.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_11">Let me first recall the context. The attacks of 11&nbsp;September 2001&nbsp;were the worst terrorist atrocity that the United States, the United Kingdom and the whole world have ever suffered. In response to those attacks, a coalition of countries came together to launch a military campaign against al-Qaeda and its Taliban supporters, to remove them from their strongholds in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_12">In those operations, thousands of individuals believed to be al-Qaeda or Taliban fighters or their supporters were detained by coalition forces. The vast majority of those individuals were released, but those who were deemed to pose a substantial risk of returning to the conflict were sent by the United States to detention facilities at its naval base at Guantanamo Bay, there to be detained and questioned about their knowledge of al-Qaeda&#039;s activities. As a result, valuable information has been gained, which has helped to protect the international community from further al-Qaeda and related terrorist attacks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_13">Approximately 200&nbsp;individuals have been released from Guantanamo Bay since their original detention. However, the United States Government believe that a number of detainees so released have returned to terrorism, demonstrating the dilemma faced by the United States in considering such releases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_14">Nine British citizens were among those originally detained at Guantanamo Bay. I and the Government as a whole have taken our consular responsibilities to those detained very seriously. British officials have visited them regularly, delivered messages and mail from their families and secured improvements in the physical conditions of their detention. I have made a written ministerial statement to the House following each of those visits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-08_para8">
<a name="stpa_15">I have also set out to the House on many occasions the British Government&#039;s consistent position in relation to these detainees and their detention. As the House will recall, discussions took place in 2003, led by my noble and learned Friend the Attorney-General on the UK side. The Government then requested the return of all of the British detainees held at Guantanamo Bay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-08_para9">
<a name="stpa_16">Five of the nine detainees were returned to the United Kingdom last March. In announcing their return to the House on 24&nbsp;February last year, I said that the Government would continue to work to resolve the position of the remaining four British detainees: Feroz Abbasi, Moazzam Begg, Jamaal Belmar and Martin Mubanga. Since last March, the Government have been in regular discussion with the United States authorities about this. Foreign Office Ministers and I have also held a number of meetings with the families and lawyers of the four men and with their Members of Parliament, and officials have been in regular contact with them.

That decision follows intensive and complex discussions to address United States security concerns. All the families have been informed of that decision this morning, as have their Members of Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-08_para11">
<a name="stpa_18">The four men will be returned in the next few weeks. Once they are back in the United Kingdom, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000&nbsp;for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity. Any subsequent action will be a matter for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. The House will understand that it would therefore not be right for me to comment further on that aspect of the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-08_para12">
<a name="stpa_19">I should like to assure the House that every practical step will be taken by the relevant United Kingdom authorities to maintain national security and to protect public safety. Throughout the period of detention of British nationals in Guantanamo Bay, the Government have sought to balance the need to safeguard the interests of Britons detained overseas with our duty to meet the threat from international terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-08_para13">
<a name="stpa_20">Terrorism is opposed to the values of every faith and religion, and seeks to deny the most basic of human rights&#151;the right to life, to security and to go about our daily business free from harm. Working with our allies, we will continue resolutely to defend those rights through a robust and determined approach to combating terrorism and its networks of support wherever these are found.

 I thank the Foreign Secretary for advance sight of this statement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_21">I welcome the announcement of the return of those four British citizens. The Opposition have unremittingly supported the fight against terrorism, but equally, we have always believed that such a fight must be conducted within the rule of law.

</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_22">Although those are the last of the British citizens being held at Guantanamo Bay, our reservations in principle remain, as they involve a strong ally with whom we are rightly continuing to work closely in Iraq and Afghanistan.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-09_para5">
<a name="stpa_26">The detention facility at Guantanamo Bay did not just raise serious concerns at the process by which people were detained there. Serious questions have also been raised about the treatment of detainees. For instance, one of them, Moazzam Begg, alleges that he was the victim of torture. Obviously, that is a most serious allegation. Can the Foreign Secretary confirm whether the detainees will be asked not only about any allegation against them, but about the conditions that they underwent at Guantanamo Bay?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_27">Does the return of those four bring with it any assurance that no British citizen will in future be held in Guantanamo Bay or in similar circumstances elsewhere without due process? Indeed, will the Foreign Secretary assure us that there are currently no further British citizens being held anywhere else in similar circumstances?

<p>
<a name="50111-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_28">Winning the fight against terrorism requires us to win too, the fight for hearts and minds, both in Britain and in the Muslim world.

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="50111-09_spnew1"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for the welcome that he has given to the release of those four gentlemen. Let me try to deal with his points in turn. We have an immediate locus in so far as our consular duties are concerned in respect of British citizens. With their return to the United Kingdom, representations about the specific conditions at Guantanamo Bay in respect of the British citizens will obviously come to an end. However, as members of the international community and signatories to various international conventions, we remain concerned about the conditions in which individuals have been, and continue to be, held there, and within that context, we will continue to make representations about them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_29">The right hon. and learned Gentleman asks whether normal due process will apply to those individuals when they return. Yes, of course, and I made that clear. He asks whether I can guarantee that those individuals do not pose a threat to the security of the United Kingdom. We have in place strengthened anti-terrorist legislation, including the Terrorism Act 2000&nbsp;and the 2001&nbsp;legislation. Those laws exist to ensure that those who pose a threat to the security of the United Kingdom are dealt with effectively. I will certainly not prejudge the guilt of any individual in advance of investigation by the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the other appropriate authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-09_para9">
<a name="stpa_30">The right hon. and learned Gentleman asks about the allegations of mistreatment made by Moazzam Begg in particular. I am aware of those allegations, and I have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 176</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>already received oral representations about them by his family and his lawyers. We are pursuing those allegations with the United States authorities, and we will continue to do so. British consular officials visited the detainees on nine separate occasions in very difficult circumstances. It is fair to say that our officials, on my behalf, gave the British detainees a higher level of consular representation than did the foreign Governments of any other nationals who were held at Guantanamo Bay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-09_para10">
<a name="stpa_31">The right hon. and learned Gentleman finally asks whether I can be satisfied that no British citizen is held in any similar circumstance. The answer is that it is almost impossible to prove a negative, but I know of no other British citizen held at Guantanamo Bay in those circumstances; neither do I expect that any will be dispatched there.

 It appears that these men are about to be rescued from what has effectively been a legal no-man&#039;s land, and it would be churlish not to welcome that, but a number of questions remain. Why has it taken so long? What undertakings, if any, have been given to the United States Government about the way in which the men are to be treated once they return to the United Kingdom? What do the Government understand to be the state of health, both mental and physical, of these men?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-09_para11">
<a name="stpa_32">Whatever the context, the truth is that the detention of these men violated all legal principle. Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused, and they were denied due process, a cornerstone of American legal jurisprudence.

<p><a name="st_35"><a name="50111-09_spnew3"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for his welcome for the announcement. I understand the concerns that he expressed so eloquently. It is important to understand the grave anxieties that arose in the United States following the 11&nbsp;September atrocities, which was the first time that an attack by foreigners had taken place on its mainland in at least living memory. It produced the largest single set of casualties on the mainland since the American civil war. It has to be understood what a trauma the United States faced. There is no point dismissing that. It is a fact. The decisions that it made have to be seen in that context.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-09_para12">
<a name="stpa_33">The right hon. and learned Gentleman asked why it has taken so long. It has taken this long to hold intensive discussions on the need for the United States to release the men and to recognise that they would be subject to our law, agreed by this Parliament, and no other law. That is what has happened. No side undertakings, which I think was in his mind, have been given to the US Government about how they will or will not be treated. They will be treated in accordance with the law. As happened with the five who were released last March, and as I said in my statement, it will be a matter for the police acting under the powers of the Terrorism Act 2000&nbsp;to consider whether to interview them and detain them when they arrive in the UK, and a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service to take any action following on from that.

Will he also confirm that our concern extends beyond our nationals to the principle of detention in Guantanamo Bay in general? How do the Government view the proposals of the US Government either to set up a special prison, Camp Six, within Guantanamo Bay, where people can be held without trial indefinitely, or to hold those people in prisons within their countries of origin?

 Any allegations that the gentlemen make will be pursued vigorously. Indeed, we are already pursuing some allegations in advance of their release.

It is therefore important that he accepts the task of encouraging, pressing and pushing the United States to change its attitude to the kind of detention that has taken place in Guantanamo Bay.

Indeed, had it not been for the nature of our alliance with the United States, we would not have got those nine detainees back.

<p><a name="st_90"><a name="50111-13_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Paul Murphy): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I should like to make a statement on Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_49">As the House will be aware, a major robbery took place at the Northern bank in Belfast just before Christmas. At the end of last week, the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland indicated that in his professional opinion responsibility for the robbery should be attributed to the Provisional IRA. He also made the point that quite apart from the massive scale of the robbery&#151;more than &#163;26&nbsp;million&#151;it was in no sense a victimless crime. Two families were kidnapped and threatened with death if they did not co-operate with the criminals. In the case of one of the families, the gang, masquerading as police officers, tricked their way into the house by claiming that a family member had been killed in a car accident. Once inside, they donned masks, produced guns and threatened the family. One of the hostages was later taken to an isolated forest where her car was burned and she was abandoned in the snow. She was forced to struggle in severe weather and in darkness across country to seek assistance in a highly distressed state and suffering from hypothermia. I want to reiterate my utter condemnation of those who planned and carried out that appalling crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_50">The Chief Constable&#039;s public remarks were necessarily constrained by the ongoing investigation. He has briefed me fully on the background which led him to make the statement that he made. I have no doubt that the Chief Constable&#039;s opinion is well founded. He did not rush to judgment. The Police Service of Northern Ireland thought initially that five groups could have been responsible for the robbery. Only when a great deal of evidence had been sifted did the Chief Constable make his statement. He is a man of the highest calibre and integrity, leading a professional team of officers acting entirely independently and objectively in pursuit of the criminals concerned. The Irish Government have also made their views on that aspect of the matter entirely clear. There will of course be a further dispassionate assessment of the position when the Independent Monitoring Commission makes its next report. I shall discuss with the Irish Government the time scale in which that report should be made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_51">On the immediate follow-up to the robbery, I welcome the announcement by the Northern bank of its intention to withdraw from circulation its current bank notes and replace them with notes of a different design and colour. That decision will reduce materially the value of the robbery to the perpetrators and we will discuss with the bank how best to publicise the detailed arrangements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_52">Since the Chief Constable&#039;s statement, there has been much comment about the impact of the developments on the political process in Northern Ireland. I cannot hide my own judgment that it is deeply damaging.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_53">On 9&nbsp;December, I came to the House to report on the proposals by the British and Irish Governments for a comprehensive agreement, which had been published the previous day. They represented a series of statements that would have been made if there had been an overall agreement at that stage. They included a statement to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 188</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the effect that paramilitary activity by the Provisional IRA would cease immediately and definitively. There was also a statement, to which the Democratic Unionist party was committed, that after a period during which the good faith of the Provisional IRA&#039;s commitments had been demonstrated, an inclusive power-sharing Executive would be re-established in March this year. I need hardly remind hon. Members that that would have been nearly two and a half years after the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland were suspended.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_54">In the event, an outstanding issue, in relation to the transparency of the decommissioning process, could not be resolved. However, as I said to the House in December, we had made significant and substantial progress, not least in rebuilding the trust and confidence that is the essential requirement of a stable, inclusive, cross-community, devolved Administration in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_55">Today, I deeply regret that that progress has been put in jeopardy. I cannot forecast with certainty when it will prove possible to re-establish an inclusive power-sharing Executive, which the Government continue to believe provides the best long-term guarantee of peace and stability. We shall not abandon our commitment to that ultimate goal.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_56">We are in no doubt, however, that it can be achieved only if the Provisional IRA gives up not only terrorism but all the other forms of criminality in which it is implicated. Unionists in Northern Ireland have made clear that if those tests are met, they will work with Sinn Fein in a power-sharing Executive. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has said repeatedly, it is entirely reasonable for Unionists to withhold their co-operation until those tests are met. We have consistently made it clear that, if a political settlement is to be achieved, any illegal activity has to come to an end. The documents published before Christmas were unambiguous on that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_57">Let me reiterate to the House that the Government will not promote a political settlement in which a party inextricably linked to an organisation that has carried out major criminal acts can assume responsibilities again in a devolved Administration. Nor could it take on the further responsibilities implied by the devolution of justice and policing while criminal activity of the kind we have just seen, and the capacity to plan and undertake such activity, continues to exist. It would be ludicrous for anyone to suggest that the people of Northern Ireland, from whatever background, voted for a political settlement on that basis in the referendum in 1998.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_58">Against that background, it is clear to me that decisions and responses on that are now needed from Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA. The comments from the Irish Government in recent days indicate that they share that view.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_59">Without the required responses from Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA, I cannot see how we can reinvigorate the political talks that must precede a comprehensive settlement. Without those responses, the Governments and, indeed, the House, will need to consider how best in the changed circumstances to bring pressure to bear on the republican movement to complete the transition to exclusively peaceful and democratic means, including any penalties that might be applied to Sinn Fein.

<a name="50111-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_60">I spoke to the Irish Foreign Minister on Friday and will meet him when he returns from a visit to the tsunami-stricken areas of Asia. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister will meet the Taoiseach towards the end of the month. In the meantime, I expect to talk to the Northern Ireland parties over the next two weeks with a view to hearing first hand their assessments of the current position and their views on several difficult questions that now face us, including, for example, the appropriateness of continuing to pay the salaries and allowances of the individuals elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in November 2003&nbsp;and our proposed way forward on the regulation of donations to political parties in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-13_para12">
<a name="stpa_61">I cannot disguise my deep disappointment at what has happened, but my disappointment is as nothing compared with that of the people of Northern Ireland. They deserve better, given the progress in so many areas of their lives in recent years. The Government, continuing to work in close partnership with the Irish Government, will do everything they can to ensure that that progress is not lost and that we can continue to move forward as soon as possible to a comprehensive political settlement. In the meantime, my colleagues and I will continue to apply ourselves to governing Northern Ireland as effectively as possible in the absence of a devolved Administration.

<p><a name="st_91"><a name="50111-14_spnew0"><b> Mr. David Lidington  (Aylesbury) (Con):</b> 
 First, I thank the Secretary of State for his statement and his customary courtesy in letting me see an advance copy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_62">The right hon. Gentleman rightly drew attention to the viciousness of the crime. I want to start by expressing our sympathy for the families who were the victims of those brutal acts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_63">The robbery and the Chief Constable&#039;s words last week have grave implications for the entire political process in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State have frequently said&#151;the Secretary of State did so again this afternoon&#151;that Sinn Fein and the IRA are inextricably linked. The Independent Monitoring Commission&#039;s conclusions supported that assessment. In those circumstances, surely no Unionist or, for that matter, nationalist politician should be asked to share power with a party that remains inextricably linked to a violent criminal gang.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_64">We cannot move towards the devolution of powers over policing and criminal justice until we can be confident that every party with Ministers in a devolved Executive is committed to supporting the police and the rule of law rather than to undermining them.


</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_65">Will the Secretary of State today accept something that he has avoided accepting up to now, namely, that the same principles should now apply in Belfast and in Dublin, and that Sinn Fein cannot take part in a coalition or power-sharing Administration until it has permanently ended its connections to paramilitary bodies and to organised crime? I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that it would be in everyone&#039;s interests if the republican movement now rapidly completed its transition from terrorism to exclusively peaceful and democratic politics. The sad truth, however, is that the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 190</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>events of recent days have shown that we seem to be a long way from achieving that objective. What, therefore, do the Government plan to do now?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_66">As far back as 7&nbsp;September last year, the Prime Minister said that if the Leeds Castle talks failed to achieve a comprehensive settlement,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_67">What is that other way forward that the Prime Minister and the Government envisaged? Will the Government now explore the possibility of establishing a power-sharing Executive who exclude Sinn Fein? Or, if that is unattainable, will the Minister consider ways of making direct-rule Ministers more accountable to the people of Northern Ireland?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_68">The Secretary of State mentioned sanctions against Sinn Fein, and I would like to ask him three specific questions on that issue. First, in the light of the intelligence to which he and the police now have access, will he consider recalling individual prisoners who have been released early on licence under the Government&#039;s early-release scheme? Secondly, given the widespread belief that the profits of crime are helping to fund political parties linked to paramilitary forces, will he look again at some of the exemptions that parties in Northern Ireland have from the normal rules on party funding, especially those relating to foreign donations and to publishing accounts? I note that he said that he would be discussing this matter with the Irish Foreign Minister soon. In the light of those discussions, will the Secretary of State undertake to drop, or at least postpone, proceedings on the statutory instrument to extend the current exemptions, which the Government tabled shortly before Christmas? Thirdly, will the Government now introduce a motion to suspend the privileges and parliamentary allowances that have been given to Sinn Fein Members of this House despite their refusal to take their seats and represent their constituents properly? It is intolerable for taxpayers&#039; money to be doled out in this way to a party that remains inextricably linked to violent organised crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_69">Finally, will the right hon. Gentleman give the House an unequivocal assurance that the police, customs and every other law enforcement agency in Northern Ireland will be unrelenting in pursing not only the people responsible for this appalling robbery but all members of the mafia gangs, republican or loyalist, that prey on the people of Northern Ireland; and that the agencies of law and order will take that action regardless of any political difficulties that it might cause in any quarter?
</p>








<p><a name="st_92"><a name="50111-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments on the process. I agree with him that the impact of these events is deeply worrying and serious. I shall try to answer his individual questions one by one. He asked whether the principles that apply to a Government in Dublin should apply to a power-sharing Executive; I am sure that that is the case. I have already said that the Government will not tolerate any form of criminality associated with a group that is associated with a political party in Northern Ireland. Perhaps more significantly, however, the political parties in Northern Ireland take a very strong view on this issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_70">In regard to whether we could form a power-sharing Executive without Sinn Fein, the Government&#039;s view&#151;the view expressed in the Good Friday agreement&#151;has 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 191</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>always been that the people of Northern Ireland and, indeed, the people of Ireland voted for an inclusive power-sharing Executive. The ultimate answer is to see the end of criminality on the island of Ireland, and in Northern Ireland in particular, whether that criminality comes from republican or loyalist sources. The Government have not ruled anything out or in, but a lot will depend on the discussions that I have over the next couple of weeks with the political parties to discover their views on the issue. At the end of the day, two things matter: one is that there be consensus among the political parties in Northern Ireland as to what they want; the other is that, whatever happens, we cannot establish an Executive in Northern Ireland without either Unionist or nationalist representation. To that end, the parties could suggest other alternatives to us for the short term, over the coming months. They could include ways in which direct rule Ministers could be made more accountable; I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman on that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_71">On recalling licensed prisoners who might be connected to the bank robbery, I am monitoring all the circumstances surrounding the robbery very carefully and I can confirm that I shall not hesitate to use the powers available to me to suspend the licence of any ex-prisoner if I am satisfied that he or she has broken, or is likely to break, any of his or her licence conditions. I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he requested on that matter.

<a name="stpa_72">The Government intend to move away from the current exemptions for the Northern Ireland political parties from the normal rules on publishing their accounts and receiving foreign donations.

I know that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members will be discussing this matter with me in more detail in the weeks ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-14_para11">
<a name="stpa_73">The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of this House suspending the privileges and parliamentary allowances of Sinn Fein Members. First, I have already said in my statement that the Government will consider a range of possibilities in the coming days, and I think the House would agree that we need to take some time to consider the most effective way of bringing pressure to bear on the republican movement. [Hon. Members: &quot;Why?&quot;] Not least because we need to discuss a number of the issues relating to sanctions and penalties with the Irish Government&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps the House will allow me to finish. Secondly, I understand that the House has its own rules regarding whether we should allow such actions to happen, and the Government will have to reflect on the significance of that. Thirdly, the Independent Monitoring Commission also has a role in determining what sanctions and penalties, if any, should be introduced with regard to Sinn Fein. We do not want to take a decision on these issues today, because we need to look at the whole picture. I have not ruled anything out on these issues.

 I agree with my hon. Friend that this is a threat to the process, as I am sure all hon. Members do. The Chief Constable made it clear in his statement last week that he came to his conclusion professionally and that his professional judgment rested on examining the evidence, whether that was from intelligence or the criminal investigation. He said that all lines of his and his senior officers&#039; inquiry led him to his conclusion.

<a name="stpa_75">My hon. Friend will understand that between 45&nbsp;and 47&nbsp;police officers are working on the inquiry. A hundred interviews have been held with 100&nbsp;more to be held in the near future. It would be wrong of the Chief Constable or the police to reveal all that evidence during the course of an investigation because, as my hon. Friend and others will know, that would seriously jeopardise the chances of catching and convicting the culprits&#151;that is the danger. However, I have read a great deal of the evidence that the Chief Constable has seen and I have no doubt that what he said was right.

<a name="stpa_76">We all continue to have high respect for Hugh Orde, but I am also surprised by his and the Government&#039;s willingness to blame the IRA for the robbery without revealing the evidence.

If he cannot give us that assurance today, he cannot claim that the IRA was necessarily behind it.

<a name="50111-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_77">The Secretary of State asks us to take it on trust&#151;without sharing evidence&#151;that the IRA was behind the crime, but if he wants to use the defence that he should not share that evidence while the investigation is continuing, perhaps it was not wise to share a conclusion before the investigation had ended. Is there not a danger that that might prejudice the outcome of a court case, because we would be prosecuting not an organisation but individuals?

</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_78">We are meant to be normalising Northern Ireland, so is the Secretary of State aware that his fellow Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson), refused this morning to say that the Government would necessarily specify an organisation on the basis of criminal activity? Why are the Government unwilling to specify sanctions against paramilitary organisations involved in crime, even if they are not willing to specify the organisations themselves? If it turns out that a paramilitary organisation is behind this substantial criminal offence, it is rather surprising that the Government shy away from giving an assurance that they would consider specifying it on the basis of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_79">It will be difficult to normalise Northern Ireland if paramilitary organisations do not fear the sanction of being specified on the basis of serious criminal activity. That stems from the fact that we have never had a clear&nbsp;definition of &quot;ceasefire&quot;. Is it not time to use paragraph 13&nbsp;of the joint declaration as a clear definition of ceasefire, and to add to it the idea that sanctions will extend to criminality as well as terrorism? Is it not the case that until we have a clear and explicit statement of the sanctions that paramilitary organisations can expect when perpetrating organised crime, we are unlikely to resolve the problems of crime or, indeed, terror?

 I am surprised by the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question about the Chief Constable and the evidence, because I thought that I had made it clear that it is difficult for him to produce detailed evidence while an investigation is ongoing. However, the hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do, because he has been involved in Northern Ireland politics for a long time, that it is by no means unusual for the Chief Constable to attribute blame across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland for paramilitary crime. Indeed, the problem that Hugh Orde faced over the past couple of weeks was that he was not attributing quickly enough. However, he wanted to ensure that he was satisfied, in his highly professional opinion, of what was the case. If the detail were to emerge, it could have a detrimental effect on future court proceedings, which is why the situation has arisen.

<a name="50111-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_80">I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s reference to specification, but as he knows, specification refers specifically to whether groups are on ceasefire.

As he knows, such sanctions would refer to various penalties affecting Assembly Members and parties when the Assembly is in session.

<p><a name="st_97"><a name="50111-15_spnew3"><b> Kate Hoey  (Vauxhall) (Lab):</b> 
 Does the Secretary of State agree that what he has said today will give a lot of heart to IRA-Sinn Fein because democratic politicians and parties from both sides of the community in Northern Ireland are being punished? Surely he should be saying that we will not be held to ransom by IRA-Sinn Fein and that we will go ahead and set up instantly a devolved Northern Ireland Assembly with nationalist and Unionist parties that have no links to terrorism.
</p>








<p><a name="st_98"><a name="50111-15_spnew4"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I could not agree less with my hon. Friend. I find it extremely unusual for her to suggest that the words in my statement could give comfort to the IRA&#151;perhaps she will reflect on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_82">I indicated in response to a previous question that I have neither ruled in nor out the possibility of persuading democratic parties in Northern Ireland to set up a voluntary coalition excluding Sinn Fein. However, the reality is that such an arrangement could be made only if the political parties in Northern Ireland that would form part of that coalition agreed to it. The coalition would have to be made up of Unionists and nationalists. It is thus incumbent on the Government, as the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) said, to consider other means of increasing accountability for direct rule Ministers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_83">I do not think that anyone would disagree that the most important matter before us today is how to stop criminality in Northern Ireland. If that stopped, and we were persuaded that it had stopped, we could of course enter into an inclusive Executive. If that does not happen, it does not happen, but anyone who suggests that we should not work towards that and stop criminality would not be thanked by people in Northern Ireland. If that does not work, we will have to find other arrangements&#151;I have not ruled those out&#151;but the House should reflect on the fact that it is incumbent on me to talk to political parties in Northern Ireland to get their views on where we might go, which I intend to do. People in Northern Ireland would not want us to take precipitate decisions today without doing that.

 This is a serious day for Northern Ireland. It is a day when the Government must cease to deal with politics, and deal with crime and paramilitaries. Until crime and paramilitaries are dealt with, we cannot have a proper democracy in Northern Ireland. As the Secretary of State well knows, the Democratic Unionist party took part in the talks process in good faith, but all the time we were in those talks, we were chided by his Government that we should have more faith and trust. We were sniped at by official Unionists, whose deputy leader says today that we were taken for a ride. The Democratic Unionist party was not taken for a ride. We took our stand boldly and strongly for what we believed. We did not change anything to which we said that we were dedicated, and we kept fully to our mandate from the people.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_86">First, the Secretary of State said in his statement that &quot;decisions and responses&quot; are now needed from Sinn Fein-IRA. Will he please tell us what he means by that? There was not one word about anger. The people of Northern Ireland are more than disappointed&#151;they are very angry about what has happened. Furthermore, what are the penalties to which he referred? The only penalties about which I have heard today are against the democrats of Northern Ireland, whether nationalist or Unionist. The hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) was right to make that point. We are being punished&#151;because of a bank robbery, all democracy in Northern Ireland is to be brought to an end. I want to press the Secretary of State to tell us what those penalties are.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>direct rule Ministers and to call them to account, as they did in the Assembly. That is a job of work that could be done.
</p>








<p><a name="st_105"><a name="50111-16_spnew3"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 On those last points, we could certainly consider the sort of arrangement about which the hon. Gentleman talked. His party put forward various proposals with regard to a committee structure or corporate body of the Assembly. The Social Democratic and Labour party put forward suggestions with regard to a similar body, but with commissioners. There are ways in which to examine how best to deal with the accountability of me and other Ministers in the House who have responsibility for Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_88">On penalties and sanctions, the hon. Gentleman also knows that, when an incident occurred last year, we considered a host of different penalties and sanctions, ranging from allowances to other matters. Those will be considered by the Government and the Irish Government together, but the House will also have an opportunity to consider such matters, if it so wishes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_89">With regard to decisions and responses, those relate entirely to the first point that the hon. Gentleman rightly made&#151;we cannot, to use his words, mix crime and a proper democracy. I hope that I made it clear throughout my statement that the Government will not tolerate that linkage, and that it is not right for that to happen. If he wants a voluntary coalition, however, I repeat that we can only have that if people volunteer to go into it, and it must be across the board. Therefore, there must be other ways. The point is also to end criminality so that we have a wholesome and uncorrupted politics in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_90">The hon. Gentleman rightly talks about anger in Northern Ireland about the issue, but the anger is also because of the impact on the process, given all the work done by his party over the months leading up to Christmas, and the work done by all the parties involved in the peace process in Northern Ireland over the last several years. I assure him that no one in the House was more disappointed than me. Off and on, for 10&nbsp;years, I have also been involved in the process, and the last thing that I wanted was to come to this House and deliver the statement that I have had to give today. I wanted to ensure that we saw progress from Christmas onwards, with an Executive and an Assembly up and running in the next six months, which the people of Northern Ireland wanted. Now we must put our heads together and work out where we go in the months ahead.

 First, I want to pay tribute to members of both Governments who have worked so assiduously on this mater. That will not prevent me from pointing out that there is a fault line in the negotiation process, which is exemplified by the way in which, for more than seven years, every attempt was made to buy the IRA army council into the political process at the expense of other factors&#151;not just buying in republicans but others. There is a fault line in any political process when people must be bought into such a process in a place like Northern Ireland. It is an even worse fault line when, added to that, we have secret deals that amount to political patronage, and secret arrangements with paramilitary groups, and when the law itself can be bartered for political reasons, as was attempted in the Republic of Ireland.

 With permission, Mr.&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the serious flooding that affected northern England, especially Carlisle, at the weekend. I also want to refer to the loss of drinking water supplies in Hexham, Northumberland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_97">The flooding was caused by a major storm that produced truly exceptional amounts of rain: some 9&nbsp;in fell in a 36-hour period on already saturated land. This rainfall quickly reached the rivers Eden, in Cumbria, and Tyne, in Northumberland. They were unable to cope with such torrential loads, and flood banks were overtopped. I have to report that very sadly, three lives were lost in the Carlisle area. The coroner reported that two deaths were caused by drowning, and one by trauma when a wall collapsed in high winds. Inquests have been opened and adjourned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_98">Nearly 3,000&nbsp;properties have been flooded in Carlisle. Elsewhere in northern England, nearly 100&nbsp;properties were flooded along the River Tyne. The Carlisle major incident plan was activated and many residents were evacuated. Some stayed with family and friends; others have been housed in reception centres. There are continuing problems with the electricity supply and telephone connections to many houses. I saw for myself on Sunday just how serious the flooding was in Carlisle, and I know from this and previous experience how utterly devastating flooding can be for those affected. The thoughts of the Government&#151;and, I am sure, those of the whole House&#151;are with everyone affected, and especially with those who have lost loved ones.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_99">I pay tribute to all those involved in the emergency response over the weekend&#151;including the fire, ambulance and police services, the local authority, the Environment Agency, the coastguard, mountain rescue, and the military&#151;who assisted greatly in rescuing those trapped by the flooding. I also want to thank the voluntary organisations that have given so much help in caring for those affected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_100">As a Government, we shall seek to ensure that all that can be done is being done to return the community to normal as quickly as possible. Emergency financial assistance is available to local authorities, under the Bellwin scheme, to help with non-insurable clear-up costs following a disaster or emergency in their area. Such an authority has one month from the end of an incident to notify the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister that it intends to apply for activation of the Bellwin scheme. If it is approved, the Department will usually reimburse 85&nbsp;per cent. of eligible costs above a threshold related to the authority&#039;s annual budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_101">I am also pleased to note that the Association of British Insurers has encouraged its members to play their part in the recovery by ensuring that they have sufficient capacity to deal with the exceptional volume of claims from Carlisle and elsewhere, especially given that further exceptional storms are expected imminently in northern Britain. As with all major flooding events, we will work with the Environment Agency in considering the lessons learned. We will do this once the agency has dealt with the immediate aftermath of the flooding,

<br>&nbsp;<br>which is clearly its first priority, and there has been an opportunity to analyse the event and the response. However, preliminary indications are that this was the most serious flood in Cumbria since 1822. Although flood defences on the River Eden remained intact, they were overtopped by the extreme water flows. There were breaches of defences at Corbridge, on the River Tyne, but the event was so severe that those defences were overtopped anyway.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_102">I should also inform the House that proposals are being developed for a new Environment Agency flood defence scheme to provide added protection for Carlisle. A number of options are being considered, and this analysis will now take account of the last weekend&#039;s flooding. However, I emphasise that whatever flood defences we provide&#151;the Government have committed record levels of investment: almost &#163;480&nbsp;million in this financial year and &#163;570&nbsp;million for 2005&#150;06&#151;we cannot provide absolute protection in all areas against all conceivable flooding events. There is always the risk that truly exceptional storms and rainfall such as occurred at the weekend will strike somewhere.

<a name="50111-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_103">I should further inform the House that the mains drinking water supply has been lost to properties in Hexham, Northumberland. Two water mains that pass under the River Tyne in the town were severely damaged by a fallen tree passing in the flooded river. The water company was able to maintain the supply to all but 1,100&nbsp;properties until yesterday, but now, 10,000&nbsp;are without mains supply. Northumbrian Water is providing emergency supplies of water in static tanks and bottles. The mains are about 1.5&nbsp;m below the river bed and cannot be immediately accessed for repair. However, as an interim measure to restore the mains supply, the company is laying temporary overland pipework, which it expects to complete tonight. Some customers&#039; supplies should be restored tomorrow, and others&#039; throughout this week.

<a name="stpa_104">Soon, responsibility for the short-term and longer-term recovery effort will pass to the local authorities in Cumbria, and I am sure that elected members and officials will rise to the challenge. The Government office for the north-west and the Northwest Development Agency are already working with the local authorities to support them in that process.

<a name="50111-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_105">What the Government can, and will, do is to ensure that we provide the investment for the Environment Agency and for others involved in flood defence to undertake works where they are most needed. We have always made it clear that nobody can guarantee that there will not be extreme weather events or flooding, but we can continually reduce risk&#151;as we are doing&#151;by investing in defences and warning systems, and by ensuring that there are efficient and effective emergency arrangements to cope with such extreme events. I repeat that commitment to the House.

<a name="stpa_106">I welcome the application of the Bellwin formula and the statement from the Association of British Insurers. The priority is, of course, to provide help for the victims of the floods and get them back home as soon as possible, and to restore essential services&#151;including electricity and water supplies&#151;very swiftly. On learning lessons from what has happened, and given in particular the loss of life, will the Minister review the arrangements for warning those likely to be affected about the onset of extreme weather that might threaten their homes? Indeed, I understand that such warnings might be needed again in that region in the near future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_107">Once the immediate consequences of the floods have been redressed, questions arise about what other steps the Government can reasonably take. Inevitably, sudden and severe rainfall is likely to cause floods and I accept the Minister&#039;s point that no system of flood defences can guarantee total protection against adverse consequences. It is, however, a characteristic of climate change that sudden and severe rainfall will occur more frequently in future than it has in the past. It may be more than a century since this part of England suffered such severe floods, but we cannot assume that another century will pass before it happens again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_108">The Government have admitted that more than a million homes around the country are at risk of being flooded, so is the Minister satisfied that the planning process takes enough account of flood risks? Have not the risks been worsened by too much development taking place in areas that are in danger of being flooded and in places where the construction of buildings will increase the risk of existing buildings being flooded? Regardless of whether that was a factor in the latest incident, does the Minister agree that one way to reduce the risk of loss of life and damage to property resulting from flooding would be to require local authorities to adopt a more precautionary approach in respect of flood risk when giving planning consent for new development?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_109">Turning to the broader issue of climate change, does the Minister accept that the severity of the rainfall that caused these floods is indeed a characteristic of climate change and is likely to recur? Does he also agree that it adds urgency to the challenge that Britain and the rest of the world face in tackling a threat that some may see as distant and global, but whose consequences can be very immediate and local?
</p>

 I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s support for the sterling work done by the emergency services and his thoughtful and measured response. I can tell him that there will be a review of the flood warning system when the immediate emergency is over. It appears from early indications that the warning system was activated, but that only some people received those warnings. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 204</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Some did not, so we obviously want to look further into the details of that. Given the extent of storms and floods, tremendous demands were made of the emergency warning system. I understand that some of the telemetry in the river systems was overwhelmed because of the speed of the water&#039;s rise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_111">The hon. Gentleman is right about climate change, and we certainly need to take into account its long-term implications. Climate change is a reality and a fact in respect of global warming. We know the figures and we can see the impact that various activities have made. We need to measure long-term trends in weather patterns. We have seen a series of extreme weather events not only in our own country, but globally, with hurricanes and typhoons. People would be ill advised not to assume that there is a link between global warming and climatic change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_112">We are trying to understand climate change better and, as part of our G8&nbsp;presidency, we are hosting a major scientific conference in February at the Hadley centre, which is recognised as one of the world&#039;s leading centres of climatic forecasting and analysis. That is part of our attempt to understand the long-term implications, but we cannot be complacent. That is why the Government set up the Foresight programme and climate impacts programme to examine the potential consequences of climatic change and prepare to deal with it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_113">I accept what the hon. Gentleman said about flood plain development. It is certainly the case that there has been inappropriate development over the years on those plains. We now have new guidance under PPG25, which places an obligation on planning authorities to take flood risk into account when assessing planning applications. The Environment Agency is a statutory consultee, and also offers its opinions on planning applications. Those are all part of the Government&#039;s long-term planning and long-term commitment to reduce the risks that people in this country face.

Within 36&nbsp;hours, we had 9&nbsp;in of rain. Tragically, three people died: Mr. Scott was killed by falling farm masonry, and two elderly ladies, Mrs. Threlkeld and Mrs. Porter, who lived in Warwick road in my constituency, sadly drowned in the incident. I want to offer my sympathy and condolences to the families of all those people, and I know that the House is with me on that. Another consequence was the flooding of 3,000&nbsp;houses, and almost 100,000&nbsp;people were without electricity, many for three nights. It has been a very difficult time.

We need to recall that both the fire station and the police station were under 6&nbsp;ft of water, reflecting the seriousness of the problem. The city council and the county council were excellent, especially social services in looking after the elderly and the young. The reception centres were manned by volunteers&#151;the Women&#039;s Royal Voluntary Service, the Salvation Army and the Churches. The Minister and I visited them on Sunday and we saw the tremendous welcome that people were given at those centres. The community spirit in the city has been brilliant.

Without that, things would be have been even more intolerable for many people.

<a name="50111-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_117">There should be further investigation of certain problems. I believe that the early warning flood system failed for some people, including myself. The local authority may also have been hampered by a shortage of sandbags. I am not convinced that the insurance industry has done itself any good, either. It was very slow to respond, especially at the weekend.

He has already touched on helping local authorities. I have asked him to talk to the insurance companies to see whether they can lift their performance. Will he also ask United Utilities to do its best on the ground to get services back to normal? I understand that at this very moment, accountants are looking at ways to fiddle the compensation awarded to my constituents. It is very bad indeed to see people trying to wriggle out of their commitments. My constituents need every penny to get themselves back on their feet.

<a name="stpa_127">The second lesson is that we must take measures to deal with the consequences of climate change, and to limit as far as possible the impact that it has on individuals and communities. I agree with the Minister that it is impossible to eliminate all floods all the time, but does he agree that there is a need to improve flood defences even faster than the current rate?

My constituency of Lewes, and other areas, were badly hit, and the Deputy Prime Minister regarded what happened as a wake-up call.

That is a significant investment in respect of flood defence. The hon. Member for Lewes asked whether it was possible to take things forward more quickly, but it is likely that the level of spending now implemented will absorb our total capacity when it comes to engineers and consultants. Moreover, the design and planning processes must also be taken into account. Unfortunately, neither of those processes is quick, but they are both necessary and important. Sometimes technical issues arise. For example, one complication in Lewes involved the question of which of the various riparian owners were responsible for the town&#039;s walls. That is another dimension that has to be taken into account. We have the latest strategy, which has been sent to DEFRA, and we are considering it in relation to Lewes.

Carlisle city council will have a contingency for emergencies, but we would not expect that to cover the costs of what has happened in Carlisle.

Although many businesses have had to shut and are facing losses, the majority of the population have faced the crisis with remarkable stoicism and good humour. I place on record their thanks for all the efforts of the emergency services, the Environment Agency and particularly Northumbrian Water, whose employees have worked tirelessly day and night to restore supplies and provide emergency supplies very efficiently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_142">For people who have lost their water supply, hopefully it will be reconnected within a day or two, but for those whose homes were flooded, it will be many months before they overcome the damage that has been caused. When the immediate crisis is over and the Minister takes a calm look at what happened, will he look particularly at the situation regarding the protective walls at Corbridge and Warden, where they were breached, to see whether anything should have been done? There was a suggestion&#151;whether it is true, I do not know&#151;that the banks at Corbridge were damaged by burrowing rabbits over the years and weakened as a consequence. Will the Minister also consider whether the warning system that was in place was adequate?

 I can give the hon. Gentleman an assurance that we will look at the situation at Corbridge. It sounds as if repairs to the defences will be needed, and I am sure that the Environment Agency will look into that. As he rightly says, when the emergency situation in Cumbria has been dealt with, those are the sort of issues that we will want to examine. If rectification is needed, we will consider the steps that need to be taken.

We take such matters seriously and when the situation improves, all these aspects will be examined in detail.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_147">The Bill takes forward legislation that will, I hope, help to reduce the number of deaths and injuries that occur every day on the roads and to improve road safety for all road users.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_148">The UK has one of the best road safety records in the world. It is a record that most EU countries, for example, strive to match. We are better than the United States and the Australians, and on a par with Sweden and the Netherlands, yet the fact remains that 10&nbsp;people are killed on our roads every day. It is against that background that I ask the House to consider the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_149">Like successive Governments, this Government are committed to reducing the number of people killed and seriously injured. That is why, in March 2000, we set out a strategy to deliver substantial reductions in road casualties. I remind the House of the targets we set: a 40&nbsp;per cent. reduction in all road casualties by 2010, with a 50&nbsp;per cent. reduction in the number of children who are killed or seriously injured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_150">Good progress has been made. For example, in 2003 we saw a 6&nbsp;per cent. fall in the number of people killed or seriously injured&#151;the biggest annual drop since the road safety strategy was launched four years ago. By 2003, the number of people killed or seriously injured had fallen by 20&nbsp;per cent., which means we are about halfway towards our 40&nbsp;per cent. target for 2010, and the number of children killed or seriously injured had fallen to just over 4,100, which is more than three quarters of the way towards achieving the 50&nbsp;per cent. reduction target for children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-21_para4">

 I am sure that my right hon. Friend will be aware of the tragic case in my constituency in which a young child, Rebecca Sawyer, was killed and her family seriously injured by a hit and run driver. The individual responsible had 89&nbsp;previous convictions, one of which was for causing death by dangerous driving. Does my right hon. Friend agree that the public need to be protected from such individuals, who kill and maim? As the Bill passes through the parliamentary process, will he examine in detail the possibility of introducing a new offence of causing death by aggravated dangerous driving, which could carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment?
</p>








<p><a name="st_143"><a name="50111-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 We all have the greatest sympathy for the family who were affected by that accident, and my hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the fact that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 214</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>many people are needlessly killed or seriously injured by bad driving. As a result of changes that have been made, the maximum penalty is, I think, 14&nbsp;years for causing death by dangerous driving. The Home Office is considering whether a series of aggravated offences should be introduced. Such offences are not in the Bill because the issue is still being looked at and further consideration is necessary, but most hon. Members would hope that the courts take incidents that involve death or serious injury on the road very seriously indeed. Someone who kills someone else using a car is just as guilty and just as culpable as someone who uses a weapon to do so. My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to what is happening.
</p>








<p><a name="st_144"><a name="50111-21_spnew2"><b> Mr. Paul Stinchcombe  (Wellingborough) (Lab):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend mentioned the ongoing Home Office review of the various offences where death is caused by bad driving. Will he prevail on the Home Office to look at an offence of causing death by careless driving? He might have already received a letter from my constituents, Mr. and Mrs. Melnik, about the tragic death of their 17-year-old daughter, who was killed recently by a careless driver. As no offence of causing death by careless driving is known to English law, the driver could not be charged with any offence that marked the fact of her death at all. He could only be fined&#151;a price paid for the loss of a life caused by criminal negligence of just &#163;500.
</p>








<p><a name="st_145"><a name="50111-21_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Again, I have a great deal of sympathy with what my hon. Friend says. The Home Office and my Department are looking at aggravated offences, because it is important that society can show its disapproval when someone causes death in that way. As I said just a few moments ago, killing someone with a car, where someone is culpable, needs to be dealt with. It needs to be treated by the courts with the utmost seriousness and, where necessary, exemplary sentences ought to be imposed. We should be very clear about the fact that someone who drives dangerously or carelessly and causes the death of someone who would otherwise be alive is just as guilty as if they took a weapon to them, resulting in their death.

It is important that we get such things right. Equally, as I said, despite the fact that our overall record is better than that of many other countries, today, like every other day, nine or 10&nbsp;people will be killed on our roads, and many of those accidents are avoidable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_152">There is no single solution to reducing the number of road accidents, and the right approach relies on a number of different measures. That is what we are doing: we are continuing to implement measures&#151;for example, more local safety schemes. We are continuing to roll out the safety camera programme. We are involved in the greater promotion of road safety under the Think! advertising campaign. Indeed, a new phase of the television advertising campaign is starting today in relation to speed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_153">We are also considering measures that can improve the dreadful statistics on motor cycle accidents. Although motor cyclists account for 1&nbsp;per cent. of road users, they account for 20&nbsp;per cent. of deaths and serious injuries on the roads. In particular, there is a need to get across to people who use motor cycles, sometimes infrequently, the fact that, used the wrong way, motor cycles can cause the death of the motor cyclist and, indeed, other road users.

<p><a name="st_150"><a name="50111-21_spnew8"><b> Mr. Ian Liddell-Grainger  (Bridgwater) (Con):</b> 
 One of the problems in the rural area that I represent is that websites are now challenging motor cyclists to compete at high speed in a circuit. We lost five motor cyclists in fatal crashes in the area last year. We have tried to get the websites shut down, with the help of the Home Secretary, but have failed. Will the Secretary of State please look to see whether we can do something about such things, which are killing people?
</p>








<p><a name="st_151"><a name="50111-21_spnew9"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 We are aware of those websites, and many hon. Members will have seen them. The problem is that people are encouraged to use motor cycles&#151;sometimes they are not used to riding powerful machines&#151;in places where they are led to believe that they can go fast, when there is some sort of challenge, and they end up killing themselves and others. As I said, motor cyclists account for 20&nbsp;per cent. of deaths and serious injuries on the roads. Over the past year or so, the statistics have been going the wrong way and there has been a rise in the number of motor cyclists killed or seriously injured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_154">The hon. Gentleman knows that stopping people putting things on websites is easier said than done. There is sometimes a fine line between what is acceptable and unacceptable. I am aware that in constituencies such as the hon. Gentleman&#039;s and others, especially if people visit them at weekends and so on, there has been an alarming rise in motor cycle deaths. The Government take that seriously, as should society. It is not just about the individuals involved, but about others as well.

 My hon. Friend may be aware that motor cycling organisations have put a number of proposals to the Government, one of which is a further test before someone drives a larger or more powerful motor bike. When I first looked at this matter I was surprised to find that someone such as me, who has held a driving licence for 30&nbsp;years and has never driven a motor bike, could buy a powerful machine and ride off on it tomorrow morning. The chances are that if I was not used to it I could get into difficulties. We want to consider that. I am bound to say to my hon.

Friend that nothing has been happening. Although deaths have been increased slightly, serious injuries have fallen. We have introduced a range of measures, and there are further measures in the Bill that I hope to discuss in the not too distant future which will help. Three things are necessary&#151;education and awareness; making sure that there is the right range of offences and penalties; and&#151;this is not in the hands of the House and the Government&#151;ensuring that people who administer the judicial system use the available powers so that if someone kills someone else, as my hon. Friend described, an appropriate penalty is visited on them. Road traffic offences should not be regarded as lesser offences. People are often left with the impression that although a death has been caused the perpetrator is dealt with quite differently from someone who sets out with a gun or something else.

<p><a name="st_157"><a name="50111-22_spnew5"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I am mindful of the point of order raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), and would like to make progress. I shall try, however, to let everyone who wishes to intervene do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_158">The first strand in the Bill tackles bad or reckless standards of driving. Research has shown that driver behaviour is a key factor in about half of all car fatalities. Excessive speeding needs to be addressed, because over 1,000&nbsp;people are killed and over 38,000&nbsp;are seriously injured every year as a result of speeding. The use of safety cameras is controversial and has been the subject of a great deal of discussion in the House over the past year. However, I repeat that cameras are one way of addressing speeding and road safety, provided that they are effectively placed. The latest independent research, which I presented to the House last June, shows that there has been a 40&nbsp;per cent. reduction in deaths and serious injuries at safety camera sites. Cameras are, of course, only one of a number of measures, but we are right to continue a policy introduced by the previous Government&#151;until fairly recently, it received bipartisan support&#151;as all the evidence shows that cameras reduce accidents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_159">Research suggests that the greatest reduction in road casualties would result from reducing excessive speeding. The Bill allows us to vary the system of penalty points to see what can be done further to discourage people from speeding excessively. That is controversial, so I shall I shall say a word about it. The Bill allows for a graduated structure of fixed penalty points. It does not introduce them, but it allows us, after statutory consultation, to introduce an order that would provide for a variable system of penalty points and fines. I made it clear in the preliminary discussion document that we published last September that there should be a variable system of penalty points and fines to make sure that the punishment fits the nature of the crime.

 I said that there would be interest in the matter, and I am happy to deal with all the points that my hon. Friends wish to make. However, first, I shall make two points. The Bill allows for a system of graduation, and the preliminary discussion document showed that a majority of people thought that a graduated system of penalty points was a good thing. It is fair to say that there is a division about how that graduation should work. The Bill, however, makes it possible to introduce a graduated system, which is essential. Once the Bill has become law, we will have a discussion about the nature of the scheme.
</p>








<p><a name="st_160"><a name="50111-22_spnew8"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his patience. A pedestrian hit at 20&nbsp;mph has a 95&nbsp;per cent. chance of survival, one hit at 30&nbsp;mph has a 50&nbsp;per cent. chance of survival, but one hit at 40&nbsp;mph has a 10&nbsp;per cent. chance of survival. I support the concept of graduated fixed penalties but, under clause 16, the Secretary of State seems to be suggesting a reduction in the penalty for some speeding from three points to two points. I am bemused by that, particularly in the light of what he said this afternoon about the seriousness with which he views speeding and the death that can result. The House might send the wrong message if it dropped the penalty for speeding from three to two points.


</p>








<p><a name="st_161"><a name="50111-22_spnew9"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Last September, I made it clear that I think it important that any penalty regime distinguishes between somebody who is just over the speed limit and somebody who had driven far too fast, especially in built-up areas. The point that I made then, which I repeat today, is that if someone is not caught by a speed camera, but is instead sent to court, the court itself makes that distinction, depending on the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_160">It comes down to whether or not we believe that by having a two-point penalty and a &#163;40&nbsp;fine, as opposed to a three-point penalty and a &#163;60&nbsp;fine, drivers will say, &quot;Oh, it is all right. I don&#039;t care.&quot; Most drivers start with the assumption that they do not want any penalty points or any fines. The point of the discussion document, which I introduced to find out people&#039;s views, was to see whether support exists for graduation, and the answer is yes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_161">Outside built-up areas, there is less of an argument, but in built-up areas people ask, &quot;Is it right to impose a two-point penalty and a 30&nbsp;to 40&nbsp;mph speed limit?&quot; Having considered that question for some weeks, the matter turns on whether people believe that a two-point penalty, as opposed to a three-point penalty, means that someone will be more likely to speed&#151;in other words, the difference is one point. I take a different view from my hon. Friend&#039;s and happen to believe that the proposal that I introduced in September is right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_162">Today, we are dealing with a Bill that allows graduation. Some people&#151;not, I think, the majority&#151;say &quot;no graduation at all&quot;, and their position is straightforward. After the Bill is enacted, we will be obliged to consult by statute. People must be able to see fairness and proportion in all laws, but I do not believe that the one-point difference that we are discussing, will mean that lots of people say, &quot;Well, it is all right to break a 30&nbsp;mph speed limit.&quot; I do not think that I am being inconsistent&#151;I would say that&#151;but I understand my hon.

 I want to push my right hon. Friend on that point. In the context of clause 16, is he therefore saying that he is open to persuasion that the arguments set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) might be a better solution than his initial feeling that a move down is possible? Is he open to persuasion, or is he taking a fixed view at this stage?
</p>








<p><a name="st_163"><a name="50111-23_spnew1"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 It will clearly be for the Secretary of State to decide the Government&#039;s final view after the Bill has been enacted. Last September, I recognised that the issue is controversial, but I thought that my proposal was fairer and more appropriate. However, it is self-evident that not only Second Reading, but Committee and the rest of the proceedings should be used to raise those issues in the House of Commons, and I am sure that my hon. Friend and others will make their views clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_163">At the moment, my view remains that my proposal from last September is reasonable, but we must consult formally, and when we consult there will be a specific proposal which will allow everybody concerned, whether organisations or individuals, to come forward, and the House will form a view. Throughout the past year or so, speed cameras have been a controversial issue. People understand that a balance must be struck between being fair to all of us, including those of us who drive, and remembering the purpose of speed cameras, which is to save lives. That point underpins my whole approach. We have to be fair and take people with us, but let us not lose sight of the fact that speed cameras do save lives and reduce serious injury. It is good that since we published the figures last summer we have heard rather less of the hysterical talk about removing every speed camera wherever it is.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_164">The Bill has other provisions on developing and using retraining courses for more serious speeding offences. They are based on the successful drink-drive rehabilitation schemes and are set out in clauses 24&nbsp;and 25.

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="50111-23_spnew2"><b> Ms Sally Keeble  (Northampton, North) (Lab):</b> 
 Can my right hon. Friend tell us about the Government&#039;s thinking on drink-driving, especially in relation to discussions with the Home Office about increased sentences for drink-driving and increased sanctions for uninsured or even unlicensed drivers, as in the major problem of kids taking cars and joyriding?
</p>








<p><a name="st_165"><a name="50111-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I will move on to insurance and roadworthy vehicles in a moment.

<p>
<a name="50111-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_165">Drink-driving is obviously a matter of major concern, and we continue to have discussions with colleagues in the Home Office in relation to that offence. It is worth bearing in mind the fact that despite all the campaigns of the past 30&nbsp;years, alcohol is a factor in nearly one in seven of all fatal crashes&#151;that is, nearly 500&nbsp;deaths a year. That must be dealt with. Up to 20&nbsp;per cent. of those drink-drive convictions concern the cases that my hon.&nbsp;Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeble) is particularly worried about, involving repeat offenders who are predominantly younger male

<br>&nbsp;<br>drivers. We must not only improve education, but improve detection and increase the number of people who are caught drinking and driving.
</p>








<p><a name="st_166"><a name="50111-23_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Kidney  (Stafford) (Lab):</b> 
 Will my right hon. Friend give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_167"><a name="50111-23_spnew5"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I want to set out what we are doing, and then I will give way to my hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_166">The Bill provides for the introduction of roadside evidential breath-testing, which is far more efficient&#151;it avoids the visit to the police station and saves police time&#151;and more effective. There is a secondary power under which we intend to make repeat drink-driving offenders&#151;for instance, someone who is automatically banned for three years after a second conviction&#151;retake their driving tests. That is justified. We are also making provisions concerning serious offenders in relation to their medical examinations, as there is a loophole there that needs to be closed. Finally, we are allowing for the future use of alcohol ignition interlocks, which have been shown to be effective in discouraging reoffenders in other countries. Those provisions are set out in clauses 14&nbsp;and 15.
</p>








<p><a name="st_168"><a name="50111-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 I support those three measures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_167">In 1998, when the Department for Transport was part of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, it estimated that lowering the legal limit from 80&nbsp;to 50&nbsp;would save about 50&nbsp;lives a year. Has my right hon. Friend&#039;s Department updated that estimate to today?
</p>








<p><a name="st_169"><a name="50111-23_spnew7"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 We continually keep the level of the limit under review. Most of the people with whom we deal are way above 80. Obviously, if the limit were lowered additional people would, by definition, be caught by it. However, at the moment the Government believe that the right level is 80. We always keep such matters under review. I am very conscious of the fact that our problem in this country, sadly, is that people are often not just over the limit&#151;there would be a stronger argument for a reduction if we were catching a lot of people on 82&nbsp;or 85&#151;but way over the limit. The people we must really have a go at are those who do not just do it once but are caught and second and a third time. The bigger problem, which I suspect would occur even were the limit dropped to, say, 50, concerns the people who believe that they can have one or two drinks and it will be all right. In some cases it is not all right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_168">For a long time, I thought that we were reaching a situation in which drinking and driving would become socially unacceptable&#151;that people simply would not put up with it and peer group pressure would take effect. Sadly, however, there appears to be a trend, especially among younger people, of saying, &quot;It doesn&#039;t matter.&quot; We need to get it across to people that drinking and driving can kill the driver, the driver&#039;s friends and others. We will keep the level under review but the Government currently believe that it is set at the right amount and have no plans to change it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_170"><a name="50111-23_spnew8"><b> Peter Bottomley  (Worthing, West) (Con):</b> 
 I believe that the Government are right to keep that under review and not to make a change. Since 1979, the number of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 221</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>deaths that have occurred when the driver or rider is above the existing legal limit has decreased from approximately 1,800&nbsp;a year to around 500. Even if the lower limit would bring the drivers involved in another 50&nbsp;deaths into the ambit of the law, it is far better, as the Secretary of State said, to concentrate on those who are over the current legal limit or have consumed twice that. Cultural change needs to continue so that drink driving does not go on even at its current rate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_169">Will the right hon. Gentleman report to the House if it transpires that countries with a lower legal limit turn out to have fewer drink driving deaths than us? While we continue to have fewer deaths than those countries, it is better to continue with an effective policy rather than do things that simply change numbers, not behaviour.
</p>








<p><a name="st_171"><a name="50111-23_spnew9"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I should certainly report to the House if such evidence emerged. However, the evidence, especially in continental Europe, does not show fewer deaths. My counterpart in France has been here to see what we do, because drinking and driving in France is a serious offence. Some countries in other parts of Europe have lower limits but no automatic disqualification. Drinking and driving is so important that it is right to signify our concern and disapproval through automatic disqualification of someone who is caught doing it. Of course, we will examine evidence not only from the rest of Europe but other parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_170">Two things will make a difference. The first is repeating the message that drinking and driving can kill. Secondly, if people believe that they are more likely to get caught than not, it concentrates the mind wonderfully. I therefore welcome the fact that many chief constables are turning their attention to the matter and recognising that it is a problem that needs to be tackled and regarded as seriously as other crimes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_171">I said that the Bill will increase penalties. The penalty for careless driving will increase from &#163;2,500&nbsp;to &#163;5,000. Driving using a hand-held mobile phone will become an endorsable offence. We will also unify the penalties for seat-belt offences in relation to children. There is currently a lesser penalty for not wearing a seat belt in the back seat than for not wearing one in the front seat. There is no good reason for that. We will also introduce a mandatory disqualification for a second offence of using a vehicle in a dangerous condition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_172">We believe that those measures taken together will send a clear message to those who persist in driving recklessly or irresponsibly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_173">The second strand of measures clamps down on drivers who do not respect the rules of the road. Recent research has shown that unlicensed drivers are six to nine times more likely to have an accident than drivers with road tax. We need to deal more effectively with the one in 20&nbsp;drivers who currently drive without insurance. We know from experience that they are high risk drivers who impose costs on the rest of us and can also cost lives. That is why the Bill includes several provisions to tighten up the regime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_174">The Bill will enable the police to make use of data already held by the motor insurance industry about vehicles that are not insured. Furthermore, for the first time, the police will be given the power to seize and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 222</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>dispose of vehicles that are uninsured, as part of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill, which is currently in Committee.
</p>

<p><a name="st_172"><a name="50111-24_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Louise Ellman  (Liverpool, Riverside) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 Does the Secretary of State accept that, although it is important to change the law to ensure that the Data Protection Act 1998&nbsp;does not impede fining people who drive unlicensed or uninsured, it is equally important that people who operate the system are aware of the law? When the Select Committee took evidence on that, we found a great deal of confusion about the state of the law.
</p>








<p><a name="st_173"><a name="50111-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 There is much to be said for clarity about the law, no matter what subject we tackle, but I agree with my hon. Friend and we clearly need to attend to the problem. It is important to stress that, shortly, especially when the MOT computerisation programme is completed, the police will be able to tell whether a car has got its MOT, whether it is taxed and whether the driver is insured. That information has not hitherto been available on a database to police officers, but it will be shortly. This will cut down on evasion. It will also make it easier for the police to take action if they find someone driving without insurance, a licence or an MOT.
</p>








<p><a name="st_174"><a name="50111-24_spnew2"><b> Kevin Brennan  (Cardiff, West) (Lab):</b> 
 Will the Secretary of State consider the problem of people who seek to avoid more serious charges by failing to identify who was driving a vehicle at the time of an incident? In a recent case, a constituent of mine, Tony Davies, was the innocent victim of a road traffic accident in which the two people in the other vehicle refused to identify who had been driving and got off with a lighter charge as a result. What plans does the Secretary of State have to deal with this issue?
</p>








<p><a name="st_175"><a name="50111-24_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 The Bill contains provisions to deal with that problem. Failure to disclose who was driving will result in a penalty of six points. My hon. Friend is right; at the moment, it might be open to a serious offender to refuse to identify who had been driving because they could get off with a lesser penalty as a result.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_175">We wish also to provide a new system of endorsement of driving licences that will allow non-Great Britain licence holders to be given fixed penalties for traffic offences. We are also seeking powers that would allow the police and other officers to take a deposit from non-GB licence holders in lieu of a fixed penalty, or pending a court hearing. This will ensure that overseas truck drivers do not escape punishment when they commit offences, as can happen too easily now. We are also seeking the power to enable the disclosure of driver and vehicle data to foreign authorities, when that would be important.
</p>








<p><a name="st_176"><a name="50111-24_spnew4"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 In regard to HGV drivers coming from abroad, will there be any discussions in Europe to ensure that the requirements are equalised? I am referring in particular to the restriction on insulin-dependent diabetics.
</p>








<p><a name="st_177"><a name="50111-24_spnew5"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Yes, such discussions are continuing with a view to reaching an agreement on those issues. As traffic between this country and the rest of Europe 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 223</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>increases, it is only sensible to try to ensure that people are treated in the same way. We particularly want to avoid a situation in which, for very good reasons, someone could be dealt with quite strictly here but could escape if they went elsewhere. This would benefit all the countries involved, and those discussions are taking place at the moment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_178"><a name="50111-24_spnew6"><b> Mr. David Marshall  (Glasgow, Shettleston) (Lab):</b> 
 Further to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) has just made on HGVs, the Secretary of State has not yet mentioned any measures relating to these vehicles. They are involved in a high number of accidents, especially during the night. These accidents often involve side impacts, and many of the drivers involved have said that this is because they did not see the HGV until it was too late. Has my right hon. Friend seen the evidence submitted by the organisation Reflect, which calls for ECE 104&nbsp;to become mandatory in the UK? This would require retro-reflective markings to be fitted to the sides of all HGVs. Does he accept that this is a good suggestion, and that that provision should be introduced throughout the whole of the EU?
</p>








<p><a name="st_179"><a name="50111-24_spnew7"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I have seen some of that evidence, and I know that it has been considered in Germany in particular. My understanding is that the evidence is still being evaluated, and that it is not overwhelming. However, the Government will look very seriously at anything that would reduce the number of accidents involving HGVs. My hon. Friend is right to say that HGVs are involved in a number of accidents, and we need to consider what we can do to reduce that number.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_176">The Bill will give the police and other authorities greater powers to deal with problems on the roads. This is supported by a strategy published this morning by my Department and the Home Office, which reaffirms road policing as a priority area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_177">The last strand of the Bill contains measures to improve driving standards, which is one of the most important elements of what we are doing. It is a fact that young and newly qualified drivers have a greater likelihood of being involved in an accident in their first year of driving. Indeed, one in five accidents involve a driver who has passed their test in the preceding year. Furthermore, 17&nbsp;to 21-year-olds represent about 6&nbsp;per cent. of licence holders, yet they are involved in about 12&nbsp;per cent. of all injury accidents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_178">The Bill will put in place measures to provide for higher standards for professional driving instructors and to regulate driving schools, including not only those who give instruction, but franchisees as well as employees. The aim is to ensure that drivers and riders of all types of motor vehicles are tested in accordance with the demands of today&#039;s traffic conditions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_179">In conclusion, the Bill will help to create a safer and fairer environment for motorists. It will provide additional protection for all road users, but especially the more vulnerable groups of pedestrians and cyclists.

<br>&nbsp;<br>pedestrians and cyclists. When cyclists are involved in road accidents, it is always up to them to prove that a motorist was the guilty party&#151;one presumes innocence before guilt&#151;but that can often be difficult. What additional measures will be put in place to protect cyclists and give them fair chances?
</p>








<p><a name="st_183"><a name="50111-24_spnew11"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 My law might be a bit rusty because it is 18&nbsp;years since I practised it, but I think that it is always necessary to prove the guilt of anyone involved in a road accident, so not only cyclists face that problem. My hon. Friend is right that we want to improve the safety of cyclists, and several measures in the Bill will help to do that, although they are not specifically aimed at cyclists. Education and other measures can help to improve cyclists&#039; safety. The onus of proof, however, applies to all road accidents, as it does to any other crime.

<p>
<a name="50111-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_180">The Bill contains many measures that will improve road safety, but I come back to a point that I made at the start of my speech: legislation is only one part of what we need to do. We must raise awareness and give courts the tools to deal with people who offend. We need to express the view that the courts will do their duty when people appear before them. The one thing that should unite us all&#151;I was struck by this the last time we discussed railway accidents&#151;is that 10&nbsp;people will die today in road accidents, so 10&nbsp;sets of families and friends will lose someone. It should weigh heavily with us that most such accidents are avoidable, so the country would expect the Government and the House to do everything possible to reduce the unacceptably large number of people who are killed every single day. I hope that everyone will support the Bill.

 To begin on a note of consensus, let me say that the Conservative party entirely shares the concerns that the Secretary of State and other hon. Members have expressed about road safety. For that reason, I am happy to make it clear at the outset that we will not divide the House on Second Reading, although my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and I will set out several changes and additions that should be made to the Bill, which we will try to achieve during its passage, especially in Committee.

<a name="stpa_181">Let me make some general remarks about road safety that pick up where the Secretary of State left off. We share the concerns expressed. However, despite the progress made over the years to reduce casualties in Britain and the fact that we are doing better than many European countries, we need to give the matter more attention. Although I have shadowed many briefs over the past seven years and served in several Government Departments, this is the first time that I have dealt directly with transport issues, and I am startled by our inconsistent attitude towards different types of transport.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_182">If 300&nbsp;people were killed in a railway accident there would be a huge public outcry and a major investigation, which would almost certainly be followed by policy change. If an aircraft accident caused the same number of deaths, there would be a detailed investigation, procedures would be examined and training and qualification standards would be overhauled. If a cross-channel ferry sank with the loss of 300&nbsp;lives, the most detailed inquiry would be held. But when 300&nbsp;people die on the roads, pretty well nothing is done, despite the fact that 300&nbsp;people die on our roads every month. All we seem to do is shrug our shoulders. Perhaps that extraordinary tolerance of road casualties is partly because they happen so often. Whatever the reason, it is not in any way a rational response.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_183">Dismissing road casualties as the inevitable consequence of driver error does not make sense. Every casualty represents a personal tragedy. The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Stinchcombe) referred earlier to the tragic case of Alexine Melnik, whose father copied the letter that he wrote to him to my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch. It is a moving document describing the tragic circumstances of his daughter&#039;s death and the unsatisfactory outcome of the case, with the verdict that it was an accident caused by a momentary lapse of concentration. As Mr. Melnik points out,

<a name="stpa_184">If someone had been carrying a loaded gun, and had accidentally shot and killed an innocent bystander, would that person face a charge of carrying a gun without due care and attention? Would the court have accepted a claim of a momentary lapse of concentration so readily? I am sure that Members on both sides of the House will have had similar cases brought to their attention, and that we all feel as strongly as those who intervened on the Secretary of State during his speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_185">The problem relates not only to drivers. The AA EuroRAP results show that driver error is not the only main factor. Some roads are much more dangerous than others. Imagine the horror that would rightly be expressed if the Strategic Rail Authority&#151;or, soon, its successor bodies&#151;were to publish a table showing that one was far more likely to be killed on a train travelling between Slough and Swindon than on one travelling between Milton Keynes and Rugby. That would not be tolerated for a moment. What would happen if the Civil Aviation Authority revealed data showing that some airports had consistently more aircraft crashing than others? Rightly, neither public opinion, nor the airlines, nor their customers, nor the authorities or anyone else, would accept that position.

If that happy eventuality comes about, however, and the British people have something to celebrate later in the year, I will require the relevant authorities, the Highways Agency and others, to assess what steps can be taken to reduce accident rates on roads classified as high risk&#151;marked in black on the AA EuroRAP map. In the first full term of a Conservative Government, we will extend that requirement to all roads classified as medium-high risk, which are shown in red on the same map.

 I am suggesting that we have clear data showing that some roads&#151;happily, a relatively small number&#151;are much more dangerous than others. We need to try to analyse what steps could be taken, and the hon. Gentleman may have just suggested one of them. I do not know whether changes in speed limit, for reasons such as he has described, are a factor on those high-risk roads. Given that we know that some roads are much more high risk than others, it is worth exploring whether simple steps&#151;such as the one that he suggests, perhaps&#151;could be taken to reduce those risks. I am sure that we would do that with any other transport mode, and we ought to start doing it with roads. Tolerating the idea that some roads are more dangerous than others seems simply unacceptable.

Particular concern arises when young males are driving with members of their peer group as passengers. Nothing in the Bill appears to address those challenges, which is a pity. Is it not time to explore new ways of encouraging more responsible driving by young men?

 What my hon. Friend says is absolutely true. The Secretary of State has been dealing largely with people who are insured and qualified to drive, but many accidents are caused by people, mainly young people, who are flouting the law by driving in the first place. They are actively encouraged by magazines and websites to save the money that could be spent on insurance for souping up their cars. Not enough is being done to clamp down on alterations that are made to cars: it is apparently still legal to soup up engines with nitrous oxide. People who are simply not capable of dealing with such powerful motors go out and flout the law, and get away with it.

<p><a name="st_192"><a name="50111-25_spnew5"><b> Mr. Yeo: </b> 
 That is an important point. I am sure that the encouragement that some newly qualified young drivers may receive from a variety of sources to act in the way described by my hon. Friend is one element of the problem. Another, of course, is the fact that penalties for driving without insurance are often lower than the cost of obtaining insurance. A number of issues need to be dealt with and, as I say, the Government do not seem to be taking sufficiently urgent notice of them&#151;in the Bill or elsewhere.

<p><a name="st_193"><a name="50111-25_spnew6"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 Should there not be a graduated system of driver licensing? Although the current arrangements have rightly been strengthened in recent years, they could be toughened even further by means of a two-stage approach. The first stage would restrict the size of vehicle that could be driven and the number of passengers carried; secondly, driving at night could be prohibited. One driver in 10&nbsp;is under 25, and one in four who are killed is under 25. As the hon. Gentleman says, there is an important link to be investigated.
</p>








<p><a name="st_194"><a name="50111-25_spnew7"><b> Mr. Yeo: </b> 
 That is an interesting suggestion. I think that we should adopt an evidence-based approach. If data suggest that particular types of driver are particularly prone to certain accidents, we may be able to identify measures&#151;such as graduated licensing&#151;to tackle that. I think that the Secretary of State accepted the principle when he expressed surprise at the idea that, with his existing driving licence and many years&#039; experience of driving a car, he could get on to a very powerful motor cycle and would not be restricted from engaging in what might be a more risky activity&#151;although I am sure that in the Secretary of State&#039;s case, it would not be. I have observed his measured approach to these and other issues over the past nine months or so, and I am sure that if he got on to a very powerful motor cycle, it would be equally measured.

<a name="stpa_190">A hollow laugh will greet the statement issued by the Secretary of State this morning&#151;and referred to, albeit briefly, in his speech&#151;about a new strategy for policing the roads. The Conservative party strongly supports the use of more police to tackle illegal and antisocial use of the roads, but this is the Government who have cut the number of traffic officers by 1,500&nbsp;since they came to power. In 1999, traffic officers were conveniently redefined to include operational and organisational support officers, who are employed to perform functions other than being out on the streets. The actual number of operational traffic officers, mainly on motor cycles or in patrol vehicles, has dropped even further&#151;perhaps by between a quarter and a third&#151;since 1997.

 I shall come to cameras in a moment, but the simple answer is that where cameras can be sited so as to reduce accidents, we of course support their use.

<a name="50111-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_192">The Bill contains a number of measures that are desirable in their own right, and will have our support. Overall, however, it is something of a hotch-potch of measures, rather than an absolutely coherent approach to the problem. It contains provisions directed specifically at the problem of drink-driving, and the Government are right to be concerned about that issue. The steady progress made in cutting the number of casualties resulting from drink-driving accidents seems to have halted in the past decade or so, which must be a cause for concern. I agree with the Secretary of State that more effective enforcement of existing drink-driving limits is essential if such progress is to be restarted, and we will want to explore how that can be done in more detail in Committee.

 I share the Secretary of State&#039;s view. The priority is to concentrate on people who are well above the limit, and on repeat offenders.

I believe that that is also the Secretary of State&#039;s view, and that of my hon. Friends as well. Let me emphasise that I approach the matter from a completely pragmatic point of view.

<a name="stpa_196">On speeding, I am delighted that the Government have adopted some Conservative party policies. Widening the range of penalty points that can be imposed for speeding offences is a good idea, and I am glad that the Government have seen the light. I wonder whether we could persuade the Secretary of State to go one step further. His Back Benchers expressed considerable interest in the idea, and it could be dealt with most effectively if we put directly into the Bill the range of speeds leading to different penalties, and the circumstances in which differential penalty points would be imposed. That would allow Parliament to be the arbiter, and there would be no uncertainty about it. I hope to pursue that point in Committee.

<p><a name="st_203"><a name="50111-26_spnew4"><b> Mr. Barnes: </b> 
 On speeding, I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman is going to mention clause 17, which deals with detection devices. It proposes a way to deal with the jamming of the police ability to detect whether speeding has occurred, and the ability to ascertain whether a speed detector is in the area. That is a valuable measure, but proposals advanced in legislation sometimes have unseen side-effects. Mark Cornwall, a constituent who runs Derby Car Parts Direct, told me that the firm, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>dealing in radar detector provision, will finish when the legislation comes into force. Yet it has developed technology that might be valuable and helpful in other respects. Perhaps the Secretary of State could help such firms to switch away from producing equipment that will become illegal, into legal products. That would be valuable.

<p>
<a name="50111-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_197">One of my concerns about our general approach to speeding is that it too often appears to be unrelated to an assessment of the risk. We have argued for lower speed limits to reduce accidents in certain areas&#151;close to schools, for example. At the same time, in my judgment, few things do more to bring traffic laws into disrepute than rigidly enforced 24-hour limits of 50&nbsp;mph on a four or six-lane dual carriageway. Given the good safety record of many motorways and trunk roads, it is surely time to consider raising the upper limit to 80&nbsp;mph in certain places.
</p>








<p><a name="st_205"><a name="50111-26_spnew6"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 I want to return to the issue of the big reduction in the number of traffic police, which has gone largely unnoticed. I agree with my hon. Friend that we need lower speed limits, such as exist in 20&nbsp;mph home zones, in school areas and residential areas with elderly people, of which there are many in my constituency&#151;but part of the problem is that they are not enforceable. The traffic police are not there to enforce those speed limits, just as they are not there to advise on traffic safety. This is not just a question of their being there on motorbikes with speed cameras; it is also about their advising on the setting of speed limits. The traffic police are no longer there. I endorse a more flexible approach, but that can work only without such a ridiculous reliance on the broad-brush approach to speed cameras, at the expense of experienced police traffic professionals.


</p>








<p><a name="st_206"><a name="50111-26_spnew7"><b> Mr. Yeo: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There is a well-founded suspicion that the Government strategy hitherto has been to encourage a proliferation of speed cameras to conceal the damage inflicted by cuts of between a quarter and a third in the number of operational traffic officers. As he says, that makes it much harder to introduce the more common-sense, risk-based and flexible approach to speed limits that we believe would go a long way to promoting safety and to winning public acceptance. A more flexible policy is the key, and the changes that I have suggested should be introduced in the context of a review of all speed limits.

<a name="stpa_198">It is well known that we share the concerns of those people who believe that in too many areas speed cameras are being used for revenue-raising purposes, and that they are not sited to achieve the maximum reduction in accidents. Because of that, once in government we will carry out an audit of all speed cameras to make sure that they are positioned where their impact will genuinely contribute to greater safety. Meanwhile, we should like two changes to be made to the Bill.

<a name="50111-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_199">The first change relates to clause 17, to which the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes) referred. It deals with devices that detect the presence of equipment used to assess the speed of motor vehicles, and with other devices that jam that equipment. I draw a distinction between those two types of device, and have no objection to the proposed measures against devices that jam. However, devices that detect the presence of speed equipment belong to a different category. If the Government believe their claims that speed cameras are sited so that they slow down traffic in places where accidents are likely to occur, it is clearly helpful for drivers to have advance warning of them, as they will then approach high-risk sections of road at a moderate speed. The only reason to outlaw detection devices is that the number of drivers who might get caught for speeding would be reduced, with the result that the revenue generated by speed cameras would be cut.
</p>








<p><a name="st_207"><a name="50111-26_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Ellman: </b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman explain his hostility to speed cameras? Independent evidence shows that they can reduce the number of accidents by about 40&nbsp;per cent?

<p><a name="st_208"><a name="50111-26_spnew9"><b> Mr. Yeo: </b> 
 As I have said already, my proposal is that we should audit the position of speed cameras. Where they cut accidents, we are delighted about the contribution that they make, but I remain unpersuaded that every speed camera is sited in such a position. The proposal in clause 17&nbsp;to outlaw devices that can detect speed cameras exposes the true intentions behind the positioning of many of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_200">Another aspect of the Bill is relevant in this respect. The Bill provides opportunities to make sure that speed cameras promote safety. We could table a new clause to abolish the so-called safety camera partnerships, which serve no real purpose. If the speed cameras were operated by traffic police, it is more likely that they would be situated where they would genuinely prevent accidents. It would also mean that a higher proportion of the money paid in fines would be used by the traffic police to promote road safety in general.

The growing frequency with which cyclists ignore red traffic lights or cycle along pavements means that for pedestrians, especially vulnerable pedestrians such as children, elderly people and disabled people, cyclists can be a danger. There is no logical reason why the provisions of clause 22&nbsp;should not apply to cyclists as well as to motorists.

There are about three traffic lights on that same journey, and it is unusual not to see a cyclist going through a red light. That is a danger to pedestrians. The hon.

They have had a son removed from their lives for ever.

<p>
<a name="50111-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_209">The Select Committee on Transport looked carefully at the Bill, because we thought that there were several straightforward questions that the House should ask. Is road traffic legislation correct and appropriate? Do the police have the right priorities in their attitude towards the whole question of policing traffic? Is there sufficient priority in legislation for the needs of pedestrians and cyclists? Could we do more to deal with dangerous drivers before they become lethal? Are we convinced that we need changes in responsibilities that will, almost inevitably, impinge on the way that we police our roads? Are we sure that those priorities are correct?

<p>
<a name="50111-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_210">My Committee looked carefully across the board. We found many good things in the Bill, but we are also concerned. Inevitably, the House of Commons ought to lead on such a subject. Frequently, when we frame laws, we give a general impression to the public about how we ought to deal with death and destruction that comes in the form of a road traffic accident.

So my Committee was concerned about what is missing from the Bill as much as what is in it.

I therefore ask the Secretary of State why we are still waiting a year after we were promised the Halliday report. Where is that report? Given the high public profile of the Home Office, which seems to concern itself with every aspect of our lives, why are we still waiting for that report to be published and brought to the House of Commons?

If the report has been published, has the Department for Transport seen it? Was it allowed to look at the complex legal issues and has its advice been sought in relation to the report&#039;s conclusions? It is extraordinary that the Home Office is not working much more closely with the lead Department on road safety because such things will make the difference.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_217">That brings me to the specific point of enforcement. It is essential that the Home Office realises that the failure to put road traffic among the core responsibilities of chief constables has meant that its importance is unevenly stressed across the United Kingdom. Some chief constables accept that legislation is vital and that the activity has to be regarded as seriously as other forms of criminal activity. Unfortunately, chief constables in some counties do not regard that activity as having the same implications as other activities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_218">The Select Committee was very concerned with the evidence and the responses we received from not only Home Office Ministers, but those who felt generally that there was no clear line of responsibility and that the pressure to take the matter seriously did not exist. If individual forces do not provide the people to police our roads and do not insist on the subject being taken seriously, we will see the results in terms of accidents. It is clearly a matter of cause and effect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_219">We have been given a long and, if the Secretary of State will forgive me, somewhat imprecise series of answers to the questions that we posed in our report&#039;s conclusion. I am still worried. Co-operation between the two Departments has not been demonstrated and there is no clear evidence of the urgency and targeting that should concern us. It is clear from our responses that most enforcement activity is carried out in 30&nbsp;mph urban areas. The &quot;Transport Statistics Bulletin&quot; on vehicle speeds shows that the percentage of cars exceeding the speed limit reduced from 69&nbsp;per cent. to 58&nbsp;per cent. in 2003. In other words, more than half of all cars in urban areas are speeding. By doing so, they are vastly increasing the risk to pedestrians and other motorists. How can we accept a statistic like that? How can we still, in 2004, be debating the same questions over and over again?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_220">Even today, the Opposition gave us a classic example of the muddle that exists. On the one hand, we appear to be saying that we want law enforcement, but on the other we are saying that we do not want to do anything that upsets the populace or the powerful motoring lobby.

<p>
<a name="50111-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_221">As a nation, we have to clarify what we want in our minds. While television programmes, motoring magazines and individual articles constantly emphasise that speed is clever, macho and directly connected with the male persona&#151;only alpha males know about speed&#151;we are inculcating in our young men, and often in our young people generally, a very dangerous thought. We should be saying, &quot;Yes, cars are important. Yes, you need them. Yes, you can use them. But they are killing machines.&quot; The damage done by tonnes of steel and glass hitting a body does not encourage us to believe that the subject should be treated lightly.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_223">The United Kingdom has a good road safety record. In fact, it is one of the best in the world. However, as we heard, there are still 10&nbsp;deaths each day on our roads. In 2002, the last year for which figures are available, 302,605&nbsp;people were injured on the roads, 3,431&nbsp;were killed and 35,976&nbsp;were seriously injured. As has been said, with any other mode of transport there would be a public scandal, and we can certainly do much to reduce the total. A number of measures can and should be introduced, including many in the Bill, although, as I shall explain, there are some serious omissions. My colleagues and I are happy to give the Bill our full support on Second Reading. We will give it our general and broad support in Committee, but I hope that some of my suggestions will be taken on board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_224">The UK generally has a good road safety record, but, interestingly, it masks areas of poor performance. For example, in 2002, 179&nbsp;children were killed, 58&nbsp;per cent. of whom were pedestrians, so the UK&#039;s child pedestrian record is one of the worst in western Europe. Two thirds of accidents in which people are killed or seriously injured take place on roads where the speed limit is 40&nbsp;mph or less. It is worth noting that 60&nbsp;per cent. of accidents occur on rural roads. There are worrying signs that positive trends that have been moving downwards for a number a years, including drink-driving, are now either static or increasing. The UK&#039;s generally good record can be improved through targeted action, so the Government are right to introduce the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_225">Clause 1&nbsp;allows Ministers in England and the National Assembly for Wales to fund road safety initiatives. That is a sensible power that will do much to improve the situation, and it is already available in Scotland. A substantial contribution to road safety can be made through road engineering and safety schemes as well as enforcement measures. We therefore support the initiative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_226">I have considerable concerns about graduated penalties, particularly for speeding. It is a long-established principle in British justice that punishment varies with the severity of the crime, so I do not object to the principle of graduated penalties or punishment. I am, however, concerned that the structure proposed in the consultation paper published last September ignores the outcome of the offence, particularly for speeding in towns and villages. An armed burglar receives a more severe sentence than an unarmed burglar not necessarily because of what they have done but because of what might have happened if they met someone while committing the crime. Two thirds of accidents in which people are killed or seriously injured take place where the speed limit is below 40&nbsp;mph.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_227">In areas with a 30&nbsp;mph speed limit, the consultation proposed a lower penalty of two points and &#163;40&nbsp;for speeds of up to 39&nbsp;mph. The chances of surviving the impact of a car travelling at 35&nbsp;mph are half those of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 238</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>surviving the impact of a car travelling at 30&nbsp;mph. I am therefore concerned that if the penalty were accepted for speeds between 30&nbsp;and 40&nbsp;mph the House would send the wrong message, suggesting that modest speeding in towns is acceptable. By contrast, the difference in outcomes when cars are travelling at 70&nbsp;or 80&nbsp;mph on the motorway is less stark. To a certain extent, the speed limits on motorways and dual carriageways, which are specifically engineered for faster speeds, are a compromise between our desire to travel quickly and our desire to travel safely while having regard to the environmental consequences of higher speeds. However, where there is mixed use of the road by pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders and others, particularly in built-up areas, the balance must shift from the car and the driver and towards pedestrians, who the suffer the effects. Observance of the 30&nbsp;mph speed limit is critical in reducing injury and death, and I hope that the Government take that point on board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_228">Almost every week, I travel up the A9&nbsp;on several occasions. I have followed cars driven at 50&nbsp;mph by respectable middle-aged people&#151;people such as me&#151;who do not slow down that much when they come to towns. I do 30&nbsp;mph as they whizz away. Many middle-aged drivers do not understand the difference between impacts at 30&nbsp;mph, 35&nbsp;mph and 40&nbsp;mph. They would think that one were a speeder if one passed them at 60&nbsp;mph on the open road, but they happily go through towns at 35&nbsp;mph or 40&nbsp;mph. That point is extremely important. Although we do not oppose graduation in principle, our support in Committee will depend on the detail of the likely outcome being fleshed out&#151;we have grave difficultly in accepting a two-point penalty for offences up to 39&nbsp;mph.

<a name="stpa_229">I support moves to ban detection and avoidance devices. It is crazy to have a law, yet allow the use of a device to stop detection. I used to know people who fitted such devices to their cars, and they were not people who would inadvertently drive a little bit fast. They actually wanted to drive a great deal faster than the legal limit and knowingly to break the limit. I am sorry to say that they are the most likely people to buy such devices, which I have no qualms in seeing being made illegal.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-28_para17">
<a name="stpa_231">Most sensible drivers&#151;the vast majority of the population&#151;now accept that drink-driving is a dangerous and serious crime. Together with sound enforcement, that change in attitude has seen a steady decline in drink-driving and drink-related accidents. However, it is worrying that that trend appears to have stopped and even to have reversed, with figures showing a rise in drink-related injuries and deaths over recent years. It has already been said that the rise has been accompanied by a fall in tests undertaken by police and the number of police who are on the road and who are available to conduct tests, although I must state that the percentage of tests failed has risen too. I cannot believe that a relationship does not exist between lower police numbers, fewer tests and higher drink-related accident rates.

<a name="stpa_232">This summer, I discussed drink-driving with the area commander in my constituency, who pointed out that one of the greatest worries is that many drink-drivers are not young people but middle-aged males. Again, the problem is not that those people have one drink too many, but that they consume as much as twice the limit. The trend by which people who should know better commit seriously-over-the-limit offences is very disturbing.

 A week ago, I had an interesting discussion with my mother. She said, &quot;Oh darling, I am so glad&#151;I have now been told how many glasses of wine I can drink and it&#039;s safe to drive.&quot; I said, &quot;Mama, you cannot do it like that, because there are different percentage rates of alcohol, and glass sizes are different. If you want to be really safe, don&#039;t do it all. If you happen to be just down the road and have half a glass, that&#039;s fine, but don&#039;t go any further than that.&quot; That is the problem. Middle-aged people think that the limit equals two or three glasses of wine, a couple of pints or three whiskies, but do not realise that depending on the metabolism of the person, the percentage by volume of the alcohol and the size of the glass, one drink may put them over the limit. Really, one does not drink and drive.

<a name="stpa_233">Although there is considerable merit in the proposal to reduce the permitted blood-alcohol level from 80&nbsp;mg to 50&nbsp;mg, there remains a big problem with people who are well over the limit, and we need to target them. The measures in the Bill are clearly sensible and will definitely help. However, we need to look again at the question of enforcement, as there is no substitute for traffic police officers who are able to stop people, make random searches and o ensure that offenders are kept off the roads.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_234">Much in the Bill is sensible and deserves our support, and I do not intend to touch on all those aspects. I have reservations about some of the details, such as the fees to be charged for recalled licences, but those can happily wait until Committee. I am more concerned about notable omissions from the Bill that I should like to be included. One partial omission relates to what can be done about uninsured drivers, who are a major danger on our roads. They cost a great deal in terms of money and lives, and create immense misery. That issue deserves to be tackled. Although clause 39&nbsp;will help, the Greenaway report made several recommendations that would have been of great value had they been included in the Bill and would have received support from all over the House. I hope that during the passage of the Bill the Government, perhaps with the aid of the Select Committee on Transport, will introduce further measures to combat that particular evil.

<a name="50111-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_237">Another example is the retro-fitting of bull bars. Many Members have commented on bull bars, which are completely unnecessary in this country. I can think of no circumstances, not even on a farm&#151;or, dare I say it, an estate&#151;where bull bars are a necessity. The retro-fitting of bull bars greatly increases the vehicle&#039;s danger in the case of impact with a pedestrian, and I encourage the Government to insert a clause to ban it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_238">I have highlighted another problem, which although not grave is none the less important, to the Under-Secretary in correspondence. Several local authorities would like to be able to put up repeater signs in 30&nbsp;mph limits, especially in rural areas where long distances may be travelled with some doubt about the limit. Local authorities of all hues and persuasions have asked me why they cannot erect repeater signs. According to the Under-Secretary&#039;s replies, they are not permitted to do so by law. Perhaps we could examine that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_239">Perhaps the most important point is framing a charge of causing death by negligent driving. An interesting debate was held in Westminster Hall at the beginning of September in which the subject was raised. Like many hon. Members, I am fully aware of the difficulty of framing such legislation but I have heard pleas for it from so many hon. Members and so many of our constituents that I believe it is incumbent on us as legislators to frame and introduce such a law. Again, I hope that the Government will be inclined to consider that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_240">I have a final suggestion. I doubt whether we can include it in the Bill, but I believe that it would make a difference. Several speakers have said that if the accident rate&#151;perhaps it should be more properly called the incident rate&#151;applied to any other industry or mode of transport, we would be up in arms. All other modes of transport have specific units that investigate accidents. We should consider establishing a dedicated road accident investigation unit so that we could understand centrally what caused each accident and learn and apply the lessons. That is probably too complicated to include in the Bill but I should like the Government at least to think about it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_241">The Bill contains many sound provisions. As I said, we are happy to support it on Second Reading and we shall support it in Committee, where we should like to make some changes.

 As joint chair of the all-party group on road safety, I am pleased about the Bill, which contains many welcome provisions. The Government&#039;s road safety strategy over the years has been progressive. It is worth repeating the Secretary of State&#039;s opening remark that we have one of the best road safety records in the world. However, it is essential to recognise that far more can be done.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_242">In 2003, the number of people killed and seriously injured fell to 37,215. Although I say &quot;fell&quot;, it remains a huge number, yet it is 22&nbsp;per cent. below the 1994&#150;98&nbsp;average. Nevertheless, the figure represents human beings who have been seriously damaged or are no longer with us. The number of children killed or seriously injured fell to 4,100, which is 40&nbsp;per cent. below the 1994&#150;98&nbsp;average. However, the figures still mean, as my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) said, that 10&nbsp;people, some of them children, die every day on our roads. Imagine the outcry if that happened on trains or aeroplanes. Although we have a good record and the Government&#039;s strategy has been progressive, a big problem remains.

<a name="50111-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_243">I do not want to go into too much detail about drink-driving because many other hon. Members have spoken about that. There had been advances until recently, but we have now reached a plateau and we might even go in the other direction. We should remember that 500&nbsp;people a year die because of drink-driving. That is a shocking statistic. I am pleased that the Bill will give police new powers to take drink-driving evidence at the roadside. As the Secretary of State said, that closes a loophole and we are all pleased about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_244">I wish that the Government had gone a little further, however, and introduced measures to bring the UK into line with most of the rest of Europe on drink-drive limits. I disagree with the hon. Members who said that there is no need for a reduction in those limits. I agree with Brake, the road safety charity, which is arguing for the limits to be brought down to the same level as those in Sweden. That would be 20&nbsp;mg of alcohol per 100&nbsp;ml of blood&#151;if we went for the European average, it would be 50&nbsp;mg&#151;and I think that that would be an acceptable level. The most up-to-date law on this is the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003, which makes provision for a limit of 20&nbsp;mg of alcohol per 100&nbsp;ml of blood for train drivers and pilots, and I do not see the logic of its provisions not applying to road users. I hope that the Government will reconsider this matter. Having said that, I congratulate them on some of the measures in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_245">I would like briefly to refer to Brake again, because I have been involved in its campaign, &quot;Watch out, there&#039;s a kid about&quot;. In 2003, the number of deaths on foot of children aged between eight and 19&#151;the age range in which children use the roads on foot without being accompanied by an adult&#151;went up by 26&nbsp;per cent. to 110, compared with 87&nbsp;the previous year. We also should note that, for children aged between five and 14, road deaths are the second biggest killer after cancer, so we should take this issue seriously. Again, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich on this matter. Brake recommends speed limits of no higher than 20&nbsp;mph&#151;and, where appropriate, 10&nbsp;mph&#151;around schools and in residential and built-up areas. I do not know why the Government do not accept that

 Unfortunately, I was attending a Committee when the Secretary of State made his speech; otherwise I would have spoken in this debate. The hon. Lady and I jointly chair the all-party group on road safety, along with one of the Liberal Democrat MPs. One of the things that I have tried to impress on the Government relates to the length of time that British summer time lasts. There is an increase of child road deaths in the winter months and, if the Government will not consider abolishing turning back the hour, I would like them to consider reducing the period of time involved. At the moment, we are on winter time for four or five months, but even a reduction of that period would have significant consequences, if the Government will not go the whole way and abolish it completely.

<a name="50111-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_246">The Bill contains proposals to deal with fatigue-related accidents, which account for about 20&nbsp;per cent. of deaths on motorways. I have been working on this issue with a small working group involving people from both the medical side and the road transport side. I welcome the inclusion in the Bill of measures to mitigate driver fatigue through the provision of picnic sites for motorway users and the better enforcement of EU rules on drivers&#039; hours. According to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, up to one fifth of accidents on motorways, and about 300&nbsp;fatalities a year, may be caused by drivers falling asleep at the wheel. We should take that statistic very seriously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_247">Although the Bill includes measures to address driver fatigue, I am worried that it does nothing to tackle the serious problem of drivers with undiagnosed or untreated sleep disorders. About 770,000&nbsp;people in the UK have a sleep disorder, many hundreds, if not thousands, of whom are driving on our roads today. People with untreated obstructive sleep apnoea&#151;a prevalent sleep disorder&#151;are up to 12&nbsp;times more likely that others to have a road accident. I have tried to take that up with the Department of Health, but the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), did not seem very interested, so I hope that Transport Ministers will talk to him and perhaps get a bit further than I did.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_248">The Royal College of Physicians has pointed out that there is an especially high incidence of sleep apnoea among professional drivers, as the condition is common 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 243</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in middle-aged men who are slightly overweight. A study of 35&nbsp;professional drivers at one depot found that nine of them were at extreme or high risk of the condition and that four others were at risk of other sleep disorders. Although the Bill addresses sleepy, yet otherwise healthy, drivers, I am concerned that it misses an important opportunity to tackle the worrying problem of accidents caused by drivers with undiagnosed or untreated sleep disorders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_249">I shall cite one example. In August 2003, John Stevens died in a road accident while driving to work. He was 41, with a wife and two young sons. As a motorway roadworks technical manager, John&#039;s job involved driving long distances and he was an experienced driver. In the year leading up to the fatal accident, John had become progressively sleepier during the daytime, despite sleeping for seven hours each night. He did not think that the sleepiness could be due to a medical condition, even when he suffered a minor accident after falling asleep at the wheel. His employers eventually insisted on a medical check and he sought help.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_250">John&#039;s general practitioner diagnosed sleep apnoea and referred him to a clinic for diagnosis and treatment. Almost all patients who need medical treatment go on a long waiting list, and three months before John&#039;s appointment, he crashed his car with fatal consequences. That demonstrates just one example of the devastating effect of the lack of awareness of sleep disorders in the UK and the importance of speedy diagnosis and treatment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_251">I recently met Professor John Stradling, who told me that there is a currently a seven-month waiting list for diagnosed patients to receive treatment for sleep apnoea, so at any one time hundreds of people could be waiting for treatment or diagnosis. A joined-up response from the Department for Transport and the Department of Health is required to tackle the problems caused by sleep disorders, because the number of people affected is not small. Such people are ticking time-bombs on our roads and motorways. I urge the Government to seize the opportunity to address the matter in their proposals on driver sleepiness. Edinburgh university sleep centre puts the cost of treating 500&nbsp;sleep apnoea patients for five years at &#163;400,000, yet the cost of accidents caused by the same 500&nbsp;untreated patients over the same period is put at &#163;5.3&nbsp;million, so I hope that the fact that I have raised the matter will encourage the Department for Transport to examine it. Additionally, under criminal law, it is no defence that a driver had an accident while asleep. The presumption is that the driver should have known that he or she was likely to have fallen asleep and thus not have driven. That is an unfair presumption to make about people with sleep disorders who do not know that they have such a medical condition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-30_para6">

 My constituents will welcome much that is proposed in the Bill. In Bournemouth, in 2003, more than 20&nbsp;per cent. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 244</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>fewer road casualties occurred than in 2002. That is a considerable decline, which will undoubtedly be enhanced by some of the measures contained in the Bill. We have seen such declines previously, however, only to see them equally dramatically reversed a year or two later. The fact remains that the average number of serious and fatal casualties in Bournemouth has been the same over the past 10&nbsp;years&#151;103&nbsp;citizens killed or seriously injured on our roads every year. That means 100&nbsp;partnerships and families temporarily or permanently deprived of a loved one because of carelessness or irresponsibility on our roads. I am therefore encouraged that all parties in the House are approaching this Bill in a constructive spirit of support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_253">All of us have received representations from interested parties expressing concern at some of the measures in the Bill and proposing amendments to improve it. Such representations apply to the range of points and fines available through the fixed-penalty system, on which I read the article by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) in <i>The Times</i> yesterday with great interest. I must declare an interest because of my current six penalty points for speeding, in which I suspect that I am not alone in the House. I was sorry to read that one hon. Friend has recently been banned from driving&#151;there but for the grace of God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_254">I agree with those who say that the current penalty point system needs to be revised. Of course, I do not object to the provision of safety cameras provided that they are placed at obvious and known places of accidents caused by speeding vehicles. We have been reassured by the Government that that is the case, and I hope that the Minister will repeat that in his wind-up today. I welcome the commitment given by my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) that the next Government will audit the current provision of safety cameras to re-justify their location.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_255">There is no doubt that safety cameras influence most of us to keep our speed within the law. It is not so much the minimum fine of &#163;60&nbsp;but the awful prospect of being deprived of driving, and thus, in many cases, of livelihood, which concentrates the mind wonderfully. I suggest that most of us do not exceed the speed limit deliberately, and that we do so neither purposely nor excessively: for example, when temporary cameras are put in place on roads that are being repaired and that are not clearly indicated. That was the case when I incurred both my penalties. That is no excuse, but is unfortunate. I therefore agree with the proposed variable, graduated system of penalty points, which differentiates levels of speed. In addition, I suggest that the fixed minimum fine be raised from &#163;60&nbsp;to &#163;100. That would be fairer, and also effective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_256">I welcome the enforcement of legislation against uninsured drivers in the Bill. The Royal Automobile Club tells us that the current average penalty for driving without insurance is &#163;150, which is far too lenient to discourage such extremely serious and irresponsible behaviour. The current cynical perception of many uninsured drivers is that there are not enough police patrolling our roads to apprehend them, and, of course, they will avoid on-street parking where they can. Better detection, as the Bill proposes, together with higher penalties and proper enforcement would change that perception and the practice; nor should foreign drivers be exempt.

<a name="stpa_257">I agree completely with the provision of motorway rest areas, which will contribute greatly to the reduction in fatigue-related accidents, but surely we do not need to pilot the provision of such rest areas, because of their obvious effectiveness where they already exist.

Such accidents are unavoidable, and they must not be allowed to happen. The same applies to accidents and near-misses at night involving cars and bikes without lights. It seems to me that too many cyclists nowadays do not display lights at night. They are putting themselves at needless risk, yet it remains the motorist&#039;s responsibility to avoid them. Any programme to improve road safety must include a relentless policy of zero tolerance by the police of cyclists who ride without lights at night.

 Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate. Let me state at the outset that I not only welcome the Bill; I believe it to be vital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_263">We live in a society, and an age, in love with the car. We all know how powerful the road lobby is. It can bring the country to a standstill over the price of petrol; it can fill our postbags with letters of disgust whenever someone is caught breaking the law speeding. I do not say that by way of an attack on the motorist&#151;I am one&#151;but in simple recognition of the way in which most of us live today. In rural areas, the car is often the only effective means of transport. For many in urban areas, it remains absolutely essential to our work. In some ways, perhaps, the car is even a badge of personal freedom. For many of our youngest drivers, for example, the car marks their coming of age&#151;an outward sign of their adulthood. The first driving lesson might be a cherished present from mum and dad; for some, their first car might even be the reward for getting through the test. For them, the car is literally and metaphorically a rite of passage.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 247</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_264">But along with that comes a big responsibility. A car, however beautifully designed, is not a comfortable air-conditioned extension of one&#039;s front room. For all of us, the car is a potentially lethal weapon that not only can kill but does kill. It killed my teenage cousin. It kills 10&nbsp;people in this country every day, and 3,500&nbsp;every year. The Bill will help to reduce that number, thereby saving lives and reducing grief. That is why I welcome it today&#151;as we all should&#151;and warmly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_265">However, I do not welcome the Bill unconditionally. Although it is good, it can be improved in several ways, one of which I wish to discuss. We need to rewrite the law concerning cases in which bad driving causes death. At the moment, a wide range of charges are available to deal with those who drive below the standard that the criminal law requires, yet at the heart of that law there is a yawning gap: the complete absence of the offence of causing death by careless or negligent driving when not under the influence of drink or drugs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_266">The extent of that gap is readily apparent from the sentences available for the various offences for which charges are most usually brought. For dangerous driving, the maximum penalty is two years in prison. For causing death by dangerous driving, the maximum penalty rises to 14&nbsp;years in prison&#151;a 12-year difference, to mark the gravity of life being lost. For careless driving, the maximum penalty is a fine and points on the licence. For causing death by careless driving when under the influence, the maximum penalty rises to 10&nbsp;years in prison.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_267">But what about causing death by careless driving when not under the influence of drink or drugs? That is not even an offence known to English law. The maximum penalty is exactly the same as for any other case of careless driving in which no life is lost&#151;just a fine and points on the licence. I find that absolutely bewildering. The law has created two offences&#151;dangerous driving and causing death by dangerous driving&#151;with markedly different potential penalties. The reason for that can only be that the law generally regards cases where driving of the same unlawful standard causes loss of life as more serious than cases where such driving causes just a dent or a scratch to a vehicle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_268">Moreover, there is a good policy reason for that differentiation. It underlines in law the simple fact that cars can kill, so all of us must be especially careful when we take to the road in them. Why, then, is the same principle not consistently applied to careless driving? Where is the sense in the law considering dangerous driving, but not careless driving, as much more serious when a life is lost? There is no sense. The law contains a gaping hole&#151;the absence of any offence of causing death by careless driving&#151;and in one way or another it needs to be filled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_269">That gap needs to be filled not just for legal neatness, but to meet the concerns of those who suffer the grief of loved ones being killed by careless drivers. All Members will have recently received a letter from my constituents, Peter and Tracey Melnik, about the death last year of their daughter, Alexine. Alexine was returning home with her boyfriend and friends from a pop concert in Great Yarmouth, when the car in which she was a passenger was hit from behind and pushed into the path of oncoming traffic.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 248</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_270">Everybody else escaped the accident uninjured, but Alexine died. She was only 17&nbsp;when she was killed by a careless driver. The driver was charged, and Peter and Tracey went to court, hoping for some semblance of justice and a sense of closure. The driver was found guilty and sentenced, but because he was charged only with careless rather than dangerous driving, and because he was neither drunk nor under the influence of drugs, the fact that he killed Alexine through his unlawful careless driving&#151;in short, his criminal negligence&#151;simply did not matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_271">No offence of causing death by careless or negligent driving is known to English law, so that driver could be charged only with careless driving, for which offence he could only be fined and have points on his licence. In the end, for killing Mr. and Mrs. Melnik&#039;s daughter through his criminal negligence, the driver received just a &#163;500&nbsp;fine and nine penalty points. The total value placed on the life of their child was &#163;500. Furthermore, because the driver pleaded guilty, there was no need to go through in detail the nature of the careless driving that caused her death. There was no forensic examination of the evidence, no detailed consideration of the circumstances leading to the loss of Alexine&#039;s life, and no questioning of why he failed to brake in time. There was just a plea and a &#163;500&nbsp;fine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_272">Little wonder that Peter and Tracey Melnik left the courtroom with no sense of closure, just a burning sense of injustice to add to their agonising grief. That is why they have written to all hon. Members to suggest that the Bill should be amended to prevent anyone else having to go through that again. I pay personal tribute to them for the courage and dignity of their campaign, and I agree with them. Like Peter and Tracey, I do not believe that the existing structure of the law can possibly be justified, and I believe that this Bill can be the legislative vehicle for making the improvement that needs to be made. It can easily be amended.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_273">Perhaps surprisingly, an alternative method could be an amendment to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill. I am advised that either Bill could properly be amended to fill the gap. All we need is a simple amendment to create an additional offence of causing death by careless or negligent driving when not under the influence of drink and drugs. Then we need to legislate to create for that offence an appropriate maximum prison sentence, perhaps of seven years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_274">In so arguing, may I make it clear that I do not want all cases where careless driving causes death to result in custody? I am a trustee of the Prison Reform Trust and spend much of my time arguing that fewer people should go to prison, not more. I believe, however, that it should be possible to sentence more seriously if the facts of any given case merit it. Legislating to create that opportunity would mean that the facts surrounding any road death caused by carelessness would have to be properly considered in court to ensure that the sentence passed was appropriate, matched the degree of carelessness, and reflected the fact that a death occurred. At the moment, as in Alexine&#039;s case, that simply does not happen. In the future, it must surely be possible.

<a name="stpa_275">On behalf of Alexine&#039;s parents, I ask my right hon.

It is absurd that cases can be brought to court yet the question of the death caused is never exposed because of technicalities such as those that we have heard about. It is absurd that the structure of our law does not consider death to be at the centre of such cases. Although such a provision may not be appropriate for this Bill, I think that the House should look for an appropriate mechanism to adapt the law so that the principle that I have outlined can be addressed.

It is important that the House should be seen to take a lead in the matter, and to say that the total number of deaths on our roads is far too high. The fact that those deaths

<a name="stpa_281">We need to find practical solutions, and the Bill contains some ways to make progress in that respect. Training is important. We should consider whether drivers should be more actively encouraged to raise their skill levels&#151;for example, by taking advantage of the help offered by the Institute of Advanced Motorists. That does not apply only to middle-age people, as the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) implied. It also applies to young people, and it is encouraging that in my own area there is a sprinkling of very young drivers&#151;the number is growing all the time&#151;who want to take advantage of the high-quality extra tuition that the IAM provides. Perhaps we can take the opportunity, not necessarily by writing it into the Bill, but by engaging in dialogue with insurance companies, for example, to create massive benefits for drivers who undergo such extra training. People who do that are made aware of the risks that they face on the road.

The Home Office, the Department for Education and Skills, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the successor to the Lord Chancellor&#039;s Department, and the Department of Health are all important players. We need a joined-up approach to the problems facing us.

<a name="stpa_283">There are some aspects of the Bill that cause me concern. I have serious reservations not about the principle, but about the way in which the Bill deals with variable graduated points. I agree with the comments of the hon.

I can see the merits of graduation, but I believe that we should start at a higher base point. I also agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon), who called for a reduction in the drink-drive limit. Real benefits would accrue from that. However, I do not disagree with the analysis of my right hon.

<a name="stpa_284">Finally, I shall deal with technology issues. I am a great fan of technology, from such simple devices as speed cameras to enormously powerful technology such as the new advanced number plate recognition tools.

<br>&nbsp;<br>that when we deal with that part of the Bill in Committee, we will look at the technical issues and set standards.

<a name="stpa_286">I want to talk briefly about two families who were affected by fatalities. David Burrows, the son of my constituent Keith Burrows, was killed tragically only a couple of hundred yards from my home, before I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;became a Member of Parliament. Ever since, Mr.&nbsp;Burrows has worked tirelessly for road safety, and became a local councillor so that he could put road safety at the heart of local civic life. There is still a problem with that stretch of road, however. Sadly, there have been more accidents and last year there was another fatality.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_287">One of the problems is that we seem to move so slowly when dealing with these things. The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) mentioned repeater signs. There is a 30&nbsp;mph limit on the stretch of road where the accidents took place, but as it is a dual carriageway no one really keeps to the limit. Over the past seven years, since I have been a Member, I have raised the problem periodically and although I can understand the Government&#039;s response, there must be some way of telling people clearly that there is a speed limit on that road and that it must be adhered to. There is a strong case for speed cameras in the area. All the local people, even those who complain when they are caught by speed cameras, would have no hesitation in saying that cameras would prevent fatalities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_288">The second family are the constituents of the Minister for School Standards, the hon.

George and Julietta Galli-Atkinson&#039;s daughter, Olivia, was killed tragically when a car mounted the pavement where she was standing. They have instituted annual Olivia awards to recognise all aspects of the work of traffic police officers&#151;from those who counsel the bereaved to those who are out on the streets. I pay tribute to all the parents and families who have suffered traumatic loss and to those who work so hard for them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_289">A common theme, to which the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Stinchcombe) referred, is the feeling that there is a lack of appropriate offences and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 252</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that sentences sometimes do not reflect the gravity of the offence. I am not saying that we should impose minimum sentences; we cannot legislate for every eventuality, but the courts must be able to recognise the gravity of offences and if that needs a change in the law, the Bill offers the opportunity to introduce it and to bring in a new offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_290">As the Secretary of State said, the answer is not just legislation; it is very much about education, and in that regard I want to mention a couple of the things that really irritate me when I am driving. I am sure that lots of the things I do irritate other people, but I want to get these off my chest. I do not know whether we can legislate; indeed, some things are already covered by legislation. It is one thing to introduce laws, but we should also ensure that existing laws are observed&#151;to echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) and others. No matter what technology is introduced, there is no substitute for police officers.
</p>

<a name="stpa_291">I abhor tail-gating, especially by the cabs of heavy-goods vehicles that have released their loads. The drivers are on their way home and travel at high speeds along motorways close behind other vehicles. That is incredibly dangerous and it seems to be a common practice.

<a name="50111-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_292">Without upsetting cyclists too much, I would echo the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Atkinson). Increasingly, I see cyclists&#151;young children&#151;out at night without lights switched on, and we must imagine what it would be like for people if they hit those cyclists and the trauma that it would cause them and, obviously, the victims themselves.

I see children climbing over from the front to the back while the cars are moving. Every day, I see people not only using mobile phones while driving, but drinking coffee and reading maps or even newspapers while doing so.

 In view of the shortness of time, I will restrict my comments to two issues. We have heard a wide consensus indeed in the House this afternoon. I greatly welcome that and hope that it is continued throughout our consideration of this very good Bill, which I support enthusiastically. Like many of my colleagues, my misgivings about the Bill are that it does not go far enough and are not about what it contains.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_294">While listening to the debate from the Back Bench today, I have been reflecting on the importance of road safety cases&#151;a point that has been made already. I was formerly a solicitor in a small market town in Shropshire. During the relatively short time that I worked there&#151;about eight years&#151;four young people were killed in different road traffic accidents. Although 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 253</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I did some criminal law at about the same time, no other deaths of young people ever came across my desk during my work there. That gives some idea of impact that road safety issues have on our constituents. We have heard today, with great eloquence in a well-argued speech, from my hon. Friend&#151;my good friend&#151;the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Stinchcombe), about the impact that deaths can have on all our communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_295">I want to talk briefly about the graduated points system. I have a great deal of respect for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, but he lost me in his arguments this afternoon in putting the case for reducing the number of penalty points from three to two. We all know that speeding drivers are more dangerous than drivers who do not speed. We all know that the faster people drive, the more dangerous they are. In that context, I cannot for the life of me understand how it makes sense to reduce the number of penalty points imposed for a speeding offence from three to two. I have grave concerns about that. I have no difficulty with the concept of a graduated points system. If clause 16&nbsp;was amended to refer to a range of three to six points, I am sure that that would carry widespread support throughout the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_296">My second concern relates to an omission from the Bill. This is a road safety Bill and road traffic offences, particularly those that cause serious injury or death, are very important matters indeed in our constituencies. Our constituents find it completely frustrating that no offence can be brought before the courts that reflects the gravity of the death of an individual, when someone who is at fault causes that death while driving a vehicle. In short, our constituents cannot understand why there is no offence of causing death by careless or negligent driving.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_297">We fail as legislators if we do not address that concern. John Halliday has been investigating that lacuna in the law since July 2003. The Home Office, to which he will report in due course, has been giving assurances to Members of Parliament and to members of the Transport Committee, on which I serve, that the issue will come to the House and be addressed, but we are still waiting for that. The Bill gives us the appropriate opportunity to address the huge gap in the law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_298">One of the cases with which I dealt when I was a solicitor in Oswestry involved a 19-year-old motorist who was travelling down the A5, a road that my hon. Friend the Minister knows well. Three passengers in the vehicle that he was driving were killed in a road traffic accident. For a year afterwards, the case proceeded through the courts, based on an allegation of causing death by dangerous driving. I represented the driver and at no stage was there sufficient evidence to justify such an allegation. However, I think that the effect of three deaths, and the importance of those deaths to the families concerned, caused the prosecuting authorities to decide to proceed with the allegation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_299">Ultimately, a year on, that case was thrown out in the Crown court. As a result, the families of the three people who were killed felt badly let down by the criminal justice system. Equally, the individual who was acquitted felt let down because he had been awaiting trial for 12&nbsp;months and did not consider that the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 254</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>allegation was ever justified. An offence of causing death by negligent driving would have allowed the case to be dealt with quickly to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. There would have been an element of closure for the families and even for the defendant, who was devastated by the impact of the accident.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_300">Every hon. Member has said that they believe that that offence is justified. It is incumbent on us as legislators to act now, to wait no longer and to ensure that the offence of causing death by careless or negligent driving is available to our courts so that bereaved families can have justice.

 I declare my non-pecuniary interest in that I co-chair the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety. The approach of PACTS is strictly non-party political. I want to praise successive Governments and Parliaments for keeping the politics out of road safety for decades. The great gain from that has been to our society as a whole, with a huge reduction in the number of people killed and seriously injured on our roads over that time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_301">However, it is valid to make the point that last year, for the first time in a number of years, the number of fatalities in the statistics for those who were killed or seriously injured went up instead of down. We should not read too much into one year alone. Longer term, the trend in killed and seriously injured is still clearly downward, but as we have heard so movingly so many times, every loss of life on the roads is a tragedy. So I want to concentrate on ways to reduce the fatalities on our roads.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_302">I very much support calls for a wider range of offences and tougher sentences for killing by driving, as that would meet the public desire for justice and provide an opportunity to introduce further deterrents against the careless use of dangerous vehicles on our roads. I want to focus on preventive measures but, because of the limited time left for Members who wish to speak, I shall ditch most of them and concentrate almost entirely on drink-driving. However, I urge all parliamentarians to have regard to the report by the advisory group on motorcycling, given the huge increase in motorcycle deaths last year. I urge all employers to have regard to the guidance from the Health and Safety Executive on work-related driving. I alert the world in general to the huge gains from technological solutions, including intelligent speed adaptation, which can reduce fatalities further in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_303">To keep my contribution short, I shall concentrate on drink-driving. Ever since laws on drink-driving were introduced, the legal limit has been 80&nbsp;mg of alcohol in 100&nbsp;ml of blood. That limit has served us well, and is robust and well-understood. However, because of changes in the law, the practices of modern society and the retailing and marketing of alcoholic drinks, it is time to reduce the limit from 80&nbsp;to 50&nbsp;mg. After significant falls, there was a plateau in the number of deaths in the 1990s. As a couple of Members have pointed out, the number of drink-driving deaths has been creeping up. Since 1998, when it was 460, it has risen by more than 20&nbsp;per cent., and last year it was 560. In 2003, 19,000&nbsp;casualties were caused by alcohol-related crashes. The Government consulted on whether to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 255</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>change the limit in 1998, and in its consultation document the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions predicted that, as a result of reducing the limit from 80&nbsp;to 50&nbsp;mg, 50&nbsp;lives a year would be saved. Using rough statistics, 97&nbsp;per cent. of drivers either have no alcohol at all in their system or less than 50&nbsp;mg. Those drivers are not anywhere near the present limit and most of them would not change their behaviour if it were reduced to 50&nbsp;mg, as they are within that limit. Those people cause hardly any of the deaths on our roads, and their behaviour would be unlikely to change in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_304">As some Members have said, about 2&nbsp;per cent. of drivers have no regard at all for the legal limit and far exceed it. They are often caught two, two and a half or three times over the limit. I concede that changing the limit from 80&nbsp;to 50&nbsp;mg will not make much difference to their behaviour. Our priority for them must remain enforcement, tough sentences and, to some extent, education and publicity. The final 1&nbsp;per cent. of drivers are close to the present legal limit, and attempt to stay within the law. They are just under, just over or at 80&nbsp;mg, and are responsible for a significant number of deaths on our roads. One assumes that they would adjust their behaviour in accordance with the new limit. They may not be within it, but they would try to keep to it, and would probably be a little under, about the right level or a little bit over. The latest assessment based on the 2003&nbsp;statistics on alcohol-related deaths on our roads was made by Professor Richard Allsop of the centre for transport studies, University College London, who estimated that we would save 65&nbsp;lives a year if we reduced the limit from 80&nbsp;to 50&nbsp;mg, and if 1&nbsp;per cent. of drivers changed their behaviour to the extent that I described. That gain is worth having. The target is continually to reduce casualties, and it is reasonable to expect a contribution through the reduction of fatalities caused by drink-driving, but such a contribution is not currently being made. In addition to enforcement and education, we must change the limit.

 I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument. How are the statistics relating to those motorists who are just under the limit collected? I understand how figures are available for drivers whose tests show 81, 82&nbsp;or 83&nbsp;mg of alcohol, but how on earth do we know whether a driver has a figure in the mid-70s? If we do not know the figures, does that not destroy the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument? Those who break the existing law, not those who are just under the limit, are the problem.

 The right hon. Gentleman has a point in the sense that we cannot tell who has been breaking the law if people are not prosecuted. If people are killed, however, an assessment is made&#151;in assessing why they died, the alcohol content in their blood is tested for the coroner, so we have the statistics to make an assessment. The up-to-date assessment is that about 130&nbsp;deaths involve the 1&nbsp;per cent. of drivers who are somewhere near the legal limit.

<br>&nbsp;<br>In 2001, the Commission recommended that all countries should adopt the same limit of 50&nbsp;mg. That has not happened and, as hon.

I know that they say that most people are familiar with the present law, that enforcement is effective, that the penalties are tough and that we do not want to distract from the present regime by changing the law as well.

 I welcome the Bill, which is an important contribution to reducing deaths, accidents and injuries on our roads. It is unacceptable that 10&nbsp;people per day die on our roads, and it is also unacceptable that 90&nbsp;people per day are seriously injured on our roads. We sometimes underestimate the importance of serious injury through accidents&#151;injuries can mean blighted lives.

<a name="50111-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_308">Given the shortage of time, I shall concentrate my brief comments on my two areas of concern. First, although the Government are well aware that speed kills and have shown in many ways how they want to deal with the issue, it is ironic that the unintended consequence of the proposal on graduated speeding fines, as it has been introduced for consultation, is that speeding in 30&nbsp;mph zones could result in a reduced penalty. It is known that a pedestrian hit at 30&nbsp;mph has a 50&nbsp;per cent. chance of survival, while 90&nbsp;per cent. of those hit at 40&nbsp;mph die. Indeed, a pedestrian hit at 35&nbsp;mph is twice as likely to die as one hit at 30&nbsp;mph.In view of those facts, I ask the Government to think again before the Standing Committee considers the proposal for graduated penalties. Given the severe consequences, hon. Members should have more information about the Government&#039;s intentions before they are asked to vote for that principle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_309">The second area to which I should like to draw attention is that of culpability for death or injury on the roads. Like other hon. Members, I ask the Minister to pursue with the Home Office the long-awaited publication of the Halliday report. All the evidence 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 257</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>shows that death because of accidents on the roads is viewed far less seriously than death caused by any other means. That is simply unacceptable. When the Transport Committee recently took evidence, it became clear that bereaved families, among others, lack confidence in the system. There are worries about investigations at the scene of accidents and whether sufficient evidence is gathered and sufficient attention given to the possibility of culpability, and about the number of charges brought by the Crown Prosecution Service concerning careless, rather than dangerous, driving. Surely it is not right to put together and equate offences that include reading a newspaper and turning into a minor road and colliding with a pedestrian. Those two actions cannot be comparable, yet they are both classed under the heading of careless driving.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_310">No proper statistics are kept on what happens following fatal accidents or accidents where there are serious injuries. That requires changes by the Home Office and the CPS as well as by the Department for Transport. Bereaved families and families of injured people are not kept informed about or involved in the progress of prosecutions that follow the accident. I ask the Department for Transport and the Home Office to consider the Transport Committee&#039;s recommendation of a new offence of causing death or serious injury by negligent driving. That, with other measures, would show that the Government mean what they say and that the Secretary of State for Transport follows up his words about how seriously he regards death because of accidents on the roads.

 Many points that I would have made have already been dealt with in the excellent speeches that have been made. I do not need to repeat them, but I hope to reinforce some of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_312">Road safety measures clearly save lives. I hope that the Bill will save more lives in future, but if it were strengthened it could save even more. In the past, there has been a cultural reluctance to accept safety measures and a kind of misguided libertarianism about driving. I think that that is well in the past and I hope that it will not return. We have experimented with voluntarism, especially with seat belts; that did not work, and we now realise that compulsion is necessary in many areas. We are making progress, and it is comforting that there is consensus across the Chamber.

<a name="stpa_313">We have heard a lot this afternoon about the effect of different speeds on pedestrians hit by cars and their chances of survival. If we look at that in another way, we realise that between 20&nbsp;mph and 30&nbsp;mph one&#039;s chances of survival decrease 10&nbsp;times, and that between 30&nbsp;mph and 40&nbsp;mph those chances decrease five times. Even between the speeds of 20&nbsp;mph and 30&nbsp;mph, there is a much greater chance of being killed when hit by a car. In crowded pedestrian areas in towns, it would therefore be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 258</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>sensible seriously to consider a default speed limit of 20&nbsp;mph. The proposal has been presented by the Safer Streets Coalition in a well argued briefing that I urge my hon. Friends on the Front Bench to read.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_314">We have heard much debate about alcohol limits. I supported the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), who tabled an amendment on Report to the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003. The amendment was rejected, but the case has to be put again. I hope that the Government will be persuaded that the 50&nbsp;mg limit should eventually become law. I would argue for an even lower limit. We have come to realise that we can save hundreds of lives by restricting alcohol and driving. We should go further to save lives and my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) made an effective speech on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_315">The culture and attitudes to driving have changed. That shows that hon. Members, as legislators, have a duty to represent people at their best and most sensible, not their most spontaneous and perhaps selfish. When Barbara Castle introduced the breathalyser, I was sitting in a pub, drinking a pint of beer. I hasten to add that I was not driving and that, even then, I was careful about the amount that I drank when I was driving. A petition against the breathalyser was circulated in the pub. I was the only person there who refused to sign it because I thought that the law was sensible and would save thousands of lives, thus making us all safer. I was not popular in the pub that day but I believe that I was right and that subsequent events have proved that.

<a name="stpa_316">I support a general 20&nbsp;mph limit in towns and a lower blood-alcohol level for drivers.

Otherwise, I support the Bill.

 Like other hon. Members who have spoken, I support the Bill, which contains many good provisions. I want to concentrate on aspects of it on which we can build and I hope that the Government will take some points on board either in Committee or in other ways in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_317">First, I endorse the comments of many other hon. Members about the problem with the graduated penalty proposals. I am worried that the message conveyed by adopting proposals for lower penalties for lower speeding would undermine the Government&#039;s good work on road safety. It would convey a message that a little bit of speeding does not do any harm. That is a dangerous message and it would be a big mistake to send it. We should face the fact that the problem of speeding below 40&nbsp;mph in a 30&nbsp;mph zone is not that people receive many penalty points but that, too often, the law is not enforced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_318">In many parts of the country, there is no genuinely effective enforcement until people drive at 38&nbsp;or 39&nbsp;mph. I do not suggest that we should pursue with the full vigour of the law someone who inadvertently creeps one or two mph beyond a 30&nbsp;mph limit. However, we must have much more effective enforcement of existing speed limits below the 10&nbsp;mph leeway, which appears to be allowed in many parts of the country. That approach is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 259</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>not consistent and I would be interested to hear today or on another occasion what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary believes he can do to try to ensure a more consistent approach to enforcement of speed limits throughout the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_319">I endorse the comments made by many hon. Members on drink-driving limits. The arguments for reducing the level to 50&nbsp;mg are convincing and I hope that the Government will consider them in Committee. I also endorse the view expressed by many hon. Members that, if we are to improve still further our relatively good road safety record, we need to change not only our legislation but public attitudes. The change in public attitudes can be brought about in a number of ways, and legislation will certainly play a part in that, as it will underline the message that we take seriously offences of this nature. We also need more public education, although a lot of good work has already been done in that regard. We need more public information, more road safety education of all sorts in schools, including basic education about street safety, cycle training and a wide range of other measures. We also need more driver education, and more work to be done by vehicle manufacturers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_320">Above all, we as public figures need to send a consistent message that cutting the toll of deaths and injuries on our roads must have a higher priority in the decisions that we take about traffic and transport. I, too, welcome the clear message given by the Secretary of State today about the way in which we should regard people who use their vehicle to drive dangerously. He drew a parallel between such people and those who create a danger by using a gun or other weapon. That was a powerful message and I endorse what he said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_321">We have heard today about the tragic cases that have affected many hon. Members&#151;we all see such cases in our communities from time to time. It is also important, however, to send out the positive message that we can do things to make a difference at local level as well as at national level. In my own city of Edinburgh, the city council, the police and other agencies have worked together to make a real impact on reducing the number of deaths and injuries on the roads. Last year, for the first time since records began, some 75&nbsp;years ago, not a single school-age child was killed on the roads in Lothian, the area that includes Edinburgh. That result was achieved by a road safety strategy involving a combination of engineering measures such as road humps, enforcement involving speed cameras, and education. This was not just a one-off strategy. Over the last 10&nbsp;years, we have seen a reduction of 30&nbsp;per cent. in the number of injuries on the roads. That consistent reduction has meant that we have had one of the highest reductions in accidents in the UK. It is time to learn from the example set by my city council, as well as by many other councils of different political colours in different parts of the country that have introduced measures to improve road safety in their communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_322">The use of speed cameras and other traffic calming measures of that nature results in howls of derision from certain sections of the community and the media. However, we have to underline the fact that none of us&#151;I am a driver myself&#151;has the right to break the speed limit. We must reject the spurious arguments about the Government attempting to raise revenue from cameras, because it diverts us from the fact that speed 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 260</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>kills, and we do not need the carnage on the roads that still takes place despite our relatively good record compared with most other European countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_323">I welcome the fact that the Conservatives have said today that they will not vote against the Bill. This is an area in which we must try to achieve as much political consensus as possible. However, it is no use Conservative Front Benchers saying that they support the headline measures on road safety if, in the next breath, they come out with language that undermines the message being sent by those measures. I do not want to undermine the cross-party consensus that we have here today, but as we listened to the opening speech by the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo), we heard all the same old arguments and urban myths about speed cameras. We heard the idea slip through that the Conservatives, if they came to power, would abolish the safety camera partnerships, which have done more than anything to reduce deaths and injury by speeding. It is no good, at one level, supporting road safety, while undermining in practice, with the message that is sent out, the intent of legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_324">I say this with some hesitation but it needs to be said: when the message is sent out by some leading Conservatives&#151;although there are some honourable exceptions in the Conservative party&#151;that a little speeding is okay and that it does not really qualify to be in the same league as other criminal offences, that contributes to the overall climate in which speeding is okay, and contributes to the campaign in some quarters against speed cameras and against enforcing speed legislation. We hear that too often from the Conservative Benches, and it contributes to making the roads less safe, and ultimately results in people dying or being injured on our roads who would not otherwise have died or been injured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_325">Conservative Front Benchers must recognise that when they undermine the message of strict enforcement of speed limits, they are acting irresponsibly and encouraging some drivers to drive in a way that leads to people being killed and injured unnecessarily. With not too much expectation of a change of heart today, I urge them to act a little more responsibly in this area, and not to take an approach that leads to more people losing their lives and being injured than would otherwise be the case.

Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody). Because of time constraints, I will not be able to respond to all the pertinent points that have been made.

Road traffic law enforcement is not included in the core responsibilities of chief constables, a fact which was investigated by the Select Committee in its excellent report. All that has happened is that the Government have produced a rather lame response to the Select Committee report, and have today announced that they will now get serious about enforcement of road traffic law.

<a name="50111-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_327">Fortunately, only on 5&nbsp;January I received a much delayed answer to a question that I had put to the Home Secretary on how many road traffic police officers there were in 1996, and how many there are now. It was quite a straightforward question, but it received a holding answer on 13&nbsp;December, no doubt while the Government worked out how they were going to respond. The answer is rather interesting, as it shows that in the past four years 1,653&nbsp;fewer police officers have been in front-line operational road policing, while the number of support staff has increased by 399, and an extra 400&nbsp;have been involved in administrative support&#151;a twentyfold increase. In 1996&#150;97, this Government inherited 9,201&nbsp;road traffic police officers, whereas now, according to the answer that I have received, there are only 6,276&nbsp;operational traffic officers&#151;a reduction of between a quarter and 30&nbsp;per cent. In the meantime, there has been an enormous increase in the number of operational support officers and organisational support administrative back-up staff.

<p><a name="st_255"><a name="50111-36_spnew1"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 I deal with miles, actually, but I can tell the hon. Gentleman that this Government&#151;his Government&#151;have tried to transfer the debate to a discussion of fatality rates per, say, 1,000&nbsp;miles. When I was Roads Minister in a Conservative Government, we set a target for reducing the actual number of people killed on the roads, and we were very successful in achieving it. I do not claim all the credit myself, but during the two or three years for which I was the Minister, the annual toll of fatalities on the road fell by more than 1,000&nbsp;a year. Under this Government, since 1997&nbsp;the number of fatalities has reached a plateau. In fact, according to the most recent figure it rose slightly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_328">Not surprisingly, the hon. Gentleman and, perhaps, Ministers are falling back on the number of fatalities per 1&nbsp;million miles driven. Because of the higher mileage on the roads, the number may be falling as a small proportion, but it certainly does not compare with our record in government. Indeed, we would like to see a significant further reduction in the number of fatalities. One of the key ingredients is proper enforcement, and it is one of the ingredients that have been lacking in the Government&#039;s policy. It is no good just coming out today with a lame press release suggesting that everything will be rosy in the future, when we know that the figures suggest otherwise.

<a name="stpa_329">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mr. Lazarowicz) referred disparagingly to Conservative Members&#039; comments about the need for police officers, and the fact that road safety cameras cannot be an adequate substitute. On 13&nbsp;May 2004, Jan&nbsp;Berry, chairman of the Police Federation, said:


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;I don&#039;t think you can remove the human element of policing and replace it with a camera&#151;in some force areas if you are going 35&nbsp;mph at 2&nbsp;am in a 30&nbsp;mph area and no other traffic it would be extremely unusual for an officer to give you a ticket&#151;a speed camera doesn&#039;t have that discretion.&quot;</p>

Despite that, the Government are probably raking in anything between &#163;60&nbsp;million and &#163;100&nbsp;million in extra fines. Their policy is not working, and it is alienating the travelling public and road users generally.

Speed limits must be worthy of respect, or they will be ignored. It is essential for us to have a sensible regime of speed limits, and sensible enforcement. That point has been made strongly by the Institute of Advanced Motorists, of which I am privileged to be a member. It has drawn attention to


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;the increasing use of non-discretionary cameras in place of police officers who are able to able to apply discretion taking account of prevailing conditions. For example, the Government position on the motorway limit included the assertion that while at 70&nbsp;mph drivers would regularly travel at 80&nbsp;mph, if increased to 80&nbsp;mph they would travel at 90&nbsp;mph.

They are the maximum speed where conditions allow and therefore, by definition, a lower speed must be appropriate where there are additional hazards e.g. traffic density, rain, fog, high pedestrian population etc&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For their message to be credible it follows that the speed limit should be set as the maximum permitted speed where the road appears empty of moving hazards, the conditions dry and visibility clear.&quot;</p>

We will implement a consistent signposting policy across England to inform drivers, riders and passengers of these posted speed limits.

It has achieved an enormous amount for road safety in our area. He admitted to having been the victim of the penalty points system, and of speed cameras imposed temporarily on roads under repair. I am afraid that concern about such cameras is often expressed in the postbag by people who, when travelling along a road whose normal speed limit has been replaced by a temporary limit, find that the signposting is inadequate.

The chief executive of the parliamentary advisory committee on transport safety admitted to me in a conversation yesterday that he had such lights on his bike. Strictly speaking, they are outside the law, and this Bill gives the Government an opportunity to bring such cyclists within the law, and then to bear down more heavily on those who ride with no lights at all.

Through it, people are prosecuted for failing in their duty to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety and welfare at work of an employee.

The large quiet majority are people who wear their safety belts, do not exceed speed limits, do not use their mobile phones while driving and obey traffic laws.

<a name="50111-36_para18">
<a name="stpa_346">However, their safety&#151;and the safety of the rest of us&#151;is compromised by the small minority who put other people&#039;s lives at risk. The people in that minority think that when it comes to driving, insurance is somehow an optional extra. They think that they are special, and can drink and then drive safely. They chatter on their mobile phones when they should be concentrating on the road ahead.

 Will the Minister give way?

<p><a name="st_262"><a name="50111-37_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Certainly. I am chattering, and will give way.
</p>








<p><a name="st_263"><a name="50111-37_spnew2"><b> Mr. Tyler: </b> 
 I warmly welcome clause 22, which deals with mobile phones, but will the Minister look again at the evidence provided by Brake, that very effective road safety pressure group? It suggests that even hands-free mobile phones can distract drivers. Will he consider that evidence again in Committee?
</p>








<p><a name="st_264"><a name="50111-37_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Our recommendation is that people should not use a mobile phone at all when driving. However, the law must be enforceable. When we brought in the &#163;30&nbsp;fixed penalty last year, we said that we would hold a review in a year&#039;s time. The Bill contains the new measures to raise the fine and to impose the three penalty points that we promised. If necessary, we will review the law again in the future. The Bill contains a range of sensible and proportionate measures to make our roads safer.

<a name="stpa_347">I will not have time to respond to all the points raised in the debate, so I invite hon. Members to whom I cannot respond to correspond with me, or to raise matters in Standing Committee. The hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) opened the debate for the Opposition, and I am grateful to him for his shared concerns and consensual approach. He said that he would not divide the House on Second Reading, as did the Liberal Democrat spokesman. It is good to have that consensus on this important Bill, although I fully expect there to be some differences about some of the smaller matters in it, which we will debate in the usual way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_348">The hon. Member for South Suffolk said how differently we in this country treat deaths on the road from deaths arising from rail or air crashes, or other causes. Other hon. Members made the same point, including my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs.&nbsp;Mahon).

<p>
<a name="50111-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_349">I think that we are going through a gradual cultural change in this matter. I am glad to say that the number of people injured is falling, as is the death rate. The static figure for deaths is about 3,500&nbsp;a year, and we have to tackle that. I hope that the House&#039;s consensual approach will allow us to find a way to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_350">The hon. Member for South Suffolk mentioned the EuroRAP map, and said that it showed some roads to be more dangerous than others. That is to be expected, but local authorities and the Highways Agency are devoting a lot of energy to identifying which roads and junctions are most dangerous and problematic. We are focusing our attention, and our funding, on those roads. If we are to pay for the improvements that the hon. Gentleman wants, we must put the funding in. In those circumstances, cuts would not be appropriate.
</p>








<p><a name="st_265"><a name="50111-37_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Anne Campbell: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has said that he will be taking another look at dangerous roads, so will he look again at the A14, which runs between Cambridge and Huntingdon? A very large number of accidents happen on that road, so can anything be done to improve the situation before 2010?
</p>








<p><a name="st_266"><a name="50111-37_spnew5"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 We appreciate the dangers of that piece of road, and I know that my hon. Friend has lobbied consistently on the issue. Those are the sort of dangers that we want to address, but she will know that it is incumbent on us to tackle the worst first. We must deal with the greatest problems first.

<a name="stpa_351">The Conservative party has performed either a U-turn or a complete 360-degree turn&#151;I am not sure which&#151;in respect of speed cameras. The hon. Member for Christchurch did a wonderful job in 1990&nbsp;when he introduced safety cameras. However, the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) argued all last year that most of those cameras were in the wrong place and should be removed. I am glad that the hon. Member for South Suffolk has brought some calm common sense to the Conservative Benches, as he clearly realises that he is on a losing issue with the electorate. The vast majority of people in this country do not believe that people should be able to speed freely. They believe that their children should be able to cross the road without having speeding drivers around them. I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_352">The hon. Member for South Suffolk proposed an audit of the cameras. We have already done that. Some of his Conservative colleagues in local government have also carried out an audit. I repeat the challenge that I made to the Tory Front-Bench team 13&nbsp;months ago. If the hon. Gentleman knows where there are cameras that do not meet the criteria, let him tell the House where they are. After 13&nbsp;months, nobody on the Conservative Benches has come up with a single example of a camera that has been wrongly placed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_353">I am glad to have the support of the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso). He spoke about pedestrians being killed at various speeds, and the issue of variable speed limits. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said in his opening remarks, the variable penalty is only an

</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_354">Repeater signs are not dealt with in the Bill. There are difficulties associated with cost and with the clutter of street signs. The present system, whereby a built-up area&nbsp;where there are lights is a 30&nbsp;mph zone, goes back 70-odd years. On bull bars, a subject which interests my hon. Friends, we are negotiating a new European directive to control their use. It is my view that they have no place on any vehicle on the road.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_355">My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax, who chairs the all-party group on road safety, contrasted our attitudes to death caused by various modes of transport. The law already empowers local authorities to reduce speed limits to 20&nbsp;mph. I take her point about sleep-related issues. They are important, but in the main do not need to be dealt with in primary legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_356">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr.&nbsp;Atkinson) spoke with great enthusiasm about many of the measures in the Bill, particularly those dealing with foreign lorries, equal treatment of British subjects and foreigners on our roads, rest areas and uninsured drivers. He spoke about a level playing field across Europe. I agree about common practice, enforcement and information sharing&#151;but whether we want the same laws as other countries in the European Union, I very much doubt. We have a better record, and those countries look to our legislation as an example, rather than the other way round.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_357">My hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough made an impassioned speech on behalf of his constituents. The penalties issue that he raised is being examined by the Home Office. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston has a long history of interest in road safety matters. I thank him for his support. He raised some interesting points, which the Committee may want to consider.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_358">The hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) made a helpful speech, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas), although he said that the Bill did not go far enough. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) chairs the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety, so his commitment, and that of the people with whom he works, is clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_359">We are concerned about the death statistics. We have been successful in reducing the number of serious injuries on the roads, and I agree that we must now turn our attention to reducing the number of deaths. Sadly, the figures rose last year, mainly because of an increase in the number of motor cyclist deaths, and we must address that issue. However, I am very much opposed to the harmonisation of penalties across Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_360">In conclusion, each crash brings human misery for those who are injured and the families of those who are killed, and a massive cost to our economy. The Bill contains a number of measures that will help to make our roads safer; it will be welcomed by all of us, and I commend it to the House.

<a name="time_22">
<a name="50111-39_time1"><h5>7.19&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_279"><a name="50111-39_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mark Todd  (South Derbyshire) (Lab):</b> 
 We have an opportunity in this short debate to reflect both on a local south Derbyshire success story and on evidence of the success of a Government and local authority programme in my area, which, I am sure, is reflected to some extent in other parts of the country. That success has been based on a partnership between Derbyshire county council, supported by central Government funding&#151;I shall expand on that subject later in my speech&#151;the local, voluntary and professional management of the community transport service in Swadlincote, South Derbyshire district council and a number of parish councils in south Derbyshire, which have been involved in developing local transport solutions for their individual communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_361">First, I shall provide a few raw facts. In 1997, Community Transport (Swadlincote), which had been in existence for some eight years by that time, carried 17,583&nbsp;passengers in five vehicles. In 2004, the same service carried 72,683&nbsp;passengers in 21&nbsp;vehicles. All hon. Members will accept that that is a huge increase in passenger usage and in the scale and capacity of community transport in south Derbyshire. Community transport was operated over nearly 100,000&nbsp;miles during 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_362">In 1997, the service operated out of a Nissen hut. Thanks to a lottery award early in the life of this Government, however, it now operates out of a modern, purpose-built garage, which has, however, become increasingly hard pressed for space as the service has developed. The garage has also provided a base for a number of innovative schemes to offer transport services to rural areas, and I shall touch on several of those schemes in my speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_363">One such scheme, which I shall mention now, was prompted by the introduction of the new deal and my identification, along with the county council, of the fact that it was difficult for unemployed people in rural areas to obtain transport to get work or even to go to interviews and take up opportunities. A bid was put in to support new deal transport for people in rural areas, and the service was run for a number of years to support people with those needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_364">Although I shall mainly concentrate on Community Transport (Swadlincote), I also want to acknowledge the role played by other voluntary sector transport schemes in the area. In particular, I want to refer to the social car scheme operated through the South Derbyshire Council for Voluntary Service, which completed nearly 2,000&nbsp;runs in 2004&nbsp;to those who need specific and personal transport, which is often required for medical reasons. Some 31&nbsp;volunteers have given freely of their time, energy and vehicles to provide that important and personal service in the past year, and this is an opportunity to thank them and those who organised that service for their valuable contribution to community needs in south Derbyshire.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 274</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_365">Government help has been available on several levels. First, they have supported two rural bus challenge bids, which have directly helped Community Transport (Swadlincote). Since 1999, that help has secured the growth of the service until 2007&#151;the latest scheme has just been authorised for a further three years. In the first phase of the rural bus challenge, 30,000&nbsp;additional passenger journeys occurred. People would not otherwise have been able to undertake those journeys, and they would have had to rely on their own private transport or lifts from other people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_366">The latest award&#151;&#163;245,000&nbsp;over a three-year period&#151;will consolidate the development of rural services and link to a specific award in the north-west of south Derbyshire, which is the most rural and remote part of the district, serving the areas around the villages of Hilton, Etwall and Church Broughton. This is an opportunity to pay tribute to the parish councils for those areas for their vision and practical work, assisted by others. I did a mailing to several parish councils in my area suggesting that they address local transport needs. I particularly congratulate the three that I mentioned and one or two others in the area. Findern, the village in south Derbyshire where I live, has also been active in taking up the opportunity to look closely at local transport requirements and then working with community transport on solutions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_367">Much of the area involved had virtually non-existent services. The bus service in Church Broughton was charmingly described as a &quot;market-day&quot; service. The traditional view of what was provided in rural areas was a bus service that went only once a week and was related to a market somewhere else in another town. That very rudimentary access to public transport has now been supplemented dramatically by access to dial-a-ride services and group services for individuals and groups in those communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_368">The Government have sharply increased the funds available to the county council for more general support for public transport in Derbyshire. This is an opportunity to congratulate a Labour county council that was, with substantial justice, classed as excellent in the last three comprehensive performance assessments. It has used the additional funding extremely well. Part of it has gone towards supplementing additional scheduled services in the area, for example by deepening the coverage for weekends and evenings, but a very large&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proportion&#151;&#163;134,000&nbsp;last year&#151;has gone to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community Transport (Swadlincote) to support dial-a-bus and group travel services throughout the district.
</p>








<p><a name="st_280"><a name="50111-39_spnew2"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that community transport in south Derbyshire could well be integrated with some form of improved rail services linking Leicester via Coalville and Ashby-de-la-Zouch to Burton-on-Trent, and serving some of the villages in his constituency? Would some Government funding in that area repay the necessary investment, and could we hear from the Minister on that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_281"><a name="50111-39_spnew3"><b> Mr. Todd: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend and neighbouring Member for that contribution. He is absolutely right. We have both campaigned actively for the restoration of passenger services through the southern part of south 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 275</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Derbyshire. Such a scheme would include a new station at Castle Gresley It is regrettable that a combination of narrowness at central Government level and occasional lack of vision from some of the councils involved&#151;although not Derbyshire county council and my own district council of South Derbyshire&#151;has meant that little progress has been made on the project, but it would undoubtedly improve access to the main rail transport network for many of my constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_369">The second initiative that deserves credit is that the Government now rebate fuel duty to community transport operators. To give the Minister an example of how valuable that is to a community transport service, in south Derbyshire in the past year it has saved &#163;18,000&nbsp;that could be applied to service development. It is an extremely valuable supplementary source of revenue that was not available before that change implemented by this Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_370">The Government have made more flexible the rules relating to the operation of community transport. We all recognise that it would be entirely inappropriate to support through public funds direct competition with private sector bus providers. However, too narrow a restriction on the development of services can be unhelpful. When I spoke to Community Transport (Swadlincote) before speaking here this evening, I was told that although legitimate restrictions remain, it is now much more a case of defining instances where services may not be provided than of following the much narrower path of very precisely restricted services that could be provided by community transport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_371">I welcome that change of tone and balance in the regulatory framework in which community transport operates. Much of the development of group travel services, which has grown rapidly in south Derbyshire, providing, for example, door-to-door services that deliver frail passengers to shopping centres in nearby towns, reflects that more liberal approach of dealing with community transport in a more permissive environment than previously existed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_372">I would personally welcome a further examination of the restrictions on community transport, especially the way in which it could work with employers to develop sustainable travel packages for employees. I should like my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to reflect on that. There is much to commend the way in which a small, flexible operator could work with employers to develop packages to bring employees to work. I can remember working in a company that operated a bus service for its employees around the town where most of them lived. That has gone out of fashion. However, there is now an opportunity to reflect on what a neat and nimble-footed operator such as Community Transport (Swadlincote) could do with local employers to improve the sustainability of transport options for employees in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_373">It is worth adding that the massive development of service and the growth in passenger numbers has been achieved while maintaining excellent relations with private operators, both private scheduled operators and those who offer coach services in the area. People get on well together, understand the differences between their businesses and I have come across no complaints about that. Indeed, offers of co-operation have sometimes been made and much appreciated.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 276</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_374">Is there any cloud on that undoubted local success? I should like the Under-Secretary to give some thought to a couple of matters. The first point is mainly a matter for local initiative but the Government could examine ways in which to facilitate it. I am proud to say that south Derbyshire is now generally an area of relative prosperity. South Derbyshire district has the highest average income in Derbyshire. Employment is high and rising. That means that recruiting volunteers, who play an important role in supplementing the activities of community transport&#039;s paid employees, can be tough and rewarding paid staff sufficiently to retain them can also be difficult. Opportunities for other employment abound in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para14">
<a name="stpa_375">The county council has recognised the problem and is trying to develop a package of promotions that will attract people to the important roles of, for example, assisting disabled users, which need to be filled. It is normally helpful to have a volunteer to supplement the work of the driver and others to help people to get in and out of vehicles. It is hard to get people to fulfil those critical functions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para15">
<a name="stpa_376">The second point relates directly to central Government responsibilities. While the range of services that Community Transport (Swadlincote) offers is secure in the medium term&#151;I have mentioned 2007&#151;for the rural services in particular, much has depended on the success of bids to central Government. As with any project based on that initial funding&#151;I also have a mini Sure Start scheme in Derbyshire that suffers from the same problem&#151;the start of the process is pump primed, but a way of mainstreaming the funding support must be found so that the service can continue to develop and be retained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para16">
<a name="stpa_377">I urge the Under-Secretary to initiate discussions on how to structure a transfer of funding responsibility over time, subject to quality tests on the services supported. All the evidence that I have seen suggests that Community Transport (Swadlincote) is doing an absolutely fantastic job in serving a large number of people who are disadvantaged, either because they live in a remote rural location or by their disabilities or other requirements, and are therefore less able to use public transport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-39_para17">
<a name="stpa_378">Community transport in south Derbyshire has achieved huge growth across a wide range of services, and it has started to demonstrate that there is a huge, unmet demand for public transport in the area. It deserves greater certainty in its planning, and if the Government take the steps that I have described, they will be able to offer it that increased security, which will allow it to build on the tremendous successes that it has already achieved.

We are at present focusing on bringing community transport schemes into being under existing viable projects, as he knows because he was present at our debate earlier today. I hope, however, that the kind of scheme to which he referred will become viable in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-40_para1">
<a name="stpa_380">The challenges might vary, but the need for transport for those who are socially excluded for reasons of income, gender, race, disability or geographical isolation is always there. The community and voluntary transport sector has been at the forefront in helping to meet those people&#039;s needs. Indeed, the services that it offers have developed and evolved over many years, particularly over the past decade, with enormous changes to their scale, scope and range, and to the professionalism of those providing them.
</p>

The Community Transport Association, which represents the majority of schemes across the country, estimates that there are some 5,000&nbsp;schemes in the UK, which between them run about 60,000&nbsp;minibuses. They do so with the help of about 250,000&nbsp;volunteers and 10,000&nbsp;full-time paid drivers. I take on board the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire about the difficulty of recruiting volunteers; many organisations face that problem. Together, the schemes deliver some 5&nbsp;million trips for almost 2&nbsp;million people with mobility problems. Any transport provider would be proud of that record. It is perhaps all the more laudable when we consider that this activity is taking place in the voluntary sector. However, as my hon. Friend has pointed out, funding for the sector is not straightforward, and I fully appreciate the difficulties to which uncertainty over future funding and the complexities of funding applications can sometimes give rise. We shall certainly consider those issues.

<a name="stpa_382">This brings me to the issues surrounding rural transport services. Rural travel patterns have changed markedly over the past 30&nbsp;years. We have seen a significant growth in car ownership in rural areas. Public transport had become a marginal form of transport, and people&#039;s journeys became longer as the number of local shops and services declined due to the consolidation of essential services such as health care, post offices and banks. For people without access to a car, that meant increasing difficulties in accessing employment opportunities and essential services.

<p>
<a name="50111-40_para4">
<a name="stpa_383">This lack of accessibility is a significant cause of social exclusion in rural areas, and we recognise the need to improve the transport infrastructure and to enhance rural accessibility. The measures that we are taking are having a positive impact. New and enhanced bus services are being delivered across all rural counties, improving the links between market towns and halting the decline in bus use in rural areas.

<a name="stpa_384">Over the past five years, we have more than doubled local authority funding for transport projects. For those authorities with extensive rural communities, considerable funding is being directed at rural areas. An important ingredient of achieving rural renewal is good-

<br>&nbsp;<br>quality rural bus services. We have specifically targeted more resources to improve rural bus services. More than &#163;50&nbsp;million will be spent this financial year alone on the rural bus subsidy grant. More than 2,200&nbsp;new and enhanced bus services are now being funded from this grant across England, on which some 29&nbsp;million passenger journeys are being made per year. We have succeeded in giving a much-needed boost to transport links for many rural communities. Our &quot;Future for Transport&quot; White Paper announced the continuation of the rural bus subsidy grant beyond April 2006.

<p>
<a name="50111-40_para6">
<a name="stpa_385">Additional resources for conventional bus services are not the only answer in rural areas. Solutions need to be tailored to local circumstances. We want better targeting of resources by local authorities to meet accessibility needs, greater promotion of rural transport services and a more joined-up approach that links public transport and less conventional services
</p>








<p><a name="st_283"><a name="50111-40_spnew0"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 The Minister refers to a more joined-up approach, and at the beginning of her speech she was kind enough to refer to my intervention. Does she acknowledge that there is a possibility of joining up and integrating bus and rail services in some parts of the country? Will she review with her officials the costings for the national forest line running between Leicester and Burton, through North-West Leicestershire and South Derbyshire, because the passenger figures that produce the prime income are excessively bleak and were drawn up at a time when the two districts involved were much less developed, in all sorts of senses, than they are now?

 Certainly, I will be happy to accede to that request. I have not seen the detailed figures, and I would be only too delighted to examine them.

<a name="stpa_386">Detailed local transport planning and accessibility planning guidance was distributed to local authorities at the end of last year. It asks authorities to produce accessibility strategies as part of their next local transport plans, which should include their visions and objectives for accessibility based on an assessment of the needs and problems of the area. The strategies should also suggest how initial priorities will be tackled. The Department has a number of initiatives aimed at supporting the community and voluntary sector in rural and urban areas, and is currently reviewing the permit regimes relating to the community transport sector in order to reduce the barriers to further expansion

<p><a name="st_285"><a name="50111-40_spnew2"><b> Mr. Todd: </b> 
 On that point, I referred specifically to considering partnerships with local employers on transport packages. In my area, for example, a major employer such as Toyota, which obviously produces motor vehicles, would, I am sure, welcome an opportunity to work with other transport providers to provide appropriate transport to bring its employees in and out of work.
</p>








<p><a name="st_286"><a name="50111-40_spnew3"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 That is absolutely right. We should not forget the bicycle in this respect, as there are tax incentives for employers to provide bicycles to employees at good rates, to ensure that they encourage employees to come to work by bicycle rather than provide them with a car parking space. There are many ways in which employers can encourage sustainable transport policies.

<a name="stpa_387">One of the most significant initiatives has been the extension to many community transport operators of the bus service operators grant. Since its introduction in May 2002, more than 800&nbsp;community transport operators in England have become eligible, and I understand that all the Derbyshire schemes are now claiming. This is a continuing grant providing the organisations concerned with significant help in meeting their operating costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-40_para9">
<a name="stpa_388">With regard to the interests of rural communities in particular, since 1998&nbsp;the Department has provided significant levels of funding to improve the provision of bus services in rural areas. The rural bus challenge scheme, which has funded 300&nbsp;projects, has been successful in making possible the development of a wide range of innovative schemes. It has helped many successful projects to become established and to reach the stage of being strong candidates for mainstream funding from local authorities or other sources. It has demonstrated the potential, in particular, of flexibly routed and demand-responsive services in the meeting of local transport needs. More specifically, the Department provided nearly &#163;500,000&nbsp;for the 2003&nbsp;rural bus challenge competition for four different rural transport schemes in south Derbyshire involving community transport providers. While we have helped to stimulate many of those initiatives, I acknowledge the hard work and dedication that community groups have invested in improving the quality of life for the many people who rely on them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50111-40_para10">
<a name="stpa_389">Of course we recognise that the funding regimes I have outlined do not provide a long-term funding base for schemes, but that was never our intention, and we made it clear from the outset of the rural&#151;and urban&#151;bus challenge that it was never intended to be a source of permanent revenue support. The main aim was to show the scope for innovation and new approaches, and to get projects under way that would then become part of the mainstream in terms of funding. While I recognise the pressures on local authority resources for revenue support of buses, I should point out that overall Government grant has increased for this year by 7.3&nbsp;per cent., and by 30&nbsp;per cent. since 1997.

<p>
<a name="50111-40_para11">
<a name="stpa_390">Some authorities clearly have an exceptional record of working in close and supportive partnership with community transport. Derbyshire is one such authority: its record is commendable and long standing. Others, however, have not yet recognised the value of working in partnership. Many are continuing to provide funding one year at a time. That gives no basis for planning or development.

<a name="50111-40_para12">
<a name="stpa_391">I believe that it is also important to engage community transport providers in the local transport plan process at a strategic level, in recognition of their contribution to public transport delivery. Again, I acknowledge that Derbyshire is at the forefront of that approach. The LTP guidance to local authorities emphasises the need to encourage active involvement by that sector, but too many community and voluntary transport providers continue to be treated as an optional extra in the transport mix. Those issues too are addressed in the accessibility planning guidance.

<a name="50111-40_para13">
<a name="stpa_392">Where do we go from here in terms of funding? We all recognise that community and voluntary transport schemes are vital to the mix of transport provision. The Government want to do all that they can to ensure that such schemes can thrive. As we have heard today, the funding issue is a key factor in determining how the sector can continue and develop effectively. It is important that for those involved to be able to share their experiences, learn from others and develop their funding policies with the broadest possible understanding of the sector. To that end, we have commissioned the Community Transport Association to produce a good practice guide to funding. The association is due to deliver the guide early this year, and we intend to make it widely available to all involved. Moreover, the funding issue will no doubt be considered in the context of a research project that we have commissioned to look at the role of community transport in reducing social exclusion. One of the aims of that work is to identify and evaluate the funding regimes available to the sector.

<a name="stpa_393">As part of our commitment to the compact with the voluntary sector, we have now completed the &quot;working in partnership with the voluntary and community sector&quot; strategy and action plan. That document outlines how the Department has met, and will continue to meet, the aims of the compact. Through continued liaison with the sector, we will obtain views on the Government&#039;s transport agenda and on barriers that voluntary organisations face in providing a full and sustainable service. A community liaison manager has been in post for six months to deal with that.
