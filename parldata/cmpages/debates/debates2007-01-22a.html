As I told the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon), we are committed to spending a significant amount to upgrade and improve accommodation. At RAF Marham, which is in the constituency of the hon.

These are important issues and we have to make sure that we get the best size and shape for the Royal Navy to meet the contingent demands that we face, and those that can be predicted for the future.

On 23 October, I sought your advice about how I could pursue some unanswered questions to the Secretary of State for Defence, dated in October, on pay and allowances for our troops. You said that I should table more parliamentary questions, Mr. Speaker, so since then I have tabled six questions chasing up the fact that my questions remains unanswered. I realise that it is very embarrassing for the Secretary of State that at the same time as he announces pay increases for our troops he is taking away their allowances, but is it right that my questions should go unanswered?</p>

Local government has a long and proud history as a driving force behind public services and the success of our towns and cities. The House will be familiar with some of local government&#146;s great historic figures and their achievements&#151;for example, Joseph Chamberlain, Mayor of Birmingham, who left the city, in his words &#147;parked, paved and improved&#148;, or Herbert Morrison, who did much to shape the London we know. Let us not forget the more than 1.5 million men and women working in local government on whom we rely, day in, day out. We are never more aware of their service than in times of adversity, such as the current storms. I pay tribute to them.</p>

I want to see all our councils leading the drive for sustainable communities, regenerating our city centres, lifting people out of poverty and improving local public services.

They wanted to get on with the job of delivering for local people, but in certain cases they made a powerful argument for change. They said, &#147;Well, if you&#146;re serious about the place-shaping role, and if you really want us to deliver value for money, and you want us to keep the council tax down to its lowest level, give us the opportunity to present our case.&#148; The agreement that we reached was that the strongest bids would be considered against extremely strict criteria, but that the window of opportunity would then close, and the unitary debate would, I hope, close down thereafter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70122-0005.htm_para1"><a name="0701226000206">It is the role of councils to serve local communities and respond to citizens&#146; needs. People want clean, safe streets and public services that respond quickly to their everyday problems. They want effective solutions without endless bureaucracy, which is why the White Paper and the Bill place a strong emphasis on the role of democratically elected councillors. We should celebrate their role, and make it easier for them to get things done. Our proposals will give a new voice to individual councillors through the community call for action, which gives citizens and councillors a new way of raising issues that they care about such as persistent antisocial behaviour, a poor recycling service, or problems with care when people come out of hospital. The community call for action will allow a councillor to draw those issues to the attention of colleagues and demand an answer from the council. Councillors can act collectively, too, through overview and scrutiny committees, which enable them to hold partner authorities to account on behalf of local communities. The Bill therefore proposes to strengthen the powers of those committees to enable them to demand information from partners and require providers to have regard to their recommendations.</p>

They cannot do so without adequate information, consultation and involvement. The best councils already engage with their communities, and the Bill proposes to require all local authorities to inform, consult and involve local communities as appropriate.</p>

If they want to opt in to unitary status that, too, should be for them to decide. That is the point of devolution. We will provide a new power for the best parishes to promote economic, social and environmental well-being and, in addition, we will give communities the power to establish parishes in London, as they can already do so in the rest of the country.

We think that greater devolution of powers goes hand in hand with the responsibility for stronger leadership that is able to look over the whole area in which local people live and be responsible for the quality of life across that area, not just for the local public services that are delivered in that area. Local council leaders will be responsible in future not just for social care, for example, or for the services directly delivered, but for the quality of the environment, climate change and all the issues that are of concern to local people.

In exceptional circumstances, a vote of confidence could be called and the leader could be changed. That is a useful way out.

Those costs will be added to the bill for council tax payers. Cambridge university has estimated that restructuring would mean an extra cost of &#163;121 per person. That would work out at roughly &#163;345 on top of the average council tax bill&#151;a bill that has already risen by 84 per cent. since Labour came to power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para6"><a name="0701226000266">The same criticism can be levelled at the uprated local area agreements, of which the Government have made much when justifying their localist credentials. The provisions for the agreements lack a clear process of how they will be achieved and to whom they are ultimately accountable. As the Local Government Information Unit says in its briefing, it is not clear how the duty to co-operate will be secured in practice. Will the chief constable, sitting at the table with the council leader, dance to his tune or that of the Home Secretary? Who has the line management? In home affairs, Whitehall has. Far from getting together and reaching an agreement based on the wishes of the community they serve, representatives are all dancing to the tune of their relevant Whitehall Departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para7"><a name="0701226000267">I see nothing in the Bill that would remedy that problem. To make matters worse, I see no sign that other Departments are sympathetic to the devolving of power to local communities; the reverse, in fact. We will end up with a heavily compromised agreement between representatives who are in hock to their masters in Whitehall. That is why we have proposed something more radical in the Sustainable Communities Bill, which gives local councils far more discretion over the way in which money is spent locally and, for the first time, total transparency in regard to how much is spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para8"><a name="0701226000268">The Government have rightly given councils a choice of leadership ranging from elected leader to elected executive to elected mayors, but rather like an anxious child dipping its toe in the waters of localism, they recoil and refuse to let councils decide for themselves whether they want a cabinet or a committee system. When asked about that earlier, the Secretary of State said, &#147;We think it is not desirable to return to the committee system.&#148; That is a classic example of centralism if ever there was one. Central Government &#147;think&#148;, therefore local government do not get. Has the Secretary of State listened to councillors? Strong leadership is about people, not structures. It is a relatively small issue, but it is a symptom of a Government who, beneath the surface, are still committed to micro-managing councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para9"><a name="0701226000269">The Bill contains measures that seem localist on the face of it, but beneath the surface do nothing to loosen the stranglehold of central Government over local government. We welcome the measures to devolve power beyond the town hall to parishes, but urge the Government not to overlook other models of local governance such as residents associations and other elected forums.

More public involvement may be secured through the community call for action outlined in the Bill, but why has the exception been made for law and order? The Secretary of State said it was because a facility was already in place. If it is, it is not working particularly well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para12"><a name="0701226000272">The health provisions contain further evidence of the centralising tendency that dogs the Bill, particularly the section on public involvement. It is not a year since the Government published their White Paper &#147;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&#148;, which stated that democratically elected councillors should have a local voice in health and social care. Where is that in the Bill? Without it, councils cannot give real expression to the statutory duty that they already have for public health, and health commissioning remains a Whitehall-driven process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para13"><a name="0701226000273">A further weakness is the lack of genuine public involvement. What the Government propose is supposed to be the answer to the whole sorry saga of abolishing community health councils in the teeth of strong public opposition. A myriad bodies have been created over the last few years, including the patients forums. Those have already cost &#163;120 million, much of which will presumably have to be a sunk cost under the new formula, but that is now about to be ripped up in favour of LINKS, or local involvement networks. As we have already heard, there is a real danger in what the Government are proposing because of a conflict of interest. Local government already provides social care, which has to be wired into NHS provision. The question is, how independent and how representative will the LINKS really be?</p>

I do not think that a case has been made for the abolition of patient and public involvement forums. Will the LINKS have adequate resources? Will they work within the terms of the Nolan principles, so that people directly involved in the provision of health and social care services will have to state as much and to withdraw from discussions? Most importantly, will they be bound by anti-discrimination legislation, because those who are involved in the PPI forums such as the successful ones in Leicestershire have not been able to get information on that out to their would-be successor organisations&#151;the LINKs?</p>

I am concerned that although public involvement is mentioned in the Bill, the word &#147;patient&#148; does not arise a great deal. The voice of the patient was clearly articulated by community health councils, and I am concerned that that voice might be lost in this subsequent reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para15"><a name="0701226000277">I have spent some time setting out the Bill&#146;s biggest failings. However, its biggest failing of all is not to do with what is included in it, but with what is not. All Members will agree that what gets people really fired up about local government is the level of council tax. That is ironic, given that the blame for punitive council tax rises lies firmly at the door of the Chancellor. It is odd that the Lyons review has been put off until the Budget, by which time the Bill will have completed its passage through the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para16"><a name="0701226000278">That is why we have asked for Sir Michael Lyons to come before the Standing Committee on this Bill, in accordance with the new model of evidence-taking by a Bill Committee, so that we can take account of his views as the Bill is amended. We have also asked for Kate Barker, Rod Eddington and Sandy Leitch to do so, because they are all reviewing areas that directly affect the role of local government. Taking evidence as part of the scrutiny of legislation is a new House procedure, and the Government must make sure that they keep their promise to let scrutinisers have a proper say over who they call before them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para17"><a name="0701226000279">We are debating the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, but what is missing is the one vital measure that would make it truly local. That measure is the abolition of unelected and unaccountable regional government&#151;regional quangos that cost every household almost &#163;600 every year. How much longer must Ministers indulge in this absurd regional agenda? It was the Deputy Prime Minister&#146;s pet project, but it has now become the elephant in the living room.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para18"><a name="0701226000280">Nobody wanted regional government, but it was forced on them anyway, and for as long as it exists anything that the Government say about localism will be met with scepticism. Abolishing regional government would help to bring council tax down and give real force to localism. If the Bill were to contain that measure alone, it would be greeted with great enthusiasm across the country. But of course, the Bill does not provide for that, just as it does not provide many commonsense measures that would deliver real localism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para19"><a name="0701226000281">Instead it shackles local government more firmly than ever to Whitehall. How could the ongoing threat of abolition be perceived as anything else? Far from being a feast of devolution, this Bill simply throws councils a few scraps from the table. The reason for that is understandable. The Government are ruled by a centralising Chancellor.</p>

That is hugely important in terms of the way that our people look at government, both local and central.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para20"><a name="0701226000285">The Bill is clearly only the first part of the changes that have to be made in the relationship between central and local government. The second will come with the publication of Sir Michael Lyons&#146; report and the Government&#146;s response to it, and the comprehensive spending review will also have a massive part to play. It is right that that should happen, because this is about governance, administration and the delivery of public services; it is not, at the moment, about the quantum of those public services. However, the two are intertwined: we cannot talk about governance without referring to the resources given to local authorities&#151;and, indeed, vice versa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para21"><a name="0701226000286">If the resources are to match the Government&#146;s aspirations in the Bill, Sir Michael Lyons must address a number of issues in his report, including the ability to raise money from the council tax or its successor&#151;if a successor is indeed proposed. Some 90 per cent. of my authority&#146;s houses are in band A or B, which clearly reflects the nature of the borough&#146;s economy. Other councils have few, if any, houses in those bands, which reflects their ability to raise money and the economic activity within those areas. That point has to be taken account of in the way that the council tax is raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="70122-0006.htm_para22"><a name="0701226000287">However, local authorities&#146; ability to raise money from other sources must also be taken into account. I read recently in the <i> Evening Standard</i> that Westminster city council can raise &#163;25 million from parking charges alone. Other London boroughs can raise only &#163;1 million, and some even less. If the way in which central Government grant is calculated cannot take such differences into account, we will be unable to achieve a fair system for local government.</p>

needs of the given area. I understand that fairness is a moveable feast, but importantly, the formula surely has to be based on measures of need. The Bill&#146;s thrust is joint working between not just local government but other agencies, particularly the primary care trusts.</p>

<p><a name="st_o196"><a name="0701226000291"><a name="70122-0007.htm_spnew0"><a name="0701226000644"><b>Andrew Gwynne (Denton and Reddish) (Lab):</b> I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. He will know that, according to a number of indices, the borough of Stockport is considered very prosperous. However, the two Stockport wards that are in my constituency share many of the same characteristics as the five wards in the borough of Tameside and the neighbouring city of Manchester. Yet, as a result of their being in the borough of Stockport, we are at the back of the queue for much of the funding, including Building Schools for the Future Programme funding. Does my hon. Friend think that that issue also needs to be addressed?</p>

<p><a name="st_o197"><a name="0701226000292"><a name="70122-0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="0701226000645"><b>Mr. Turner:</b> Indeed I do. My hon. Friend raises a very important issue but if my reading of the Bill is right, it can be addressed through the overview and scrutiny committees. Local ward councillors in areas of deprivation within broad council areas that have a reasonable level of resources will be able to take such matters to those committees and make sure that the needs of their areas are addressed by councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para1"><a name="0701226000293">We have to take into account that not only are some local authorities underfunded, but so are some primary care trusts. If PCTs are substantially underfunded and cover the same area&#151;I see that the Secretary of State is looking at me askance, but I assure her that my local PCT is some &#163;11 million away from its target, and will still be so at the end of the comprehensive spending review. That is a substantial amount of money, and when one adds in the fact that the local authority area I represent is also well off the target that the Government have set, we have a double whammy. The Bill refers to relating the local authority, the PCT and other agencies together, so the amount of funding they all receive will be important if we are to ensure that the governance arrangements deliver for the people of the borough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para2"><a name="0701226000294">I said earlier that the definition of &#147;fair&#148; is debateable and a movable feast. However, it is not an abstract concept. On the contrary, it is very real and it will be a huge task to ensure that we have the ability to tackle deprivation. We have heard talk of a north-south divide, or a Labour-Conservative divide, but that is not the case. I recognise that there are many areas in the south of England, especially in some of our coastal towns, which have areas of great deprivation. They deserve the resources to tackle that. There are also many areas in need in Conservative council areas and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne) suggested, in Liberal Democrat council areas. It is important that we recognise that any definition of fairness has to be about tackling deprivation, on the basis of need, and we need a system of local government finance and other Government finance, when it is devolved, that recognises that.</p>

Members: &#147;Shrewsbury!&#148;] I will rephrase that. I am not quite sure where he is coming from intellectually. I know where he is coming from geographically. I was talking about the amount of money that local government and other bodies get in grant from the Government: I was not talking about what form of government we should have. I will come on to that issue if the hon. Gentleman will hold his water, as they say in Scotland, and he may have another opportunity to intervene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para3"><a name="0701226000297">I also welcome the strengthening of local councils through local area agreement, which recognises, at last, the primacy of the council as the only democratically elected institution in the local authority area. That is very important. We have had a long process, started by the Conservatives when they were in government, of moving towards quangos, and that has been to some degree continued by this Government. However, we will at last have a way to reverse that trend and make the democratic process more important.</p>

Against that background, does he agree that it is especially disappointing that the Bill does not include a requirement for NHS foundation trusts and health trusts to be members of the local area agreements and under a duty to co-operate? Those of us who have been involved in local government know that it is essential to include those health bodies so that we have the integrated service&#151;especially closer co-operation between health and social services departments&#151;that we need.</p>

A few weeks ago, I had one of my regular meetings with representatives from my local authority, PCT, acute hospital trust and local improvement finance trust. In fact, the LIFT programme in my area is the best in the country. We talk about various issues, and local MPs are involved in the discussions. I therefore agree with the thrust of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, but remind him that the Bill will enable the Secretary of State to add other organisations to the list of those that must take part in LAAs. I hope that the list will include the organisations to which he referred.</p>

assessed to be one of the best councils in the country. I am glad to place that on record yet again in this House. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para5"><a name="0701226000303">Wigan is able to engage with agencies and bodies in the private and voluntary sectors because it is recognised to be a good authority: for their part, those other bodies acknowledge that they get added value out of its involvement. Giving local authorities a statutory leadership role in their communities will cement the engagement process in place in those areas where it is already evident, and ensure that other parts of the country begin to move in that direction. The Bill will mean that a council will become, not the top dog locally, but rather a leader of equals&#151;the primus inter pares.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para6"><a name="0701226000304">I especially welcome the proposed change to the system of targets. The White Paper proposed that many targets should be scrapped and only a small number retained, and I understand from my discussions with Ministers that that is still the intention. Even more important is the fact that the targets will not be set by central Government; instead, they will be put in place through the LAAs, following discussion with local authorities. The targets that are set will therefore be relevant to each authority&#151;Wigan&#146;s targets will be different from Wycombe&#146;s, and Cambridge&#146;s from Camberley&#146;s&#151;and must reflect the needs and priorities of the elected representatives serving each community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para7"><a name="0701226000305">I turn now to the involvement of the community. That is a very important aspect of the Bill, because we must ensure that the people whom we govern are involved in the governing process so that councils can deliver services in a better way. In addition, councillors&#146; ability to refer matters to the overview and scrutiny committee will greatly strengthen their role as advocates and leaders in their community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para8"><a name="0701226000306">Moreover, the ability of council leaders to devolve resources to ward councillors will enhance that role, and Wigan, where a substantial amount of money is already devolved to each councillor, offers an example of how important and effective that can be. I live in Wigan Central ward, which is represented by three excellent councillors. They recognised that putting gates across alleys was very important in areas of terraced houses because unrestricted access to the alleys behind those houses leads to burglary and other nefarious activity. The system of gates that the councillors have put in place has greatly enhanced security, and made people feel much better about where they live. I pay tribute to Councillors Halliwell, Willis and Shaw for what they have done in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para9"><a name="0701226000307">However, the proposals in the Bill carry some dangers. For instance, community capacity is not equally spread. When I was a local authority representative for the Norley ward, I represented people who were not as able as people from more middle-class areas to express themselves and make their voices heard. It is important that we take that into account, so that the Bill does not become a nimby&#146;s charter, nor a vehicle for the articulate to override the wishes of the majority. We need safeguards to ensure that the Opposition, of whichever party, do not abuse the process and that they use the measure properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para10"><a name="0701226000308">I want to talk about unitary authorities, of which I have some experience. I was a local councillor when Greater Manchester was a two-tier authority and a  <br>

councillor in Wigan when it was a unitary authority. I was also a council officer in a district council. All my experience, both as a councillor and an officer, shows that unitary authorities serve the people much better than the two-tier system. They do so because there is clarity of responsibility between the electorate and the local authority; people do not have to go to their county council with inquiries about housing or getting their bins emptied, which is the difficulty in two-tier authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para11"><a name="0701226000309">In unitary authorities, there is clarity about resources. The fairly small district council in which I worked was full of excellent people; they were dedicated local government officers but they had neither the financial nor the intellectual resources of a unitary council. When I was chairman of the highways and works committee of Wigan council, we had a difficulty with our local building department. We resolved that difficulty only because we were a large unitary authority, with the financial resources and intellectual capacity to bring to bear on the issue. That could not have happened in the district council for which I worked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para12"><a name="0701226000310">The role of the Conservative party has been appalling. I understand that the Conservative Opposition have refused to allow Conservative-controlled local authorities to enter discussions about setting up unitary authorities, even when the authorities want to do so because they recognise that it is the best deal for their area. That is disgraceful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para13"><a name="0701226000311">The Conservatives have form. Under the Local Government Act 1972, and against the wishes and advice of Redcliffe-Maud, the Conservative Government introduced the two-tier authority system, the residue of which is still with us. They have messed about with the system ever since and they are still doing so. They know that unitary authorities are right because whenever they are in government they move towards that system. They know that county councils are not necessarily the right thing.</p>

Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, Durham, Lincolnshire, Kent, Essex and Warwickshire were all butchered by the Conservatives, when great chunks of them were put into other areas. That is their form.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para15"><a name="0701226000313">The Conservatives went even further. With no referendum and no reference whatever to people in Scotland, they got rid of every county&#151;from Caithness to Kirkcudbright and from Berwickshire to the Western Isles. Every county was abolished and unitary authorities were imposed. In Wales, every county was abolished and unitary authorities were imposed. In Ireland, all six counties were abolished and unitary authorities put in their place.</p>

We thought that there was a chance to rebuild and restore local democracy, to make it more representative, to empower it, make it more responsive, effective and capable&#151;and, of course, to provide the resources that it needs to deliver the services and responsibilities heaped on it. If local government had those foundations, we would be able to achieve a more equal partnership between local government and local democracy, and central Government and the democracy in this place&#151;perhaps something closer to the balance achieved in the US, the Commonwealth countries or the EU&#146;s larger countries, in which the proportion of spending and service delivery by local government is hugely higher than in the UK, particularly England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para18"><a name="0701226000317">We needed a more vigorous engagement and participation with communities and individuals&#151;something that could have sprung from a White Paper and local government Bill. We needed more local services, tailored more accurately to the needs of local communities, delivered and designed by local people. That was the opportunity that we hoped for, and our colleagues in local government certainly hoped to see it as well&#151;but the opportunity has been missed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para19"><a name="0701226000318">The Bill is a disappointment, not only because of what the Government have left out of it, but because of what they have put into it. They have certainly gone for quantity rather than quality, with 176 clauses and 15 schedules. Somewhere in all those provisions something has to come out right, but I am reminded of the mythical monkeys who set out to type Shakespeare. How long would it take them to achieve that, and how many failed attempts would be made on the way? It seems to me, having read the Bill, that we have much ado about nothing, but not too much of all&#146;s well that ends well&#151;</p>

It is interesting to note that the Audit Commission, having carefully looked at the performance of councils, has reported that&#151;regardless of their governance arrangements&#151;councils are improving their overall performance year by year. Whatever model is adopted, the average picture is that performance is improving.

I have had informal discussions with the Audit Commission about how that might be done. One thing that is clear is that on the basis of the Government&#146;s own system of measuring targets, inspections and performance, no discernible difference in the models can be determined. As to Cabinet government at the national level, we need reflect only on Iraq, the Home Office and the Child Support Agency to realise that that model does not always deliver effective leadership to point us in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para21"><a name="0701226000324">This Bill represents quantity not quality, change not reform, and busyness not effectiveness. There are dozens of botched proposals in it, and hon. Members on both sides of the House have already commented on some of them. I want to pick up some of the things that are missing from it, the first of which, clearly, is a strategic view of what local democracy is for, and how to make it more powerful and effective. The signs of it all going wrong were there, of course, with the White Paper, which was very much a delayed &#147;five out of 10&#148; effort, based on a compromise within the Government. It is not the Secretary of State&#146;s fault&#151;she inherited a dog and she has added the breakfast&#151;but the framework for the Bill was flawed, and the Bill itself is flawed as well. There is no strategic view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="70122-0007.htm_para22"><a name="0701226000325">Secondly, the Bill has skipped the vital question of making local democracy more representative. The Secretary of State&#146;s colleagues in Scotland, working with the Liberal Democrats, have introduced a fair voting system for local government, and it will be voted on and in place for the May elections this year. It is a great pity that such a provision has not found its way into her Bill for England. I will quote the Electoral Reform Society&#146;s comments:</p>

I shall mention a few of them; there is plenty to choose from in 176 clauses. I shall start with the internal governance of local authorities. On Friday last, the Secretary of State made a written statement about the future governance of Stoke-on-Trent council. Indeed, she referred to it in her speech, and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley) made an intervention. The Secretary of State said in her speech that she wanted to give councils flexibility, and to see them experimenting and doing all sorts of exciting things. I shall quote from her statement of last Friday, which encapsulates in two sentences what is wrong with the Government&#146;s approach to these matters.</p>

regard to the governance of all local authorities, the Bill says that they have to conform to one of the three new models, and if they do not happen to do so already, the status quo is not an option. There is no question of that situation being endorsed by a referendum before things are imposed by the Secretary of State. The point that the Liberal Democrats want to make is: why is it for the Government to intervene in the internal governance of local authorities? If there were any evidence at all that the performance of local authorities is adversely affected by one or other of the governance systems that are in place, perhaps the Government would have a case. I had a talk with a number of local government consultants who give advice on these matters, and their view was that the best that could be said of the Government&#146;s proposals is that they will not make the situation worse. There is no question of their leading to an improvement. There is no possible way in which that could be measured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para1"><a name="0701226000336">Let us consider the models and look at the changes that the Secretary of State proposes to make to how mayors will come into existence in future. I was interested in what the Minister just said: in Stoke-on-Trent the system could not be changed because it was put in place by a referendum and another referendum is necessary to get rid of it. That is all very good, but what about mayors? There have been 32 referendums on the establishment of mayors, and in 20 cases voters have opposed the creation of mayors. That is two to one against mayors. There are 12 mayors in place, and without doubt some of them do excellent work. There are some good models, and some of them are doing better than their predecessor councils were. Obviously, I want to draw the House&#146;s attention to the mayor of Watford in that context. However, the House also needs to understand that in four of the 12 cases there are active campaigns to get rid of mayors, because they are not seen as effective models at the local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para2"><a name="0701226000337">The Government&#146;s solution is, &#147;Let&#146;s take out the public participation in that decision. Let&#146;s have mayors established not by popular preference but on the say-so of a council.&#148; It is not altogether surprising that the leaders of councils tend to be in favour of strong entrenched leadership. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to see why that might be so. When we consult leaders, funnily enough they are in favour of strong entrenched leadership. The question is: is that model good for local democracy, does it improve the delivery of services, and does it give good value for money? The answer is that there is no evidence at all to show that that is so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para3"><a name="0701226000338">The proposal to have entrenched leaders, as opposed to mayors, seems to have been drawn up by somebody who had no knowledge whatsoever of local democracy. I was sorry for the Secretary of State, who had to respond to a string of questions on that point. She represents a constituency in which, for a period, no political party had overall control of the local authority. One third of all local authorities are in that position, and it is difficult to understand why she imagines that the strong leader model would be right for a council in which no party had overall control, or how a council with such a governance system would manage if it entered a period in which no party had overall control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para4"><a name="0701226000339">Whoever worked out the proposal had evidently not looked at the statistics, because in half of the remaining local authorities&#151;the two thirds in which there is a party with majority control&#151;the leader&#146;s average term of office is less than four years. What exactly is the model intended to deliver, and how will it do it? I have already commented on the difficulty that there will be for cabinets and cabinet slates; a whole set of issues will have to be explored. I point out in passing that it is a good job for the Scottish Parliament and Executive that the Bill was not in force earlier. Otherwise the past eight years would have been very difficult in Scotland, where there is a multi-party Executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para5"><a name="0701226000340">I heard the Secretary of State say that one of the reasons for going down the route proposed is that she will give enhanced powers to local government, which would therefore need strong, effective, centralised leadership to deliver results. That is fine, except for the fact that in the first half of the 20th century there was committee government even in the largest cities, and the committees dealt with public transport, and public utilities such as gas, sewage treatment and electricity. There was nothing that they did not do, and on the whole, they were leaders in those spheres. A lot has changed since then, but the idea that there could be no consensus if work was done by committees, whether multi-party or dominated by one party, and the idea that those committees could not deliver effective decisions, are not based on any proper historical analysis. We have severe concerns about the Bill&#146;s proposed changes to governance, and we simply assert that it is for local government to determine how it should govern itself. We have allowed that for the colonies, so it does not seem excessive to allow it for local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para6"><a name="0701226000341">On a much smaller and entirely different issue, the Bill includes provisions relating to the powers of the Audit Commission. At the moment, the commission not only does work commissioned by the Government in respect of local authorities, but carries out work commissioned by local authorities on their own behalf, so that, for example, an authority can find out whether its social services department is delivering. The Bill proposes to remove the right of the Audit Commission to accept such work. Just when huge numbers of local area agreements are about to come into force, when there is to be much more co-operative and partnership working, and when issues of value for money and sensible organisation between several tiers of local authorities and public bodies are more important than ever, the Government are including a provision to prevent the Audit Commission from accepting a commission from bodies that want to look into how they provide services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para7"><a name="0701226000342">I cannot imagine why that decision has been taken, but I shall be interested to learn the reason in Committee. A cynic might think that it has been done so that PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG can be taken on as consultants, at three times the price and half the credibility. <i> [Interruption.]</i> If the Minister for Local Government wants to tell me, either now or in Committee, why he thinks that is not true, I will listen, but the fact is that he is taking away that right of the Audit Commission, to the disadvantage of value for money, local government and the commission itself.</p>

There are district nurses in my constituency who have had three different employers in three successive years, as trusts were moved around. Whether the policy of patient and public involvement in health has been in place for four years, two years or one year, the Government are now tearing up a system that they assured the House was the correct response to getting rid of community health councils.</p>

When CHCs were abolished and PPIH introduced, individual complaints were siphoned off and given to the NHS, which thus acted as judge and jury on complaints made against it.

Please stay on for a bit until we pass the legislation.&#148; Clause 162 proposes to abolish the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. Despite the fact that it has reduced powers compared with CHCs, and it is very much a creature of the system, it still has the capacity to bite, because it said of the Bill&#146;s provisions:</p>

I tabled a parliamentary question about that, and the answer that I got back was, &#147;That&#146;s okay&#151;it&#146;s up to them.&#148; Not only are some important elements of the national health service omitted, but those that are omitted are the ones that are doing their best to get under cover and avoid public inspection.</p>

Many of us understood that in relation to the creation of unitaries, it was the Government&#146;s intention to have a restricted number&#151;almost a small tidying-up operation. However, by casting their net so widely, they have set all sorts of hares running in various directions. The information that we have heard from Shropshire and Shrewsbury, from Lancashire, from Pendle and from practically every other county area&#151;Cheshire is an example known to me more personally&#151;shows that there are strong views and strong voices raised in every direction, often by members of the same political party pulling in different directions.

Friend the Secretary of State as a platform to deliver real change on the ground and real changes for local people to influence local decision making and improve their lives, comes when there is no doubt that our modern society is attaching far greater importance to what happens in our immediate neighbourhoods. Paradoxically, this is at a time when we are travelling more and when global issues are attracting much more of our attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para16"><a name="0701226000356">I suspect that some of this renewed interest in localism and localities results from the centralism that we have experienced over the past few decades&#151;centralism and paternalism from the state, which apparently knows best. However, the public are critical of the apparent growing differential between the type and quality of the services offered by neighbouring local authorities. We have a far more discerning and demanding population, aided by fast and effective access to information and media headlines. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that we have experienced an increase in criticism about a lack of local involvement, and concern about postcode lotteries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para17"><a name="0701226000357">We should put that criticism in context. In 1997 Labour inherited demoralised, cash-starved local authorities whose interest in performing well for their citizens was, understandably, not a top priority. They were simply trying to stay afloat. Our first priority in government was to raise standards and aspirations, which meant the centre continuing to take a very close interest in the delivery of local public services. With so many local authorities now performing well, it is possible for Ministers to let go of some of the control mechanisms and to trust local councils and local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para18"><a name="0701226000358">The Bill is a move in the right direction, as it has the potential to offer local councils more freedom and power. Local authorities need those powers if they are to provide effective leadership. Citizens, too, will be able to take advantage of the opportunities offered in the Bill better to hold their elected representatives to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para19"><a name="0701226000359">There is widespread support for the Bill. I recently spoke at an event organised by the New Local Government Network and attended by representatives from local authorities&#151;elected and officials&#151;and by voluntary and community organisations. There was a degree of consensus that the Bill was positive for the sector, but&#151;there is always a but&#151;a number of issues were raised, and concerns were expressed that the Bill lacked teeth or, though well intentioned, was a little too vague in some areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para20"><a name="0701226000360">I should like to focus on a couple of matters. The first relates specifically to the role of the voluntary sector and existing non-statutory partners. Everyone agrees that successful communities depend on strong local government. Sir Michael Lyons is clear about that when he refers to the importance of place shaping in achieving good community cohesion and thriving local economies. That can happen only if we have clear local leadership and greater involvement and engagement with the public and a range of partner bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para21"><a name="0701226000361">The voluntary sector plays an important role, which the Minister responsible for the third sector  <br>

acknowledged in his recent public comments. It is not there to take over delivering services but clearly has the experience, expertise and contacts on the ground to offer support and partnership when appropriate. It is also in a good position to assist individuals to scrutinise local authorities and elected members. Indeed, volunteers often act as advocates for marginalised groups in our society&#151;the very people whom the Bill seeks to empower.</p>

Will the Minister set out the mechanisms that enable the Department to ensure that local authorities seek the voluntary sector&#146;s support and advice? The National Council for Voluntary Organisations is worried that we are considering an extraordinarily grey area and would like the voluntary and community sector to be recognised as an essential non-statutory partner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="70122-0008.htm_para24"><a name="0701226000364">Issues that relate to delivering the many proposals in the Bill also have an impact on the voluntary sector. In the main, it does an excellent job, but if the Government and local authorities are serious about using its expertise to best effect across the range of new aspects that the Bill outlines, it will need support to build capacity. Local authorities should also take account of other Government-funded programmes for supporting the sector, such as Change Up and Capacity Builders. It is important, when providing support to the community and voluntary sector and enabling it to engage with the Bill, to link what is happening locally and nationally. Otherwise there is a risk that the Bill&#146;s best intentions&#151;empowering local citizens to have their voice heard&#151;will not be fulfilled as comprehensively as it is hoped.</p>

Respected organisations such as the Local Government Information Unit, the Centre for Public Scrutiny and the Local Government Association have asked why several key local providers, especially in the health sector, have not been included. Again, I appreciate Ministers&#146; dislike of including lists in legislation, but perhaps the Minister will explain the reasons behind the exclusion of NHS foundation trusts and health trusts as well as housing associations from the short list.</p>

My hon. Friend mentioned arm&#146;s length companies. Housing associations are an interesting case. Given that much of the Government&#146;s housing policy has been to move local authorities&#146; role to providing a strategic overview of housing of all sorts of tenures in their area, it is perhaps a little odd that housing associations are not included, especially when they are often partners in a range of social policy initiatives, such as those on antisocial behaviour, as well as being the main social housing providers in some areas. There is also the wider criticism that a minority of housing associations are not as accountable to their tenants as they ought to be. The Bill provides a real opportunity to do something about that.</p>

Individual councillors sometimes complain that their voice is not heard or that they are not taken seriously, perhaps because they are in a minority, either politically or for reasons such as race, gender or religion. I must stress that that is not the norm, but in those cases, the public can understandably feel helpless and voiceless.

The community call for action can strengthen the hand of councillors and citizens, but we also need to be wary of the vexatious citizen or group. Proper safeguards must be put in place to ensure that the call for action is not misused, for example, to slow up important decisions or to give interest groups more influence over decisions in the wider community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para5"><a name="0701226000374">I know that SIGOMA&#151;the special interest group of municipal authorities&#151;also has worries about that part of the Bill. We all know that those who are well educated, literate and who have good communication skills can quickly form action groups, not necessarily for the benefit of the whole community but more on a nimby basis. They have the power and the tools to do that, and unless the voluntary sector is given the right funding and recognition to support the vulnerable, certain groups in our communities will still not be heard or have the support that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para6"><a name="0701226000375">Other hon. Members have already expressed concern about local area agreements. I am pleased that the targets are to be extended, and there is evidence from the existing scrutiny of health that that will strengthen partnership working and assist in finding solutions to local problems. However, the Bill restricts the duty to respond to scrutiny to specific agreed LAA targets, which leaves gaps. Many outside bodies would like to see the scrutiny power over partner agencies extended to cover other issues of local concern, and not just the issues covered by LAA targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para7"><a name="0701226000376">I should like to make one small point relating to the openness and accountability of first-tier councils. Will the Minister explain why the Department does not hold a database of first-tier authorities? Is it because the bureaucracy involved would be enormous, or are there other good reasons? He will know that this issue exercises the National Association of Local Councils, and it would be helpful if that matter were clarified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para8"><a name="0701226000377">The Bill specifies a new duty on local authorities to extend the participation of local citizens, which will be essential if the raft of measures set out are to be translated into better and greater engagement from residents. However, the duty does not specify how that is to be done. It appears to leave it up to the local authorities themselves. How will the Secretary of State monitor whether local authorities are widening participation? The Bill is wholly non-prescriptive on that issue. So much of the Bill&#146;s success hinges on greater involvement from a range of partners, and yet it appears to leave how that is done in the hands of councils, which is little change from the current situation. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will offer reassurance on that matter.</p>

Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck), who has made an elegant transition from political adviser to parliamentarian. She raised some extremely practical points about how things work on the ground, which is the most important question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para10"><a name="0701226000380">The Secretary of State described the Bill as radical, which makes me think that we ought to call in the trading standards officers. I do not think that there is much that is radical about the Bill at all, but I note that Bolton lost 5-1 away to Middlesbrough on Saturday, so perhaps she had a bad weekend in preparation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para11"><a name="0701226000381">The impression that I get from the Bill is that it is very provisional&#151;many parts of it seem to betray unmade-up minds in the Department, which has not really decided in which direction it is facing. We understand that we are in a period of regime change and transition, and that there are pulls in different directions, which all Departments are caught between. The Department for Communities and Local Government in particular is caught between different tendencies. The Government&#146;s ambitions do seem to have been diluted significantly, however, since the departure of the right hon. Member for South Shields (David Miliband), who is now the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para12"><a name="0701226000382">Of course, there is always the argument, &#147;We are waiting for Lyons.&#148; We have been waiting for Lyons so long, I am amazed that Pinter has not written a play about it. One might say that Lyons would be the ghost at the feast, if we had a feast. We do not have a feast, however; we just have a ghost. We keep waiting to hear not just when Lyons will be delivered but when the Government will decide to publish it, and whether they will publish their own conclusions, so that they can be judged by the electorate in the local elections in May and we will not be caught by local government purdah; otherwise, we will have entered a further stage of regime change, and it will be another year before local government finance starts to be given any future shape. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para13"><a name="0701226000383">If the Bill is intended to be a charter for devolution, it is timid and tentative. If it is a blueprint for empowerment, it is hesitant and unadventurous. If it seeks to introduce a revolution in leadership, it is muted and confined. Only in unwinding some of the best-value gendarmerie of inspection and control does it show a few red blood corpuscles; curiously, the debate has concentrated little on that, which I think is the most important part of the Bill. Of course, the Bill does not specify in any detail what will replace that. The Government made clear in the White Paper that there would be a rigorous system with a framework of outcomes. We agree with that, but the devil would be in the detail in relation to how it operated in practice. That part of the Bill, however, is welcome, and one to which we can all subscribe.</p>

Two years ago, we had the Miliband momentum, which made it clear that the Government wanted to deal with reorganisation once and for all by heading for unitaries. One year ago, we had the Kelly crush for directly elected mayors. That also seems to have been diluted. What we have ended up with are some confused signals from Government. Does the regional agenda still hold true? Could it be reconfigured to help the idea of city regions to develop, and I am enthusiastic about the concept of city regions? Do we find the Prime Minister&#146;s attachment to charismatic leadership running up against the Chancellor&#146;s devotion to institutional solutions? All those questions seem to be unresolved.</p>

The job then was to get that brought to a conclusion, which we did. I see strong arguments for unitary councils, but I am much more an enthusiast for smaller unitaries. I am fed up with the obsession with capacity which seems to underline so many Government actions. Other factors are important, and accountability, identity and responsibility are among them. I would be much more sympathetic to a French-style system. It appeals to me a great deal more because the level of accountability is much more tangible than it is in our system.</p>

There must be a geographic area that corresponds to the sensible solutions to those problems. Other parts of the country have different problems and would not need the same solutions.</p>

I am not sure whether the aim is to allow Cambridge or Oxford to become a unitary, but based on current boundaries, there are serious questions about both those cities. Nor do I feel that the conspiracy is as deep-seated as others do. In any case, it is fairly small beer. The applications will be in by the end of the week, if I remember the date correctly, and then we will see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para16"><a name="0701226000390">One of the other problems with the Bill is that however much the Government talk about devolution, leadership and letting people decide, they cannot, at the end of the day, kick the habit of prescription. The prescription of different forms of council management are not necessary. If we have a sensible framework to deliver outcomes, I do not understand why the Government should be preoccupied with the structure that delivers them. It was, after all, the Prime Minister, I think, who said that what works is what is best or what is right. Although I do not usually quote him with approval, and I see some cringing on the Labour Benches at that non-ideological, pragmatic approach, on the whole right he is right. That is what matters, rather than the structures. I regret that we have that form of prescription.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para17"><a name="0701226000391">A large part of the Bill is unexceptional and, frankly, unobjectionable. I am mildly in favour of it. There are three main thrusts: leadership, devolution and empowerment. I have said that I cannot quite see that any of them is enough to send the citizens storming to the barricades. Leadership is covered by the local area agreements, requirements on public bodies to co-operate and the scrutiny powers. The local area agreements offer important opportunities and possibilities. As the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport said, there is bound to be debate on who is embraced by the local area agreement. If one is not careful, one gets an absolutely gigantic sort of jellyfish of an orgasm&#151;<i> [Laughter.]</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para18"><a name="0701226000392">I wondered how many of my colleagues were awake. I am agreeably surprised. I meant &#147;organism&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para19"><a name="0701226000393">That organism will be very difficult to manage. People will ask why the health trusts and housing associations have not been incorporated, but if they all are incorporated, the poor local authority that has to manage the arrangement will spend the whole of its time packing its bags for a journey that it never gets around to taking. There must be some framework and limit to the working of the system, but I think that there are huge possibilities. Given the pattern of local government expenditure, it may well turn out that in a number of years the expenditure flowing from the local area agreements surpasses the expenditure flowing from the revenue support grant. We need to find sensible ways of managing the reorganised system and giving it a proper direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para20"><a name="0701226000394">Another issue is devolution and the possibility of all-out elections and single-ward councillors. I am not sure to what extent my agent constitutes a representative focus group, but he is passionately keen on the idea on the grounds that it will make his job a great deal simpler. This is something that can be decided locally. The enactment of byelaws without the approval of the Minister of State is welcome, but will it be possible to enact byelaws dealing with the issues that my constituents get excited about? They are constantly demanding traffic-calming measures, for instance, and measures to deal with antisocial behaviour&#151;which, no doubt, will be covered by the local area agreements in any case.

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para22"><a name="0701226000396">As for empowerment, I am rather in favour of parish councils. I recognise that in metropolitan areas certain issues may arise when there is a concentration of people from particular ethnic minorities or persuasions. I only hope that people will beware of thinking that parish councils can achieve very much at all. In fact, their powers are token. The smaller parishes devote most of their time to writing letters to the other authorities in a mood of increasing frustration, trying to persuade them to do something about a local issue, or complaining about or giving advice on planning when they know that the district council will not take a blind bit of notice in any circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para23"><a name="0701226000397">I speak with some feeling because my wife is a parish councillor. She brings to her parish council a way of doing things that is no doubt due to her French blood, and occasionally leads her to pass comments on Uttlesford district council and Essex county council which would not bear repeating in the Chamber. I have no doubt that the officers of those two councils would reciprocate in equal terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para24"><a name="0701226000398">Creating parish councils may provide a voice, but the voice is often not heard. We need to think hard about whether the powers of parish councils&#151;which can vary hugely in size, from representing a small market town to representing 200 people in a village&#151;are really effective in an age of devolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para25"><a name="0701226000399">I can see what the community call for action is trying to do, but I am a bit sceptical about whether it will get very far in practice. Councils are pretty disillusioned, and many have not found it easy to extract any reality from the scrutiny role. However, in so far as the community call manages to kick some councillors into some sort of action on behalf of their communities, it may prove welcome. Many councils take their cue from the officers rather too easily. We live in hope, provided that&#151;as the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport mentioned&#151;the initiative is not captured by people with particular interests or agendas, as sometimes happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="70122-0009.htm_para26"><a name="0701226000400">The salient point about the legislation is that it will be launched in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. The slowdown in the rate of increase in public expenditure will dominate the remainder of this Parliament. It will be the dominant continuing political event. The comprehensive spending review will mean tight rations for local government. The most telling phrase in the White Paper, which can be found as early as the executive summary which is a bit of a relief, is:</p>

I do not think much of it; there is nothing to laugh at, as Albert might have said at Blackpool&#151;or it is &#147;neither nowt nor summat&#148; as they say in my part of the world. However, we live in hope that something better will turn up&#151;that this Bill is the beginning of a process, and that we will be able to look back at it and say &#147;Actually, something did begin at that stage, and an awful lot has happened since.&#148; We hope that that is the case.</p>

Therefore, I think that the time scale is too short&#151;although there are those who will say that if district councils were to have a year in which to come forward with a proposal they would find it difficult to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07012214000003">Let me go into the history of Cumbria. It was created in 1974 by a Tory Government. There was no logic behind its formation. It took in Cumberland, Westmorland, the county borough of Carlisle, the Furness part of Lancashire including Barrow, and a little bit of Yorkshire. The intention behind the formation of that county was to create an authority that would not be controlled by the Labour party. It would not have been possible to create it without the M6; it is, in fact, a motorway county. It can take two hours or more to drive from one side of the county to the other, even on the motorway.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07012214000004">Cumbria was never the right solution. The right solution might have been to create Cumberland with the county borough of Carlisle inside it. If we look at the mountain ranges in Cumbria, we can see that that is why Cumberland was formed. We have an affinity with the north-east. Westmorland and the Furness area, which have an affinity with the north-west, should have formed another authority that looked towards the north-west.</p>

council&#151;I know I do not look old enough to have done so, but I did&#151;and I was also a member of Cumbria county council and of the Cumbrian health authority. I chaired both the county council and the health authority, so I know the problems that they face at first hand, and one of the problems is the county&#146;s size.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07012214000006">There is no overall media coverage or local newspaper for the county&#151;although there are about six or seven local newspapers. The ITV station for the area covers only half the county. The BBC splits coverage; programmes for the southern half of the county come from Manchester and those in the north come from Newcastle. It tried to put them together in the &#146;80s, but it had to return to how things were before because nobody watched. People will say, &#147;We have Radio Cumbria,&#148; but those who can remember will remind them that we used to have Radio Furness as well but that that was done away with for economic reasons only.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07012214000007">There is no real affinity. The Minister&#146;s constituency of Oldham, East and Saddleworth is as near to Barrow as Carlisle is to Barrow, and there is more affinity between Barrow and Oldham because they were both part of Lancashire at one time. Therefore, Cumbria is vast, and it is not a county, but a sub-region. A look at the map reveals that it comprises 48 per cent. of the north-west region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07012214000008">The majority of the population of Cumbria lives on the periphery because of the mountains. We have six district councils, because it was deemed necessary to have six of them to represent the various communities. There are also five distinct accents in Cumbria, of which I have one. It is a very big area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07012214000009">Because of its size, Cumbria county council has never been particularly successful. I used to be its chairman and a couple of years ago I had an Adjournment debate because the council was so bad. I asked the Government to take back and look after children in social services. Recently&#151;until this week&#151;three secondary schools in my constituency were failing; fortunately, the Roman Catholic school, Newman, has just succeeded in coming out of special measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07012214000010">The county council has put forward a proposal to become a unitary authority. It was interesting that the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) did not endorse the leader of the county council, who is a Conservative, in terms of that proposal. I am in a cleft stick because I believe that we need to have unitary authorities. A case can be made for Carlisle to be a unitary authority, but the city council has decided not to follow that path. If any of the districts could become a unitary authority, it is Carlisle. It has a population of about 110,000, and the population in its central urban area is about 80,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07012214000011">We have had only one proposal. I can give two options. In 2004, the boundary committee for England recommended that the county be split north and south. That is similar to the boundary proposal that the districts of Allerdale, Copeland, Carlisle and Eden form one unitary authority, and that Barrow-in-Furness and South Lakeland&#151;and I would prefer Lancashire and Morecambe to be included, too&#151;form a southern one. That is one option that we should look  <br>

They intend that Cumbria should be run with 84 councillors. The Government talk about front-line councillors. In fact, what they are really talking about in Cumbria&#151;and, I am afraid, in a lot of other places&#151;is full-time councillors. Given that it takes perhaps two hours to drive to a council meeting and two hours to drive back again, young people with children will not be able to become Cumbria county councillors. All those years ago, young people like me were able to get time off from their careers, bring some expertise to the council and give something back to the local community; however, that will not be possible. I know what the public think, but councillors are not well paid and they do not get good allowances. All that a unitary county council the size of Cumbria will get is retired people. Only they will be able to take part in such a council, which will have the functions not only of the existing county council, but of the districts.</p>

The idea is to increase the number of area councillors to four&#151;one for west Cumbria, one for Carlisle, one for Eden and South Lakes and one for Barrow and Furness&#151;and to delegate massive powers to them while the centre sets the precept and plays a strategic role, thereby providing all the savings that a local authority would provide. However, the problem is that Cumbria county council did not consult anybody; it simply decided that that was the option and that such a council would be run with the same number of councillors. I suspect that they will run it as well as it ran the county council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07012214000015">So although I am in favour of unitary authorities I cannot support a Cumbria unitary authority, which would be an absolute disaster.

If I have read the Bill right, although the Government are saying that there is only a narrow window of opportunity, the reality is that the powers in the Bill will enable this or another Secretary of State to alter local government boundaries, or to have unitary authorities at a later stage. Before the Minister goes ahead and gives the okay for a unitary Cumbria, will he talk to the county and district councils and bang their heads together? Will he talk to the local MPs and see whether he can come up with a sensible solution that will give us local democracy and save the council tax payer money? That is essential. As I said, I prefer the current option to a unitary Cumbria.</p>

Carlisle. I have been helped in what I am about to say by an earlier intervention from the hon. Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell), who, in a slight slip of the tongue, referred to a two-tier option when he meant the two-council option; however, he made his position very clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07012214000017">Like the hon. Member for Carlisle, I believe that unitary local government has considerable advantages, not least because it is easier for the electorate to understand, and because local authorities then tend to have a bigger critical mass of services and staff within which they can make changes and adjustments denied under the two-tier system. It is difficult, however, to implement unitary local government in Northumberland; indeed, we have found it difficult every time such a reorganisation has been considered. At the moment we have a county council and six districts, but the size of the county makes things very difficult. It is more than 100 miles from end to end, and contains two very different types of area: a highly concentrated urban south-east core, and a large rural area stretching from Berwick, in the north of my constituency, to Haltwhistle, which borders on Cumbria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07012214000018">I want to suggest to the Minister how he might consider the bids that will emerge from Northumberland. To start with, he should remember that when the unitary question was put to a referendum at the time of the regional referendum, there was a clear vote&#151;some 56 per cent.&#151;in favour of two unitary authorities for Northumberland, not one. The votes were broken down according to the way in which the regional referendum was conducted, and in my own rural area the majority in favour of two authorities was much higher even than in the referendum as a whole. It was clear that there was no consensus for a single county-wide unitary authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07012214000019">The Labour leadership of the county council simply ignored that fact and decided to go ahead and put to the Minister a proposal for a single unitary county authority&#151;against the wishes of many of their own councillors. Indeed, the leadership did not even seek the council&#146;s support for the proposition until last week. The Minister will have received letters, deputations, visits and all sorts from the Labour leadership of Northumberland county council, but they never sought the support of the council for their proposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07012214000020">Meanwhile, the Northumberland districts showed surprising consensus. Bearing in mind all the past difficulties, I was surprised that all six districts agreed that a twin unitary authority solution was the right way to go.</p>

<p><a name="st_o231"><a name="07012214000021"><a name="70122-0010.htm_spnew4"><a name="07012214000053"><b>Mr. Ronnie Campbell:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is right to mention the decision that the Labour group took last week. In fact, it was a very narrow decision; the leadership were about to lose the vote, until they reached a compromise. Labour councillors were not going to vote for it, which shows how far apart the leadership were from their own council.</p>

council. We both disagree with the view that the county leadership have been putting forward. <i> [Interruption.] </i>We both agree with our wives about this issue; indeed, all four of us agree with each other. In fact, all four of the county&#146;s Members of Parliament agree on this issue, as I shall shortly explain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07012214000023">The districts put together a proposal for two unitary authorities which is an impressive feat of consensus. What really struck me was the fact that they had recognised that different issues would confront the two authorities. The more urban of the two authorities, they said, would primarily face issues such as health inequality, low educational attainment, access to employment, crime and disorder, and synergy with the wider city region based in Newcastle, whereas the dominant issues for the more rural authority would be access to services, market town sustainability, tourism and economic diversification, affordable housing, transport and the condition of the highways. There were different strings of issues, from which I have merely cited some examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07012214000024">That was a revealing analysis. We are talking about two different areas that face rather different problems. They obviously have some problems in common with other parts of the country, but there are some striking differences. The financial calculations, which are notoriously unreliable in any local government reorganisation proposal, did not show huge differences between what could be achieved by having two authorities and by having one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07012214000025">I turn to the point that the hon. Member for Blyth Valley so vividly portrayed. When the county leaders put their single-council plan to the council, they realised in the end that they could not win&#151;that they simply did not have the votes&#151;although extremely strong letters had been sent to Labour councillors, saying that if they did not toe the line they would be expelled, and would not be allowed to stand in the district council elections later this year. That was a pretty serious threat, which they nevertheless continued to withstand. I should explain that in the meantime, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) had written to Conservatives in the area, saying that they should not support any change at all, although quite a number of them were by that time firmly committed to the two-council option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07012214000026">The council&#146;s Labour leadership realised that they were not going to get their proposal through, so at the very last minute a revised motion&#151;it was not on the agenda paper; councillors did not have it beforehand&#151;was produced, containing the following wonderful words:</p>
<a name="70122-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="07012214000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Council...Endorse the submission of a single unitary proposal in the context of county support for the submission of both a single unitary by the County Council and two unitary councils by the district councils.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07012214000027">In other words, they could take their pick. As the county leader said at the meeting, the Government are going to decide which one to have, anyway. So the council leadership could not get their own proposal through their own council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07012214000028">The bid was very complex, involving adding 22 neighbourhood structures. One factor that influenced a lot of people was the county&#146;s failure to deliver for rural areas. Opinion probably swung even more behind the two-authority solution when it was realised that the  <br>

county had an institutional inability to cope with some of the rural problems. The Minister for Schools has taken a close interest in a very vivid example of such problems, and he has recognised that further work needs to be done. In trying to deal with school transport issues, the county ended up imposing a very high charge for school transport for over-16s. It decided to charge &#163;360 per child aged over 16 for transport to school in the rural areas of the county. That does not happen in Cumbria. The council also withdrew train passes from students from Berwick who were travelling to college in Newcastle and told them to go on the bus, which took one and three quarter hours. The usage of the bus has fallen to five people, because it is such an impossible way to travel to college. That is one example of how the decision-making structure of the county did not enable the rural aspects to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07012214000029">Another example is the executive, which does not have a single member from either the Alnwick district or the Berwick borough, and has only one from Tynedale. That reflects the partisan differences between the different areas, but those differences would be writ large in a single unitary authority. Whichever part of the authority managed to gain control of the executive, the rest would feel very left out. The two-council alternative is more attractive and more popular.</p>

<p><a name="st_o233"><a name="07012214000030"><a name="70122-0010.htm_spnew6"><a name="07012214000055"><b>Mr. Ronnie Campbell:</b> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that if we were to have a referendum, support for the two unitary authorities, in his area and mine, would be overwhelming?</p>

In fact, if anything, opinion has probably strengthened in that direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07012214000032">If the Government decide that the area is not one that they should choose and if they are not prepared to accept the two-council bid, the alternative will be to make a reality of a new kind of two-tier system, and make it work properly. That was ruled out because the county leaders were so concerned to get the one authority bid, that they would not have a serious discussion about making the two-tier system work. For it to be made to work, and some of the problems to be addressed, it is clear that&#151;as the districts have recognised&#151;they will have to share more services and staff and work more closely with the county. That discussion never got off the ground, because the county said that it would not play that game because it was interested only in a single county bid. It was up to the district councils to make a different bid if they wanted to&#151;</p>

a bid, all the districts are against, a referendum in the area voted against it and the county council leadership cannot get its proposal through, a Minister might want to think about rejecting that bid, looking to see whether another bid is on the table and deciding whether to proceed in that area at all. I suggest to the Minister that he meet the four MPs from the county&#151;the hon. Members for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson), for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell), for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy) and me&#151;as we all agree in our opposition to the county option.</p>

It is clear that to accept the county leadership&#146;s bid for a single unitary authority would not make any sense. Most of the elected representatives in Northumberland, both urban and rural, take the same view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70122-0010.htm_para25"><a name="07012214000038">My hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell) addressed the more general issues raised by the Bill, but I wished to consider one aspect that I hope does not feature in any bid and is not forced on any council&#151;the directly elected executive. That strikes me as the most barmy proposal for local government that I have ever heard. Interestingly, the Secretary of State did not advance it or explain it when she spoke earlier. It would involve all the parties putting forward a slate of candidates for those posts. If there were eight executive posts, all three parties&#151;perhaps even the independents, too&#151;would put forward a slate of eight candidates. If a party thought that it had a good chance of winning, but was not certain, it would be likely to put up the same people to be members of the council. Indeed, knowing the difficulty that we all have finding candidates, it is likely that the parties would do that. So on election day, one of the slates would be elected and the eight candidates would become members of the executive. Immediately, those people would have to resign from the council, leading to eight by-elections to replace them. That used to be the situation in the House of Commons. Ministers used to have to resign after they were appointed and a by-election would be held, which they took part in. The House abolished that procedure some 60 or 70 years ago, and nobody has ever thought to reintroduce it.</p>

For a host of reasons, local authorities need the option to remove a leader if it is felt that he or she is not operating properly.</p>

People can put forward different models and the Government can make provision for them to be used, but I do not want prescription by the Government, whereby local authorities are saddled with a system that they cannot change after they have had some experience with it. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley) mentioned the situation in Stoke, where the procedures make it difficult to change even if there is a consensus in favour of that change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70122-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07012214000045">The Bill is still loaded in favour of certain preferred solutions, and it would be much better if the Government, while keeping whatever models they want&#151;including ones that I think are barmy&#151;provided a procedure for local authorities to adopt a model but to be able to change it if it is wrong. We could also have a trigger mechanism that allowed the electorate to say that a model was not working, and hold a referendum to defeat it. That would be an improvement. However, the main purpose of my speech was to give the Minister some guidance on how he might view what almost everybody in Northumberland regards as an unacceptable bid to create a single unitary authority for the county.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State set out when she introduced it. It is the start of a process, and it contains much for us to build on. Like other hon. Members, I recognise that dealing with the structures and functions of local government can be only a part of the process of revitalising local democracy. The fundamental questions of how local services are funded and paid for must wait for the Lyons review. Only by returning responsibility for most of local government revenue to the local level can we ensure that accountability to the local electorate is fully restored.</p>

Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) touched in passing on the first&#151;that measures to revive local democracy can be successful only if high-calibre candidates from a cross-section of a local community are willing to serve. In many areas, such people do not put themselves forward for election, and the sad fact is that the average age of councillors is now somewhere in the late 50s, with barely one in eight under the age of 45.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70122-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07012224000003">All political parties find it difficult to get younger people to stand. Women remain under-represented in many local authorities, and minority groups often do not get a look in. Equally, the calibre of council candidates presents an enormous challenge. All parties will admit privately&#151;and some of them will do so publicly&#151;that in many areas it is difficult to get effective local people to put themselves forward as candidates, or to stand for a second term. Far too often, people will serve one term and then decide to go and do something useful&#151;to &#147;get a life&#148;, as some have expressed it. I served on a local council for 30 years, and I have some sympathy for them. Perhaps I was the one who did not get away.</p>

The system was designed to give the public at large a clearer view of what was happening in a local authority, and to enable authorities in turn to provide leadership to their communities. Although it may have worked in some areas, it did not work everywhere and it is certainly not a model that some local authorities have been able to use as effectively as its original proponents hoped.</p>

I share some of the reservations expressed by other Members. I suspect that, when faced with the choices that the Government propose, the majority of local authorities will opt for the model they consider nearest the status quo. There are many vested interests in most local authorities that will lead them to do that. Inevitably, the option that most will take is for a leader with a four-year term.

In most circumstances, that change of leadership and the loss of confidence implied will have to result in a change of council leadership, whatever the mechanism for achieving such a change. Loss of confidence in the majority political group would inevitably result in a change of council leadership, too, and mechanisms would have to be devised to ensure that that is possible. There would be very little difference from the current situation. I say that as someone who survived 17 annual general meetings. The council leader only ever had one-year terms&#151;from one AGM to the next&#151;and I suspect that the result of the Government&#146;s option will be little different.</p>

As I indicated in my opening remarks, the funding of local government is a fundamental issue, but directly elected mayors would be appropriate in some areas and, as I have suggested in responses to other interventions, if a choice is to be given, there should be the option of returning to a structure much more akin to the one with which those of us who began in local government many years ago are familiar. I acknowledge that improvements to the committee system could be made, and that a degree of executive authority could be given to the chairs of committees, but if options are to be given, the two that would be most appealing in terms of revitalising local government are the directly elected mayor and something akin to the former committee system.</p>

Clearly, the Bill will not deal with the issue of boundaries&#151;I would not expect it to&#151;but the problems of the urban core can still only be properly addressed outside their very confined boundaries.

Indeed, the creation of patients forums and the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health was hard won by the Government in the face of strong opposition in the House and elsewhere.

Once established, patients forums were not provided with the administrative support that they needed, which compounded the original error. As a result, the turnover of membership has been high. Meanwhile, the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health has cost more than &#163;120 million to set up and run over the last four years and will cost even more to abolish, whereas CHCs did not require such a costly body to oversee their work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70122-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07012224000041">One of my concerns is that the hard work and expertise contained within patients forums now risks being lost by a Government intent on replacing them with LINKs&#151;a matter that one or two Members have already raised. The qualifications for individual membership of LINKs are not set out in the Bill, but left to the discretion of a host organisation. There can therefore be no reality to the Government&#146;s claim that LINKs will build on the work of forums or that forum members are being encouraged to participate in the new arrangements. In particular, the specialist knowledge and skills of patients forums attached to such specialisms as mental health and ambulance services risk being lost&#151;a terrible waste. The Government risk repeating the mistake that they made when they scrapped CHCs, for far too little of the expertise contained within them was transferred over to the patients forums. As a result, the patients forums did not get off to a good start; and the Government risk making the same mistake again.</p>

is the incentive to serve? The Government must take on board that fact. The problem is compounded by the fact that a lot of patients forum members feel as though they have been completely ignored. I can speak only for the local patients forum members, and they feel that they have been completely sidelined, as though they do not exist and as though their expertise counts for nothing in this process. That is a bad mistake, and it does not bode well for the Health Minister&#146;s claim that, suddenly, that expertise will find an easy path into LINKs, when existing patients forum members are being completely ignored in the reform of patient and public involvement.</p>

Therefore, if we were to release the resources that currently go to the commission at the centre, we had to find a mechanism to enable money to go directly to patients forums. Local authorities are a very good example of how contracts can be let to voluntary organisations independently to run the LINKs. More money will therefore go to the new LINKs through the auspices of the local authority, while preserving their independence.</p>

<p><a name="st_o278"><a name="07012224000057"><a name="70122-0012.htm_spnew12"><a name="07012224000184"><b>Mr. Baron:</b> I hear what the Minister is saying, but the fact remains that many of those who were consulted&#151;certainly, a lot of patients forum members&#151;do not understand why the funding must take such a route. When the expert panel responsible for developing the concept of LINKs included no such recommendation, it certainly brings into question the Minister&#146;s reasoning on why the funding should take that route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70122-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07012224000058">Let us briefly discuss one or two other concerns that Opposition Members have about LINKs. A further concern of ours relates to the powers of inspection. Where patients forums have been successful&#151;for example, in putting the spotlight on cleanliness or the quality of hospital food&#151;the power to enter and inspect NHS premises has often been the key. However, the Bill seems to contain, at best, a watered-down version of that power&#151;a power to enter and view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70122-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07012224000059">Of course, it is impossible to tell how useful the new power to enter and view premises will be, since precise arrangements will be left to the Secretary of State&#146;s discretion in making the regulations. However, CPPIH has expressed concern that the qualifications and conditions set out in the regulations could have the effect of weakening the power to enter premises. The words &#147;inspect&#148; or &#147;inspection&#148; do not appear anywhere in part 11, whereas they were key to previous PPIH legislation. The patient and public involvement forum for the University Hospitals of Leicester said:</p>
<a name="70122-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="07012224000134"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The inspections and service reviews which have had such strong impact on improving patient care have depended on the statutory powers. To discard a programme of over 20 inspections a year by trained and experienced Forum members is a retrograde step, damaging to patients and the public.&#148;</p>

It was not even included in the original proposals. Only when the Health Minister turned up at a meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on patient and public involvement and got a very strong reaction against the Government&#146;s proposals did they include the power to enter and view. We contend that that falls well short of the power to enter and inspect. There is a big difference, and the Bill does not make it clear that the powers that patients forums have will be matched by those of the new LINKs.</p>

We listened to what members of patients forums said and agreed that there should be a right of entry to premises. However, it is important to remember that not every member of a LINK would have a right of entry, possibly because of sheer numbers, but also because anybody involved in that has to have a Criminal Records Bureau check. We have kept that back for regulations so that we can continue to consult on how that role can best be carried out. That was a response to the patients forums.</p>

What is blatantly clear from the Bill is that the power to inspect seems to have been withdrawn as part of begrudging concession by the Department of Health. LINKs members can only &#147;view&#148;. There is a difference, and I look forward to that matter being fleshed out in Committee.

It fails to create a national voice for patients, or even the capacity for regional networking of LINKs. The Department of Health has talked about a national voices project, but that initiative has been led by the voluntary sector and is currently quite separate from LINKs. Nor does the Bill give patients a direct role in the regulation of health and social care. LINKs apparently lack that function, despite the recommendation from Lord Currie that a function should be created. For our part, we have already consulted on proposals for health watch, an independent national voice for patients, but with a local presence, which would combine the traditional investigative and representative functions of PPIH with those of a modern, consumer-style watchdog. Until the Government join us in embracing that concept, patient and public involvement in the NHS and social care will continue to suffer from the Government&#146;s poverty of ambition.

good things, not least the facility to allow credible cases for unitary council status to go forward. None the less, I hope that we will not lose sight of&#151;or fail to debate in as much detail as is required, certainly in Committee&#151;the public involvement part of the Bill. I wish to address that subject today, as the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) has just done. Out of 14 parts and 176 clauses, only one part&#151;part 11&#151;covers patient and public involvement in health and social care. Although I express a personal view, I also speak as chair of the all-party group on patient and public involvement in health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70122-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07012224000069">In 2000, a national health service plan proposed to abolish community health councils. In late 2003, patients forums were set up, together with the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. Now, both the forums and the commission are to go, to be replaced at local level by LINKs and at national level by, it would seem, nothing. The all-party group has sought to identify the views of patients forum members on the best way forward. We met a large number of representatives on 30 October in the House and we will meet a smaller number on 30 January. The principal concerns expressed by patients forum members that we have dealt with are as follows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70122-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07012224000070">First, there is uncertainty about the direction of travel and where we are going. Secondly, there are fears that LINKs will not be independent and will be subservient to the political process in local councils. Thirdly, there is the feared abolition of the inspection rights currently enjoyed by forums. Fourthly, there is the apparent lack of a national voice. Fifthly, there is the failure of Government, as perceived by the people we met, to recognise that forums already actively pursue networks, links and local contacts with a variety of voluntary and other organisations in their areas. All those are fair points to raise and need to be addressed in the House, both today and, perhaps especially, in Committee and later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70122-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07012224000071">Personally, as I indicated in an intervention on the hon. Member for Billericay, I do not think that coming under the umbrella of local government necessarily undermines independence. I support local government and I think that it is capable of doing the job properly, but we need to be aware of those concerns and ensure that they are properly addressed. As I said earlier, both for budgetary and overall administrative reasons, community health councils came under local health authorities, although perhaps they were called strategic health authorities at that time. There have been so many changes, I cannot quite remember. However, community health councils were not accused of being the creatures of the Department of Health or local health authorities and so it does not necessarily follow that LINKs would suffer from that same accusation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70122-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07012224000072">However, we need to think through the administrative arrangements, the resourcing and the governance issues with regard to LINKs in order to understand how independence is to be secured and how accountability is to be made clear. My right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench will understand that the Government&#146;s intention to consult on these and a number of other related matters risks giving rise to a period of greater uncertainty and speculation on some crucial questions. That is inevitable, although hopefully  <br>

it will not last too long. Having more uncertainty and speculation on some of these matters is not satisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70122-0012.htm_para14"><a name="07012224000073">I am not upset at the thought of there being one LINK for every local government social services area in the country. I understand that that would mean 152 LINKs, instead of well over 400 patients forums. However, it is essential that they be rooted in the local authority area and that they be local. I am not certain that that would be guaranteed, because, in carrying out its duty to establish a LINK, a local council will have to tender for an outside body to do that on its behalf. I do not think that it is likely that there will be 152 outside bodies, waiting to be tendered to operate in those council areas and to set up a LINK. If a regional or a national organisation does that in some places, which is likely, we will need to ensure that local sensitivities and the shape of local areas are sufficiently respected and understood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70122-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07012224000074">With regard to the power to inspect health and social care facilities, I think that the concerns expressed by forum members are largely met. Earlier in the debate, there was some probing of the meaning of the words used, but in clause 156, there is a commitment that LINKs will have such powers, and that answers many of those concerns. Okay, so the wording is</p>

That is not necessarily the same inspection that would be made by an expert group that was statutorily empowered to take a particular route, but in general terms, many of the forums&#146; concerns are answered in clause 156.</p>

I understand that there are more than 28,000 contracts between public-sector commissioners and private or other-sector providers of social care, so there is a real problem with how inspection information will be delivered, until the contracts are amended or renewed.

In some cases, for example in the independent sector, the premises that we are talking about might be people&#146;s homes&#151;an instance might be residential homes&#151;because some social care can be delivered there. We have to respect the sensitive issues around going into someone&#146;s place of abode, and social care increasingly takes place in people&#146;s homes.</p>

I take on board the fact that there are extra sensitivities, but if my point is not addressed, it will seem as if an inferior role can be given to many social care providers.</p>

Such a facility should be there from the start; we should not tack it on later, simply because it is obvious that we must do so. I would like the Government to take that on board right now. I understand and support the proposed functions of LINKs, which are neatly set out in clause 153(2). In fact, reading the provisions on that subject&#151;they are set out in simple and straightforward language, which is welcome&#151;I do not see how patient and public involvement in health and social care could function at all, unless it is on the basis of the words in clause 153(2). I am therefore at a loss to understand why, under subsection (3), all or part of subsection (2) may be amended, or even omitted, by the Secretary of State&#151;subject, however, to consultation, as is pointed out in subsection (4). The drafting of subsection (2) effectively allows the Secretary of State to abolish LINKs at some stage in the future. I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench to address that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70122-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07012224000083">I shall comment briefly on how LINKs might work, and on the issue of membership, which has been raised by other hon. Members. I accept and agree that the Government do not want to dictate, or to be heavily prescriptive about everything that happens in the country, from the centre. They do not want membership to be pre-approved by another body, and that is absolutely fine. None the less, there is surely a need for some detail and shape. We need something to look at, so that we can discuss, understand, and hopefully improve LINKs, and I hope that that will emerge in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70122-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07012224000084">The Government rightly recognise that the patient and the public are represented not just by patients&#146; forums, but by hundreds of bodies across the land, many of them voluntary organisations, dealing with all kinds of issues, and some of them are very specialist. Beyond those bodies, there are of course millions of members of the public who dip in and out of health and social care concerns, and they should not be ignored by the system, either. There must be some structure. Presumably, there will be a LINK committee of some sort. The Bill does not say how that would be devised, but at some point before the legislation  <br>

completes its passage through this House and the other place, there will have to be a sharper focus on how LINKs could be delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70122-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07012224000085">There will be LINKs in various different parts of the country, serving different populations. Some of them&#151;in the case of smaller unitary authorities, for example&#151;will serve perhaps 100,000 or 120,000 people. At the other end of the scale, in the county of Kent, there are more than 1.5 million people. For that reason, the bodies will be different in different parts of the country. As to what they will do, obviously they will communicate with existing groups, including voluntary organisations and others, and they will try to communicate with the public, too, perhaps through websites and so on, so that people may opt in. There will be a core of people on LINKs, I guess&#151;I should not have to guess&#151;surrounded by dozens of organisations, and beyond that, thousands of individuals who will get involved now and then. Might all those people and organisations be members of LINKs? We do not know, but it is a fair question to pose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70122-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07012224000086">The answers will not come today, but I have mentioned the sort of details that we will have to address in Committee. Even if we do not need to legislate for every detail, it is important that we demonstrate that we know what we are talking about, and that we understand what sort of landscape we want to view in future, to better deliver patient and public involvement in health. I do not think that any of the proposals are bound to fail automatically, but we need more substance, and I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to bear that in mind. It has been said to me&#151;</p>

In fact, I have not heard anyone suggest that either those individuals, or their ideas, would not be welcome. Indeed, it is essential that such people are involved in the process. Discussing the absence of firm detail, someone told me that envisaging the way in which LINKs will work requires an act of faith. Yes, that is the case, but we need a little bit more than an act of faith when we legislate in Parliament, as I have said. If we are to encourage innovation and, to use a well-worn phrase, let a thousand flowers bloom, we need to know the structures on which that is to be based.</p>

Committee intends to hold on patient and public involvement next month, while, in parallel, the Bill is in Committee. I should be grateful if Ministers would assure me that the outcome of the Select Committee&#146;s deliberations will inform the Bill, and that the programme will allow that to happen, otherwise it is a waste of parliamentary time. The Secretary of State has repeatedly stated that we live in a time of change and reform. There are concerns about the way in which health services are delivered, so we particularly need effective patient and public involvement, hopefully on an informed basis, as that will help to deliver the improved and reformed health services that we want. As those changes take place and as the new PPI process is not yet clear, we must consider how we will undertake the transition from patients forums. It is therefore important that strong signals are sent on transitional arrangements. I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to reflect carefully on those matters and to introduce a framework for LINKs that is sufficiently detailed to generate a more positive debate on the way in which PPI can be better delivered.</p>

We had primary care trusts, which became large PCTs&#151;which, in fact, were the same as the abolished area health authorities&#151;and practice-based commissioning is suspiciously like GP fundholding. The Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health and patients forums are to be abolished three years after their formation. The CPPIH&#146;s annual review states that the commission was formed in January 2003 and the forums were put in place in December 2003, so they have had only three years and one month in which to establish themselves and work successfully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70122-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07012224000099">We all expected the CPPIH to be abolished, as the Labour party made a commitment in its manifesto to cut the number of arm&#146;s-length bodies. However, the abolition of forums was not mentioned by the manifesto&#151;all that I could find, in a section on empowering patients, were the phrases, &#147;putting patients centre stage&#148; and &#147;extending patient power&#148;. I was lucky enough to secure an Adjournment debate on the subject in July 2004, on the very day that a Government document on the reconfiguration of the Department&#146;s arm&#146;s-length bodies was published.

The Minister confused me further by saying that the right of access had to be limited because of the number of people who would serve on the LINK bodies. That brings me back to the efficiency of the present forums. They are the right size for members to have access even to residential care homes, nursing homes and so on. Even if they are called LINKs, we need a small group to act as the central body co-ordinating all those who contribute their views on health and social care. The right of access is crucial.</p>

The worry is that the clause introduces the word &#147;significant&#148; before describing the degree of change in the health service that would warrant a duty of consultation. The word &#147;significant&#148; weakens the provision considerably.</p>

Patient involvement is a single patient&#146;s involvement with their own care, their own illness and communication with staff. Public involvement means definite, independent, adequately resourced and adequately informed representative groups of citizens, with recognised channels for two-way communication with all commissioners and providers of health and social care in their area. The best forums were beginning to do that. If the Bill goes through, the Government must ensure that their replacement, the LINKs, achieve better public involvement, or the Government will be accused of meddling, and the words of the Earl of Derby about Lord John Russell&#146;s foreign policy in 1864 will again be all too relevant: &#147;Meddle and muddle&#148;.</p>

I think back to my time as a Lambeth councillor and remember reading reports from the 19th century about the medical officer for health and the sanitary officers, the importance of bringing together health, social services and local government, and all that municipal government at that time was able to contribute.</p>

The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) spoke about the Lyons review. Over the coming months local government leaders will have to deal with the implementation of equal pay, the extra resources that that will require, and issues relating to local government pensions, which may involve more money for local government. It is strange that, having waited so long for the White Paper, we are holding the debate without having had the benefit of the Lyons review and a clear idea of future local government finance. It is important to link local government funding with the way in which people who are elected to be strategic leaders respond to what local communities and people want. Local government must be fit for purpose.</p>

I know many councillors&#151;I am sure that some will follow this evening&#146;s debate with bated breath&#151;who want to play a strategic role in local government. They do not believe that they were elected simply to be glorified social workers. They believe that their role is to have an input into policy making so that they can deliver the policies that emerge from the council. As we heard earlier, if people cannot deliver, they will not be interested in standing a second or a third time for local government.</p>

We have heard a great deal about party funding and the way in which we engage with our party members. However, many long-standing members of my party&#151;and, I am sure, of other parties&#151;feel that their introduction to party politics was through their part in local government. That has a bearing on the funding of party politics, and it is important that we ensure that the new models for elected mayors do not lose the accountability that local government has developed through its close link with local party politics. I urge Ministers to take that on board.</p>

I should like to hear more about the way in which what happens in local government will link to the climate change measure and other Government decisions, not least that about the new combined body that will incorporate English Partnerships and Housing Market Renewal. That will have major implications for local councillors, who work through local area agreements and local strategic partnerships to deliver their agenda on regeneration, if they cannot link what happens locally with national Government targets. I hope that the Government will take account of changing national structures and the implications for what happens locally.</p>

In my local authority, I have been appalled by the lack of a seamless link between the local strategic partnership and elected council representatives. It is almost as if a parallel bureaucracy has been set up. I do not believe that that was the Government&#146;s intention. We should consider carefully the way in which we take policies further in the light of the Bill&#146;s new powers and the reorganised structures for local government.</p>

In my area, it has been delayed. None the less, decisions from the local planning department are being determined by planning inspectors in Whitehall. Without the local planning framework and the local development framework, we cannot get the whole policy together. Ministers must take account of that.</p>

The Local Government Act 2000 gave us a referendum, which provided the option of an unelected council manager and an elected mayor. Together, they would form the council executive. However, the Act did not provide for subsequent legislation or regulation to enable us to hold a further referendum and thus provide a constitutional basis for the people of Stoke-on-Trent to make an informed decision about the system of local government that best suits our needs. If that happened, we could reach agreement about the system with which we would proceed for the May 2009 elections.</p>

The Minister for Local Government is not on the Treasury Bench at the moment, but I am sure that he takes a keen interest in the debate.

They will therefore no longer have to put all their energy into worrying about that, and will instead be able to get on with taking advantage of all the Government funding available to deal with the deprivation and problems that we have in Stoke-on-Trent. We need to get on with the job of governing now, not to be sidetracked, and we need to ensure that that moves further forward.</p>

However, it would be helpful if it could be followed up, in a letter if not in the Minister&#146;s closing speech, or perhaps at the meeting with Ministers on 31 January that the people of Stoke-on-Trent have asked for. May we have an ongoing dialogue with the Government about what will fit us best, and about how we can ensure that government works locally? We need to ask questions about the role of local councillors and MPs alongside our elected mayor and council manager, and about the independent commission that the Government are considering.</p>

reorganisation that is proposed in the Bill. Like many other Members, I welcome some of the measures that apparently seek to give greater freedoms to local communities and to remove what we all hate most in local government, namely, targets and red tape. They cause sclerosis at local government level, as I and many other Members who have served in local government know, and they leave communities feeling that local government is just a mouthpiece for central Government diktats. I raised this issue earlier, and I know that other hon. Members share my frustration. Consultation often pays lip service to local views, with the outcome already having been determined by some central Government bean counter. It seems to me that the Government ask a question, and if they do not like the answer, they keep asking it until they get the right one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70122-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07012228000002">The other main driver that worries many in local government is the fact that they have little control over the purse strings. The thumbscrew approach to local government finance causes deep unhappiness, involving too many levers which mean that local authorities cannot deliver what local people want. I raised this issue during our deliberations on the Sustainable Communities Bill. If people have no control over the finances of their local council and over what their council can do, they have no real power at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="70122-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07012228000003">Too often, the Government appear to pay lip service to localism while allowing more and more important issues, such as planning, to be decided at regional level. Many Members on both sides of the House have great difficulty in accepting the regional approach. That approach causes intense annoyance in constituencies such as St. Albans, and is a prime example of the Government not listening. For example, I happened to have the delight of attending the east of England draft planning review recently. Such events are familiar to many in the Chamber who take a keen interest in local government. They tend to go like this: Hertfordshire proposes a draft housing figure of 66,000, which we believe we can deliver, but we are told to go away and come up with a figure that is more in line with central Government thinking. The council then reluctantly proposes 72,000 homes with no green belt encroachments. However, we are told that we should come up with an even better figure, and advised that 79,000 might be nearer the mark, although it would involve some green belt encroachments. Then, because our answer is obviously still not quite right, we are informed in the review that we are likely to have 83,200 homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70122-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07012228000004">I struggled when I heard the Minister say earlier that local people should shape the places where they lived and have a greater say in the places where they lived and the services that they received. That is not happening now, but if I honestly believed that the Bill would deliver that, it would have my support. However, I do not believe that it will. There is strong opposition to the ratcheting up of housing totals, and fury at the whole rigmarole of councils being asked what they would like to deliver, only for the plans to be revised centrally. Unanimous local opposition to them seems to have no effect and falls on deaf ears. The Government do not allow local people to make those decisions, and the Bill will certainly not change that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70122-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07012228000005">I wonder whether there will be a shift towards a unitary approach, with the scrapping of the existing tiers of local government. The proposals ring alarm bells for me. Indeed, I would be grateful if the Minister could tell me whether we are going to have district elections in 2007. This is a contentious issue, and perhaps it involves a thought in process in the Minister&#146;s mind. Perhaps if she gives it greater thought this evening, we shall be all the wiser.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70122-0014.htm_para21"><a name="07012228000006">I am extremely concerned that the Government acknowledge in their own review that, despite the Local Government Acts of 1999, 2000 and 2003,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70122-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07012228000007">So we are going to get a bit more restructuring, because it has obviously proved so wonderful&#151;according to the Government&#146;s own assessment of the situation&#151;that we need more of it. However, the proposals in the Bill, although quite radical, will achieve little more than moving the deckchairs around on the Titanic. If we have problems in local government, altering the structure without altering the emphasis on delivering localism will not achieve much at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70122-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07012228000008">Consequently, I have little faith in clauses 1 to 30, which propose to give the Secretary of State the power to implement structural changes to local government in England so that areas with a two-tier arrangement can easily be reorganised into a single unitary tier, but also scrapped altogether if the arrangement does not meet with the Secretary of State&#146;s approval. This will be a win-win situation for the Secretary of State, and a lose-lose situation for local authorities and local people. If people feel divorced from decision making, subjected to imposed housing quotas, stifled or driven by targets and deprived of funding, and if they get even less funding if they do not comply, how can they think that things are decided locally, and why would they have any more confidence in a Government who give more power to the Secretary of State to decide that, if they do not like the system, they can scrap it altogether?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70122-0014.htm_para24"><a name="07012228000009">The local government restructuring will be a costly exercise. As my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) pointed out, research by Professor Mike Chisholm of Cambridge university suggests a transitional cost of &#163;121 per person. Given that my council tax payers do not like paying for local government, and prefer to pay for services, not bean counters, the prospect of having to pay &#163;121&#151;perhaps more, as I have never known a Government figure that does not rise&#151;will fill them with dismay. It will hit those on fixed incomes and pensioners the hardest. What are they getting for that &#163;121? They will not get a better service; they will get a more divorced service, and people whom they do not recognise, do not know and cannot talk to, unlike their local councillors. Having been a local councillor, I know that people can ring up local councillors and talk to them; they are accountable and known. The higher up the decision making is, the less accountability there is, and the less empowered people feel when they are fed up with what their local councils do.</p>

As someone who has a two-tier authority, I do not welcome even more costs. As the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government admitted in 2006, the Government reorganisation is generally &#147;a great distraction&#148;. My hon. Friend the Member for Meriden touched on that point. Many Members will be wondering what we are being distracted from. Partly, perhaps, the intention is to further the Government&#146;s creeping programme of regionalisation&#151;regions by the back door. I hate to keep referring to the draft east of England plan review, but Mr. Tim Frehey, head of development of infrastructure for the east of England, explained that we would have regional targets on carbon dioxide emissions, and that we would have great control over housing totals. However, the beleaguered St. Alban&#146;s and Decorum officer who attended the meeting, Mr. John Chapman, said that we would have &#147;no choice&#148; over housing totals. My local council wants to ensure that local people are listened to. The thread for the regions is becoming stronger and stronger, and local democracy is diminished as a result. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="70122-0014.htm_para27"><a name="07012228000012">The housing totals debacle is a barometer of this Government&#146;s approach to regionalism: if one alters the structure, one eventually gets the right answer. The district and the county said no, so the exercise had to be done again. Perhaps I will be called a cynic, but it seems that if the district and county say no, scrapping the district and county is the way to get the right answer: a resounding yes for the Government&#146;s housing totals.</p>

They will not welcome a further dilution of their input in that regard. People on the street and the council are infuriated by frozen posts, massive cuts in services and, especially in my constituency, the loss of the proposed super-hospital. The Government are strong on consultation, which is an issue that I raised in relation to the Sustainable Communities Bill, but I am not sure that they are long on listening. A long consultation was undertaken on option 1 and option 2. Everyone was voting like mad, and it was covered in the local newspaper. Ultimately, however, we were told that there was no such option. It had all been a waste of energy and expectation for the local community. Local government, with its hold on the purse strings, just decided that the hospital was not going to happen.

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07012228000026">The Bill is an attempt to make local government more responsive to the needs and aspirations of local communities. That has eluded us for some time, and it has led to disaffection and a lack of engagement in local elections. We have a problem to overcome in relation to local area agreements between local statutory providers and local service providers. How do we engage the local community in those, and how do we create a dynamic relationship that responds to the local community&#146;s aspirations and influences those local area agreements? That should be the focus of our attention. Much in the Bill moves us in the direction of bringing local authorities closer to their communities, and I very much welcome those aspects of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07012228000027">I can give examples of difficulties that have arisen in my local communities. A number of the most deprived communities in my constituency were asking for services, especially podiatry services, for elderly people. We convinced the local primary care trust to set up a pilot service in a satellite practitioner nurse-led centre financed by our single regeneration budget programme. That proved popular and was well attended by elderly residents in the local community. The pilot came to an end and in spite of the popularity of the service and the high demand, the community unfortunately failed to influence the service providers to bend their spend&#151;a phrase we have used in the past&#151;to meet that aspiration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07012228000028">I also chair one of our local neighbourhood renewal panels. For many years, at the start of the neighbourhood renewal programme, we asked for funding for neighbourhood wardens from the neighbourhood renewal funding. However, it was difficult to get officers who supported the panel to produce a report in favour of them in spite of the fact that the whole community, covering two estates in the neighbourhood renewal area, was unanimous in its support for the idea. We finally got the report three years later and the neighbourhood wardens are now in place. They are extremely popular and are doing a very good job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07012228000029">Similarly, a number of heads of local schools came up with the idea of having adult learning centres in their primary schools. They came to the neighbourhood renewal panel with the plan to work in partnership with the further education college for the borough and develop adult learning centres where parents and people from the community could come to improve their education and employability. The scale of the improvements and benefits to the local community are difficult to quantify, but with little money from our neighbourhood renewal panel the heads were able to set up those schemes. One has led to &#163;1.4 million of additional investment to expand the adult learning centre by having a family centre on the premises and a lift to enable disabled people to access the adult college. That scheme arose from a local initiative, with the heads of local schools talking to residents on their neighbourhood renewal panel and the panel agreeing a sum to finance the improvement and introduction of those services. That is an example of people who were empowered by the resources made available to them through neighbourhood renewal programmes so that they could make a difference. There was a reason for  <br>

them engaging in the process because they made a contribution and a significant difference to their community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07012228000030">Sadly, our neighbourhood renewal programme has been rolled up into a much more centralised structure in which it has to hit specific targets. The decision-making process has been taken away from local communities. A minimal sum of money is left for people to play around with in their communities. Basically, the presence of local residents in terms of neighbourhood renewal is now a box-ticking exercise to satisfy the requirement for some sort of community engagement to deliver on the core themes.</p>

The Department funds neighbourhood renewal through local authorities. In neighbourhood renewal funding areas that is a non-ring-fenced grant through the local area agreement. Is he saying that it has been centralised to borough level or to national level?</p>

<p><a name="st_o305"><a name="07012228000032"><a name="70122-0015.htm_spnew2"><a name="07012228000083"><b>Clive Efford:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving me the opportunity to clarify that. It is very much centralised at borough level. What has been drafted for the programme of expenditure is driven by the service professionals, whether they are in statutory organisations or the borough itself. The complaint from members of my neighbourhood renewal panel is that what was working well, and what empowered the local community to be very responsive to things that came out of the community at a local level, has been diminished and has almost disappeared. That is to the detriment of the programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07012228000033">Another part of the Bill that I very much welcome is the intention to expand the support and involvement of the third sector. When we do that, and in particular when we talk about introducing local parishes in London, we need to guard against those communities that have readily available to them the capacity to take advantage of those powers at the expense of those communities that are more disadvantaged and therefore less likely and less able to do so. In saying that, not only do local councillors need to play their role, but we as MPs need to play a role, too. Often when we draft this type of legislation, we overlook our role as champions within our communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07012228000034">I have been involved in setting up local community forums in my constituency, and I am currently involved in trying to set up a charitable trust involving local residents. One of the problems that we are coming up against is that we already have an existing centre that is used by young people. The charity is funded by a trust, held by a bank, and it had a capital sum invested for it. Unfortunately, as a result of the dotcom collapse, some of that capital sum disappeared. The income is now reduced and the fall means that the charity has drawn on the lump sum that it invested, making its income even lower. It has been a vicious circle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07012228000035">None the less, the charity is an important voluntary organisation within my constituency and it is having serious problems in identifying a source to fund the core activities of a charitable trust. It has a number of irons in the fire with regard to applying for grants, but it does not have a means to access resources readily. It needs resources that can be underwritten for three  <br>

years or more to give it sustainability and the chance to plan ahead to perform its core functions. That is a big problem. The forthcoming taskforce report into the third sector must address the problem of core funding for the third sector to ensure that such bodies can stand up and play their role in delivering some of the strategies that the Government and the funding bodies want an organisation that engages with young people in the community to deliver. If those organisations fold because of a lack of funding for their core functions, the opportunity is lost to engage with them and with the use of their resources and links within the community. That is an essential part of ensuring that we have a vibrant and effective third sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07012228000036">I want briefly to cover one or two other things. Part of the Bill deals with the future of local government boundary review procedures. My experience when we had the local government boundary review in Greenwich was that the whole process was unsatisfactory. The local government boundary commission was not accountable to the local community. It held no public inquiry to conclude its initial findings and it split many well-established and well-understood local community boundaries across not only council wards but, inevitably, parliamentary seats, because its findings were the building blocks for the future parliamentary review. I say that having benefited slightly from the parliamentary boundary review. I do not want to give the Minister the impression that this is sour grapes. In fact the difference is marginal, so it is neither here nor there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07012228000037">The Cator estate in Blackheath is run by its own trust, currently served by two wards and in future to be served by two Members of Parliament. None of the decisions made any sense, but the commission committed itself at an early stage to delivering a set of ward boundaries providing for a number within 1 per cent. of the average number per ward if the population is divided by the number of wards. By setting itself that standard it drove a coach and horses through any idea of local accountability, local knowledge and local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07012228000038">If we are to engage with local communities and encourage people to participate in elections, we must ensure that they feel some affinity with the boundaries of the areas that are being represented. In Greenwich, we underwent the painful exercise of moving from two-member and one-member wards where we had 62 councillors to three-member wards with 51 councillors. In the process we made the wards too big. They are unwieldy and unrepresentative, and parts of communities are lumped together in a ward while half a mile away there is another part of another community, although there was a much more sensible solution to the problem in the locality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para14"><a name="07012228000039">The Bill suggests a system of directly elected mayors, leaders or executives. I believe that there have been 35 referendums on mayors, and that on 23 occasions the proposal was rejected. If we value elections and putting information before the electorate, allowing them to make up their own minds, we should recognise that communities that have been given that choice want to exercise it; but the Bill suggests that we take the choice away, and allow no referendums before introducing mayors. The Minister looks puzzled; if I am wrong he can correct me, but I believe that if a local authority  <br>

decides that it wants a directly elected mayor, it should be able to put the proposal to members of the local community in a referendum so that they can decide. Heaven help them if they are stupid enough to vote in favour of it, but that will be a matter for the community. In any event, the proposal should be put to the community in the form of a reasoned argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para15"><a name="07012228000040">It has been said that we have diminished the role of local councillors by electing executives. I am passionately in favour of the committee structure, because when we were on committees as local government councillors we had the opportunity to scrutinise the officers who were charged with responsibility for delivering services. At present, scrutiny means scrutiny of a member elected to an executive rather than scrutiny of the officers. What used to happen was that a group of members with broad knowledge of, say, social services in an area could interrogate the officers charged with delivering those services.</p>

However, others may understand my scepticism and that of my constituents, given the existence of similar documents produced by health managers using the phrase &#147;in your hands&#148; when the proposed reconfiguration of services seems to involve an inexorable slide towards the downgrading of accident and emergency, children&#146;s and maternity services despite the wishes of thousands of people.</p>

The Bill appears to make the clear admission that legislation in 1999, 2000 and 2003 has not succeeded in revitalising local democracy and satisfaction with local services. In fact, it could be seen as a formal apology from the Government: &#147;We are sorry. We accept that we made a mistake. We are going to abolish many of the inspection regimes such as best-value performance indicators, and reduce the burden on local government.&#148;</p>

I hope he recognises that local government has improved its services.</p>

In fact, it may have happened despite them. It is an interesting spin on the record of best-value performance indicators to suggest that once they are supposedly fulfilling their purposes, they should be abolished. Perhaps a similar proposal is being considered for patient forums. They are fulfilling their purpose in Enfield, so I do not think that they should be abolished.

That is a big omission, because it is in terms of that that people might feel a change in their level of satisfaction. They want to ensure that their council is much more responsible&#151;that it is responsible for the taxation raised, and that that links in with representation and expenditure. I await the Lyons review with bated breath, but we must not delude ourselves about the importance of matters such as shifting the structures and seeking to improve consultation.

An issue for the public is whether they have a voice&#151;whether they, or their representatives, are involved in decision-making. Is there a genuine devolution of power? The Government answer that by addressing structural change, but that takes them in the wrong direction. Their structural change involves looking at the option of giving more power to executive leaders. I have not had letters in my mailbag or people banging on my door demanding that more power be given to the council leader. People do not say that they want that.

and more able&#151;is more power and accountability for councils and individual councillors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para20"><a name="07012228000054">That is why it is profoundly disappointing that having a committee system is one of the options among the various structural models. When I was elected as a councillor in 1994, I was one of the youngest councillors in Enfield. It took a while for me to understand what was going on in the council, but I appreciated the signposts of the committee system. I knew where to go to get information and who to ask questions of. My party was not in control of the council at the time, but, as an opposition councillor, I appreciated having the opportunity to ask questions not only of councillors, but of council officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para21"><a name="07012228000055">We now have a system of cabinet government, and I was a cabinet member. I appreciated the level of involvement that I had with council officers and having some kind of streamlined decision making. However, the scrutiny of my role diminished, as did the amount of information that went not only to councillors but to the public. Also, newly elected councillors, in particular, do not know where to go. They are put on a scrutiny committee and it takes them a while to get to grips with the labyrinthine ways of how to hold an executive with increasing power to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para22"><a name="07012228000056">Other elements of the committee system that were of benefit were the degree of consensus and the cross-party working that could be achieved on a committee, for the good of a community. That now seems to be decreasing. I urge&#151;as I will do again in Committee&#151;that we look into at least giving local communities the option of having such committees, even though in my experience they are not perfect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07012228000057">Another issue to do with structure involves the standards committee. I welcome the recognition in the Bill that things have become centralised, that we need to devolve decision making, and that the conduct regime needs to be determined locally by local councillors working with independent members. I was an inaugural member of the standards committee in Enfield. The independent chairman and councillors on both sides of the party divide worked well and diligently. However, the committee became concerned that the standards board was increasingly taking powers and control away from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07012228000058">Also of profound concern throughout the country is the increased detail and the increasingly bureaucratic nature of the code of conduct, and the fact that it lacks basic common sense. Therefore, the suggestion that there might be a clearer, simpler and more consistent and sensible code of conduct is to be welcomed. However, we will need to see how that works in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70122-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07012228000059">I particularly welcome the suggestion that there will be a reduction in the burden of best value and inspection. It is about time that that happened, and my party has campaigned vigorously for it, not least during election campaigns. It is also welcome that the Audit Commission might have a gatekeeper role in terms of inspection, instead of its seeking to perpetuate the inspection regime, which is a circus in many respects.</p>

the debate. I have held a number of public meetings about the north circular road&#151;about the continued blight caused by that congested road that goes through my constituency. There was also a recent public meeting against the closure of Southgate police station. I can think of another one that intended to stop back-land development at New River crescent involving a number of houses along our river path. There was also a recent campaign about the proliferation of mobile telephone masts. All such local issues have caught the imagination and concern of many of the public, who are engaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07012228000061">However, the public have a concern that the Bill does not address: they feel powerless to make changes in respect of such issues&#151;issues that are of profound concern on their doorstep, and affect their lives. In the context of the north circular road, they see Transport for London as unaccountable to them&#151;it is unelected&#151;and that other legislation is not providing more accountability. They see Transport for London setting targets and taking action that they have no real control over.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07012228000062">Communities see the Metropolitan Police Commissioner setting central targets for what are termed community assets, but they have no involvement in the decision as to whether they can keep their local police station.

Similarly, the guidance on mobile phone masts makes little provision for consulting or involving local people.</p>

They are concerned that this is more than a structural change&#151;that it is a substantive change not in the relationship within local government, but between central and local government. That concern is not being addressed; the Bill is silent on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07012228000064">On local area agreements, the Bill refers to local targets, but the hand of central Government remains heavy. Why should the Secretary of State be able to approve local targets? Local councils and their partners should be free to determine their own targets through their own measures, instead of the Secretary of State seeking to second-guess them. To what extent will the community call for action process involve young people? Will they really be able to call on councils to act? Where is the reference in the Bill to young people&#146;s proper engagement in that process? They are concerned about their communities, but will they really be able to facilitate a call for action?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07012228000065">As I said in an intervention, crime and disorder is excluded from the community call for action process because it is dealt with in the Police and Justice Act 2006. However, what action should communities who are concerned about alcohol-related issues take, for example? Will such issues be dealt with properly? It is clear that they are not being dealt with properly now through the crime and disorder reduction partnerships. Will this bureaucratic model exclude such issues because they fall under the category of crime and disorder, and will that affect proper community engagement?</p>

I am concerned that the existing proper statutory duty to inspect will no longer exist, and that, as has been said, there will simply be a duty to observe, which comes with preconditions and caveats.</p>

Will a duty to consult only on significant changes really deal with issues in my constituency such as the local baby clinic and developmental checks, which have been removed without proper consultation? The duty to consult has not been properly upheld. I would welcome the measure if it would firm up the process, but the concern is that it will not. The dead hand of Government is clear in this regard. The questionof what is significant is determined by the Secretary of State. The White Paper was called &#147;Our health, our care, our say&#148;, and in Committee I will try to ensure that that phrase is not just words, but leads to action.</p>

authorities were not a good idea and the advantages of changing to unitary status. It is a pity that that Administration bottled out of rolling that change out across the country. Instead, they stopped as soon as they got into some difficulties in rural areas. It is not easy to establish unitary authorities in rural areas, but the Bill charts a way to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07012235000004">It is worth briefly rehearsing the arguments against two-tier authorities. They can be very costly. We have seven districts in County Durham that duplicate several functions, but we need to recognise the lack of strategic leadership caused by small districts. Districts may also not be sufficiently local to have a real connection with people. That is not a point that has really been discussed today, but their boundaries are often very artificial. Perhaps most importantly, it is very confusing for local people who live under a two-tier structure, because they are often not clear about which council has responsibility for what.</p>

think that it should be an aspiration to have leaders in place for four years, so that they can stand on a manifesto and be judged against what they have delivered&#151;or not&#151;four years later. I hope that that provision remains in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07012235000015">I appreciate that the Bill allows districts that want to work more effectively together to have pathfinder status. However, I am not sure how that will help local people who, as I have said, are often very confused about two-tier local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07012235000016">I began by saying that the Bill charts a way through the real difficulty associated with establishing unitary local government in rural areas. The unitary councils that it sets up will provide county-wide strategic planning, but the Bill also stands up for the needs of the large number of people who make up the wider community. That balance is very important if rural areas are to be able to challenge the city-region agenda, when that conflicts with their needs. For example, the regional spatial strategy in my area appears to acknowledge the needs of the two city-regions, but takes no note of the need to provide more housing or economic development in the county as a whole. I hope that a unitary authority will give the people of County Durham a stronger voice which will enable them to get that regional spatial strategy changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07012235000017">The balance to which I have referred can be achieved if we have stronger neighbourhood councils. They need powers in addition to the ones that they have already so that, when they demonstrate the necessary competence, they can deliver services at the neighbourhood level. That is very important, as people in Durham identify most with what happens at a very local level&#151;that is, in their village or urban neighbourhood. They are concerned about matters such as parking, community halls and bus shelters, and councillors should have a budget for such things so that they can react quickly to local needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07012235000018">The Bill will allow us to achieve a better balance between neighbourhood communities and more strategic planning. I cannot understand how the Liberal Democrat spokesperson, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell), can say that the Bill will not improve local representation and accountability, given that many of its provisions are intended to strengthen parish councils, where that is appropriate, and to support what goes on at a neighbourhood level with new forms of neighbourhood councils. I am also pleased that the neighbourhood councils will be able to co-opt local people to join them&#151;a system that could bring in much needed skills. However, we must look very carefully at whether that might erode the local democratic voice. Clearly, the power of co-option could be used only in very limited circumstances.</p>

Local councillors and others&#151;including young people&#151;must be able to bring forward matters for greater scrutiny in the council and get a report on what needs to be done.

I also welcome the changes to best value and the rationalisation of inspection, which are much needed to reduce the bureaucratic burden on local authorities.</p>

We shall have to tackle the difficult issue of remuneration for councillors, especially for members who become full-time members of a county council executive and whose remuneration should reflect that. We should take care not to be drawn by the <i> Daily Mail </i>hysteria on the subject; we need grown-up, rational discussion about how to include more people and involve them in local government.

For example, the official website of the City of Durham council is full of statements from portfolio holders and the council leader; they are prominent on the web pages but it is hard to find information about council services. There seems to be no body that can look into such issues.</p>

Chislehurst (Robert Neill) and my neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne), have a chance to speak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07012235000027">I want to give the Minister the result, hot off the press, of the referendum held in Shrewsbury on unitary authority status. It is with great honour that I announce that more than 27,000 people in my constituency voted in the referendum, which is great for democracy. People are interested in how their council works. I must tell the Minister that 67 per cent. of the people of Shrewsbury voted against a unitary authority&#151;a majority of more than 10,000, which is even bigger than my parliamentary majority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07012235000028">I campaigned hard against a unitary authority, so I am grateful to my constituents for rejecting the proposals. Ministers say that they will be open-minded and respect the wishes of the people. Well, people in Shrewsbury have spoken and I very much hope that the Minister will take their point of view on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para25"><a name="07012235000029">I campaigned on the issue because I felt so desperately passionate about Shrewsbury and her identity. We have the lowest council tax in Shropshire and the council is rated excellent. In my estimation, we have the best chief executive in the whole of England, Mr. Robin Hooper&#151;an excellent gentleman who does a tremendous job of providing services to Shrewsbury, despite the below inflation levels of increase in local government funding from the Government. In fact, Mr. Campbell, our finance director, informs me that this year our increase was only 1 per cent.&#151;far less than the rate of inflation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para26"><a name="07012235000030">Because of my passion for Shrewsbury, I decided to call a meeting with the Minister for Local Government&#151;I am pleased to see him in his place to listen to my speech&#151;and I must say that he is a man of honour and principle. I would like to thank him for the help he gave me&#151;a very rare thing among the Labour Government. This gentleman certainly deserves praise for all his help. However, he did say at the meetings that the Government would not be prescriptive. That word is indelibly printed on my mind&#151;and I am pleased to see him moving his head. He told me that the Government would not be prescriptive. He told me that if all areas asked for unitary authorities, the Government would not be able to afford it. He acknowledged the huge cost of redundancies and gave me a commitment in last December&#146;s meeting that the referendum would ultimately play a role in the Government&#146;s decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="70122-0016.htm_para27"><a name="07012235000031">I must say that Labour councillors tried to provide a different view of what I have said about my constituency. I am particularly upset with Councillor Alan Mosley, the socialist councillor from Castlefields, who has tried to imply in public meetings that I am somehow misleading my electorate about the Minister&#146;s comments. I put on the record here in the House of Commons that I spoke the truth to my electorate when I assured them that the Minister for Local Government would not be prescriptive in this matter and that he would take the result of the referendum into account. Unless he intervenes on me, I take it as confirmation that my comments were correct. I ask the Minister to confirm the Government&#146;s view on this matter&#151;and I need a guarantee from him in his summing-up speech that the referendum result will be respected.</p>

I did not get involved in the fiscal or financial elements, but spoke about local councillors being accountable to local people in Shrewsbury. Let me provide one example. Councillor Mrs. Judith Williams, who has represented the Porthill area for nearly 20 years, is an extremely hard-working Conservative councillor. She knows every single flagstone on every single pavement in that part of Shrewsbury. That is exactly the type of local person living in Shrewsbury who is accountable to the people of Shrewsbury and who can take the decisions that affect Shrewsbury. Nobody else from outside our town could do so as well.</p>

This quango said yes to providing money for a north-west relief road, but explained that the downside would be the imposition of congestion charging in Shrewsbury. If we have no borough council in Shrewsbury, the unitary authority will be able to impose such measures, so councillors from outside our community will be able to impose congestion charging on Shrewsbury and we will have no say in it whatever. In a unitary authority, Shrewsbury would have only about a third of all the councils across the whole of Shropshire. Tanners, a major company in my constituency, is extremely concerned and has said that it will leave Shrewsbury if congestion charging is imposed.</p>

For every single house in my borough, we receive &#163;80 less, which is an extraordinary amount of money. Two identical Shropshire hamlets&#151;Withington on my side of the border and Roden on the other side&#151;are subject to that difference of &#163;80 for every single house. That is a great anomaly, which I want the Minister to take into account.</p>

I am sick and tired of Ministers telling me, &#147;Oh well, yes, but Shrewsbury is a beautiful, quaint little English town with flowers&#151;a picturesque little town.&#148; Yes, of course, we want to have that image&#151;ours is a beautiful town&#151;but we have areas of deprivation. When his Parliamentary Private Secretary visited my constituency to look at a new library in a very run-down part of Shrewsbury, she was amazed. She said, &#147;I didn&#146;t know you had areas like this in Shrewsbury.&#148; There is that sort of prejudice among the Government. They think that, if people are out in the countryside in Shropshire, they are somehow very wealthy and do not need extra support from the Government. That is not true.</p>

My concern with some of the things that have been said about the Bill and with the tenor of some of the things that the Government are doing is that, somehow, we are trying to depoliticise the process. The suggestion seems to be that using a quango, a board or something that is not directly elected by the people provides a better way to deliver services.

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07012235000042">I fear that, by means of this leadership method, we might get mayors by the back door. I have a copy of a briefing note that was sent to me today by the parliamentary Labour party. It is for people who cannot think for themselves. It says:</p>
<a name="70122-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="07012235000116"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Does the Government want more Mayors? We want stronger leadership everywhere. The success of Ken&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>

<a name="70122-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="07012235000117"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in London shows that directly elected mayors are highly visible and benefit from a strong mandate to take tough, but essential, decisions on issues such as congestion charging. People understand who is making these decisions and where the buck stops&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07012235000044">That demonstrates where the problem comes from. We are looking at the issue in the light of a London-centric model. We have to recognise that there are examples up and down the country of where the old committee system, which I served under for nearly nine years in local government, served us perfectly well. Most of the regeneration of Newcastle and Gateshead was done under the old committee system. The revitalisation of Manchester was done under the local committee system. Let us not be fooled by some of the people who write these position papers and documents. Many of them have never served in local government, but they think that they have the answer to all our prayers in these models. I do not denigrate the hard-working councillors of all political persuasions, who, let us be honest, do their work for little monetary gain and who get a lot of hassle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07012235000045">I strongly support the case for a single unitary in County Durham. A bid will be put forward by the deadline of this Thursday. A single unitary will, overnight, clear up the confused mess that we have at the moment. We have a county council that spends86 per cent. of the budget, district councils that are too small and bicker among themselves and over the most small-minded things with the county council. It willdo away overnight with 275 councillors. I have60 councillors in my constituency alone. They vary in quality. We have some good county and district councillors, but all parties are struggling to get people of quality to come forward. Comment was made earlier about savings. The change will save &#163;21 million for the council tax payers of County Durham. More importantly&#151;this will be attractive to many council tax payers&#151;the bid says that the precept will be moved down to the lowest, which is Chester-le-street. Six out of the seven districts will see their council tax precepts reduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07012235000046">The other issue is about devolving power to the local level. That is a good aspect of the Bill and something that we should grasp. I hear people say, &#147;You can&#146;t have a unitary county, because you can&#146;t represent local people.&#148; That can be done. In County Durham, we have some examples of good town and parish councils.  <br>

That is why I have been fighting for the last two years against Derwentside district council to form the new Stanley town council, which will deliver at a local level. Okay, it is not high politics. It is about flower beds, litter picking, street lighting, Christmas lights and so on. But that is what a lot of people want. The Bill will give them that. The bid from County Durham stresses that devolution of power to local town and parish councils. I accept that that puts some pressure on the existing ones to go for quality status and make sure that they are professional, but it is welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07012235000047">I do not know whether the Minister has worked out that the timetable for the changes means that we will have elections in May this year and, in the middle of that, we will be saying to people, &#147;Your council will be abolished in the next year to 18 months.&#148; Will the Minister think about how we can improve that in some way? It will not help turnout at those local elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07012235000048">Finally, I turn to health. Ever since I was elected, I have made representations about accountability at the local level, and I feel strongly about the subject. What is proposed in the Bill is a complete dog&#146;s breakfast. We are unpicking something that we put in place quite recently, as it does not work. It does not work for one reason, which relates to my point about accountability: there must be the ability to affect actions. People must be able to change things. Neither what is proposed in the Bill nor the system currently in place can really change decision making in health at local level, and that is because of that terrible body, the NHS Appointments Commission, which appoints staff without any reference to local people. Even if those staff commit a host of mistakes, local people cannot remove them. If local councillors had made the mistakes that some local trusts in the north-east have made, they would be out on their ear at the next local elections. That is the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07012235000049">We have missed an opportunity to democratise local health provision, after the mess of foundation hospitals. I am glad that I voted against the idea when it came before the House, and I have been proved right: it did not work, and did not make health more accountable. The Bill is a missed opportunity to introduce if not direct elections to health boards, then at least some way for local people or bodies to remove the decision makers. If we do not ensure that, we will not really interest people in local health. There are opportunities for local people under the Bill, but I do not think that it will be the panacea that people might think it is, or that it will bring about the Government&#146;s ultimate aim of finding the perfect form of local government.</p>

I wish that some other people had done the same. I am sorry to say it, but the truth is that the Bill is thoroughly disappointing. It is devolution of the kind that Napoleon Bonaparte brought to Europe.

(b) subscribe to the code of Napoleon, (c) subscribe to the continental system of tariffs in trade, and (d) send a levy of troops to the Grande Arm&#233;e. Once you&#146;ve dealt with all that, you&#146;re entirely free to do what you like.&#148; The same situation applies to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para17"><a name="07012235000051">The provisions are totally constrained, and the leadership model is a good example of that. When I was a London borough councillor in Havering, we had strong political leadership, and we had a leader and a cabinet. It was the leader who chaired the policy and resources committee, and he and the committee chairman met, and gave the officers and the authority the direction that they needed. There is no need to tinker with that, because it worked. The other problem with the Bill is that it is all about tinkering and creating a plethora of new structures, but what we should be doing is reinforcing existing democratic structures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07012235000052">That brings me to the buzzword of empowerment. The first thing that we could do is empower democratically elected councillors as local champions. I had the pleasure of being the deputy chair of the commission on London governance; I think that the Minister for Local Government is acquainted with some of its work. My chairman was the former Labour leader in Croydon, and we had input from leading Liberal Democrat council members, and we came to an all-party view. We thought that much more could be done, not to diffuse accountability, but to reinforce and concentrate it around the elected councillor as the local community champion. I am sorry to say that the Bill misses an opportunity in that regard, but I suggest that we could change that by taking some simple thoughts on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07012235000053">We could strengthen the position of councillors by giving them a statutory right to be consulted by all public service providers in their ward. I was horrified to find that under the model for safer neighbourhood teams, the involvement of local councillors is almost discouraged, but they should be involved. Local councillors should be consulted about local health provision, on issues such as where a local surgery should be sited in their ward. We could strengthen their powers in that regard.</p>

Some progressive authorities already do so by providing &#163;20,000 or so to be spent in each ward. If we entrenched such a provision, it would empower councillors to make local decisions, consult their community and make a proper business case for what they do. It would refocus everything around people who have democratic legitimacy.</p>

We have made a start with overview and scrutiny committees, but why should we not go further and give ward councillors, too, involvement at borough level? That would strengthen things at the base and give them teeth. Should we not consider the possibility of allowing successful local authorities to take on PCTs&#146; commissioning role? Local authorities had a good record in public health in the past. We ought to return to that practice and build on it, instead of replicating a massive range of structures. Time is pressing, and I want to make sure that other hon. Members can make a contribution. I hope that I have indicated in a few brief headlines the missed opportunities in the Bill. That saddens me, as it saddens all of us who entered Parliament because we are passionate about local government, which is desperately important to the country&#146;s health.

In health, we are confronted with two parallel worlds&#151;the world of decision making and the world of consultation. The world of decision making is made up of quangos, trusts, appointees, NHS networkers and so on, who decide what services are available, commissioned and cut, as well as the way in which they are configured, structured, run and financed, and even where they are located. They respond to ministerial instructions, financial pressures, turnaround teams, European directives, advice from the royal colleges, pressures from professional and union bodies and, of course, market forces. That is called local decision making, in the same sense that colonial government was local decision making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para23"><a name="07012235000060">The parallel world of consultation produces bodies such as community health councils and patients forums, which will be replaced by LINKs&#151;local involvement networks. It produces, too, brochures, meetings, consultations and pseudo-consultations, surveys, much frustration and not a great deal of change in the eventual decision making. The public are given rights to be heard and consulted, as well as rights to a response, a hearing, a survey and a visit, but not a scrap of decision-making power is surrendered to them. Power remains with commissioners and providers and, ultimately, head office at Richmond house.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07012235000061">One cannot move from one world to the other without confusion, so one cannot avoid developing a deep cynicism. The Bill resolutely keeps those worlds apart. Poring over its small print, I could not find a single clause allowing the public to determine what the decision makers do. Ministers should be honest and tell us what they think&#151;that the public are not capable of shaping the health service. If they think that locally elected people are probably too dim or lack relevant  <br>

expertise, why do they not come out and say so? Why do they not admit that such people cannot make tough decisions or are likely to make bad ones if they are allowed such powers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07012235000062">The Government choose to ignore the fact that many health services were locally grown, planned, owned and, at one stage, locally financed in part. Things are run differently in other parts of Europe. Almost every hospital has a long history of public involvement and local commitment going back many years, and it would be great to revive that practice. I accept that we have overview and scrutiny committees, which I support&#151;indeed, they should be enhanced&#151;but apart from fine words, ultimately they have the power only to refer things to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07012235000063">So in my view the Bill, unamended, leaves the parallel worlds of the decision-makers and the consulted just as far apart as they were before, and still parallel. Patrician rule remains, and hollow consultation and quango rule are still in place. There will be patient and public involvement, but it will be an extraordinarily frustrating business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para27"><a name="07012235000065">I reiterate the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) about the timing of the Bill. As the Minister for Local Government said from a sedentary position earlier in the debate, the issue of local government reform has been on the agenda for over two and a half years. The Lyons review was commissioned by the Government to look at the restructuring of finances for local government. It is due to report in March. Why is the Bill not presented for our consideration after the Lyons review has reported? That is extraordinary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para28"><a name="07012235000066">Another timing issue that I should raise is why areas have been asked to volunteer to change their status by Thursday this week, after Second Reading but before the Bill has completed its passage through the House. We heard from the Secretary of State that she intends to make amendments to the Bill, which could be significant, to do with the powers of the Secretary of State to direct local councils. Councils are being invited to abandon their existing structure for a structure that is still unclear, in terms of both the powers that will be available to them and the financing regime within which they will be operating. That seems a peculiar way to go about making legislation that will affect local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70122-0017.htm_para29"><a name="07012235000067">I welcome aspects of the Bill. I welcome the reduction in targets, which we have heard about from many hon. Members in all parts of the House. I welcome the reduction of best value reports. My council&#151;I should have reminded the House that I am still a local district councillor and proud to be so&#151;has to produce best value report notes on some of the most minute aspects of the council&#146;s service, which seems quite unnecessary. I welcome some of the plans for increased powers for parish councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para0"><a name="07012235000068">But there are many aspects of the Bill that concern me. Other Members have covered those in great detail, so I shall highlight three in particular. One is the loss of  <br>

the committee structure, as directed in the Bill. I, like many others, have served on committees and found, when I arrived on the council, that that was a suitable way of learning the procedures and methods of council working. In the event of unitary structures being imposed, and with councils perhaps as strong as 80 to 100 councillors, in a cabinet system of government individual council members will be merely voting fodder and will not have access to discussion or decision-making as they do on committees at present, which has cross-party benefits and allows people to mature and perform various roles on the council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07012235000069">My second concern, which has not been covered much in the debate, is the impact of increasing city regions on rural areas. There are many rural areas which, even if they become unitary, will not be sufficiently adjacent to cities to be able to be included in city regions. It is important that we consider in Committee whether the similar powers that will be available to city regions will also be available to rural areas, perhaps working together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07012235000076">Let me consider the two principal matters that I wanted to discuss. The first is the greater centralisation of control that the Bill creates through granting the Secretary of State powers over many aspects of local government&#151;perhaps more than hon. Members appreciate. Clause 2 grants the Secretary of State explicit power to direct local authorities to make a proposal to reorganise. The Minister shakes his head. Earlier, the Secretary of State said that she had no intention of directing areas apart from those that initially volunteer to become unitary. However, the Bill gives her the power to do so and, if it is accepted, it will exist for her and any successors&#151;and there have been several Secretaries of State in recent years. Although the right hon. Lady may have good intentions, her successors may not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07012235000077">Clause 3 provides that the Secretary of State may specify a date by which areas that want to consider their structure must make proposals. Local authorities must have regard to any guidance that the Secretary of State chooses to make. Those powers give the Secretary of State immense control to determine what happens to local authorities, and which become unitary. It is her decision, not the local people&#146;s. It contrasts with her earlier comments. I hope that she will honour the  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07012235000078">Secondly, I want to consider consultation. Much has been said about the Government seeking to proceed with unitary status only in areas where there is a desire for that to happen, which is supported by a &#147;broad consensus&#148;.

I look to the Minister to confirm in his response to the debate that he will take note of the views of the voters in Shrewsbury and Atcham and in my constituency. On a 42 per cent. turnout&#151;higher than for local authority elections in my area&#151;57 per cent. of people in South Shropshire voted against unitary status. In Bridgenorth district council, on a 46.5 per cent. turnout, 86 per cent. voted against unitary status and in favour of enhanced two-tier local government. The people of Shropshire have spoken, and they want their councils to work together to achieve savings and greater efficiencies. They do not want a unitary authority imposed on them by this Government.</p>

identified a series of flaws in the Bill&#151;to which the Minister for Local Government, who has been warmly praised this evening, will respond in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07012235000086">Four trends have emerged from what colleagues have said. First, councillors should be doing real jobs. They should be properly engaged, not crowded out by targets set elsewhere or fooled by a structure that pretends to involve them but does not do so. Several colleagues mentioned the need for the committee structure to be covered by the Bill, at least as an option. The hon. Members for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby), for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley) and for Eltham (Clive Efford), my hon. Friends the Members for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) and for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill), and, notably, the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) made that case particularly strongly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para8"><a name="07012235000087">Secondly, the Government have dealt with the health aspects in only a small part of the Bill, and real concern has emerged over the limitations of LINKs. The hon. Members for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) and for Bedford (Patrick Hall) and, most notably, the powerful speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) made it clear how important it is to speak up for the independence of those who comment on health issues, and to speak out against their diminishing role in inspection. We defer to my hon. Friend&#146;s expertise and look forward to his participation in the further stages of the Bill. He certainly spoke for the whole Front Bench tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07012235000088">Thirdly, the House was concerned about truly letting the people decide. Hon. Members drew our attention to the absence of detail in the Bill about how decisions are to be taken&#151;decisions in relation to local government that affect the most important aspects of our constituents&#146; lives. We will forever be pleased that we were in the House on the night when my hon. Friends the Members for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) and for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) announced the results of the debate that should save their local district councils. That was democracy in action, and I challenge the Minister to stand at the Dispatch Box and say that he will not accept the results of those referendums. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), and the hon. Members for Wigan (Mr. Turner) and for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) also spoke of the importance of letting the people decide. Whatever the decision may be, we must bring the people into it. The Bill certainly does not do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07012235000089">Fourthly, more than one colleague picked up on the sense of prescription that lies at the heart of the Government. Whatever their honeyed words about consultation, at the end of the day they are all about telling us what to do. The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh), my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Anne Main) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) made that very clear. My right hon. Friend, above all, put his finger on what was going to happen in the next couple of years. He described the turning off of the public sector tap. If a chill has not already descended on Labour Members as they look at the money that has flowed into the education and health systems over recent years, they must surely feel one now. Let them just wait and see what is coming in the next couple of years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07012235000090">I want to deal with the positive aspects of the Bill&#151;although this part of my speech will, understandably, be brief. First, we support local decisions on the electoral and warding arrangements of a council, which should be for the local people to decide. I repeat, however, that we urge the Minister to take the opportunity to look again at the committee system, as so many people want him to do. The Local Government Information Unit backs up that request in its briefing to us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07012235000091">Secondly, we welcome the efforts to involve parish and town councils more. My old constituency of Bury&#151;dear Bury&#151;had no such councils, so I came rather new to the 54 parish and town councils in North-East Bedfordshire. They have been a huge blessing. They are a local tier of information and advice and, like the National Association of Local Councils, I strongly support a greater role for them. The parish and town councils in Bedfordshire are very perceptive and sharp. Among the responses that I received to the consultation that I produced, Renhold parish council said:</p>
<a name="70122-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="07012235000118"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Councillors say also that any measure that can reduce central government interference is to be welcomed.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07012235000092">We have heard it from Renhold parish council&#151;and if the Government would take note, we would all be pleased.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07012235000093">Thirdly, although we welcome a revision of targets from the centre, experience suggests that we should examine carefully the new local targets set. Too often, the impression is given that local targets are set with national criteria in mind. Why the Government want to be involved in the setting of local targets we just do not know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para15"><a name="07012235000094">That brings me to the heart of our concerns about the Bill: the power to direct local authorities to make applications for unitary status, and the absence of any democratic means of gauging public opinion and support for proposals put forward. On 26 October, the Government published a White Paper full of the meaningless modern jargon that those in authority now use to keep the people in their place&#151;the patronising face of modern administration. At paragraph 3.55, the Government say:</p>
<a name="70122-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="07012235000119"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are, therefore, now inviting local authorities in shire areas to make proposals for unitary local government &#147;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07012235000095">and at paragraph 3.57:</p>
<a name="70122-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="07012235000120"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;More information can be found in the Invitation accompanying this White Paper, including full details of the criteria&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07012235000096">However, by 13 December, a bare 47 days later, the Bill was published, and out of the blue the word &#147;direct&#148; appeared. Where had that come from? What responses to consultation had there been in those 47 days to make Ministers suddenly realise that taking that power was necessary? If minds were not changed in that time, why was there no mention of the power to direct in either the White Paper or the full details of the invitation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07012235000097">It is not as if the White Paper was rushed. The parliamentary brief mentions the debate on the future of local government as having begun in July 2004, with a White Paper expected the following year. It was late, but after hundreds of seminars and speeches, those in local government might have expected it to be pretty definitive, at least on such a major issue as  <br>

restructuring. Either the failure to mention the power to direct was incompetence of the kind that has become the hallmark of this Government, or it was deception on a grand scale, which is also now indelibly attached to them, from the Ministry of Defence toNo. 10. We have already forced an admission of possible amendment from the Secretary of State, and I look forward to hearing the Minister confirm that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07012235000098">Where is there any sense of democratic support for the proposals that will come forward? Where is the referendum?</p>

Gentleman made powerful interventions on the Secretary of State to make it clear that the people had spoken in his area, and that they deserve to be listened to. But where is that provided for in the Bill? He cannot see it, and nor can we.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para20"><a name="07012235000101">How is a &#147;broad measure of support&#148;&#151;the weasel words in the White Paper&#151;to be calculated? How is that to be weighed against what is on the face of the Bill, which is what the Minister believes is in the best interests? How cringe-making some of the words in the White Paper are. It talks of a &#147;permissive approach&#148;&#151;and there is the wonderful phrase from the Secretary of State:</p>
<a name="70122-0018.htm_brev3"><a name="07012235000121"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we must have the courage at the centre to let go.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para21"><a name="07012235000102">Can anyone recognise that about this Labour Government? It sounds like a melodramatic mum appealing to a child in a &#146;30s or &#146;40s northern drama, not letting her children out of her sight to go into a cruel world. This Government would not know what letting go was if they confronted it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para22"><a name="07012235000103">This Bill highlights a fundamental divide between the two main parties, which is about the willingness to let go. Labour is addicted to power and control. From health to education, and local government to the police, everything that has a public element must be within its grasp. Every public service that one can think of has been driven almost demented with target after target, their discretion fettered and their professionalism compromised. Devolution of power is at the heart of the issue. There is a sharp contrast between the Conservative party&#146;s approach to the issue&#151;as shown in our commitment to the Sustainable Communities Bill introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) and our opposition to this Bill and its unjustifiable powers to direct councils&#151;and the Government&#146;s hostile and reluctant attitude to the Sustainable Communities Bill and their determination to push through this Bill regardless of its constitutional outrage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para23"><a name="07012235000104">Letting go is not easy. It is against the conventional norms of government in this country over the past 30 years or so&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I said 30. It is completely against every fibre of the Treasury&#146;s being, yet the evidence is that as the central Government stranglehold on local government has increased, the participation of the public at the ballot box has decreased. Coupled with that is a sense of powerlessness at local level: it does not matter what we think or say, because the Government will decide.  <br>

People think that if their council follows the Government&#146;s agenda it will be praised and congratulated, and given the pretence of making its own decisions&#151;but if the council goes its own way, it will be marked down in assessments and its people will pay.</p>

Does the hon. Gentleman use it in every debate? History has moved on. It is not the poll tax that will be the deciding issue at the next general election, but this Government&#146;s deceit, the way in which they control and centralise power, how they have let people down on health, education and the police, and the way in which they will turn off the tap. That is what people will judge by at the next election. Enough is enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07012235000109">We have seen the danger. It is time to take some risks and restore trust and discretion. Our opposition to the Bill, our support for the Sustainable Communities Bill and our continual objection to nationally driven targets and agendas is hard tangible evidence of that, against which there are only sweet words, with hidden meanings, from the Government, and the tough experience of thousands of public servants who have heard this talk of devolution so many times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para25"><a name="07012235000110">This Government now suffer from two fundamental flaws, each of which is enough to kill them. One is a failure to understand a shift in the political bedrock and to work with it. The second is that few any longer believe almost anything they say or any statistics they produce in their own interests, such has been the devaluation of the relationship between the Government and the people in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para26"><a name="07012235000111">The Bill is a fig leaf to cover the Department&#146;s inadequacies. How will it help the local government funding crises, so often the result of the Treasury and the Chancellor loading responsibilities and taxes on the local taxpayer and evading the rap for doing so? How will it help the taxpayer who knows that he will have to bear the costs of any reorganisation and see any potential savings eaten up by the Chancellor, filling the gap with new taxes and ensuring that there is higher pay for executives as a result of reorganisation, as was highlighted by the newspapers this weekend? Will reorganisation build another house, provide another care bed or a new carer for the elderly? There is no doubt that taxpayers in all areas, male and female, will feel the burden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70122-0018.htm_para27"><a name="07012235000112">The Bill should have been about listening to the people and devising some serious adjustments to power that would have delivered what they really need.

We let go through non-ring-fenced grants and &#163;500 million from the neighbourhood renewal fund, opposed by the Conservatives.

Having been a Minister with responsibility for such matters for four years, he understands the importance of this change in the legislative regime. Our proposals are genuinely devolutionary. I advise the Conservative party to try to change its mindset, because its opposition to our proposals will leave it floundering in the wake of those local authority leaders who are already grasping the new powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70122-0019.htm_para6"><a name="0701233000012">Members of all parties had points to make about the leadership model. As elected representatives, all of us know that devolution can go only so far&#151;that, at whatever level, somebody has to take a decision. The Bill ensures that, ultimately, those who take such decisions are elected representatives. Concerns about community cohesion and unrepresentative groups are met by the fact that a central role will be played by the elected councillor, either as a front-line ward councillor, or as a leader or part of the leadership of a council.</p>

<p><a name="st_o358"><a name="0701233000014"><a name="70122-0019.htm_spnew5"><a name="0701233000534"><b>Mr. Woolas:</b> Not now, as I want to finish the point that I am making. I am normally generous in taking interventions, but I have only a few minutes left.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70122-0019.htm_para7"><a name="0701233000015">Let me say something about the boundary on the devolution of power. Given that through the local area agreement more money will be pooled by the Government and their local agencies than is contained currently in the revenue support grant, and also that more money will be distributed, the boundary on that devolution is the insistence, on behalf not only of the Government but of Parliament, which has the right to intervene in local decisions should it wish to do so, that areas have strong and accountable leaders for their local councils. That is why we have put forward what we see as strong leadership models.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70122-0019.htm_para8"><a name="0701233000016">Admittedly, the indirectly elected leader does not in practice change significantly what is already the case in most areas, but in the context of what we are talking about, one cannot expect any Government of any political persuasion to go down the route of radical devolution. Anybody who has studied the financial arrangements in the Bill cannot expect us to devolve power to leadership at local level that is not accountable. It has been said that we are prescribing mayors; we are not. Nor are we prescribing the modus operandi of councils in detail. However, we are insisting that if there is to be power at local level it must be accountable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70122-0019.htm_para9"><a name="0701233000017">I will now take a quick intervention.</p>

might he consider reducing the number of electors that are required to force a referendum on that issue?</p>

<p><a name="st_o360"><a name="0701233000019"><a name="70122-0019.htm_spnew7"><a name="0701233000536"><b>Mr. Woolas:</b> Points made on the numbers can be debated in Committee, should the House agree to the Bill&#146;s Second Reading. However, I have met mayors from across the country, and those who are in place&#151;whether Conservative, Labour, independent or Liberal Democrat&#151;are making a difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70122-0019.htm_para10"><a name="0701233000020">A number of Members asked why the Lyons report will come after the Bill. It seems to me that any consideration of the proper function and form of local government and the changes that are being made in order to build on the reforms that this Government introduced elsewhere in the public sector could sensibly be made only before we discuss the finance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70122-0019.htm_para11"><a name="0701233000021">I appreciate that it is the job of the hon. Members for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell) and for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) to oppose&#151;that is their constitutional duty&#151;but there is one thing that I would bet my council tax on. Incidentally, according to today&#146;s report by the Local Government Association, my bill is the second lowest since the council tax was introduced, but I see that the Opposition are giving no credit to the Government. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Presumably, we are now getting the Hammersmith and Fulham argument. The Opposition call for devolution, but why is it that, when councils of their own party put the council tax up, it is because of a centralised, heavy-handed Labour Government, yet when they lower them and cut services, they blame the cuts on a Government who allegedly do not give them funds? Lord Sandy Bruce-Lockhart of the Local Government Association speaks more common sense in one press release than the Opposition have done throughout today&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70122-0019.htm_para12"><a name="0701233000022">That is not to mention&#151;no, I will mention it&#151;the fake consensus that we had on Friday. When the Sustainable Communities Bill was given its Second Reading, with support in all parts of the House, the Government agreed with its intention and said that we would study its details in Committee. Do we see the same consensus regarding the plea of the Local Government Association and of Labour Members? Surprise, surprise, Mr. Speaker, we do not. It is no wonder that people think that the Opposition are cynical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70122-0019.htm_para13"><a name="0701233000023">Does it not make sense to discuss the possible reforms of local government finance after the House has had a chance to discuss the roles, functions and direction of travel that it wants for councils? Had we done it the other way round, I bet my council tax on the fact that the Opposition would have said tonight that we had got it the wrong way around. The proposal has always been that we would take forward the form and function before the finance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70122-0019.htm_para14"><a name="0701233000024">On the duty to direct, let me give the Opposition the reassurance that they and the Local Government Association are looking for, and which I have already given them. We have taken that power&#151;we will introduce amendments to clarify it, as I and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State have undertaken to do, to ensure that there are limited circumstances in time and geography where that can be done&#151;because  <br>

we have a duty to ensure that we do not do what the previous Government did, which was to introduce unitary proposals for some areas that had detrimental effects in others. We have to provide a solution that is fair to all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70122-0019.htm_para15"><a name="0701233000025">That, in all seriousness, is the point that the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham made. He had a referendum, and the Government must, and will, take the opinions into account, but we must also take into account the impact of proposals on other parts of the country. That is why the directive exists. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar says that he is not reassured. Given the cynical mood that the Opposition are in, I would imagine that they would not be reassured if I promised him a zero council tax and free meat pies. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I notice that it was the meat pies and not the low council tax that got him going, but there we are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70122-0019.htm_para16"><a name="0701233000026">The measures in the Bill represent the most radical empowerment of local authorities and their partners, and of local councillors as front-line councillors in their communities. There are powers to set byelaws; to decide the configuration of wards; to decide to move to all-out elections, if so required; to work with their partners in the expenditure of taxpayers&#146; money over the 35 outcomes that they will decide, in conjunction with the Government; and local targets that they will decide on behalf of their local people. It is a radical measure and I call on the House to support the Bill.</p>

I hope that, with the prior agreement of the Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) will also be able to address the House during this short debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0701237001002">What is the future of health care in the London borough of Sutton? What is the future of St. Helier hospital? Those are the questions that my constituents want answered tonight. St. Helier is a huge part of life in Sutton. It is a great white monolith that stands on Rosehill and dominates the south London sky line. It also dominates the lives of my constituents. Like all hospitals, it has formed the backdrop to some of the most significant events in the lives of the people whom it serves&#151;lives begun, lives ended and much else in between. I was born at St. Helier, as were all my children. I therefore make no apology for the personal stake that I hold in the future of my local hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para15"><a name="0701237001003">Does that hospital have a future? The events of the past six months lead to one conclusion: St. Helier&#146;s future is at risk. We reached that stage through a long and tortuous process of proposals, plans and policies, which amounted to nothing but empty promises. Only 14 months ago, St. Helier was to be the site of a new, high-tech critical care hospital&#151;a state-of-the-art facility at the centre of a network of local care hospitals: a hospital for the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para16"><a name="0701237001004">After years of planning and fruitless consultation, the Secretary of State for Health intervened on 19 December 2005 to direct the local NHS that St. Helier be the site for that hospital of the future. However, rather than actively seeking to implement that direction, local NHS managers attempted to thwart my constituents&#146; wishes and the Secretary of State&#146;s clear instruction. They have succeeded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para17"><a name="0701237001005">Last August, the Secretary of State backed down and withdrew her direction, leaving the NHS, its staff and my constituents in limbo. Why? The answer is money. The trust that runs St. Helier has had to find &#163;20 million in savings in two years. In September, the trust announced the first round of cuts. It called them &#147;quick wins&#148;&#151;money that could be saved without upsetting anyone: that is, anyone except patients who forgot to pack their pyjamas and found that the hospital no longer kept a stock, those who got fed up with the single limp sandwich that they were served for lunch but were told that hot food was no longer available, or those affected by the jobs that were frozen throughout the trust, causing huge pressure on the wards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para18"><a name="0701237001006">However, those cuts were as nothing compared with what came next. On 10 October, the trust announced plans to axe 200 hospital beds&#151;that is, one in four of those available at Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust. A week later, it announced plans to cut 470 jobs&#151;one job in 10 across the trust. Every single one was a front-line clinical job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para19"><a name="0701237001007">What impact will the cuts have on the quality of service, staff morale and patient care? Those are questions that my constituents want answered. Between the two announcements, my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington, the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) and I met the Secretary of State for Health. During that meeting, 10 months after her decision to direct that St. Helier be the site of a new critical care hospital, she told us&#151;or at least gave the impression&#151;that there was little chance of that ever becoming a reality. We were told that there was no money behind the lofty aims of the better health care project. Never has it been less gratifying to be proved right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para20"><a name="0701237001008">For years my hon. Friend and I have asked the same question: where is the money to pay for the hospital and the network of local care hospitals? That question has been evaded by those in charge of the local NHS. We have had warm words, nudges and winks. They said that everything would be fine, but they never gave a straight answer. Now, years down the line, we are told that there is no money. Where are the people responsible? They are nowhere to be seen. They have gone, moved on or resigned. The disappearing managers and faceless board members promised more and delivered less. Where is the accountability? That is a question that my constituents want answered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para21"><a name="0701237001009">We are told that there are too many hospital beds in London and that hospital closures are a real prospect in south-west London. In the end, what have we got? We have a hospital that is falling apart at the seams, where patients recovering from heart surgery shiver because there is no money to fix a broken radiator; a hospital with a threat hanging over it. It is ripe for downgrading&#151;even closure&#151;so that accountants can balance the books in London. How is that better health care, closer to home? It feels like less health care, further from home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para22"><a name="0701237001010">On 25 November, on a cold grey morning, in pounding rain, more than 2,000 people joined my hon. Friend and me on a march to protest against the cuts at St. Helier. Those people&#151;ordinary local residents, former patients and disgruntled hospital staff&#151;wanted to send a clear message to the Government, as, indeed, do many Labour Members. They wanted to say no to cuts driven by financial pressure rather than clinical need, no to additional pressures on staff already working extra shifts to offer decent care, and no to the gradual downgrading of services at our hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para23"><a name="0701237001011">Since then, the situation at St. Helier has deteriorated further. Staff morale has fallen through the floor. With fewer resources, increased pressures and the threat of compulsory redundancies looming, that is hardly a surprise. Morale has been further damaged by the sudden and unexplained resignations of both the chief executive and the chair of the Epsom and St. Helier trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para24"><a name="0701237001012">Morale is only part of the problem, however. The cuts are having an impact on patient care. St. Helier has the trust&#146;s full complement of surgical assessment beds. Those 26 beds are so oversubscribed that, on a single night in December last year, there were 23 breaches of the four-hour waiting time target. That means that 23 people in a single night were let down because the system could not cope.</p>

Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)&#151;and, indeed, the Minister&#151;for allowing me to make a contribution to tonight&#146;s crucial debate. Our constituents share the accident and emergency unit at St. Helier hospital. My hon. Friend&#146;s children were born at the hospital, and so were mine. We received fantastic care from the doctors and midwives there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para31"><a name="0701237001024">St. Helier hospital is at the centre of the community on the St. Helier estate. It is a landmark both on the skyline&#151;it dominates any south London panorama&#151;and in health and employment terms. It sits at the centre of one of London&#146;s largest and least affluent estates, which is represented by my hon. Friend and me, by the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) and by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling) on the Greater London authority. Its loss would be a body blow to residents of St. Helier and surrounding areas. When the Minister responds to the debate, he can allay our concerns and give a simple yes in answer to the question, &#147;Is St. Helier hospital safe?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para32"><a name="0701237001025">My hon. Friend has explained why he is worried about the future of St. Helier. I echo his concerns, and I shall add one other. In a letter dated 18 January, Steve Peacock, the programme director of the better health care closer-to-home project, states that the review will need to consider new health services and providers, and lists the independent sector treatment centre. My concern is the extent to which the ISTC may distort the local health economy, as it has a guaranteed income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para33"><a name="0701237001026">Let me seek one further assurance from the Minister about a subject that has not yet been mentioned in the debate: Orchard Hill. He will be aware that last week the Healthcare Commission published a report that was critical of the care provided by the Sutton and Merton primary care trust for adults with learning disabilities. The failing must be rectified by the PCT as a matter of urgency. Indeed. the PCT, which called in the Healthcare Commission, which I welcome, has started the work. The report recommends that external support and transitional funding is provided to the primary care trust so that services for people with learning disabilities can be brought into the 21st century. For the second time, I seek a simple yes from the Minister, in response to the following question. Will the external support and transitional funding recommended by the Healthcare Commission be provided?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="70122-0021.htm_para34"><a name="0701237001027">The answers that the Minister gives to those basic questions tonight will make or break health and care services locally. He will need to weigh his words carefully before he responds.</p>

Of course it is important that any changes are made for the right reasons, are clinically led and are in the interests of the local population. The status quo, however, is not always desirable. In some circumstances, change is not appropriate, and maintaining the existing infrastructure of services is the best way forward. However, the presentation of any reconfiguration or need to engage with the local population about changing health care requirements or social and economic circumstances as always being about cuts is disingenuous, and is not in the best interests of constituents and the local community.</p>

The better health care closer-to-home project dates back to 2003, with proposals for local care hospitals to be supported by one new critical care hospital sited at either Sutton or St. Helier. There was a comprehensive consultation exercise over a three-month period which finished in November 2004. In January 2005, the then three trust boards&#151;Epsom and St. Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, East Elmbridge and Mid Surrey primary care trust and Sutton and Merton PCT&#151;met separately but agreed to proceed with the proposed model of a network of local care hospitals supported by a single critical care hospital. At that time, their preferred view was that that should be on the Sutton hospital site. However, in March 2005, in line with the procedures created by the Government, Merton overview and scrutiny committee referred the decision to the Secretary of State. At the end of 2005, she responded to the referral, concluding  <br>

that the arguments at the time over the siting of the critical care hospital were finely balanced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="70122-0022.htm_para1"><a name="0701237001035">The Secretary of State decided that it was appropriate to give significant priority to the needs of communities suffering social and economic disadvantage and to ensure that major redevelopments should contribute to the case for the broader regeneration of disadvantaged areas. My right hon. Friend was right to take that view. She therefore asked the NHS locally to take forward plans for the new critical care hospital to be developed on land opposite St. Helier hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="70122-0022.htm_para3"><a name="0701237001041">The next thing that happened in this long process was that the London strategic health authority wrote to the Secretary of State to ask that she refer the matter back to it so that it could review the whole situation. On 16 August, the Secretary of State responded to NHS London, noting the developments and supporting the SHA&#146;s requests to carry out a review. Again&#151;this is consistent with her views&#151;she asked that the review should pay particular attention to the needs of disadvantaged communities in the context of the Government&#146;s determination to tackle inequalities in health. That review is being carried out and it is being led by Sutton and Merton PCT. It is scheduled for completion by the end of next month. I hope that hon.

of that process, to make any pronouncements or judgments from the Dispatch Box. The only point I would make is that a constant part of the brief that has been given to people and organisations that have been asked to consider the matter is the socio-economic conditions and the health inequalities that exist within the relevant health economies.</p>

It has sought to create a plan involving minimum disruption to staff and patients. While the trust cannot rule out staff redundancies entirely, there is a public commitment to keep them to an absolute minimum, and an assurance that in most circumstances staff will be redeployed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="70122-0022.htm_para5"><a name="0701237001043">The requirement for NHS organisations to bring their budgets into balance is one that we should all support.

Member for Sutton and Cheam about the dreadful report on learning disability services in the community, which we all received with shock. That applies particularly to Orchard Hill. In the aftermath of the scandal in Cornwall, we must take practical and decisive action not only to close Orchard Hill as soon as reasonably possible&#151;it provides outdated, inappropriate care for people with learning disabilities in a modern world&#151;but to learn the lessons from Cornwall and Orchard Hill in the development of future national policies and the way in which we treat adults with learning disabilities. We must respect their views and the rights of their families.</p>
