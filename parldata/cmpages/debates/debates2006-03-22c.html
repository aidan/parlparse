 My right hon.

 Will the Minister confirm that business investment and productivity are falling and that England and Wales have both fallen in the world competitiveness tables?

 The hon. Gentleman, who regularly asks that question at Wales questions, still does not accept that Wales is doing extremely well. Welsh private sector output grew for the 35th month in succession in February 2006, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland, and 4,800&nbsp;businesses started up across Wales in the third quarter of 2005, a rise of 7&nbsp;per cent. on the previous quarter. Wales is doing extremely well, and small businesses in Wales are doing extremely well.

 It is clear that the Government&#039;s approach to alcohol misuse and alcohol-related violence is working, and that police and local partners are getting their tactics right.

<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 268</b>

<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60322-01_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Williams: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for that answer. Does he agree that the press speculation following the passing of the Licensing Act 2003&nbsp;has proved incorrect? Indeed, the figures from North Wales police show a significant drop in alcohol-related crime. Is that the general pattern throughout Wales? Will my right hon. Friend join me in congratulating all the divisions of North Wales police on their hard work on the Home Office alcohol misuse initiative, which proves that such measures can pay dividends if we all work as equal partners to ensure that our communities benefit from them?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60322-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that a fantastic job has been done in north Wales by the North Wales police, and I join her in congratulating them. In fact, there has been an 11&nbsp;per cent. fall in all violent crime in England and Wales during the recent alcohol misuse enforcement campaign. All those lurid allegations from the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru&#151;who formed an unholy alliance on this issue&#151;have proved totally groundless, as the Licensing Act has had a beneficial effect in our local communities.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60322-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Elfyn Llwyd  (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</b> 
 (PC): One of the lurid allegations that we were making was that alcohol-related crime would increase late at night. I spoke to a representative of North Wales police this morning and learned that, since the Act came in, there has already been a 4&nbsp;per cent. increase in alcohol-related crime between midnight and 2&nbsp;am, and a 2&nbsp;per cent. increase between 2&nbsp;am and 4&nbsp;am. Things are not as rosy as the Secretary of State suggests, and what he has said does not add up with what North Wales police have told me. I wonder who is right. Will the Secretary of State also undertake to review the temporary event notices, under which licences can be granted for 10&nbsp;events a year, simply by giving 48&nbsp;hours notice to the police?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60322-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Obviously, I shall be happy to look at that question for the hon. Gentleman. However, I simply do not accept his selective use of statistics, either for north Wales or right across England and Wales, where the picture is very different from all the ritual expectations whipped up by his party, along with its alliance partners in the Assembly, the Conservatives.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60322-01_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan  (Chesham and Amersham)</b>

With Swansea and Usk prisons in the top 10&nbsp;most overcrowded prisons in England and Wales, how on earth can our Welsh prisons even start to deliver the treatments needed to reduce alcohol-related crime and dependency in Wales?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60322-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right to say that alcohol-related crime right across the United Kingdom, including Wales, has been very serious for a long time. It seems to be a particularly British phenomenon&#151;and a Welsh phenomenon as well, for that matter&#151;and we need to bear down on it. I would remind her, however, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have regular discussions with Assembly colleagues about matters affecting young people in Wales. The Welsh Assembly Government are investing in a variety of schemes, including the pilot scheme for half-price bus travel for 16&nbsp;to 18-year-olds and the Cymorth programme, which is aimed at improving young people&#039;s life chances.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60322-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the half-fare bus scheme for 16&nbsp;to 18-year-olds, which is rolled out in Wrexham and Denbighshire, will make it easier for young people to access leisure activities? Will he ensure that he puts forward his view that it should be rolled out throughout Wales?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60322-01_spnew9"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Yes, but before I respond directly to my hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">My hon. Friend is right that the proposal is to roll out the scheme throughout Wales. That is a Labour party manifesto pledge, and it will assist young people to get to leisure activities as well as to training and employment.

Currently, there are far too many gaps in provision for vulnerable young people.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60322-01_spnew11"><b> Nick Ainger: </b>

<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 270</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Gentleman is not aware that young people&#039;s partnerships have been set up under every local authority in Wales. Those are made up of various bodies, including the voluntary sector, which impact on young people&#039;s lives and can come together to plan and address the issues that he rightly raises. By 2007&#150;08, the Cymorth programme will have a &#163;57&nbsp;million budget to spend on those initiatives, and I am sure that it can address the issues that he highlights.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60322-01_spnew12"><b> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire)</b> 
 (LD): Does the Minister recognise that the provision of diversionary activities is made harder by the Welsh outdoor pursuits industry&#039;s increasing fear of litigation&#151;much of which, as we both know, is vexatious and unfounded, but is a huge disincentive to providing adventure-based activities nevertheless? In that context, will the Minister act as a conduit for the industry&#039;s concerns by being prepared to convey any recommendations from Welsh outdoor pursuits providers on ways to address the litigation culture, perhaps through the Government&#039;s welcome Compensation Bill?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60322-01_spnew13"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman referred to the Compensation Bill, currently being considered in the other place, which makes it clear that the social value of activities is a factor that a court can take into account when considering a claim for negligence. That would go some way to reassure those companies involved in outdoor activities. The Bill is only part of a programme that the Government are taking forward to tackle perceptions that can lead to a disproportionate fear of litigation and to risk-averse behaviour. As we all know, the hon. Gentleman is not risk averse&#151;to his own personal cost&#151;but I am sure that he will agree that the Government are addressing this issue. If he wants to direct any organisations to me with particular concerns, I will be more than happy to take up those issues.

 My hon. Friend is right to mention the number of additional NHS dental places in his constituency.

 I see that the hon. Gentleman has applied for Southend to be part of the western tip of Wales. The truth is that his figures are completely inaccurate. The Welsh Assembly Government announced that, according to their best estimate, the hospital deficit will be under &#163;22&nbsp;million, which is 0.5&nbsp;per cent. of the &#163;4.3&nbsp;billion health spend.

 The Welsh economy has been transformed in recent years, with more people in work than ever before and a very highly skilled work force ready to do more. My right hon.

<p><a name="st_o43"><a name="60322-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I completely agree with my hon. Friend. That is a bid to build a world-class defence training facility in the St. Athan area, which is an ideal location. He is also right that the number of economically inactive people in Wales, although it remains high, has fallen, despite there being 9,000&nbsp;extra students in the figures. That shows again that, under this Labour Government, the Welsh economy is doing better than ever before.

<p><a name="st_o70"><a name="60322-04_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is particularly absurd because the purpose of the amendment is to decouple the passport from the identity card.

It is therefore absurd to try to detach that from the introduction of an identity card, which can give so many benefits in terms of preventing identity fraud. It is particularly absurd that the argument now being put by the Conservative party against identity cards is cost, because the whole point of linking the passport to the identity card is that 70&nbsp;per cent. of the cost is in the passport.

 That particular case was indeed shocking and appalling. Anybody who has read even the most cursory details could not fail to be sickened by that horrific crime. However, in fairness to the probation service, it is important to state that those people were not on early release, nor were they subject to penalties that involved imprisonment at any stage; they were on probation for far lesser crimes. However, a broader issue is raised not only by this case but by many of the other recent cases, and that is how we monitor offenders through trial, conviction, and subsequently&#151;if they go to prison&#151;when they are released. That is the purpose of the reforms to the National Offender Management Service, which is being introduced by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary.

<p><a name="st_o73"><a name="60322-04_spnew9"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b>

 First, we have increased funding significantly over the years. Secondly, I do not believe that that is the problem.

The purpose of the changes to

 While early release may not have been an issue in this case, will he ensure that the review of the probation policy commissioned by the Home Secretary includes the early release schemes, which cause widespread concern and still let far too many prisoners out of prison far too early?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o76"><a name="60322-04_spmin10"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 My understanding is that the early release scheme had cross-party support when it was introduced. Release on parole has been going on for many years. I do not agree that the problem has to do with morale in the probation service or the level of funding. It is to do&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am about to explain. It is about the procedures that we apply to offenders. In my view we have to apply those procedures even when someone has finished their sentence. The problem at present is that someone may be convicted of a violent sexual offence, serve a term of imprisonment and be released from prison once they have served their sentence&#151;and it is at that point that we need new procedures and rules that mean the person is subject to monitoring and supervision and, if necessary, recall, even after they have finished their sentence.

<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="60322-04_spmin22"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is important, surely, to put that into the context of the overall numbers of nurses in the Thames Valley strategic health authority. There have been almost 3,000&nbsp;more nurses and almost 400&nbsp;more consultants. Now it is correct that the John Radcliffe hospital has severe financial difficulties. That is why we are looking, with the hospital, at how it can get over them&#151;but let the hon. Gentleman be in no doubt at all that in real terms the increase in the funding is almost 7&nbsp;per cent., and there has to be a finite amount of money available. What is happening with the new financial system in the national health service is that for the first time, a proper account is being kept and hospitals have to live within their means&#151;and it is important that they do so. In some cases that will mean hard decisions, but as one of the chief executives of one of the trusts was explaining the other day, those are necessary for the long-term health of the national health service.

<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="60322-04_spmin24"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Surely the reason why there is a deficit is not that there have not been huge increases in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;funding. Surely even the hon.

That has delivered falling waiting times, falling waiting lists and, indeed, more staff&#151;but it is important for his constituency hospital, like the others, to live within its means. There is massive investment going in. It is correct that as a result of the new financial system that is being introduced, hospitals and primary care trusts are having to ensure that they do indeed live within their means. That is important, because whichever Government are in power there will be finite resources. The hon. Gentleman asks what is responsible. Sometimes what is responsible is the fact that hospitals and trusts need to change the way services are delivered so that they deliver the right number of targets that the Government have set down, but do so in a way that prevents them from going into financial deficit. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State congratulated the trust in the hon.

With the world&#039;s pace of economic change accelerating, this is a Budget to strengthen Britain further for the global opportunities ahead: to lock in stability, but also to lead the world in new industries and technologies, which will increasingly shape our future; for British people, higher skilled jobs with higher wages, but also new choices for parents to balance work and family life; to invest in and reform public services, housing and infrastructure; and, building on the climate change levy, to meet the energy and environmental challenges.

<a name="stpa_22">For this Budget I received representations to increase investment in skills, transport, infrastructure and science. I also received representations that we should adopt a third fiscal rule, that over the economic cycle and regardless of the needs of the economy, infrastructure and services, public spending and investment must, as a matter of principle, always rise more slowly than growth. Having analysed this proposal against our published plans, I have found that it would require in the coming year public spending &#163;17&nbsp;billion lower than this year and &#163;16&nbsp;billion lower the year after, closing off the possibility of additional investment. I have rejected these representations.

<a name="stpa_23">We are consistent that facing the economic challenge ahead we still, as a country, need to invest more.

And gross investment will rise from &#163;48&nbsp;billion this year to &#163;63&nbsp;billion in 2010&#150;11. That sustained long-term investment in our education and infrastructure and in our future is possible because of the stability that we have achieved. So, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we can meet our fiscal rules, support the needs of business and make necessary long-term investments in, first, science, innovation and enterprise, secondly, infrastructure and transport, thirdly, security and the defence of our country and fourthly skills and education.

However, using the same resources to raise the child tax credit will give that same family a family tax cut worth &#163;140&nbsp;a year more, over six times as much: &#163;2.70&nbsp;a week. So the best way to do most to help low and middle-income families with children, the best family tax cut, is to do as I will do today: to raise the child element of the child tax credit. Over the next three years, I will improve it by 14&nbsp;per cent. For a family with two children, the child tax credit will be worth up to &#163;88&nbsp;a week in 2009, or &#163;4,500&nbsp;a year, a far bigger family tax cut than we could give if we used the same money to improve personal tax allowances or to cut the tax rate.

We are today announcing initial funding of &#163;34&nbsp;million for a new national sports foundation. It will start next week, modelled on the Football Foundation&#039;s success, and will bring together public and private finance for new local sports facilities and grass-roots participation. I am also setting aside &#163;2&nbsp;million for a new venture between police, premier league football clubs and community groups, with the Football Foundation, to offer young people evening sports and to tackle antisocial behaviour.

It will be backed by youth community service on environmental projects, to be financed by an expansion of the landfill tax credit scheme.

<br>&nbsp;<br>areas. After asset sales reported at &#163;6&nbsp;billion last year, we plan total sales by 2010&nbsp;of &#163;30&nbsp;billion, releasing finance for our front-line priorities. In addition, I can confirm that the sale of Westinghouse will be completed in the next year, and we expect it to raise &#163;3&nbsp;billion.

<a name="stpa_81">The Government will move ahead in the coming year with the sale of the Tote. To diversify risk further and after the energy review has reported, we are prepared to sell part of our stake in British Energy and related energy assets.

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para83">
<a name="stpa_83">The Home Secretary has agreed that we can invest more in priorities like policing and security, while making savings in other areas within a three-year budget at its 2007&#150;08&nbsp;real-terms level. Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs, the Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Cabinet Office have also agreed that necessary modernisation will be funded from an innovation fund, and alongside this the spending review for those four Departments will proceed on the basis of minus 5&nbsp;per cent. a year in real terms below the baseline of 2007&#150;08&#151;efficiency savings that will allow us to focus new and additional resources on front-line priorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para84">
<a name="stpa_84">To meet and master the global challenge, the most important investment in our economy and our future and the most pivotal reforms we can make will be in the education of our children and young people. I, like so many people, am grateful for the inspirational teachers and the high quality of education from which I benefited. And just as I had the best chances, my aim is that all young people from whatever background have the best of chances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para85">
<a name="stpa_85">There are two priorities where, in this Budget, Britain can speed up our progress and advance even more quickly towards our ambition of world-class standards and excellence. With China and India turning out 4&nbsp;million graduates a year, we can no longer afford to write off the talent or waste the potential of any British young person. So the Secretary of State for Education and Skills is announcing today that those who have missed out on their first chance in education will have a second chance to make the best of themselves. We are setting aside resources so that, for the first time, up to the age of 25, further education all the way up the scale to A-level standards will be free of charge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para86">
<a name="stpa_86">That new right to free learning will be backed by adult learning grants to help with costs of living. And with financial help also for school leavers who have fallen through the net&#151;and whom we want to help make the transition into training and work&#151;our aim is a Britain where all young people stay on in part-time or full-time education, and gain skills throughout their working lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para87">
<a name="stpa_87">But 80&nbsp;per cent. of the 2015&nbsp;work force is already in work, and to make a reality of second chances in education for all ages, we must also strengthen our further education colleges&#151;centres of learning that have been neglected in the past, but must be at the forefront of future success. So we are announcing for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 301</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>each college a step change in employer involvement, so that we can match the demand for skills to the courses on offer. The Secretary of State is also announcing new powers to redirect resources from failing courses to the best courses, the ones that individuals, employees and employers want to use.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para88">
<a name="stpa_88">We will match these further education reforms that promote individual choice, increase local accountability and business engagement and reverse failure with &#163;500&nbsp;million of capital investment and an annual budget worth &#163;7&nbsp;billion by 2008. As with other allocations, separate announcements will be made for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para89">
<a name="stpa_89">But while we have a duty to ensure that there are second chances, we also have to ensure for every child the best first chance. Even with a doubling of investment, Britain&#039;s share of national income spent on education is still behind America and other major competitors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para90">
<a name="stpa_90">We know the educational benefits of more individual attention, small group teaching and tuition, and we know that they are easier to get when the overall teacher-pupil ratio is low. In private schools there is one teacher for every nine pupils, compared with one teacher for every 16&nbsp;in state secondary schools. To secure better results, we have improved the pupil-teacher ratio and doubled the money spent per year for the typical pupil from &#163;2,500&nbsp;to &#163;5,000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para91">
<a name="stpa_91">But that figure of &#163;5,000&nbsp;per pupil still stands in marked contrast to average spending per pupil in the private sector of &#163;8,000&nbsp;per year. Our long-term aim should be to ensure for 100&nbsp;per cent. of our children the educational support now available to just 10&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para92">
<a name="stpa_92">So to improve pupil-teacher ratios and the quality of our education, we should set as an objective for our country that stage by stage, adjusting for inflation, we raise average investment per pupil to today&#039;s private school level. And I can start immediately in the coming spending round by closing today&#039;s gap between capital investment for pupils in private schools and in state schools, so that all schools and all pupils have world-class IT and world-class equipment, teaching materials and buildings. So in the coming five years, investment in schools will rise from &#163;5.6&nbsp;billion a year to reach &#163;8&nbsp;billion a year&#151;a 50&nbsp;per cent. rise, making a total of &#163;34&nbsp;billion of new investment over five years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para93">
<a name="stpa_93">By 2011, annual investment in the typical child&#039;s education will be over &#163;1,000&nbsp;per pupil, matching in state schools&#151;in IT, equipment and buildings&#151;what private schools spend today, and demonstrating, fully within the discipline of our fiscal rules, that by investing more in education and investing not a lower share of our national income but a higher share, we can make a practical reality of our goal that every child should have the best possible start in life. It is a goal we could not achieve if bound by a fiscal rule that cut investment, but a goal we can achieve if we build a national consensus around a rising share of investment in education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para94">
<a name="stpa_94">I have further announcements to make. This Budget&#039;s choice is to invest more, not less, in schools and families; to strengthen the new deal, not abolish it; to maintain the climate change levy, not remove it; and instead of cutting investment, to hold firm and not waver on the principles that have given Britain stability and jobs, and now allow us to do even more for our priorities.

<a name="stpa_95">To tackle crime and the fear of crime, there are already a record 140,000&nbsp;police officers and 6,000&nbsp;community support officers. In 1,000&nbsp;neighbourhoods, there are full community policing teams. But the Home Secretary and I want every community to have a community policing team as soon as possible. So, at an additional cost of &#163;100&nbsp;million, we will ensure by April next year that we more than double the number of community support officers from 6,000&nbsp;to 16,000, and ensure that there will be neighbourhood policing in every community in England and Wales.

<a name="stpa_96">From 1&nbsp;April there will be free local bus travel for every pensioner and for disabled people, but we believe that there should also be free national bus travel. So the Transport Secretary is announcing today, from April 2008, at a cost of &#163;250&nbsp;million, for every pensioner and for disabled people free off-peak national bus travel in every area of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para97">
<a name="stpa_97">I have one further announcement. In 1997, there was no payment at all direct to primary and secondary head teachers. With &#163;270&nbsp;million extra from April, rising to &#163;440&nbsp;million next year, I can today put much more money than before direct to our schools for tuition, teachers and teaching support. There are those who say&#151;as with the &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion that I have already found for law and order, policing, security, environment and the Olympics&#151;that this &#163;440&nbsp;million for education should be used to cut taxes. I could, of course, afford to do so, but I say: investing in education comes first, and investing in education is this Budget&#039;s choice. So for the typical primary school, up from this year&#039;s &#163;31,000, &#163;44,000&nbsp;will go direct to the head teacher. For the typical secondary school, up from this year&#039;s &#163;98,000, from next week &#163;150,000, and next year &#163;190,000&#151;twice what it is now. For the largest secondary schools with the greatest needs, from &#163;260,000&nbsp;to &#163;365,000&nbsp;next week, rising to &#163;500,000&nbsp;next April. Next year, &#163;440&nbsp;million more will go direct to schools, helping pay since 1997&nbsp;for 30,000&nbsp;more teachers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-05_para98">
<a name="stpa_98">Excellence in education, my priority; more investment and reform, not less; a strong and strengthening economy; this is a Budget for Britain&#039;s future and I commend it to the House.

 Well, we wondered today whether we would get a Budget or a leadership bid, and I have to say that we did not get much of either. One can tell how big the crisis in the health service is&#151;the health service did not even get a mention. If we cut through all the rhetoric, what we have is a Chancellor who has taxed too much, borrowed too much and is the roadblock to reform. He is a politician completely stuck in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_99">Of course, there are some things in the Budget that we welcome&#151;not least because we proposed them. I particularly welcome what the Chancellor had to say about independent statistics and youth volunteering. We will look carefully at the detail, but I like what is happening: I come up with the ideas and he puts them in his Budget. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Bye-bye.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_100">The Chancellor made a lot of the changes to the climate change levy, but he still has not addressed the real problem: it is a tax on energy, not a charge on carbon, which is why carbon emissions keep going up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_101">The Chancellor has just announced a new environment institute, but this is the same Chancellor who is closing the very laboratories that do the research into climate change. This was not a genuinely green Budget, and that is not surprising, because this Chancellor has not made a single major speech on the environment in 11&nbsp;years. In a carbon-conscious world, we have got a fossil-fuel Chancellor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_102">I congratulate the Chancellor on what he had to say about the Olympics. I do not want to overdo it, however, as he has just spent an hour congratulating himself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_103">The Chancellor told us that his borrowing forecasts were correct. Yes, he correctly forecast that the public finances are in a mess. He is borrowing &#163;37&nbsp;billion this year. He told us that his economic growth forecasts were correct. Yes, he correctly forecast that Britain would grow more slowly than the United States, Canada, the G7, Spain, Ireland, the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and Australia. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that the Chancellor and the Prime Minister get to talk to each other only once a year, on Budget day, but they ought to listen to this bit.

<a name="60322-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_104">We will study the rest of the Budget carefully because, after 10&nbsp;Budgets, we know that this Chancellor&#039;s Budget speeches bear very little relation to the Budget itself. He told us about the savings culture, but why did he not tell us that according to page 238&nbsp;of the Red Book&#151;or, in the Prime Minister&#039;s case, the unread book&#151;the savings ratio is only 5.75&nbsp;per cent.? That is half what it was when he took office. Why did he not tell us that business investment, at 9&nbsp;per cent., is at a record low? And he did not tell us that today he has revised the figure downward compared with three months ago. <i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_105">Mr. Deputy Speaker, there are two central facts that tell us the real story of this Budget. <i>[Interruption.]</i> First&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60322-06_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 Order. I am sorry to interrupt the right hon. Gentleman. The Chancellor was listened to with very&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Order. The hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson) will be removed if he behaves like that. One expects a certain reaction to these things, but the Chancellor was heard in relative silence and the same courtesy should be offered to the Leader of the Opposition and to the leader of the Liberal Democrats afterward.
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60322-06_spnew1"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 There are two central facts that tell the story of this Budget. First, the tax burden is at its highest ever level in the history of this country: higher than when Denis Healey made the pips squeak; higher than when Ramsey MacDonald sat where the Prime Minister is sitting now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_106">People who listened to the Budget will have noticed the second fact: even with the highest tax burden in Britain&#039;s history, the Government are borrowing &#163;175&nbsp;billion over the next six years. I know that the Chancellor is a man in a hurry, but that is no excuse for belting out figures like a supercharged bookmaker. Let me go through the figures in turn. He is going to borrow &#163;37&nbsp;billion this year, then &#163;36&nbsp;billion, then &#163;30&nbsp;billion, then &#163;25&nbsp;billion, then &#163;24&nbsp;billion, then &#163;23&nbsp;billion. That is &#163;175&nbsp;billion over six years. This Chancellor is mortgaging this country&#039;s future. That is more than &#163;6,000&nbsp;of debt for every household in this country. Those are the facts. After all the years of spin about enterprise and prudence, we have finally got to the truth. He is an old-fashioned, tax-and-spend Chancellor, and that approach is completely out of date. The story of this week is of a Prime Minister and a Chancellor up to their necks in debt, making promises that they cannot keep and not knowing whether to work together or fight with each other as the ship starts going down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_107">The real challenge facing this country is competing in the new global economy. The Chancellor has given us the biggest tax burden in Britain&#039;s history, and cannot be the right person to meet that challenge. We used to have the 10th lowest business taxes in the developed world, but we now have the 10th highest. The Chancellor has had 10&nbsp;Budgets to boost science, but science departments in our universities are closing. He has had 10&nbsp;Budgets to improve transport, and some of our motorways look like car parks. He cannot be the change that this country needs, because he is the architect of the policies that have put us where we are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_108">This country also faces a huge challenge to reform public services. The Chancellor, who has squandered billions of pounds on unreformed public services, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 305</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>cannot be the right person to meet that challenge. He has doubled spending on the health service but this weekend one hospital sacked almost 1,000&nbsp;staff. Deficits across the NHS have now reached &#163;1&nbsp;billion. The Chancellor has doubled spending on education, but more than half of our children leave school without attaining the required standard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_109">Billions of pounds have been raised and spent, but we have no idea where the money has gone. With a record like that, the Chancellor should be running for treasurer of the Labour party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_110">In his Budget, the Chancellor mentioned pensions. After everything that he has done, millions of people in this country will think that he has got a nerve. This is the Chancellor who took &#163;5&nbsp;billion out of the nation&#039;s pension funds, and whose means testing destroyed savings. No mention was made of whether his pre-election bribe of &#163;200&nbsp;would be continued: I expect that we will have to find that in the Red Book.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_111">This is the Chancellor who caused the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)&#151;the Government&#039;s first pensions Minister, and the only one who was any good&#151;to say:

<a name="stpa_112">The Chancellor who smashed up the pension system cannot be the right person to rebuild it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para14">
<a name="stpa_113">Labour MPs may think that the Chancellor is their salvation from the mess that they find themselves in this week, but the big policy failures of this Government&#151;as opposed to the sleaze and the spin&#151;are his failures. The failure to spend money wisely, to reform public services, to protect people&#039;s pensions, and to prepare for Britain&#039;s future&#151;those failures are made in Nos. 10&nbsp;and 11&nbsp;Downing street.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-06_para15">
<a name="stpa_114">The Chancellor may see himself as the rock on which Labour can rebuild its church. Instead, he is the roadblock stopping Britain from meeting the challenges of the future. He is an analogue politician in a digital age. He is the past. <i>[Interruption.]</i>

 It is a fearsome task to follow such a constructive contribution as the one we have just heard, but I must begin by congratulating the Chancellor on the presentation of his 10th Budget. That he did so with great enthusiasm is hardly surprising, as he has a particular affinity for the number 10.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_115">Let us look at the Chancellor&#039;s legacy. Levels of inequality are worse than under Mrs. Thatcher. Our pensions system is in crisis, and consumer debt is at &#163;1&nbsp;trillion. In spite of what the right hon. Gentleman has said today, there is complacency about the threat to the environment, and he presides over a Treasury that cannot manage even its own tax credit system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_116">Of course we welcome the changes in child tax credit and acknowledge the stability in inflation and employment, but we are entitled to remind the Chancellor that that stability is based on the independence of the Bank of England. The right hon. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 306</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Gentleman derided that policy throughout the 1997&nbsp;general election campaign, but he implemented it within 48&nbsp;hours of entering the Treasury. Against that background, there is no room for complacency or time to tread water.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_117">I return to the issue of inequality, to which our mutual friend John Smith would have attached the highest priority. The wealthiest 1&nbsp;per cent. in this country owns 23&nbsp;per cent. of the assets&#151;more than in 1997&#151;while the poorest 50&nbsp;per cent. own only 6&nbsp;per cent.&#151;less than in 1997. The top 20&nbsp;per cent. of earners pay less of their income in tax than the bottom 20&nbsp;per cent., while the tax system remains unfair and complicated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_118">Why does the Treasury tinker with a tax system that is so fundamentally unfair and requires such radical reform? Every time that it does so, it adds layer upon layer of complexity and creates an incitement to, and opportunity for, fraud.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_119">The most unfair and regressive tax of all remains the council tax. Having read the Red Book, we can confirm that it contains no provision for the &#163;200&nbsp;rebate made available last year. If there is to be no council tax rebate, we know that some of the most vulnerable will suffer. They will ask why they deserved help immediately before a general election, but not a year later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_120">The lack of reform to the council tax is not the Chancellor&#039;s only failure to act. Under this Government, green taxes have fallen as a share of overall taxation. The measures announced today will make little impact on that. If the Chancellor needs any external reference, he need only examine yesterday&#039;s report from the Environmental Audit Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_121">We need simplicity in environmental taxation, and a proper system of green economic incentives that encourages people to change their habits and the way that they live. Such a system should express and implement the principle that the polluter should pay. It was notable that, in the course of his observations about the environment, the Chancellor made no reference to the impact made by aviation, nor to the crying need to address the problems of continued expansion in the aviation industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_122">The fact is that CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions are higher now than in 1997. The additional vehicle excise duty to be paid by drivers of 4x4&nbsp;vehicles applies only to new vehicles. By my reckoning, it is rather less than the cost of half filling the petrol tank. That is hardly likely to operate as a disincentive for people sufficiently well off economically to be able to afford such vehicles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_123">As for public spending, the Chancellor prepared the ground well in his pre-Budget report. He conceded the error in his growth predictions, changed the economic cycle, pointed out that he was going to raise taxes and acknowledged the slowdown in public spending. He got a lot of cheers today when his speech seemed to foreshadow increases in public expenditure. What many of those who cheered did not realise is that the spending plans pencilled into the pre-Budget report will mean that there will be announcements of real-terms cuts in many Government Departments next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_124">Despite all the extra investment, public spending is still not reaching the front line. Treasury targets have led to NHS trusts, and to the drive to reduce waiting lists at all costs that has meant that care in other areas has been cut.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 307</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para10">
<a name="stpa_125">Of course, tough choices have to be made and spending prioritised. For example, the industrial subsidies that the DTI has been giving to the nuclear power industry could be cut, and the money going to what is colloquially described as the baby bond scheme&#151;on which the Chancellor enlarged today&#151;would be much better spent on early-years education now than on a bond in the future. In addition, the right hon. Gentleman could decide not to proceed with spending millions and perhaps billions of pounds on an identity card scheme that is unnecessary and unworkable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para11">
<a name="stpa_126">The British people want better public services and are willing to pay for them. What they do not understand is how so much can have been spent with so little to show for it. Operations have been cancelled, wards closed, local hospitals threatened and nurses have even been made redundant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para12">
<a name="stpa_127">It is clear that trust in fiscal policy must be restored. That could have been achieved by widening the remit of the National Audit Office so that it can provide transparent and independent scrutiny of all Budget assumptions and forecasts. Some progress has been made today in respect of statistics, but that is not enough. The Chancellor has a good record of listening to our advice, rejecting it, and then accepting it. Perhaps, on this occasion, we will once again prevail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para13">
<a name="stpa_128">I welcome what the Chancellor said about housing and the shared equity fund. The question is whether any of that represents new money. We have to address the issue of those who simply cannot afford to make the contribution that is necessary to participate in a shared equity purchase of a house.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para14">
<a name="stpa_129">I declare a retrospective interest in the Chancellor&#039;s provisions for the Olympic games. It is essential that those games are a success for London and the whole of the United Kingdom. He will have universal support for what he announced in that regard. However, it is not true to say, as has been rumoured, that my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) is already positioning herself to make a bid for the British team.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para15">
<a name="stpa_130">One issue that the Chancellor said nothing at all about was that of personal debt. Consumer debt is now approaching &#163;1.2&nbsp;trillion&#151;practically identical to the gross domestic product of the United Kingdom as a whole. Of course, consumer debt has underpinned the economic boom, but the legacy for many families will be disaster. Nearly a fifth of all income is being used to service debt. That means that it is back to the level that it was at when the economy crashed under the Conservatives in the early 1990s. The immediate signs of that stress are clear: rising bankruptcies and rising repossessions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-07_para16">
<a name="stpa_131">The other side of that is the poor recent record of private business investment. Under its current leadership, the CBI has been a great deal more supportive of the Government than in previous years, but I suspect that it will react to this Budget more in sadness than in anger&#151;sadness at the way in which regulation and tax complexity are squeezing British business. The Budget does nothing to deal with that. Enlightened British companies understand the need to pay taxes for investment in education and infrastructure; what they do not understand is why those taxes do not deliver the goods.

<a name="stpa_132">The Budget failed to deal with the most glaring issue before us today: the crisis in pensions. Last week we learned&#151;the Leader of the Opposition already referred to this&#151;that the Government would not follow the ombudsman&#039;s recommendations and compensate those who were foolish enough to believe in Government information.

<a name="stpa_134">We know that there is a broad consensus of agreement around the recent report by Adair Turner and that there is an existing blueprint for pensions reform that is available and capable of implementation.

 I am aware that in 1997&nbsp;the Labour Government inherited an unemployment rate of 3&nbsp;million. Since 1997, we have produced 2&nbsp;million jobs, and that is the best antidote to poverty. I speak as an ex-school teacher, as I mentioned earlier, and one of the sad features of life when I was teaching in the 1970s and 1980s was meeting young people five or 10&nbsp;years after they had left school who had yet to get a job. If people do not have a job, they are not fulfilled and they do not contribute to society&#151;it is a spiral of decline. It is important to provide jobs, and I commend the Government on those extra 2&nbsp;million jobs.

<a name="stpa_142">This was the first Government with the stated aim of reducing child poverty.

 Would not comments from the Opposition about child poverty have greater credibility if they would make the pledge to eradicate child poverty in a generation and match our commitment to help the poorest families out of poverty?

<a name="stpa_146">The Turner commission report raised two or three other important issues, including industry regulation. We know that the industry&#039;s commission-based model has produced inherent conflicts of interest that successive Governments have used regulation to manage. The mis-selling scandals led to tighter regulation, which, while protecting some consumers, has increased distribution costs and made it uneconomic for the long-term savings industry to service consumers on below-average incomes. Embracing the needs of lower-income consumers is one of the issues with which Turner, the Government and others will have to grapple. As Turner pointed out,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;it is very difficult for the financial services industry to sell pensions to people of average earnings and below, working for small and medium size companies, or even to sell pension schemes

</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_147">That highlights the need for two solutions: first, the Government need to make the pension system simpler, to reduce the cost of regulated advice; and secondly, the industry needs to develop and encourage the take-up of simple, low-cost stakeholder products for that larger market.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_148">The Financial Services Authority has a role in that regard. It did not go as far as it could on simpler regulation for stakeholder products&#151;we have to get regulation right before we start considering the management costs, which must be low. Turner recommended 0.3&nbsp;per cent. and at the weekend Aviva became the first insurance company to propose a figure, which was 0.6&nbsp;per cent. However, we should be striving to reach Turner&#039;s figure.

<a name="stpa_149">The fiscal policy framework has stood the test of time.

The Committee will reconsider that issue over the next few months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_150">Some of the challenges to the framework will come in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the form of the spending pressures to which the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will have to respond in the 2007&nbsp;comprehensive spending review. Their capacity to do so successfully will be enhanced if their preparations are transparent and Members and Select Committees can both examine and contribute to the process, so I welcome the announcement about independence for the Office for National Statistics.

<a name="stpa_158">The Treasury Committee has been seized by what globalisation will mean for the UK. We have undertaken an inquiry into globalisation, to which both the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor have agreed to give evidence. Part of our inquiry will look at the role of the IMF. The Chancellor and the Governor&#151;in a speech a month or so back&#151;have both focused on the IMF, about which there are a number of fundamental questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-09_para13">
<a name="stpa_159">What is the fund for? Do we need an IMF? Is there a role for a multilateral monetary system and, if so, what is it? In 1946, the international monetary system was built around fixed exchange rates and controls on capital investment, and each country met its international responsibilities by running a balanced current account. That is a world away from the situation faced by financial services in the 21st century. The IMF is increasingly seen as the lender of last resort, and until the repayment of loans by Argentina and Brazil, 70&nbsp;per cent. of its outstanding loans were to only three countries. The IMF lending book is the lowest that it has ever been, and we can be sure that the Asian economies, including Japan, having built up their foreign exchange reserves, will not be coming back to the IMF. They were scarred by the experience of the 1990s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-09_para14">
<a name="stpa_160">The IMF has a number of tasks, especially at a time of such massive global imbalances. It should be a forum for transparent discussion of the way forward with national Governments about risks to the world economy. Recently, the Treasury Committee visited the United States where we had the opportunity to talk to a wide number of people. One issue relating to economic risk is trade protectionism, and the possibility of its being translated into policy change in the US should not be dismissed. It is a risk and a Bill proposing further protectionism is currently before Congress. However, it is important that we emphasise to our US colleagues that protectionism will not get us anywhere.

<a name="60322-09_para15">

It makes for a much better debate if we have an honest and full account of what is going on in the economy. For our part, we can accept that not everything is bad, but we would like the Chancellor to agree that not everything is good.

<p>
<a name="60322-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_168">It is extremely good that we are debating the economy yet again against the background of continuous months, quarters and years of output growth, since we righted the economy after the bad mistake of the exchange rate mechanism&#151;a policy recommended by Labour to the then Conservative Government, but a policy that Labour seems to have forgotten that it was part father and mother to. Since we came out of that most unfortunate experiment and since the Conservative Government put in place the foundations of fiscal discipline and greater productivity growth, the economy has grown extremely well. The continuous growth under Governments of both parties is extremely welcome.

<a name="stpa_169">If we look at the Chancellor&#039;s views on growth, we must accept&#151;I trust that Labour Members will accept&#151;that we are reviewing a disappointing year. In 2005, the Chancellor tells us that output growth was down to only 1.75&nbsp;per cent., compared with, as he helpfully tells us, real GDP growth that averages 2.5&nbsp;per cent. in the major seven countries and 4.5&nbsp;per cent. in the world overall. So that shows Britain growing not only at under half the world average rate, but at considerably below the growth rate of large, advanced countries.

There is no need for the Leader of the Opposition to give a very long speech if he has gone to the trouble of preparing an excellent short speech that makes all the crucial points. One of the crucial points on which my right hon. Friend immediately homed in, although he did not have very long to read the documents, was the way in which the Chancellor intends to borrow so much money over the review period set out in the Budget forecast that we have just received.
</p>

<a name="stpa_173">My right hon. Friend said that the Chancellor plans to borrow &#163;175&nbsp;billion, on the published figures, through the public sector accounts over that period. Like my right hon. Friend, I think that that is very dangerous. If we are going to live through a period of reasonable growth, surely that is exactly the point in the cycle where we should cut public borrowing rather more sharply than the Chancellor forecasts, preferably by the growth in revenues from faster economic growth, but also from pursuing the initiatives that the Chancellor always promises that he is taking to gain greater efficiency in the public services and public sector and to cut the public overheads.

If only that were the end of it, I suppose that it would meet the wishes of the Labour party, but of course that is not the end of it because we know that there will be an awful lot of off-balance-sheet borrowing, too. There is no reference in the stock of debt figures to the &#163;20-odd billion of borrowings and guaranteed moneys that have already been pushed the way of the effectively renationalised railway company. Strange accounting procedures are followed for all the private finance initiative and public-private partnership projects in which the Government have indulged on a grand scale.

The Chancellor is thus asking every one of us to sign up to an additional &#163;3,000&nbsp;mortgage. On top of that, there will be additional mortgages for PFI, PPP and off-balance-sheet items, including the railways, which will probably be another

<br>&nbsp;<br>&#163;1,000&nbsp;or &#163;2,000. There will thus be a substantial increase in the national mortgage per head on top of the billions that the Chancellor has already borrowed and accounted for and those for which he has not accounted. Given that there is already quite a lot of debt in the private sector, the Chancellor should be more careful when building up public debt. After all, public debt is tax deferred; we or our children have to repay all that money with interest.

 I would be interested to hear my right hon. Friend&#039;s comments about the fact that up to &#163;800&nbsp;billion might be held off balance sheet. Should not the Chancellor be far more transparent in his accounts? Is that not the issue with which we should be dealing?
</p>








<p><a name="st_42"><a name="60322-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to extend my argument even further. He is pointing out that we should account properly for not only borrowings that are guaranteed but not in the documents, such as the railway borrowings, and the contingent liabilities of all the PPP and PFI projects, but the massive contingent liabilities in the pensions area throughout the public sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_176">I will accelerate my argument because of my hon. Friend&#039;s question, although I was going to refer to this matter later. The Government have just said to all private businesses that they must not only have recent calculations of the deficits in their pension funds, but write those deficits on to their company&#039;s balance sheets. I understand the logic of that, and FRS 17&nbsp;is the standard under the Government&#039;s requirements. My plea is not that the rule is changed for companies, but that the same rule is applied to the Government. It is obvious that the Government have a massive deficit on the pension account because they&#151;Governments of all parties have done this over the years&#151;have built up huge liabilities, but not provided any assets on the other side of the account to pay for them. We need honest public accounts that match the clarity and honesty of private sector company accounts to show us the contingent liabilities of all the pension funds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_177">The Government may well counter my point by saying that one can deduce, by reading carefully the Red Book and other sources, the annual payments under the PFI and PPP contracts. However, that is not sufficient because it is a flow&#151;an income statement&#151;for each year. We need to know the contingent liability, which is how many times the income must be paid to get rid of the contract, or how much would have to be paid to rescue the contract if the company went bust or the contract went wrong. It is how much would need to be paid to reinstate the service if there was a breakdown. We need an accurate figure for that kind of contingency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-10_para12">
<a name="stpa_178">We know that sadly such contracts go wrong from time to time. We can expect new Governments to be elected who would like to change the arrangements, but there would be a substantial price for doing so. For example, it might prove penal to get out of the London tube contract because it is very bad. We need on the face of Government accounts a clear statement of what the contingent liability costs of all the private arrangements would be, in addition to the guaranteed borrowings and the pension liabilities.

: I think that the right hon. Gentleman has been drawing on the information in table 2.4&nbsp;on page 31&nbsp;of the Red Book. If he looks at the back of the Red Book, he will see a table on previous borrowings. The Conservatives were in office between 1979&nbsp;and 1997, and during 11&nbsp;of those 18&nbsp;years, the percentage of GDP that borrowing represented was considerably higher than it has been in any year under this Government since 1997. I think that I am right in saying that in all those 11&nbsp;years, borrowing was well over 40&nbsp;per cent. of GDP. Does the right hon. Gentleman decry the past of his party, during some of which time he was in government.

<p><a name="st_44"><a name="60322-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 I have already said that an economic mistake was made during the Conservative years. The mistake was backed and encouraged by the Labour party, but I never supported it. Yes, we borrowed more than we would have liked because of that mistake. The hon. Gentleman makes a party political point while I am trying to give a sensible analysis of the true position, so I would say that quite a lot of that debt was incurred to clear up the mess that Labour left behind in 1979, when we inherited a grossly over-borrowed and overtaxed country. Of course, the borrowing was especially high because Labour did not want to confess just how much it had to put up taxes to pay for the spending on its accounts.

 Perhaps I can help my right hon. Friend in answering the question raised by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris). The problem goes back to the point about transparency that I made earlier. If one adds together the money that is off balance sheet and the amount that is on balance sheet, it comes to roughly &#163;1.3&nbsp;trillion, which is 105&nbsp;per cent. of GDP, not 35&nbsp;per cent.

 Once again my hon. Friend makes his point extremely powerfully. I note that the amount has gone up by several hundred billions while he has been sitting next to me. I have seen the figure of &#163;1.3&nbsp;trillion in public commentaries and the press. It must be right if it has appeared in the newspapers, must it not? Although I have not done the calculations myself, the figure feels about right. We can leave the House with the clear understanding that there is &#163;1&nbsp;trillion or so of liabilities, many of which are not stated in the figures. Such liabilities are serious for all taxpayers and our children, so a more honest recognition of the situation would be helpful.

<a name="stpa_180">I will make a final comment on the fiscal balances in table 2.4. It is a great pity that we do not have an honest account from the Chancellor of exactly what the cycle is.

<p><a name="st_48"><a name="60322-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 I am saying that there are about &#163;1&nbsp;trillion of liabilities, which are mainly pension liabilities. The hon.

Fortunately, the House of Commons is not in that category because we have a properly funded scheme to which Members contribute and local government is also not in that position, although there are some deficits in local government schemes. However, there is nothing but deficits when it comes to all the unfunded schemes, and there should be a recognition of that in the accounts.

If he reads the figures in the Red Book on the amount of outstanding national borrowing and adds to that the pension deficits of the funded public sector schemes, the PFI and PPP contingent liabilities, the debt that has not gone through the books that should have done so, and the very large figure for unfunded pension liabilities, he would not have change out of &#163;1&nbsp;trillion. It is a good round figure that should help to inform the debate. I will leave it at &#163;1&nbsp;trillion because I have not myself done the calculation down to the second decimal point. However, I have looked at the general arguments and I am satisfied that that is the order of magnitude to which the Chancellor needs to face up.

<a name="60322-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_184">The problem began when the Chancellor, encouraged by the Prime Minister no doubt, thought that he had discovered that elixir of Labour Chancellors&#151;a stealth tax that would raise a huge amount of money which would do no damage and which no one minded. He introduced a tax on the dividend income of British shares held through pension funds and other charitable funds. He has never published an accurate figure for how much that takes.

 The general &#163;5&nbsp;billion-a-year figure is in common circulation. It started at rather less than that, to be fair to the Chancellor, but it is probably now more. It is growing. Let us take it at &#163;5&nbsp;billion, however, because he will not give us the accurate figure. He would, I am sure, concede that it is a large sum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_185">If we take &#163;5&nbsp;billion a year out of pension funds for, say, 10&nbsp;years of the policy, before Labour loses power, that is &#163;50&nbsp;billion out of pension funds. That is &#163;50&nbsp;billion that has not been invested, so perhaps another &#163;20&nbsp;billion would have been made on that from investment gain in income if it had been available to reinvest. We should then factor in the obvious point, which I made at the time, that the change was bound to hit share values&#151;share prices valued as a stream of income from a company&#151;and that if we tax that stream of income more heavily, it is worthless. I did a back-of-the-envelope calculation when the Chancellor proposed the tax and said that with the market valuing income at 20&nbsp;times its rate, as it did at the time, the &#163;5&nbsp;billion off the stream of company income would mean a &#163;100&nbsp;billion fall in share values. Compared with the fall going on elsewhere in the German, French and American markets at the time, the fall in London was about &#163;100&nbsp;billion extra for a variety of global as well as national reasons.

<p>
<a name="60322-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_186">Basically, the Chancellor decided to hit the pension funds by about &#163;170&nbsp;billion over a 10-year period as a result of capital loss income and income reinvested forgone. We now see that the actual deficits may be a bit lower than that, I am pleased to say, because the stock market has started to pick up some of the lost ground that the hit and other factors caused originally, and companies have put a lot of extra money in to try to make good some of the losses caused by the Chancellor.

 I am interested in what the right hon. Gentleman says about the balance between equity markets and bond markets.

As a result of that and the unregulated market, which we created, people have lost their pensions and seen the money pilfered by everyone apart from the brokers who made the money out of the transactions.

<p><a name="st_69"><a name="60322-12_spnew12"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 The figures show that the tax rate was far more important, but I agree that value was destroyed in global capital markets around 2000. The high-tech sector had been bid up to levels that proved unsustainable. That was particularly true of companies that had little turnover and no prospect of a profit. There was a big blow-off in the United States of America, but a lesser one in the UK because the situation had developed less dramatically. A special factor in the UK led to the collapse in share values in telecoms and high-tech areas, and it goes right back to the door of the Treasury: the Chancellor&#039;s decision to target telecoms for another of his stealth taxes that would do no damage. If one takes &#163;21&nbsp;billion-worth of tax in a single go out of the lead sector&#151;[Hon.

<p><a name="st_71"><a name="60322-12_spnew14"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 It was effectively a mandatory purchase. The companies were bidding for monopoly licences and rights to the airways, and if they had not done so they could not have stayed in that kind of business. Of course they had to pay. If one offers fewer licences than there are companies wishing to buy, one will raise a very large sum. Indeed, I pay full tribute to the Chancellor and his advisers for optimising the take for the taxpayer by the brilliance of the auction that they worked out. It just happened to do enormous damage to our lead sector, and therefore to share prices in companies such as BT and Vodafone, which happened to be the leading investments for pension funds at the time. The hon.

What if at some future date people decide that bonds are overvalued and yields go from, say, 4&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;per cent., which is not an impossible scenario?

 I quite agree and I shall come briefly to that very issue of public sector efficiency and productivity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_192">In chapter 3&nbsp;of the report there are measures to meet the productivity challenge. The main issues seem to be addressed in the Chancellor&#039;s mind to the private sector, but if one splits the disappointing figures for productivity growth in the past year or two, one sees immediately that productivity growth in areas such as manufacturing has been pretty good&#151;it has had to be, because it is an extremely competitive global world out there&#151;whereas productivity performance in the public sector has been poor to abysmal. The Government think that the figures are so bad that they have decided to call them in for re-examination and re-presentation. That is how serious it is. The figures are beginning to hit them in the headlines so they will need to be recalculated or suppressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_193">On the figures that we have had so far from the Government, it appears that productivity in the health service has been falling by 1&nbsp;per cent. a year against the background of a massive increase in spending, which the Government rather foolishly call investment. There is a lot of investment going into the health service&#151;that is in capital expenditure and it ought to be increasing productivity, but it does not seem to be working. There has also been a lot of increased spending, but much of it appears to be on unnecessary jobs and activities that are not related to front-line actions. That is one of the reasons why there are not more beds, more operations and more treatments. I hope that the Government will therefore regard productivity as especially a public sector challenge and that they will understand that merely presenting Gershon as a nice idea is not sufficient. They have not only to implement Gershon&#151;we hear of stumbling progress; I think that they are a long way from full progress&#151;but to introduce son of Gershon very quickly.

<p><a name="st_76"><a name="60322-13_spnew4"><b> Justine Greening: </b> 
 Is my right hon. Friend aware that the Department for Work and Pensions, for example, is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 326</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to spend &#163;500&nbsp;million on voluntary and involuntary redundancy schemes over the next two to three years? Does he agree that that is clearly an ineffective way of running a Department?
</p>








<p><a name="st_77"><a name="60322-13_spnew5"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 It is horrifying; what a waste of money. The rate of run-off and natural turnover in public sector employment is very high in most such departments. Surely it is possible for the Government to cut staff numbers in administration and unnecessary activities quite rapidly by ensuring that they do not replace staff and that where genuine vacancies occur for real jobs people are transferred from less important posts. It can be extremely good for morale in a department to have a staff freeze, because it creates promotion opportunities for those who remain. It is certainly better for morale in a department to try to run the change and to gain savings by a staff freeze and by transferring people to jobs that really matter than to embark on mass redundancy programmes. It clearly makes a lot more sense for the taxpayer than would spending the money on voluntary or compulsory redundancies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_194">The Chancellor understands that productivity also needs to be improved through working away on education. It is wonderful to share the Lobby with him in order to try to secure some reforms to our schooling system, which I hope he will want to take considerably further. It is a slight move in the right direction, but I am impatient to go a lot further and faster, and I always think that we are so much better when we are at our boldest. I would like my party to be much bolder on all those things.

: Yes, selection is very important, which is why I support the view of the Leader of the Opposition that we should select on ability as well as aptitude. We should select across disciplines, as specified in our policy, and we should defend our very good grammar schools, of which people are rightly proud. Many hon. Members are here only because they went to very good grammar schools or direct grant schools, as I did. We are grateful for that opportunity, so we do not wish to pull up the ladder on such proposals.

</p>








<p><a name="st_81"><a name="60322-13_spnew8"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 The Minister is heckling me, but he clearly has not studied Conservative policy carefully enough. The Leader of the Opposition is keen to preserve all the great grammar schools in this country and in Northern Ireland, as I am. He is keen to introduce sensible selection in our comprehensive system, and effectively to create a grammar school stream at the top of every comprehensive, which is a very good way of raising quality. Indeed, it is the Minister&#039;s own policy for certain disciplines, such as modern languages, where he does believe in selection on aptitude, which is another word for ability, as we all know. When I asked the Prime Minister what the difference was between aptitude and ability in modern languages, his answer was notably deficient. I am glad that the Chancellor, in the guise of

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, said that more needed to be done in further education. He said that we need to take skills education much more seriously, and we may find common ground in trying to achieve such improvements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_195">The Government could make an important contribution to improving our productivity and efficiency if they sorted out a couple of things for which they have prime responsibility. They have been in power for nine years, but we still lack an energy policy. They play an important role in energy, as they need to send the right signals in their tax and market-influencing policies, and they issue planning permission for new power stations. The Chancellor glided over the matter in his speech and in the document, but it is high time that we had an energy policy. If we wish to develop process industry in this country we need better answers on energy availability and price. In the past few weeks, there has been too much reliance on the spot price, which has gone all over the place because of the imperfections of the continental market.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_196">The Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry have both said that the Government intend to push for proper competition inquiries in Europe to try to free the market so that we can achieve access to a good supply of gas and other power at sensible prices. When will the Government persuade their partners to do so, and when are things going to be open? This is an urgent matter&#151;it is no good saying that it may happen next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_197">The Government often play a lead role in transport. We have a 21st-century economy and a very good private sector, but we have a mid-20th-century transport system that is in desperate need of more capacity and modernisation&#151;a word that the Government usually like but which they misinterpret. I hope that they will soon come up with a way of increasing transport capacity on both the road and the rail system, and I hope that it will harness private finance. I am not putting in a bid for extra public spending, as a huge amount of money is available for sensibly worked-out road schemes to expand transport capacity. The bipartisan project for the relief road around Birmingham offers a good model, and we need more of those projects. I hope that the Chancellor accepts that if we are to improve the country&#039;s economy and productivity we must tackle those road blocks, which hinder the movement of goods and people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_198">Finally, I would like to raise the issue of regulation. In his Budget statement and in the supporting papers, the Chancellor talked about the need for better regulation. Indeed, at times, he even talks about the need for deregulation. In the past, I have warmly welcomed his conversion and that of the Prime Minister to the view that we are a greatly over-regulated society. I welcome their conversion to the notion that certain regulations are unnecessary&#151;some of them achieve the opposite of what they set out to achieve and other regulations are simply too expensive, given the aims that they set themselves.

<a name="60322-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_199">We have heard fine words and speeches, and the first of two promised Bills on deregulation has finally been introduced.

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="60322-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 Of course, I would. There are some European items among the 63&nbsp;in the agreed party programme, as it is impossible to deregulate in Britain without deregulating matters with which Brussels is involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_200">The second big problem with the Bill is the inclusion of an offensive group of clauses that gives Ministers the right to legislate without reference to Parliament. The Bill does not even specify that it has a deregulatory purpose. We were invited to accept a Bill that could re-regulate Britain, taking more of our freedoms away without due process. I hope that Ministers accept that that was a gross error and a huge misjudgment. The country desperately needs proper deregulation, and a Bill is proceeding through Parliament that would allow us to achieve that. We would be delighted if the measure were subject to major amendments and surgery. We would be willing to co-operate if the Government dumped the clauses that give them too much power to legislate by the back door and included in the Bill some genuine deregulation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_84"><a name="60322-14_spnew2"><b> John Bercow </b> 
: My right hon. Friend will probably recall as well as I do that the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers) talked about the case for sunset regulation as long ago as 2000, but little has happened since. Given that more than 99&nbsp;per cent. of businesses in this country employ fewer than 100&nbsp;people but account for approximately 50&nbsp;per cent. of the private sector work force and generate two fifths of national output, does he not agree that it is time that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government looked at, and learned from, the experience of the United States by studying the Regulatory Flexibility Act 1980&nbsp;and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act 1996? If they did so, they could learn a great deal.
</p>








<p><a name="st_85"><a name="60322-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point, and I agree with him. I would, however, like to go further, as I do not want to deregulate just one sector of trade or commerce, or one size of company. I accept that small companies are badly oppressed by too much regulation, but we could strip out some major regulations for everyone. Earlier this week, the Minister and I debated the regulation of financial services in Committee. I made the point that I agreed with the Government&#039;s rhetoric on the system of regulation for the European Union as a whole and the United Kingdom in particular. The Government said that competition was better at regulating than regulators and that greater freedom produced enterprise and flexibility. The Minister said that I did not need to tell him that competition was the best regulator, as the Government understood that intuitively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_201">I am delighted that we agree about what we wish to do, but the difference between us in our current roles is that the Minister has the power to do something about

<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 329</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>it, but I do not. Now that we have agreed on the remedy, I urge Ministers who have the power to put it into effect to get on with it. We all know that the country is crying out for less regulation and that far too much regulation comes from Brussels. Treasury Ministers say that they have a unique relationship with their European partners; they have enormous influence and Europe is going their way. They say that they want a less but better regulated Europe. When will those fine words translate into action? Since the Prime Minister last spoke about the need for a deregulated Europe, 2,000&nbsp;new regulations have been introduced. Why did the United Kingdom sign up to all those regulations? Why did we not use our influence to say no? Why have we signed up to a 72-point action programme for financial services in Europe when the required regulation is either already in place nationally or will be put in place globally? When we know that we need to compete in a global marketplace, is it not much better that regulation is put in place globally, so that we are competing on a level playing field with the Indians, the Chinese and the Americans, as well as with the French and the Germans? There is no need for mezzanine regulation in big global areas such as financial services or some of the other leading globally organised industries. There may be some need for global regulation, and that surely is the level at which Ministers should concentrate their attention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_202">The Chancellor rightly said that the world is changing extremely rapidly. He rightly drew attention to the growing competitive challenge from India and from China. He may also have mentioned Brazil and Russia. The new large economies are growing very quickly. They are importing a great deal of technology and ideas, and in some cases they are exporting a great deal of capital because they are generating very large surpluses. The pattern of world trading is changing extremely quickly. We must understand that for Britain to have a prosperous future, as she has had a prosperous past, we need to turn our attention much more to countries of the size and pace of change of India and China.

<p>
<a name="60322-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_203">Britain&#039;s great advantage in the next 30&nbsp;or 40&nbsp;years is that we have a special relationship with India. We have strong ties, a common language for business and political purposes, and quite a lot of common systems as a result of our shared history in the 20th century. We need to turn that to good effect and play the game in the spirit of the recent cricket exchanges, where India won one and we won one. We need to develop that relationship as strongly as we can, because it will help pay the livings of our children and grandchildren in the future.

 I have followed the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s speech with interest. On the productivity challenge, which I accept, he has not touched on the conundrum of business investment.

There is a crying need to improve our productivity, even in the private sector, although I take some of the points that the right hon. Gentleman makes about the public sector. How do we overcome that problem?

<p><a name="st_87"><a name="60322-14_spnew5"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 That is a very good question. I have shortened my remarks because I know that other hon. Members want to speak. The point of my argument about pensions answers the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about investment levels as well. The main reason that British companies are not investing more in plant, equipment and new ideas is that every spare pound they generate is likely to have to go to make good the deficit in their pension funds&#151;deficits that are being exaggerated or made worse by the actuarial advice on and by the method of compensation of the value of assets and liabilities.

<a name="60322-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_204">If the Chancellor takes the pension fund problem seriously and can find some kind of regulatory amelioration, the hon. Gentleman will find that more of that cash flow will become free for expenditure on improving the real assets of the country and generating more wealth. Similarly, more money will be available for equity investment through the stock exchange. There is not so much equity investment available from British sources through the stock exchange for exactly the same reason&#151;people are told to put their money into bonds, not into new share issues by companies, which could otherwise finance new ideas, new technology and extended ideas for companies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_205">My concluding point is on the change in the world. According to the European Union&#039;s projections, which are a little out of date as they were issued in 2002, the 15&nbsp;main EU economies, which represented 18&nbsp;per cent. of world output in 2000, would represent only 10&nbsp;per cent. of world output by 2050. I think that is a wildly optimistic forecast on the part of the European Union. If one looks at the pace of change, the relative decline of some of the continental economies and their populations, and the enormous success of India, China, Brazil, Russia and the other emerging countries, one realises that there is no way in which the EU 15&nbsp;will still represent 10&nbsp;per cent. of world output by 2050.

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="60322-14_spnew6"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 Did my right hon.

For practical purposes, he is prepared to criticise the European Union but not prepared to go that step further and say that we will have nothing to do with that aspect of it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_89"><a name="60322-14_spnew7"><b> Mr. Redwood: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. An honest Chancellor would have said, &quot;The game is up. I now realise that joining the euro would be quite inappropriate for Britain and we would be much better off getting our regulations into line with the leading countries and power blocs in the world, not regulating at the mezzanine level in the European Union.&quot; This is the point. On its own figures the EU will almost halve as a proportion of world output. On more independent figures, it will not do that well. It will fall even more, and we will not be earning our living sufficiently if we hitch our wagon entirely to the European train or bus. We need, instead, to be aware that the life and growth in the world economy will be in America, India, China and the other emerging countries. Our foreign policy should be geared to that, and so should our economic and regulatory policy.

Turning to what I take to be his case&#151;he will correct me if I am wrong&#151;he has done himself a disservice. We should all be concerned about public sector productivity, and I am convinced, although he may not be, that the Chancellor and the Government are concerned about that, too. He has done his case a disservice with his comment about the NHS&#151;I made a similar comment to this on the first day of last year&#039;s Budget debate. If the average time allocated for a GP to see a patient goes up from eight minutes a patient to 12&nbsp;minutes a patient, it is a significant decline in productivity, which I wholly welcome, and I suspect that Conservative Members welcome it, too. In a commercial sense, that is one example of declining productivity in the NHS, but I think it fantastic.

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60322-15_spnew5"><b> Mr. Graham Stuart: </b> 
 One of the problems associated with longer GP times is the time spent using choose-and-book technology, which takes nearly twice as long to use as was originally expected when it actually works. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Prime Minister&#039;s policy unit reported in 2004&nbsp;that it felt that there had been a 20&nbsp;per cent. drop in NHS productivity. This is the great crisis: in the early &#039;90s, NHS productivity was growing strongly; under this Labour Government&#151;I think that the hon. Gentleman would agree that Ministers should take responsibility for this&#151;productivity has fallen on normal stable measures.

 I am not foolish enough to take interventions on what it is. Nevertheless, an apparently independent body that is dealing with productivity takes a view that is shared by the Chancellor.

 The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) quoted with approval the increase in productivity rates in the health service in the period before 1997. However, it is a fairly well understood economic principle that when one brings into productive use resources that were unused on the scale that was the case under that Government, they are generally less productive, and therefore average productivity is bound to decline. It is the law of diminishing returns. There is nothing special about having high levels of productivity&#151;that can be achieved by sacking the least marginal resources in any productive enterprise.

<p><a name="st_102"><a name="60322-16_spnew4"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend, who, as a cost auditor by background, is much more knowledgeable about these matters than I am. As regards what was going on in the NHS in 1997, I was a trade union solicitor working closely with the Unison branch at the main acute hospital in Wolverhampton, as well as the branch at the health authority which became the primary care trust. The hospital was doing what in industrial terms would be called sweating the assets, which was wearing out staff.

 In response to the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), in private business it would usually be expected that if one invested more, particularly if one doubled expenditure in an area, one would expect a step change upwards in productivity rather than the opposite.

<p>
<a name="60322-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_219">To try to take a little heat out of the debate, I think that it is generally accepted within the NHS&#151;and even among health Ministers&#151;that productivity is a problem.

 Although this anoraks&#039; debate between my hon. Friend and the hon.

 I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman comes from a more commercial background than I do, but I too come from a business background&#151;I spent the majority of my working life in the private sector. One should not simply rely on a commercial model as regards NHS finances and structures, and I am not suggesting that the right hon. Gentleman takes that view, but it can be illuminating to use it for comparison purposes. Arguably, the NHS was for years unadministered. The statistic that the right hon. Gentleman cites, which is commonly cited by Opposition Members, is one of those that can be extremely misleading in certain hands. For example, in some statistical, taxonomic sense&#151;to use the kind of word that the hon. Member for Buckingham would use&#151;a matron could be counted as an administratrix, to use the proper Latinate originate, or an administrator, in everyday terms. But most people, including, I suspect, the right hon. Gentleman, would not consider a matron&#151;we reintroduced them, of course&#151;to be an administrator or manager when looking at the figures to determine who is front-line and who is not.
</p>








<p><a name="st_114"><a name="60322-16_spnew15"><b> Alan Simpson: </b> 
 One example of the difficulty of setting productivity measures in the NHS is to be found in the parallel debate about productivity in health care that is taking place in France at the moment. There, people are arguing that it is productive to reduce bed occupancy rates because their measures of efficiency are to be based on reductions in readmission rates and hospital infection rates. So, to make the system less intensely used is to make it better, in terms of productivity in health care. To use strict numeric terms in regard to volume throughput might therefore miss some of the really critical health issues on which productivity ought now to be measured.
</p>








<p><a name="st_115"><a name="60322-16_spnew16"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 Absolutely. My hon. Friend makes an important point. It is extremely difficult to measure productivity, particularly in the social or public sectors.

<a name="stpa_220">Another measure of productivity&#151;which Opposition Members, especially those on the Conservative Benches, never cite, but which I always have to cite in Budget debates&#151;relates to our work force, and its participation rate of 75&nbsp;per cent. There is indeed a gap between us and France in terms of output per person-hour. That is true. It is quite a significant gap, although we have halved it in recent years, as the Chancellor pointed out in his Budget speech. However, in terms of output per person of working age, there is almost no gap at all.

<a name="stpa_221">Economists have traditionally used output per person-hour as their primary measure of productivity, for understandable reasons; it is an extremely valuable tool for a business that is planning investment, for example.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, because it illustrates the dividing line between his party and mine. Of course the rate of growth in productivity is important. I think that he said that it was the most important measure&#151;he will correct me if I am wrong&#151;but it is not the most important one to me. The most important thing for me is the size of the pie that we can divide up, as equally as possible, in our society. That is to do with the way people live, and their quality of life. To say that the most important measure of productivity is output per person-hour and to point to the slowdown in the rate of its growth are of course important, but that is not the most important thing to me. Those are dry statistics; I want to talk about people and the size of the social pie.

<p><a name="st_118"><a name="60322-17_spnew2"><b> Greg Clark: </b> 
 Far from being dry statistics, these measurements go to the heart of the matter. I am not interested in the pie as it stands at present. I am interested in the future pie, and the growth in our productivity&#151;compared with that of our competitors&#151;determines the size of the pie to be divided up. The fact that the hon.

 I am very worried about the drift of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s speech. He said a few moments ago that it was notoriously difficult to measure productivity in the health service. He then agreed that the rate of growth of such productivity was important, although 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 338</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>not necessarily the most important factor. If productivity is difficult to measure, it is difficult to see why he would regard it, and particularly its rate of growth, as so important. May I put it to the hon. Gentleman that the advances in medical science are such that there will always be a new queue whenever there is a new cure? That increases, rather than diminishes, the importance of productivity growth, as we must ensure that we get maximum value for money for the finite resources that will be available.


</p>








<p><a name="st_123"><a name="60322-17_spnew7"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 This will be my last word on this issue and I hope that hon. Members will forgive me if I do not give way further on health service productivity. The hon. Gentleman says that there will always be a queue. With the advent of statins, there is no longer a queue for heart surgery, but there may be a queue down at the pharmacy for a few extremely important pills. Do we therefore say that heart surgeons are less productive because they are carrying out less surgery? That might be so, but I am not going to continue on the NHS.

<a name="stpa_223">We need to focus on the 2.4&nbsp;million people who are employed, two thirds of them in the private sector, and on the quality of their lives in terms of public services and income, because obviously income, the size of the pie and growth in the pie are important. The relative position of the United Kingdom, a statistic mentioned by the Chancellor&#151;which is not often remarked on, and perhaps not at all today&#151;was that this country&#039;s gross national income per capita when we came into Government was seventh in the G7&nbsp;group of advanced industrial countries. We are now second out of seven. That is not to say that everything is rosy, but it looks like a darn good trend to me. As far as I am aware, that change is not just because the income of the other five has suddenly been cut, but because it has not increased as much as ours. That is extremely important and, again, is connected with the labour force participation rate. I will give way on this point, before I move on to more micro-matters.

 The Government set clear targets. They accepted targets under Kyoto, although it is questionable whether the country will meet those minimal targets. No commentator thinks that there is any chance that the country will meet the target of a 20&nbsp;per cent. reduction in 1990&nbsp;levels of carbon dioxide. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the small&#151;if, in environmental terms, arguably positive&#151;role played by the climate change levy should not be used to excuse the Government&#039;s failure to lead a major campaign on energy efficiency, to listen to the various reports of the Environmental Audit Committee and others over the years, and to transform the country&#039;s performance? If this is the biggest issue facing the world today, why have the Government failed so completely, and why do Friends of the Earth say that today&#039;s Budget statement will do nothing to tackle the challenges that we face?

That is how it works with energy: every little bit helps, whether people are driving fewer miles and cycling more, whether we have microgeneration, or whether we have a few more windmills. Hon.

<a name="stpa_234">One area where the Chancellor has made some progress in this Budget, although not nearly enough, is vehicle excise duty. There is a new band for vehicles emitting more than 225&nbsp;g per kilometre of carbon dioxide, the duty for which will be &#163;210. As I say, that is not nearly enough. In, for example, two to three years time, we should introduce a swingeing regime for such vehicles, although I stress that it ought to apply only to newly purchased ones. At one end of the spectrum is the Toyota Prius, which produces 104&nbsp;g of CO <sub>2</sub>  per kilometre. At the other is the Lamborghini Diablo, which produces 520&nbsp;g. A Ferrari 575&nbsp;Superamerica produces 499&nbsp;g. I am not an expert on cars, but I suspect that the Ferrari carries only two people. A Toyota Prius carries five people and a Toyota Aygo, which produces 109&nbsp;g of CO <sub>2</sub> per kilometre, carries at least four and may even carry five, although I do not know whether it has five seatbelts. One of the Maseratis produces, I think, 525&nbsp;g of CO <sub>2</sub>  per kilometre. We should have swingeing taxes on such vehicles.

 I hate to disillusion the hon. Gentleman, but someone who can afford a Lamborghini Diablo is unlikely to be put off by the rate of duty, whatever it may be. People in rural areas who use four-wheel drive vehicles will be hit by this new band, particularly struggling farmers. Under the proposal, they will pay more even though many such people are on very low incomes. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Chancellor needs to look at providing extra relief, so that those for whom the use of four-wheel drive vehicles is essential&#151;I am not talking about non-essential use&#151;are not penalised?

However, a duty of &#163;1,000&nbsp;to &#163;2,000&nbsp;would affect the resale value of some of these vehicles&#151;perhaps not very fancy sports cars such as Ferraris&#151;and that might influence people when they consider purchasing them. A Range Rover 4.4&nbsp;V8&#151;which is made in the west midlands by Ford, of course&#151;produces 389&nbsp;g of CO <sub>2</sub>  per kilometre. That is a ridiculous figure. I suspect that few farmers use a Range Rover 4.4&nbsp;V8&nbsp;for anything other than taking their daughter to the gymkhana.

 It is a truism in Treasury circles that it is very difficult to work out at first hearing the true shape of a Budget, but this Budget is more difficult than most.

I congratulate the Chancellor on the undoubted progress that has been made in lifting the poorest pensioners out of poverty, but we must bear in mind the fact that, first, pensioner incomes remain relatively low, with annual assaults, particularly from energy and fuel charges, on those limited incomes. The basic state pension stands at only 15.6&nbsp;per cent. of the average wage at the moment.

I accept what my hon. Friends have said, and I have been working with the Pension Service in my constituency to try to ensure that benefits are claimed. I pay tribute to the Pension Service for its work on the ground. I also pay tribute to the support it has had from the Public and Commercial Services Union.

Members, I do not have a calculator that runs to trillions, but House of Commons Library figures suggest that my recommendation would cost &#163;7.3&nbsp;billion, which would be a fairly minimal sum to lift a large number of pensioners out of poverty and enable them to share the future wealth of the country.

</p>








<p><a name="st_173"><a name="60322-21_spnew5"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 There has been a long debate about means-testing over the past 60&nbsp;years. Any Government will have to ration resources in some way. The best book to read on the matter was produced by Enoch Powell in the 1960s. It addressed health and welfare benefit reform. The language of Bevan is about socialism and the language of priorities, and Enoch Powell demonstrated in his own terms that there will always be a need for any Government to have some form of means-testing, but our job in a civilised society is to try to minimise it. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s support, but given his past calculations I am wary of his mathematical ability on such matters.

<a name="60322-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_264">Individual Members of Parliament must address elderly care. The main worry for many pensioners, apart from their income, is what will happen to them if they need care. They fear losing their homes to pay for such care, and the problem has been graphically highlighted by recent television programmes. In addition to restoring the link with earnings, the Government should thus consider abolishing all care charges, which, according to House of Commons Library figures, would cost &#163;4&nbsp;billion. That would give pensioners security in the future, but we should go further and consider again the high prescription charges that are levelled against pensioners and others. Abolishing prescription charges would cost the relatively minimal amount of &#163;0.42&nbsp;billion.

<a name="stpa_265">At the other end of the age spectrum, we must also applaud the impact of the Chancellor&#039;s policies on reducing child poverty. However, we need to acknowledge that the Government have missed their target of taking a quarter of all children out of child poverty. They have managed to do that for 17&nbsp;per cent. of children, but we have missed our target on the time scale that we set. That is not to carp. To get this far is a major achievement. However, we have missed our target by 250,000, and those children remain in poverty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_266">The definition of poverty is extremely limited. Many children living on the margins of what is defined as poverty do not enjoy the lifestyle that we would want for our own children. That is just an aside; I accept that we need commonly agreed mechanisms by which we measure poverty, but we also have to accept that the definition sets a relatively low target.
</p>

<a name="60322-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_267">There is also the problem of non take-up of means-tested tax credits, high marginal tax rates and disincentives to work, which are associated with all means tests. We have debated that. It is why I propose a simple solution to tackle the failure to meet the full 25&nbsp;per cent. target. A &#163;5&nbsp;increase a week on child benefit would cost &#163;3.4&nbsp;billion. According to Treasury figures, it would initially lift 350,000&nbsp;children out of poverty.

For that reason, we need dramatic and radical action to restore confidence among our young people in staying on, especially young people from working-class backgrounds.

It is clear from my experience that that has arisen from the rigidity and dominance of the national target setting approach to service improvement, which has undermined local management and local decision making. Therefore, central Government need to review not only local management but the central Government role. In addition, we need to recognise that the &#163;800&nbsp;million gap is not bridgeable in one year.

<a name="stpa_278">I am delighted that a number of years ago the Chancellor introduced windfall taxes to tackle obscene profits in certain sectors of the economy. I urge him to revisit that policy and look at two particular proposals. First, a windfall tax could be imposed on the bonuses given before Christmas to many people who work in the City. We have heard that the stock market is having a difficult year, but national account data show that output in the financial sector has recently increased by 5&nbsp;per cent. year on year. It is just shy of the 5.3&nbsp;per cent. that is the highest recorded increase since the 1990&nbsp;boom under the Lamont chancellorship. The bonus pool for investment bankers is estimated to be &#163;7.5&nbsp;billion, and some of those profits were distributed before Christmas on a scale not previously seen. Indeed, it is believed that 3,000&nbsp;mangers could receive a &#163;1&nbsp;million handout. A windfall tax on 50&nbsp;per cent. of a City bonus is therefore justified, and would bring in &#163;3.75&nbsp;billion.

<p>
<a name="60322-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_279">Secondly, we must look at banks and oil, and we could impose a windfall tax on the incredible profits that energy companies have reaped recently. BP, for instance, had a profit of &#163;11&nbsp;billion or 25&nbsp;per cent; Shell, 30&nbsp;per cent.; and Centrica, 11&nbsp;per cent. Of the banks, Barclays had a profit of &#163;5.28&nbsp;billion or 15&nbsp;per cent.; Lloyds TSB, 10&nbsp;per cent.; and the Royal Bank of Scotland, 21&nbsp;per cent. The Chancellor has introduced windfall taxes before, and he should do so again on the same scale. The level of profits that triggered the previous windfall tax has been exceeded by those companies, and a new windfall tax could bring in &#163;6.10&nbsp;billion.

Ten days or so ago, it announced that its so-called PFI investment quintupled in a relatively short period and that its profits had increased by 43&nbsp;per cent. The income stream that it received from those projects was twice the base rate, so it is no wonder that 60&nbsp;acute NHS trusts, to which he has referred, have commitments to PFI payments that exceed 10&nbsp;per cent. of their revenue.

 That is a significant roll-out of PFI. In the past, PFI schemes have wasted resources, and companies have been guilty of exploitation.

In my own constituency, a new PFI school was imposed on us. Every year, the school has a deficit that it must make up.

In the Department for International Development, it is &#163;10,947. When we increased the minimum wage last time, we discovered that some of our own staff were on the minimum wage. In the Ministry of Defence the starting salary for an administrative assistant is &#163;11,220.

<p>
<a name="60322-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_285">Many of those jobs are based in London. I do not know how people survive on such salaries in city areas. If we are to look into public sector pay, it should not just be in terms of restraint. We need to develop Government policies for coherence in national negotiations and tackle low pay. We must recognise that many of those people are dedicated public servants, without whom we would not be able to deliver our policies or the Budget.

However, I shall make one point: he has said that he is against privatisation, but if he looks at table C4&nbsp;in the Red Book, he will see that the spending programme that the Chancellor is currently planning depends on some &#163;35&nbsp;billion of privatisation&#151;&#163;7&nbsp;billion a year over the next five years.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 356</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>not mention today. In the middle of the existing financial year, the Chancellor rushed to the Treasury Committee to change the economic cycle&#039;s starting date. He then fiddled the end date of the cycle, and he also started to correct some of his mistakes in the pre-Budget report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_288">The Committee had already warned the Chancellor that because of earlier misjudgments, he was likely to have to put up taxes, increase borrowing or reduce spending. As hon. Members know, he did all three of those things in December: he put up taxes quite significantly, especially on North sea oil; he increased his borrowing forecast; and he cut spending by reducing the original envelope that he had sketched out for the comprehensive spending review 2007.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_289">Today&#039;s Budget was largely set by the pre-Budget report. Those who follow our proceedings may be puzzled by how the pre-Budget report has evolved into the Budget itself&#151;today seems to be a tidying-up exercise with an awful lot of flannel in between. Today&#039;s course had already been set, which is a shame, because the Chancellor could have done very much more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_290">As other Conservative Members have said, the taxation system is far too complex, too burdensome and increasingly unfair. The Chancellor could have taken the opportunity today to introduce serious proposals on simplification, to make cuts rather than increasing taxes and to introduce measures to make taxation fairer. There is much more to be done on simplification than the minuscule target of reducing the administrative burden imposed by Revenue and Customs by 10&nbsp;per cent. over five years. For example, although I admit that the figures show that the administrative cost of processing taxes is higher in Holland than it is here, the Dutch are cutting that burden by 20&nbsp;per cent. over four years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_291">Much could be done on matters such as simplifying statutory sick pay for companies and company car schemes, and there is a range of such measures that are simply an unnecessary burden on our businesses. Instead, the Chancellor has continued to make life more complicated for business and to increase the burden, although I was hoping that he would decrease it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_292">I have heard nothing today about the plight of council tax payers, who are shouldering an increasing share of the cost of local services. When the Government entered office, council tax payers had to shoulder some 25&nbsp;per cent. of the cost of local services, but the figure is now well over 35&nbsp;per cent. Year after year, council tax payers must bail out the inefficiencies of central Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_293">On income tax, the effect of fiscal drag means that people of quite moderate means, many of whom are inside the public services that the Economic Secretary has defended so eloquently, have been dragged into the higher rate of tax. Some of those people are in the front line of public service, such as senior police inspectors and senior hospital nurses, who would never have dreamed of being described as &quot;the rich&quot;. They have been dragged into the higher rate of tax by the Chancellor&#039;s failure to index allowances. It is perfectly possible for a Chancellor to choose not to index allowances to suit any one year&#039;s particular fiscal judgment. However, the cumulative effect of refusing to do so is that more than 1&nbsp;million people, many of whom are on relatively low incomes, are being dragged into the higher tax bracket.

<p>
<a name="60322-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_294">Business is paying more tax. Although, as the Chancellor reminded us, there have been welcome reductions in corporation tax, business is paying an increasing burden elsewhere. The key point about business taxes is that they are not stealth taxes&#151;they are highly visible to business, and business is extremely mobile. I fear that white-collar jobs will follow blue-collar jobs out of this country overseas. The level and complexity of business taxation needs constant vigilance. We cannot stand still as other countries improve their competitiveness and the attractiveness of their tax regimes. I hope that the Chancellor will use his new all-star global advisory board to set himself a target of improving our competitive tax position. I have no magic bullet to offer him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-22_para15">
<a name="stpa_295">It is a mistake for people to think that the 15&#151;not 10&#151;years of economic growth that we have enjoyed were triggered by any single reform. They are not underpinned by any single employment Act, change in industrial tribunals, or change in tax rates, but by a raft of economic liberalisation and supply-side reforms that took place much earlier, in the mid-&#039;80s. Because our competitive disadvantage is now slipping away, the Chancellor and the Government urgently need to look again at the supply side to ensure that our climate for business is as competitive as it should be. Instead, the Chancellor merely said that he would continue discussions on the rate of business tax and continue to review the level of national insurance against the level of taxation, and we are to have yet another report on business regulation. After nine years of the effects of this Government, the time for discussions, reviews and reports is surely over. It is time to do something serious about the situation.

Those measures are all very worth while, and exactly the sort of thing that the Treasury should be doing, but their yield is always unproven and uncertain.

I understand the difficulties involving confidentiality regarding individual and corporate taxpayers&#039; details, but as the Chancellor and the Treasury have got their revenue forecasts so badly wrong year after year, I believe that we need an external eye to look at the matter. These processes need more external validation. I live in hope. I was roundly abused by the Chancellor in the Treasury Committee for daring to question the integrity and independence of the Office for National Statistics. Six months later, he announced that he was taking urgent measures to enhance the integrity and independence of the ONS. There is no reason why the Treasury&#039;s revenue forecasting model should not be opened up to a little more external scrutiny in the same way.

The Chancellor has postponed the spending review by a year, in order to turn it into a fully comprehensive spending review in which every stone is turned and every detail examined. So I was quite struck by the way in which he pre-empted it today. He identified a whole series of Departments that will have no increase at all, then announced that the Department for Education and Skills would receive the lion&#039;s share of the increase. We welcome those additional resources, but, as several of my hon.

<a name="stpa_309">Two studies paint a picture of the actual state of affairs. The Institute for Fiscal Studies recently produced a report showing that Britain has one of the lowest rates of innovation compared with our main competitors in the industrial world. We also rank 15th among the 30&nbsp;richest countries in terms of productivity growth. There is little evidence to suggest that the freeing up of wealth acquisition among the wealthiest is delivering the productivity gains that Members would like to see, or to claim.

<p><a name="st_200"><a name="60322-24_spnew4"><b> Mr. Graham Stuart: </b> 
 Does the hon.

Ireland, for instance, wants to reduce corporation tax. Companies setting up there are now contributing in a major way to Irish tax coffers, and hence to schools and hospitals.

 Other Members would say that what underpins the dynamism of the southern Ireland economy is the number of subsidies that it has received from the European Union. That is what allows such investment and relocation to take place. In many ways, those subsidies are merely relocation bribes&#151;they are not necessarily about productivity gains. The notion that if taxes on the rich are reduced wealth will flow to society as a whole is pure mythology.

<a name="stpa_312">Nowhere is such a culture more apparent than in the management of the water industry, a critical issue to which I now turn. Today is world water day, which is an interesting benchmark for the House. No mention was made of it in the Budget. It comes at a time when 12&nbsp;million households in the UK, mainly in southern England, have been told that they are likely to face hosepipe bans and water restrictions during the summer, and when the UK water industries&#151;the companies responsible for water management&#151;are haemorrhaging 4.7&nbsp;billion litres into the drains through unrepaired leaks every single day of the year. That is enough water to meet the needs of 14.5&nbsp;million households. The scale of inefficiency in the management of the water supply is breathtaking and it will certainly be neither welcomed nor understood by any of those who face hosepipe bans and water restrictions.
</p>

<a name="60322-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_313">Despite that crisis, the rate of leakage reduction has fallen in the past five years. However, the rate of self-reward, profits and distributed dividends has risen. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 362</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Dividend rates in the UK water industry are now four times higher than those of our European counterparts. Last year, executive pay in the water industry increased by 31&nbsp;per cent.&#151;at a time when leakages were becoming colossal. Now, the industry is asking the country as a whole for some form of restraint in order to manage its way out of the crisis, but such restraint has nothing to do with the rewards that those in the industry pay themselves. We have created a water service delivery culture in which companies are pouring water down the drain, and in which that rate of loss is matched only by the rate at which they pour money into their own pockets.

 I have a great deal of sympathy with the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. Does he accept that there is an inequality in this&nbsp;regard? In some areas, the price paid by people for so-called improvements to the water supply&#151;improvements that they are not seeing&#151;has risen exponentially. In areas such as the south-west, the water rates and the council tax combined account for more than 25&nbsp;per cent. of some pensioners&#039; income. That is unsustainable for the poorest in our society&#151;those on fixed incomes and pensions&#151;particularly given that, as the hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>responsibility away to arm&#039;s length should have engendered a culture of cheating and dishonesty, but we are reaping the harvest of the mistaken belief that throwing assets out to the private sector would lead to that sector delivering social gain. What has happened, in fact, is that it has delivered social greed.

<a name="60322-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_315">At the same time, hon. Members are lobbied, in the House and in our constituencies, by people who have been punished not for pursuing policies of greed, but for acting in a responsible manner. I am referring to the 85,000&nbsp;people who have had their pensions stolen. I spoke earlier about the lack of wisdom of using pensions savings for speculative purposes, but the people who have suffered are the ones who did as successive Governments, of all parties, asked them to do. They put money into pension schemes so that their retirement years would be properly provided for, and we have a moral duty to ensure that that money is paid back. We need people to believe in saving for their pensions, but that has to be underpinned by a cast-iron guarantee that those savings cannot be stolen.

<a name="60322-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_316">If people choose to cash in their pension savings and subsequently squander the money on speculation, that is their tough luck. However, I believe that it is a criminal offence to cause people to lose out after a lifetime of regular saving into a pension scheme. An offence like that must be redressed in full. How such redress is achieved is, in part, a responsibility for the Chancellor and the Government.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 364</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a point made from the Conservative Benches. If we want to begin with the question of the creation of wealth, it is fair to say that there are a few dynamic entrepreneurs in the UK who have not only invented things to make, but have gone on to produce them. We ought to consider how to reconnect with support for domestic manufacturing. Many of the countries that are far more successful than we are at that are in that position because they have much more interventionist policies in their markets. There is a presumption that it is not enough to talk about inventions if one does not create the domestic circumstances in which those inventions have markets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_320">That is the point that I want to come to on the climate change challenge. One of the big criticisms that we hear from the parts of the manufacturing industry in the UK that are involved in the development of new technologies and sustainable energy systems is that we should look at what is happening in other parts of Europe. The Governments of those countries have created a market in sustainable energy systems and renewable technologies because they have changed the rules and financial subsidies in relation to those markets. Germany is streets ahead of the UK in doing that. It has captured 15&nbsp;per cent. of the world market in renewable technologies because its firms have a domestic market in which to sell. In Berlin, 80&nbsp;per cent. of all new buildings that are going up are generating their own energy. Is that just a foible of Berliners? The answer is no. The market rules about buy-back pricing of electricity were changed so that people get back four times the price for energy they generate in relation to the cost of energy that they take from the system. Of course, that transforms the way in which energy suppliers begin to look at the energy market.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_321">I just happen to have completed my own eco-house, which will generate more energy than it consumes and which puts the surplus back into the national grid, but it is a crap deal. For every &#163;1&nbsp;of energy that I put into the system, it will cost me &#163;7&nbsp;to get it back. That is the nature of a rigged market. We can change the nature of that market so that there is less sense of theft and a dash for cash in the present and so that we have a market that genuinely invests to deliver in a sustainable way for the future. The rules are not God-given; they are Government-created. One can create competitive markets, but on a different presumption.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_322">In that sense, when we talk about the need for liberalised markets, I would just point out that, in the UK, in a liberalised market mentality, we are currently paying more for our energy supplies than our European competitors. The best point of comparison is Denmark. In 1970, after the last oil crisis, it looked at the short-term pressures, realised that it needed to come up with long-term solutions and began to invest systematically in decentralised energy systems. It did so knowing what most people in today&#039;s UK energy sector know: we have a monumentally inefficient national grid energy supply system. Some 70&nbsp;per cent. of the energy input is lost in energy production or transmission. In Denmark and the Netherlands, decentralised energy systems, using co-generation techniques of combined heat and power, are 90&nbsp;to 95&nbsp;per cent. efficient. Those countries recognised that they could meet their energy needs, and their energy security needs, through decentralised energy systems using the energy that we throw away.

<a name="60322-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_323">Why do we not take the opportunity to change the fiscal rules relating to energy markets to allow a paradigm shift, not into the absurdity of a new generation of nuclear power stations or the presumption that we are under some obligation to prop up a grossly inefficient national grid, but in the way we think about energy generation and supply? The Dutch are building roads that incorporate solar power generation so that the energy needs of 400&nbsp;houses can be met by every new kilometre of motorway. Why are they doing it, but we are not? It is because their Government intervene to structure the market towards renewables rather than short-term consumption or profit generation.

<p><a name="st_208"><a name="60322-25_spnew2"><b> Mr. Vaizey: </b> 
 I have listened to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s speech with intense interest and, if I had the opportunity, I would reply to it in detail, not least because Thames Water is planning to build a reservoir in my constituency and because I have had the Thames Valley energy centre round to my home to reduce my emissions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will put on his website the details of how he created an eco-home. I completely agree with him about fiscal rules. Will he congratulate Braintree council, a Conservative council that has reduced council tax for energy-efficient homes? Does he also agree that the Government could ensure that all new homes meet the highest environmental standards possible? It is in their hands to do that today.
</p>








<p><a name="st_209"><a name="60322-25_spnew3"><b> Alan Simpson: </b> 
 The Government could do that and I would encourage them to do so. They could require new homes to meet not only the decent homes standards, but the standards that are being set for other parts of Europe, which are considerably higher than the decent homes standards. Those new standards make our requirements seem like the last generation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_324">The reality in the UK is that 80&nbsp;per cent. of the population is likely to live their lives in 80&nbsp;per cent. of the existing stock. The question is what we do about those who are living in existing housing stock. That position is profoundly affected by other changes. Since 2003, gas prices under British Gas have risen by 80&nbsp;per cent., and its electricity prices have risen by 38&nbsp;per cent. The incomes of the fuel poor have risen by nothing like that amount. I am proud of the fact that my Labour Government made the first legally binding undertaking to eradicate fuel poverty in this country. I am proud of the initiatives that have been adopted under the warm homes programme, but the recent burgeoning of oil and gas prices is taking people back into fuel poverty far faster than the programme is lifting them out of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_325">By 2003, we had reduced the numbers of households in extreme fuel poverty to some 1&nbsp;million. We were on track to eliminate fuel poverty in the most vulnerable households by 2010. As matters stand, the figure has risen to 2.7&nbsp;million and is projected to exceed 3&nbsp;million by the end of the year. The only way to reverse that is through a step change in intervention in the market, both to reward those who are able to adopt energy conservation measures in their own homes and to require standards to be met by those who wish to lease out properties and those who are building properties that are energy guzzlers, rather than energy generators.

<p><a name="st_211"><a name="60322-25_spnew5"><b> Alan Simpson: </b> 
 That is certainly one measure that could have been used, but not the only one. As has been suggested, we could tie such a provision to exemptions or reductions in council tax, to stamp duty or to licensing for rented houses of multiple occupancy, all of which could be conditional on energy efficiency. However, there is a cost involved. We need to be honest about that and take the cost on the chin now, because the cost of not using energy efficiently will be paid in people&#039;s lives. That is the real challenge against which this Budget and future Budgets will increasingly be judged. To what extent will we offer more than lip service to making profound, demanding, changes in energy costs or climate change that affect people&#039;s lives or their ability to stay alive? All future Budgets will have to be judged against those criteria.

<a name="stpa_327">One of the things that experience taught me is that there are no individual solutions. My contribution to energy generation would be infinitely more efficient if it could be fed into a decentralised energy system for Nottingham, in which co-generation&#151;the interaction between the energy needs and energy generation of houses, shops and businesses&#151;was part of an integrated whole. We shall achieve that only when fiscal measures make such a shift possible. That is an admission of the limits of the contribution I can claim in lightening the ecological footprint of my existence on the planet. My contribution would be much more significant if my footprint was lightened alongside others and in conjunction with them.

<p>
<a name="60322-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_328">In budgetary terms, we need to look at the management of markets and the management and deployment of fiscal incentives on energy. Recently, we handed out a public, taxpayer subsidy to clear up the &#163;85&nbsp;billion waste management costs of the last generation of nuclear power stations. Soon, we shall be asked to believe that there will be no similar costs in future for a subsequent generation. I have to say to the Chancellor, his colleagues and colleagues on both sides of the House that the public, taxpayer subsidy for that next round of follies would run off with the budget for all the other interventions that would bring about fundamental change towards a sustainable energy system for the UK in the 21st century.

 The use of that figure in relation to nuclear new-build is extremely disingenuous. That was a historic cost; there is no doubt that the generation and disposal of waste was shockingly bad 30&nbsp;or 40&nbsp;years ago, but that would not be the case now. Those who oppose nuclear new-build tend to compare what we could build 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 367</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>now with what we built in the past, but in fact that would be the equivalent of buying a 1970s Ford Cortina, whereas nuclear new-build now is the equivalent of buying a Toyota Prius. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?
</p>








<p><a name="st_215"><a name="60322-26_spnew1"><b> Alan Simpson: </b> 
 No, I do not agree; nor does the Sustainable Development Commission or Greenpeace. Those who consider the issue say that, as soon as we start to scrutinise the cost element of what the nuclear industry wants, we are back into the same old game. I remind the House that, when we were there first time, the House and the public were promised atoms for free. We have been paying for that deception ever since, and we would do so again. My caution is that, if we go down that path, all the money that the Chancellor would have to play with for a shift towards renewables and decentralised energy would be hijacked and put into the pockets of the nuclear industry once again. That will not meet our energy security or supply needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_329">My final point on energy and the carbon consequences of how we run the economy is to echo the sense of sadness that aviation duties were not mentioned in the Budget. Some colleagues say that those duties are covered by international agreements and that we are pushing forward with the plans for emissions trading, but I would add a word of caution. We need to look carefully at what emissions trading is about. With all other aspects of pollution trading, the real danger is that a market in non-goods is created. Some of the greatest enthusiasts for emissions trading schemes are in the City of London, and they see themselves as making large fortunes out of their brokerage roles in the trade in non-goods.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_330">In aviation, it is far simpler to consider non-tradable duties. It would be very simple to calculate the current carbon miles impact of flights from all UK airports in the past year. We could set that as a quota for them, and we could say that the UK regime will be to reduce every airport&#039;s quota by 5&nbsp;per cent. a year. Airports could specify that priority will be given to higher efficiency aircraft or shorter flights, with higher passenger usage or shorter cargo trips, all of which reduce the carbon content of passenger miles and food miles. We must engage in that scale of shift in the next 10&nbsp;years if we are remotely likely to manage our way through the climate change that will happen. We can do that if we intervene to set those climate change duties in fiscal terms that define a different shape of aviation market.

<a name="stpa_331">All Budgets are really expressions of solidarity, to a greater or lesser extent. They are transfers in society. They represent the extent to which a society will take elements of the wealth generated today by those in work and redistribute it to those out of work. They are transfers from one generation to another in determining how people in work today meet the pension needs of those who are retired and the needs of our children in the future. They are transfers from one region to another and from one section of society to another.

<a name="stpa_332">It would be possible for the House, in solidarity, to have a Budget that wrote off the NHS deficit and scrapped prescription charges, which would cost us &#163;1.2&nbsp;billion.

We could change the fiscal rules of the energy markets to create sustainable markets and decentralised energy networks in the way that I have described.

I hope that we have a Labour Chancellor who will not lack the courage to face up to that challenge and deliver those answers, if not in this Budget, in the Budgets ahead, regardless of whether he does so as the Chancellor or whether he aspires to do so as leader of the parliamentary Labour party.

<a name="stpa_334">When I started my career in business, I worked for the Boston Consulting Group. A few days after joining the company I was sent to south America to investigate the market for breathing apparatus among fire brigades in the Argentinean pampas&#151;it was a fairly exotic mission. Owing to long flights and delays, I had little time after getting back before I was required to present my report to our client. Just before we were about to do that, the senior partner called me into his office and looked at my report. He jabbed an accusing finger at a number in the document that he chose at random and said, &quot;Greg, how did you come by that figure?&quot; I was required to explain how I derived the calculation and, fortunately, I passed the test because I was able to explain exactly where it had come from. The senior partner was making an important point because if I had not been able to give an explanation, no other figure in my report would have been of any worth whatsoever. If I could not explain every figure, there was no point presenting the report to the client at all.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_335">When I came to the House, I assumed that there was a similar process when the Chancellor of the Exchequer presented figures in his annual Budget to Parliament. I

<br>&nbsp;<br>assumed that there was an equivalent of the senior partner who went through the Budget figures. It might have been that the Chancellor himself asked his officials who are in the Box today how the figures were derived. If not, perhaps the Prime Minister had the papers laid out on the Cabinet table and, pointing to a figure, said, &quot;Gordon, how did you get to that number?&quot; Whatever the process, I assumed that if a report on breathing apparatus in Argentina could merit such scrutiny, anything presented to the House by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the annual Budget should merit exactly the same treatment.

<a name="60322-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_336">I was thus interested when the Chancellor said earlier this afternoon that savings of &#163;6&nbsp;billion had been secured from the Gershon efficiency review. That is extremely important because any Government have two duties: first, to advance new policies that will reform and change the country in which we live; and, secondly, to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manage effectively the public services and administrative activities that are in the remit of the Government. Both duties are equally important, and the Gershon review goes to the heart of the second one. It is absolutely crucial that public services are run effectively and efficiently at the minimum cost to the public, not least because any savings that are made can be reinvested in services, can promote the greater quality of those services, or can be returned to the public through tax cuts. It is thus important that the numbers are right, and the work of the Public Accounts Committee, on which I serve, is very much geared to that end.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_337">However, when the Chancellor announced his &#163;6&nbsp;billion figure, it called to mind an earlier claim that he had made about Gershon savings. The Committee examined that. The right hon. Gentleman made the same claim in his Budget speech last year when he said:

<a name="stpa_346">The hearing also raised worrying questions about the substance of the Gershon review. I do not want to make political points about the review as an appropriate subject on which the Government should take a view. I genuinely think that it is extremely important, but the NAO advised us that commercial organisations might expect in an efficiency drive to identify about 10&nbsp;per cent. of the relevant administrative costs as savings. The Gershon review proposed savings of only 2.5&nbsp;per cent. I do not quibble with that; I merely compare it with practice in commercial organisations. However, it is important to achieve even that modest level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_347">Again, when the NAO looked closely at the Gershon review, it discovered that most of the savings accounted for in the &#163;21.5&nbsp;billion ultimate total from Gershon came from projects that had started before the review was conceived. It is stretching credulity to regard them as being Gershon savings; that is what the NAO found. When I questioned the Comptroller and Auditor General in the PAC on his assessment of the quantity of new money&#151;the real savings that were being made under Gershon&#151;I discovered something even more shocking.

<a name="stpa_348">The NAO established a sum of 20&nbsp;projects under the Gershon review that it looked at in detail. That sample was designed&#151;I asked Sir John Bourn about it directly&#151;to be representative of the whole, as is any sample. Any auditor would choose a sample on that basis, and Sir John confirmed that. Of that sample, the NAO was able to say that, of the ongoing efficiency savings, only between one and three were in any sense new and engaged in subsequent to the commissioning of the Gershon review. On the basis of that sample, 85&nbsp;per cent. of the funding improvements that the Chancellor presented last year and, indeed, this year as possible do not merit the flourish that he gave them. They were the normal, embedded efficiency savings that Departments were already engaging in. That again gave me great cause for concern.

<a name="stpa_349">The final point that I wanted to raise in this Budget debate, since the Chancellor chose to talk about having achieved &#163;6&nbsp;billion-worth of Gershon efficiency savings, is their reliability and robustness. The Office of Government Commerce helpfully makes an assessment of the deliverability of each of the savings by Department, and ranks them in four categories. Red means that there are grave concerns about deliverability, and green that there are good prospects that the savings will be delivered.

<a name="stpa_350">The NAO had access to that information and helpfully reproduced in a series of pie charts in its report how many projects fell into each of the four categories of deliverability. It was drawn to my attention that there seemed to be a misprint in the charts, because there were only three segments to the pie. It was only on looking at the small print to the key to the table that it became apparent that that was so because, as at December 2005, there were no projects in any Department that were rated green as having good prospects of being delivered. Therefore, far from the Chancellor&#039;s being able to bank on, boast about and flourish the &#163;21.5&nbsp;billion-worth of savings in his Budget statements, the truth is that there is extreme risk that they will be delivered. The evidence for that is reported by the Office of Government Commerce itself.

<a name="stpa_353">What is to be done about this? I would have hoped that the Chancellor might exercise the senior partner role and interrogate the figures.

In the presence of such difficulties, who better to certify that the numbers are above board and accurate than the Comptroller and Auditor General&#151;the head of the National Audit Office, Sir John Bourn?

Sir John Bourn rightly signed off those variables as above board and put them into the public domain. What more reasonable request could there be than to ask that he look at and validate Gershon efficiency savings before they are deployed by the Chancellor? I urged the Chancellor to do so at the last Treasury questions, suggesting that there was plenty of time before the Budget to ask Sir John to look at the savings. I raised the matter at a hearing of the Public Accounts Committee, and Sir John told me that he was ready, willing and able to conduct such an audit before the Budget.

Turning first to the economy, I assume that the Chancellor&#039;s heading for the 2006&nbsp;Budget&#151;&quot;A strong and strengthening economy&quot;&#151;is ironic, because the evidence indicates otherwise. After he downgraded his growth forecast twice last year, UK growth was finally estimated to be 1.8&nbsp;per cent., which is significantly below the growth rates of China, India and the United States. Moreover, we came a poor 19th among 25&nbsp;EU member states.

Google and Apple&#151;the businesses of the future&#151;have both chosen to set up their operations in Ireland rather than the UK. Productivity growth is now only 0.4&nbsp;per cent.&#151;the lowest in more than 15&nbsp;years. Worse still, public productivity, as we have heard, is falling. Business investment, which fell to 9.1&nbsp;per cent. of GDP in the last quarter of 2005, is now the lowest since 1965. Overall, the Chancellor is failing on all the long-term drivers of prosperity.

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his foresight, because I am about to address that topic. Perhaps most pernicious of all is the state of Government debt. The Chancellor has continued to hide extra Government debt off balance sheet in order to avoid breaking his own sustainable investment rule. The headline figure used for public sector net debt is &#163;436&nbsp;billion, which is 35&nbsp;per cent. of GDP. That headline figure is attractive, but the reality is that each and every year the Chancellor is hiding more and more debt off balance sheet&#151;up to &#163;850&nbsp;billion at the last count. The real public sector net debt figure could be as high as &#163;1.3&nbsp;trillion, of which roughly &#163;450&nbsp;billion is on balance sheet and &#163;850&nbsp;billion is off balance sheet. That is a staggering 105&nbsp;per cent. of GDP. For every &#163;1&nbsp;that the Chancellor is willing to show on balance sheet, he is now hiding &#163;2&nbsp;off balance sheet.

<br>&nbsp;<br>decision in 1992&nbsp;to leave the exchange rate mechanism, a scheme supported by the great and the good, including the Labour party and the present Chancellor of the Exchequer? Does he agree that that is why the economy has grown over the past nine years?

<p><a name="st_236"><a name="60322-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Todd: </b> 
 It is certainly entertaining to have 1992&nbsp;raised when the current Leader of the Opposition was the ghostly figure behind Norman Lamont at that fateful time. I would not have thought that that topic would benefit from further exploration, so I will not venture into it. I will, however, make a European point towards the end of my remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_378">Our level of debt is low by international standards. I take the points about off-balance-sheet figures, which, to be honest, could apply to any nation in the world. If we attempt to use internationally based comparisons, our position is good. Few would dispute that.We have some other advantages, however, to which we need to play firmly over the next few years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_379">First, we have a reputation of being a liberal country with liberal markets and an emphasis on freedom of movement, freedom of expression and freedom of ability to establish businesses and prosper. My concern is that that is in a world in which protectionism is once again starting to rear its head. I have always been hostile to protectionism, whether in the European Union context&#151;as there are concerning signs of the EU considering and being more sympathetic to protectionist measures than it should&#151;or in the major threats in the World Trade Organisation process of countries stepping back towards protectionism all around the world. We should play to that fundamental advantage with all our strength, as it builds the skills and flexibility on which, as a relatively small nation, we can play well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_380">Secondly, the English language is a huge unsaid advantage in the global economy. I earned my living in the media industry, in which we play way above our strength as a result of that advantage. We have another considerable strength in the diaspora of our former empire, and many people trade freely with us partly because of the number of those on our shores who come from where they live. We have a large, prosperous and entrepreneurial Indian community. We have a Chinese community, which, again, has strong links.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_381">If we can play to those strengths over the next few years, I think that we will compete more effectively than any other nation in western Europe, and I am sure that we can do so.

 It is important to consider Britain&#039;s relative economic position, in terms of competitiveness, vis-&#224;-vis the major countries with which we do business. Under this Government, according to the World Economic Forum, we have fallen from 4th to 13th in terms of competitiveness. Productivity in the private, wealth-producing sector of the economy, running at 2.6&nbsp;per cent. under the last Conservative Government between 1992&nbsp;and 1997, decreased under the first term of a Labour Government to 2.1&nbsp;per cent., and today is only at 0.4&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_382">Savings have also decreased rapidly. Between 1992&nbsp;and 1997&nbsp;the savings ratio was 9.7&nbsp;per cent.; today it stands at just over half that&#151;5.5&nbsp;per cent. The World 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 379</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Economic Forum rates the United Kingdom 98th out of 117&nbsp;countries, and says that our low savings ratio puts Britain at a &quot;significant competitive disadvantage&quot;. That is obvious: it is the savings of the nation that go towards providing a decent savings system for our pensions and the business investment that we need to create wealth for the future. Business investment is also at an all-time low. At 9.7&nbsp;per cent., it is at its lowest level since records began in 1965.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_383">Last year British growth was below the G7&nbsp;average, below the OECD average and, indeed, below the global average. This year, it is actually below trend growth. Then there is taxation, which is important when businesses decide where to locate in the world. As we have heard from Members today, many businesses do have a choice. When the Government came to power, this country had the 10th lowest business taxes in the developed world; we now have the 10th highest. A few days ago, the ITEM Club and the accountants Ernst and Young concluded that, excluding North sea oil revenues, the UK tax burden was higher than it had ever been. I understand that, on the basis of the figures produced by the Chancellor today, by 2010&#150;11&nbsp;it will be touching some 41&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_384">Why is that important? There is evidence that other countries around the world that have taken a different tack in regard to tax rates have experienced significantly higher levels of economic growth. In Australia, John Howard&#039;s Government came into power in 1996, just a year before our present Administration. They promptly set about cutting taxes, and as a result the Australian economy has expanded by a third so far, compared with a quarter in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_385">What the Government often miss is the fact that a cut in tax rates will lead to an increase in the total tax take as business activity increases and companies from around the world decide to locate here. Ireland has done the same: it cut taxes on business and now has a higher income per head than the United Kingdom. At the other end of the spectrum, Sweden&#151;which has the highest taxes in Europe and possibly in the world&#151;now has a pre-tax income that would make it the fifth poorest state in the United States, just behind Alabama.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_386">There are important lessons to be learned from our relative global competitive position. If we want a thriving economy, we must secure a decent tax take with which to fund the public services that we all want.

Those are very large sums, equating to &#163;7,000&nbsp;for every family in the country&#151;a figure that people can relate to slightly more easily. In addition, of course, there is the off-balance-sheet debt, be it from unfunded public sector pensions liabilities, Network Rail or, indeed, private finance initiative and public-private partnership schemes, all of which will bear very heavily on the public purse. I am not arguing that we should not, therefore, have gone ahead with certain PFI and PPP schemes, but we need to be honest and to take into account the impact of the payback costs on the public finances going forward.

At &#163;47&nbsp;billion, our trade deficit is the largest it has ever been. Our trade deficit with China increased by 20&nbsp;per cent. during this year alone. I find it completely ridiculous, moreover, that Belgium is exporting more to India than we are, bearing in mind our historical and cultural links with that great country.

<a name="60322-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_389">The Chancellor talked a lot today about education and he was absolutely right to do so. Business people tell us that one of the issues that they are most concerned about when deciding whether to locate here or elsewhere is this country&#039;s skills levels. As far as I am aware, Amazon decided to locate in Ireland in part because its work force has greater language skills than does the UK&#039;s. That should be a significant lesson to us. We need to increase language ability in our schools, because we do not do nearly well enough in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_390">The Opposition welcome the money for our schools announced in today&#039;s Budget, but here I return to the issue of literacy and numeracy, which is tremendously important. According to the CBI, employers believe that one in seven adults in the UK is functionally illiterate. As my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree pointed out, according to the National Audit Office the total number of adults in that category is increasing by 100,000&nbsp;per year. The Department for Education and Skills told us in January that one in three 16-year-old school leavers do not even have five A to C GCSE passes. As a result of all that, we are ranked 33rd in the world in terms of the quality of our state education system. That simply is not good enough for the fifth strongest economy in the world.

<a name="stpa_391">What can we do about that? I am delighted that the Government have at long last agreed that synthetic phonics should be the basis for teaching children to read in our schools. Those of us who are familiar with the work of Melanie Phillips know that she argued for synthetic phonics many years ago in her book &quot;All Must Have Prizes&quot;. I regret that this issue became a matter for party political debate. I salute the efforts of my own party, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), who has campaigned tirelessly on this issue. I hope that Members in all parts of the House are pleased that we have eventually adopted a position that should lead to an improvement in our children&#039;s reading ability.

<a name="stpa_392">On maths teaching and numeracy, I hope that the Government will take note of the many children throughout the country participating in the Kumon maths scheme, in which, I should point out, I have no financial interest whatsoever. There is a Kumon centre in Dunstable, in my constituency, to which many children from both independent and state schools go. A DFES study on this scheme would be useful. However, it is what goes on in schools that is crucial. The money is welcome, but it is hard for children to get the education that they will need in a competitive world when discipline and control are absent.
</p>

<a name="60322-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_393">A lady in my constituency has been a teacher for more than a quarter of a century and she told me about an incident that happened in one of my upper schools only a couple of weeks ago. One class was being disrupted by a pupil and the teacher concerned was unable to handle it. He appealed for help from other staff, but nothing happened for half an hour. That was because the spare member of staff allocated to help in such situations was dealing with an incident in another classroom, where a different child was disrupting a lesson. As a result, the children in the first class to which I referred learned nothing for half an hour. Discipline is fundamental to education. The Government have launched a review into the matter, but some of our schools face very serious difficulties that we need to address.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-29_para16">
<a name="stpa_394">More funding was announced today for further education, and I welcome that. Further education gives people the second chance that they desperately need and which they did not get at school, but the Government have adopted a very stop-go approach. Dunstable college in my area lost 25&nbsp;jobs and almost 1,000&nbsp;student places last year because of a budget cut. Why cannot we have a smooth progression? What is the point of cutting funding one year and increasing it the next? That approach has a very serious impact on the morale of both staff and students.

<a name="stpa_395">The Chancellor said that a link would be established between British students and American business schools.

I am sure that both institutions would welcome some of that money. No doubt American business schools turn out some excellent graduates, but I question whether taxpayers&#039; money should be used for that purpose.

<a name="stpa_396">The same stop-go approach is evident in respect of science. We all know that the science base is essential for this country&#039;s future, but science departments up and down the country are being closed because they are so expensive. A couple of weeks ago, I had the privilege of welcoming one of my constituents to the Terrace of the House, where an exhibition of her work was being held. She came to my constituency from Exeter, where the university&#039;s chemistry department had been closed because it was so expensive, and she now teaches at the Open university. The same thing is happening all over the country. Why cannot we have a consistent approach? I welcome the money that the Chancellor is giving to science, but science departments around the country should not be closing.

 Does my hon. Friend think that there is a contradiction between the Chancellor&#039;s emphasis on stability and prudence and the way in which money was showered on the NHS a few years ago?

<a name="stpa_399">I come now to pensioners. I agree with the comments made earlier that it is scandalous that the ombudsman&#039;s report into the 85,000&nbsp;people whose pension schemes have collapsed has not been honoured. Some of my constituents worked for Dexion in Hemel Hempstead and so fall into that category. The Chancellor was happy to talk about the unclaimed assets going into youth services. We all support those services, but the 85,000&nbsp;people who were forced to save for pensions as a condition of employment, and who now find that the money has gone, should have first claim on those funds. It is reprehensible that they do not and I hope that the Paymaster General, who is sitting on the Front Bench listening to the debate, will urge the Chancellor to reconsider the use of those unclaimed assets. As I said, the 85,000&nbsp;people who have lost their pensions should have first call on them.

We will all have constituents who are counting down the number of years that they can stay in their own homes. They run down their savings every year just to pay their council tax. That is simply not acceptable. Had we had a Conservative Government there would have been a halving of the rate of council tax for people over 65, up to a maximum of &#163;500. It is deeply regrettable that the Chancellor has not given that &#163;200&nbsp;rebate this year and that we have not had a proper reform of council tax, which is long overdue.

Two days ago, the <i>Financial Times</i> contained damning evidence about the fact that regional disparities in the UK have got worse.

 I may forgo a lifetime&#039;s obsession with macro-economics and look at some of the micro-economic aspects of the Budget, focusing on the environmental impact. I welcome the fact that the Chancellor has announced that he will index fuel duty in September and that he is indexing the climate change levy, but we have to put that in the context that was admirably spelled out in the Environmental Audit Committee report, &quot;Pre-Budget 2005: Tax, economic analysis, and climate change&quot;, which came out yesterday. If we update for today&#039;s announcement, figure 6&nbsp;in that report makes it clear that, on fuel duty, there has been a revalorisation in only two and a half of the past seven years&#151;if we count the current period as a half year. On vehicle excise duty, we are looking at one increase in revenue over the past seven years. On the climate change levy, we are looking at one year out of the past seven years. On air passenger duty, we have had a freeze over all the seven years, with a steady decline in yields.

<a name="60322-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_402">If we look at the detail of what the Chancellor announced today, we can see, for example, that it is extremely unlikely that we are even going to see an increase in yields from the green taxes overall, given that he admitted that vehicle excise duty, although restructured, would raise less. The restructuring is actually extremely mild. On the increase for those at the top end, in terms of emissions, we are looking at a cost that will be less than the cost of filling a full tank of the average 4x4&nbsp;gas-guzzler that he says that he is aiming at. The Energy Saving Trust recently came up with research that suggested that, if there is to be a genuine shift in the pattern of car-buying behaviour, there could be a need for a tax at the top end of more like &#163;2,000&nbsp;a year than &#163;200.

<br>&nbsp;<br>taxation through the price mechanism has an effect on behaviour, it is worth pointing out an extremely useful article in the latest <i>Fiscal Studies</i> from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which cites a number of academic research studies, from Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Austria and Belgium, all of which clearly suggest that increased taxes and prices have positive impacts on behaviour when it comes to dealing with climate change. However, the Chancellor&#039;s record since 1997&nbsp;shows a peak in green taxes of 3.6&nbsp;per cent. of GDP in 1999, but that has fallen steadily so that the latest figure is only 3&nbsp;per cent. of GDP, or a lower share than in the last year of the Conservative Government. Given the policy announcements today, there is no prospect of a rise either.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_404">The result is clear. The Government constantly remind us that they are set to meet our Kyoto target, but that is an exceptionally complacent spin on the reality, which is that the only reason we are meeting our Kyoto obligations is the felicitous shift from coal-generated electricity to gas-generated electricity, which had a sharp impact on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Chancellor has included a chart in the Red Book, chart 7.1, which usefully shows that carbon dioxide emissions have risen by 2.9&nbsp;per cent. since 1997. The Government cannot be confident that they will continue to meet our Kyoto obligations or their target for carbon dioxide emissions unless they take a much more radical view of the need to change behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_405">The issue is a test of seriousness for the Government and for the Opposition, who are strangely silent whenever anybody mentions the possibility of using the price mechanism or taxation to direct behaviour towards a more sustainable pattern for the future of the planet, our children and our grandchildren. It is a basic economic point that such a change does not necessarily involve any overall increase in taxation. If &#163;10&nbsp;more is taken in green taxes, it can be handed back to the same people through a reduction in taxes elsewhere, thus leaving incomes unchanged but ensuring that the price incentive bears down on people&#039;s behaviour.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to have this Adjournment debate tonight and I also wish to record my gratitude to the usual channels on the Government side who ensured that I knew that I had to be here somewhat earlier than I might have predicted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_409">I am raising this matter tonight because it is an extremely grave one for the 36&nbsp;Engineer Regiment and for the town that I represent. It is an irony that 19&nbsp;years ago I had to fight exactly the same battle when it was proposed to move the regiment from Invicta barracks in Maidstone to, at that time, Thorney Island. It was a bleak prospect and the town and regiment rebelled. I am pleased to say that we secured a reversal of the policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_410">It would seem that yet again we are threatened with the removal of the 36&nbsp;Engineers from Maidstone. I am sure that the Minister will accept that it is very important that morale is kept as high as possible in an Army that is stretched as badly as it is at the moment. Part of the maintenance of good morale is ensuring that families are happy, especially when the forces have to serve overseas for any length of time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_411">The 36&nbsp;Engineers is a sapper regiment, so almost by definition it spends a large amount of time abroad and has one of the highest rates of separation from spouses and families in the entire Army. It is thus essential for recruitment and retention that the soldiers can go away feeling that their wives and families are happily integrated in the local community. In turn, the wives have considerable influence over whether their husbands decide to stay in the Army. It follows that if there is general unhappiness with the serving conditions, the soldiers will not give a particularly happy account to potential recruits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_412">In Maidstone, the 36&nbsp;Engineer Regiment is based near the centre of a large town, which offers not only good shops but extremely good schools, including the envied grammar schools, and many opportunities for wives to work. The Gaffney report described the regiment&#039;s relationship with the town as &quot;ideal&quot; for a major unit. It is. Super-barracks are no substitute. They would need to be built and maintained, and would be costly. The regiment currently enjoys the freedom of the town, and the citizens of Maidstone and the surrounding areas regard the Army with immense gratitude following its intervention, first, after the 1987&nbsp;wind storm when we had to clear roads urgently and, secondly, during the floods which, the Minister may recall, devastated parts of my constituency a few years ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_413">The Minister appears remarkably unmoved by all that, however. I shall quote from a recent letter from the Secretary of State for Defence. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;I should tell you that the Army is committed to consolidating its estate into fewer and larger sites. As a result, a singleton site such as Invicta Park Barracks will be kept under review for possible disposal in the longer term. I should stress that no specific time lines have been established for this process but the points you make regarding the presence of 36&nbsp;Engineer Regiment in the area will be taken into account.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_414">We should look at the context for that proposal to dispose of sites. On 21&nbsp;July 2004, the then Secretary of State for Defence announced to Parliament what he described as a &quot;radical change&quot; in the future force structure. Since 1997, the trained establishment has actually declined by about 6&nbsp;per cent. at a time when the reserve has fallen by nearly 68,000, including a fall of 20,000&nbsp;in the Territorials.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_415">The cuts make no sense at all, given what we require our armed services to do. We should have taken notice of the recent situation when we wanted both to deploy troops in Iraq and to keep them on standby during a firemen&#039;s strike. From talking to members of the 36&nbsp;Engineer Regiment, I know that that placed considerable strain not only on their resources but on the ingenuity necessary to manage both operations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para17">
<a name="stpa_416">The cuts should be reversed. We should be making sure that we have a properly manned force rather than a reduced one that is operating with a reduced reserve. In the last 12&nbsp;months, the outflow from the Army has exceeded the inflow by about 3,500, which led my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) to tell the Prime Minister that as our forces were so overstretched it was hardly the time to cut four battalions from the Army.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para18">
<a name="stpa_417">Since the last time we went round this course, that proud regiment has fought in both Gulf wars and has been involved in every other conflict. The Secretary of State for Defence has said that there is no specific time scale, but I think that he means by 2012, which is the time to which the Army is operating in considering the creation of super-barracks and the disposal of sites. Of course, 2012&nbsp;is a mere six years away. The loss of the regiment would be a severe loss to Maidstone. Although I appreciate that this is not the Minister&#039;s direct worry and that it is more properly the concern of the Deputy Prime Minister, it would be a very great worry to Maidstone if that site were replaced by development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para19">
<a name="stpa_418">Our infrastructure is already extremely pressured. We do not have enough water. We do not have sufficient roads. Our schools and certainly our health services are stretched and, of course, we have to face up to the huge extra developments being foisted on us by the Deputy Prime Minister. If we were also confronted by a major site, such as Invicta barracks, being covered by housing development, it would be a great deal more than Maidstone could stand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para20">
<a name="stpa_419">Quite apart from those worries, we want to keep the regiment in Maidstone, as we wanted to do in the late 1980s, when we faced the same threat of removal but for different reasons. We want to keep it because we are proud of it. We are particularly proud of the Gurkhas. We want to keep it, because it makes a major economic contribution to Maidstone and because we believe that we, in turn, provide the Army with a very good background against which troops can go abroad satisfied that their families are fully integrated into the local community. Our schools would be regretful if those children were suddenly to disappear to super-barracks somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para21">
<a name="stpa_420">The creation of vast Army sites is not a substitute for a major unit in close association with the town in which it is stationed. I ask the Minister to think again. It would be very optimistic of me to think that he would give me every reassurance that I have sought tonight, because 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that is rather unlikely, but I hope nevertheless that he will, at the very minimum, agree to visit the 36&nbsp;barracks at Invicta and talk to the officers and men and, of course, the Gurkhas who are involved there. I hope that he will also consent to hold conversations with Maidstone borough council about the impact on the town if that Army site is disposed of and the force sent elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-30_para22">
<a name="stpa_421">The 36&nbsp;Engineers have been associated with Maidstone for more than 60&nbsp;years&#151;a long association that has been fruitful both for the regiment and, indeed, for the town. I therefore very much hope that some singleton sites will not be disposed of&#151;a few must survive&#151;and I should be grateful to the Government if Invicta barracks were among the few that survive.

<p><a name="st_247"><a name="60322-31_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 I congratulate the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) on securing this debate and providing me with the opportunity to speak on the issue. I did not know that in the past an attempt was made to close the barracks. I was not advised of that, but it is now received wisdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_422">We are now attending to the reorganisation and better definition of our armed forces because previous Administrations did not seize the reality. They did not face up to the harsh choices that had to be made in restructuring the Army overall. I do not necessarily comment on Invicta barracks in saying that, because I do not know the details of what happened at that time, but we are addressing the problems of that legacy. That is not driven by cuts or financial imperatives, but because the Army and the chiefs of staff have determined that there is a better way to organise the armed forces. That is what we laid down both in the future infantry structure and the future Army structure generally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_423">I pay tribute to the right hon. Lady for the interest and support that she has shown for 36&nbsp;Engineer Regiment at Invicta Park barracks and, more generally, the Gurkhas, which she mentioned&#151;

<p><a name="st_248"><a name="60322-31_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I take it that my words will still be on the record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_426">I was congratulating the right hon. Lady on her deep interest. When I asked those who were briefing me how closely engaged she was, I was told that she is a very good friend of the regiment. We value such close engagement of Members of Parliament and their local Ministry of Defence interests, whether they are military or civilian, or, indeed, both. I also know that she has the best interests of the regiment, the Gurkhas and her constituents at heart.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_427">As the right hon. Lady knows, the Royal Engineers has a considerable and noble history. Its construction activities are as relevant today as they have ever been. Recent events have seen Royal Engineers soldiers providing disaster relief and humanitarian assistance to the earthquake victims in Pakistan. A small team of sappers has been involved in bringing fresh water to the

<br>&nbsp;<br>villages of Kpalusogu and Koshibu in northern Ghana. I recently visited Ghana to open the second phase of an internationally supported peacekeeping training centre and was briefed on the work done by Royal Engineers personnel in Ghana and the contribution they were making. They were performing a non-military role in one sense, but clearly building on the defence diplomacy that is essential to keep our partners and allies supportive of us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_428">Such innovation has continued through to the present day, and 36&nbsp;Engineer Regiment, in particular, should be proud of its contribution. Today, soldiers from 36&nbsp;Engineer Regiment serve all over the world in Iraq, Afghanistan, Belize, Norway, Gibraltar, Kenya, Brunei, the Balkans, Nepal, Cyprus and Canada, as well as Northern Ireland. I am really grateful for the part that 36&nbsp;Engineer Regiment played at the beginning of current operations in Iraq and subsequently in two further squadron deployments. The entire regiment was deployed for the initial conflict phase of operations. I pay tribute to the men and women of 36&nbsp;Engineer Regiment, who truly show what it means to be part of the best trained and most professional Army in the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_429">The regiment has developed a significant attachment to its current home, Invicta Park. Its links with Invicta Park stretch back to 1949, when it was stationed there for two years. It moved away for eight years&#151;first to Ripon and then to Osnabruck&#151;only to return in 1959, since when Invicta Park has remained its home. I recognise the importance of the historical connection and the links that have been developed with the local community. I also recognise the need for our soldiers&#151;those brave men and women&#151;to have decent homes. It should be noted that over the past five years we have spent around &#163;2&nbsp;million on maintenance, upkeep and improvements to Invicta Park.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_430">Contrary to the somewhat unhelpful speculation in the local media, there are no plans to close the Invicta Park site. The right hon. Lady correctly referred to the letter that she received from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that observed that the Army is examining the possibilities for consolidating its estate into fewer and larger sites in line with the Defence Estates strategy of developing and rationalising the MOD&#039;s estate holdings. The logic of doing that must be sound. The armed forces must examine their real estate and its quality all the time. It must examine the prospect of building new facilities&#151;super-garrisons, if that is how they are to be described&#151;for our personnel. If that means that we must examine the existing estate and determine what can be realised by way of assets, it is a sound approach. It is nothing new. It has been the consistent approach of previous Governments. We are, admittedly, taking another big step forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_431">Again, the logic of looking at disparate barrack sites is sound. An estate that is spread out costs a lot of money to maintain. The purpose is to get money to the front line. The armed forces benefit greatly from close community links. We very much value looking after personnel in the ways that we do in the areas that we are in, but it is an imperative of the Ministry of Defence to rationalise and get the best use of the taxpayer&#039;s pound, and to ensure that it is invested in equipment and support for the front line. Those are difficult equations to balance, because there are many aspects to consider.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_432">I do not want to make a party political point, but a decision was made in the 1990s not to invest in real estate. There is now a massive catch-up, the scale of which is truly phenomenal. We are already committing about &#163;1&nbsp;billion over the foreseeable number of years to complete that catch-up, although a lot of the estate has not been maintained, no new build has taken place and large parts of it were sold off. The assets realised from the sums that were received when the right hon. Lady was a member of the Government did not all come back to defence. We are operating on the basis that all the rationalisation and efficiency measures will be retained for the defence purposes that I mentioned. A qualitative change has taken place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_433">The point of building new super-garrisons is to give greater continuity to people overall and to provide them with better accommodation, probably on new sites, although sometimes existing sites will be developed. They will allow people to integrate properly with the civil community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_434">The right hon. Lady mentioned how our armed forces are stretched and the pressure that they, and in particular the Royal Engineers, are under. I recognise that. It is one reason why we have defined the new way forward in terms of the future Army structure. As a result of rebalancing, 2,400&nbsp;posts have been reallocated to what would be defined as the key enablers. Engineers fall into that category. We understand that we have put a huge strain on those key enablers, and the Royal Engineers have been part of that. We are therefore reinvesting 2,400&nbsp;posts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_435">The right hon. Lady also mentioned in passing the important role of the TA. I do not want to get into the detail of that, because I am due to announce shortly our approach to TA rebalancing. However, the Royal Engineers will benefit from that as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_436">We cannot achieve everything overnight. It takes time. We have to let things grow. However, we are on the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60322-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_437">We have not established firm timelines for the work on which we have embarked. There is no particular focus on Invicta Park. It is not as though a work stream is saying, &quot;Let&#039;s look particularly at a range of barracks, of which Invicta Park will be one.&quot; Nothing is in the machine at this stage and nothing is immediately coming over the horizon. That is why I say that the speculation about the threat to Invicta Park is a bit premature. I do not deny the right hon. Lady her entitlement to raise the subject and to take the arguments forward. I would do the same in her position. However, Invicta Park is in the same position as other barracks of equivalent size on the Army estate and no plans to relocate 36&nbsp;Engineer Regiment are on the stocks.

We have invested over recent years and we are looking at ways in which we can invest to meet our commitments under the Gurkha married accompanied service rules. The Government have taken a major step forward and we are having to address some very important issues about the Gurkhas who are based at Invicta Park. I have set out to make it clear that there are no plans that put Invicta Park under immediate threat, and there are no timelines. At one point, there was a timeline of 2012, but that no longer applies, and for a very good reason: funding. It takes a lot to invest in infrastructure, and when we are doing so we are not investing in equipment and personnel. We must balance the priorities across the various resources.

Investment is going on and will go on for the Gurkhas once we can find the resource allocation to enable it.
