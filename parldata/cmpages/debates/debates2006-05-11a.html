 (Lab): What recent progress has been made towards reaching the Lisbon agenda benchmarks. [69704]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60511-01_spmin0"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 Britain is leading economic reform in Europe. We are calling for the opening up of competition in utilities, energy and services, with new legal powers of investigation and enforcement where there are restrictions to competition. Britain will continue to match reform with pay discipline in the public sector. The official figures published today show that production is up 0.8 per cent. on the last quarter, and yesterday&#039;s bank report shows that inflation is on target. British growth is strong, strengthening and will strengthen even more in the months to come.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60511-01_spnew0"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 I thank the Chancellor for that answer. On Monday the European Commission revised its economic growth estimates from 2.1 to 2.3 per cent. According to the Centre for European Reform, the United Kingdom is now top of all the big EU countries in terms of the Lisbon benchmarks. France is eighth, Germany 10th and Italy 23rd. What steps is the Chancellor proposing to take to encourage our European partners to follow Britain&#039;s excellent example in vigorously pursuing the Lisbon agenda?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60511-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who was Minister for Europe when the Lisbon reform agenda was agreed. It is important to recognise that in the next few months we must make progress on energy liberalisation. The cost of the absence of liberalisation has been a &#8364;40 billion extra bill for consumers in Europe over the last

<br>&nbsp;<br>year&#151;&#163;10 billion for British consumers. That is why it is important not only that there is a timetable, which has been agreed, and the investigation into what happened over gas prices, which Britain proposed and has been agreed, but that we have new powers of enforcement as well as investigation where there are restrictions to competition. We will continue to pursue this agenda of reform in Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">My hon. Friend mentioned that the growth figures for Germany, France, Italy and other euro countries were forecast over the last few days by the European Commission. I remind the House that growth in Britain has been faster than almost all those other countries in each year since 1997 and continues to be faster this year, despite allegations made by the Opposition.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60511-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Michael Fallon  (Sevenoaks)</b> 
 (Con): If the Lisbon agenda is about improving European competitiveness, why has this Chancellor increased the burden of tax and regulation on the British economy? He talks about a timetable. Is it not time that we had a firm timetable for an orderly transition to a new Chancellor who can reduce the burden, or must we wait for a Conservative one?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60511-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I thought that this morning the hon. Gentleman would quote the report of the Heritage Foundation of the United States of America, which says that we are a less regulated and more liberal economy than when his Government were in power in 1997. As for the Lisbon reform agenda, where the emphasis is on the creation of jobs as well as on competitiveness, let me say that unemployment has fallen by 55 per cent. in his constituency since we came to power.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60511-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. John McFall  (West Dunbartonshire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): The Chancellor will know that the Lisbon target was for average economic growth of 3 per cent. My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) indicated that we are far from that. Can the Chancellor spread the idea that if we do not respond together on the issue of globalisation and particularise India and China, the future for Europe will be bleak? What policies does he have to ensure that that challenge to globalisation is met by the European Union?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60511-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 It is because of the challenge of China, India and Asia, and because we appreciate that there is a shift taking place in both production and services around the world, that we believe that open markets and free trade should be combined with investment in science, technology and the creative industries for the future, and that we should aim to be the best educated, skilled and trained work force in the world. At the same time, we must aim to ensure that work pays for families in Britain as in the rest of Europe, which is why we have a child tax credit policy as well as a new deal for employment. Child tax credit has done more to take children out of poverty than any policy since the second world war.

<a name="60511-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">How does he reconcile that commitment with the striking conclusions of the Treasury Select Committee, which are summarised in a remarkable graphic, that while the Government have made welcome progress in cutting extreme marginal tax rates, the number of workers who now pay marginal tax withdrawal rates of 60 to 70 per cent. has doubled to almost 2 million under his stewardship?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60511-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 When we came to power, because of the way the family credit system worked, people had marginal tax rates of above 100 per cent. Thousands of people had marginal tax rates of above 90 per cent. and 80 per cent. We have eliminated those marginal tax rates, and the hon. Gentleman should give us credit for that. <i>[Interruption.]</i> We have eliminated marginal tax rates above 100 per cent. and 90 per cent., as I said. Has the hon. Gentleman also seen the report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which says that for the average family with two children the effective tax rate for the average earner has fallen from 17 per cent. to 8 per cent. during the course of the Government? That shows that, not only are we relieving child poverty but, by introducing tax credits and a 10p income tax rate and reducing the basic rate of income tax from 23p to 22p, we have been able to help the very people he is talking about. If the hon. Gentleman really wants to have a sensible economic policy, perhaps he will start looking at the changes that he needs to make in his own.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60511-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend should look at the pamphlet that the Treasury produced in the last few days on the need to respond to global economic change by combining open markets and free trade with investment in science, infrastructure and education. That is the way forward for advanced industrial economies to deal with the problems of the global economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">In the last year, in America, Japan and Europe, 1 million manufacturing jobs have been lost. A quarter of a million service jobs have been offshored. As a result of the rise of China and India, 30 per cent. of the demand for oil now comes from China, and that is one of the reasons why the oil price is rising. We need to respond to Asian competition by combining open markets and free trade with sensible and prudent investment in education, infrastructure, transport and science. It is unfortunate that the Conservative party wants to cut the very investments that should be made.

<br>&nbsp;<br>growing more slowly than the world average, the OECD average and 18 other European Union member states. Disposable incomes growth is stalling and, according to the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), poverty has become more entrenched. Is his former Cabinet colleague right about that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60511-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 This is the very shadow Chancellor who congratulated me on Labour&#039;s success on macro-economic policy. Let me just tell him that disposable income is rising; he only needs to look at the Bank of England inflation report yesterday to see that that is happening. In terms of growth, if he looks at the comparisons that we should make between Germany, France and Italy&#151;the euro area&#151;it is absolutely true that British economic growth is rising this year faster than in those countries and rose last year faster than in those countries. Why does he criticise us for a high level of growth when the growth rate on average under the Conservatives was substantially less? The tragedy is that under the Conservatives we had less growth, higher inflation and higher unemployment, as well as greater poverty. How can his policies, which are the same as the policies of the past, begin to change those things?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60511-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Osborne: </b> 
 I was asking the Chancellor about the views of the right hon. Member for Darlington, who I thought was a great friend of his, but he did not address that point. The right hon. Gentleman is not the only one who is critical of the Chancellor&#039;s performance. The World Economic Forum says that we are becoming less competitive.

<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60511-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 Growth is higher. Employment is 125,000 higher than last year. We are meeting our inflation target. Interest rates are half what they were. I do not think that the shadow Chancellor should be dining out on the idea that the British economy is falling apart under Labour. We have a more stable economy, higher investment and higher employment. If the shadow Chancellor does not believe that, why was he telling people only a few months ago that Labour had been successful at establishing economic credibility and had improved the macroeconomic management of the economy, and that too often the Conservatives had sacrificed long-term economic credibility for short-term gestures? He should look again at his own statements.

<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60511-02_spnew2"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The tax exemption was removed because it was poorly targeted and did not achieve the goal of encouraging people to develop skills. The Low Pay Commission reported that people on low pay or out of work could not get access to the scheme. Also, the scheme was being misused: people provided with the exemption used it to buy computer, home video and other equipment, but that was not what it was designed for. If the hon. Gentleman is seriously suggesting that the Government should spend money on poorly targeted and abused schemes instead of targeting such initiatives on those who need them most, he must tell us why.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60511-02_spnew4"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 No, there is no alternative. Unfortunately, the creativity of those seeking to provide equipment in a way not originally intended by the provision was growing all the time and needed to be stopped. My hon. Friend makes an important point about how the scheme assisted his constituents, and that is precisely why the Government are refocusing on their digital strategy. I am the Minister in charge of this matter, and he is very welcome to submit his views and those of his constituents to me. They will be taken into consideration in the review.

Most people realise that when America, the euro area, Japan and even China are putting up interest rates, Britain has by comparison managed to keep both low inflation and higher growth in the economy.

 The Natural Environment Research Council has reviewed its strategy in light of scientific priorities and financial sustainability. Following public consultation and given the centre&#039;s reducing external income, the council has announced a restructuring. That does not affect the Lyons programme, which is on track to relocate 20,000 civil service posts from London and the south-east by 2010.

<p><a name="st_o42"><a name="60511-03_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Moon: </b> 
 The closure of the three sites of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology by the NERC makes no economic sense. The transitional costs of &#163;45 million over four years will save only &#163;2 million a year.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o43"><a name="60511-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The centre will continue to have an important role in the areas to which my hon. Friend rightly draws attention. The reorganisation will release about &#163;5 million a year for the priorities of the NERC, including work on the impact of aerosols on climate change and the possible shutdown of the north Atlantic current. In this case, there was quite rigorous peer review and wide consultation before the decision was made. It is right for the independent council&#151;the NERC&#151;to decide how best to use its resources.

 I am grateful to the hon.

</p>


<p><a name="st_o49"><a name="60511-03_spmin1"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 Overpayments are a consequence of a responsive system, under an annual system. Given that a family&#039;s final entitlement cannot be known until the end of the year, some end-year adjustment will be necessary. Such adjustments could be avoided only by moving to an entirely fixed system. The 2005 pre-Budget report announced a series of measures to improve tax credits that would reduce overpayments by about a third once they are fully in effect. Overpayments amounted to &#163;2.2 billion in 2003&#150;04. The Public Accounts Committee announced on 25 April that Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs estimates that the figure will be similar in 2004&#150;05, and national statistics on tax credit overpayments for 2004&#150;05 will be published on 31 May.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o50"><a name="60511-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Evennett: </b> 
 I thank the Paymaster General for her reply. The Chancellor said that tax credits are both symbol and substance of the Government&#039;s ambition for Britain. Is it not therefore appalling that the administration of tax credits has been so shambolic and that the recovery of overpayments has forced many people below the bread line and into mounting debt?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o51"><a name="60511-03_spnew8"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is completely wrong on that, and he needs to ask the thousands of families in his constituency who are benefiting from tax credits. Some 700,000 children have been lifted out of poverty since 1998&#150;99. Four in 10 families now pay no net tax, as a result of tax credits. Families are helped with child care. Families are supported in building on their affluence by changing jobs and increasing their hours. Tax credits are a fundamental part of supporting families in a flexible way, and if the hon. Gentleman is proposing to take them away from his constituents, he will hear a very different story from them.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_o52"><a name="60511-03_spnew9"><b> Jeremy Wright: </b> 
 The Paymaster General will be aware that a substantial number of the overpayments are due to official error. In those cases, claimants are expected to identify and challenge the error if they want to avoid repaying the money. She will also accept that there are many cases where the claimant receives a large number of award notices, all of them different, and that task can be extremely difficult. Why should tax credit recipients, who have done nothing wrong, spend so much time correcting the Government&#039;s mistakes?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o53"><a name="60511-03_spnew10"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 It is indicative, if I can remind the hon. Gentleman, that about 10,500 families in his constituency receive tax credits and that the vast majority of them are receiving their tax credits at the right time and correctly. He will know&#151;I have already said this in an answer to him, but I am happy to send the details&#151;that the question of error and whether it is reasonable to expect the claimant to notice the error is a matter for the procedures used by HMRC, which are well publicised and were repeated in the PBR in 2005.

 (Lab): When the Minister gave evidence to the Treasury Committee in February, she suggested that she might be thinking of placing HMRC staff in citizens advice bureaux to run specialist advice surgeries on tax credits. Will she update us as to where we are with those proposals? At the risk of exposing her to a conflict of interest, may I suggest that Bristol would be an ideal place for a pilot?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="60511-03_spnew12"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I could not possibly comment on whether Bristol would be a sensible place for a pilot. Areas of work between the department and the citizens advice bureau are continuing to develop. Tax credit staff can be in citizens advice bureaux, citizens advice bureaux can have access to hotlines and special advice for their staff, and can be located in the department&#039;s inquiry centres to assist constituents who require that more detailed assistance from the citizens advice bureau.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o56"><a name="60511-03_spnew13"><b> Ms Sally Keeble  (Northampton, North)</b> 
 (Lab): From what I have seen, the Inland Revenue staff have worked extremely well to take up and deal with complaints and problems relating to the tax credit system and I welcome the changes that were announced. In the case of the child care tax credit, will the Paymaster General say whether she would be prepared to look at an amnesty or some changes in relation to overpayments? The benefits are important and generous and have helped women. However, because the system is generous, if there are overpayments, they tend to be quite high.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o57"><a name="60511-03_spnew14"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend will know, the same regulations and procedure with regard to overpayments apply if there has been an overpayment of the child care element. Yes, of course, I am open to suggestions about how to improve the process&#151;bearing in mind the need to maintain flexibility, provide certainty and make sure that the tax credits respond to the changing needs of families and the income in those families. If she has suggestions that she would like to put to me, I would be happy to consider them.

<p><a name="st_o59"><a name="60511-03_spnew16"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Six million families are claiming tax credits and some 10 million children in those families are benefiting. We are paying out something like &#163;15 billion-worth of support to them. If the hon.

Finally, I wish that he would stop running down the staff of HMRC and tax credits by saying that the system is in chaos when it certainly is not.

 (Lab): The tax credits have been a major success of this Government and have assisted in lifting hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty. However, we would be remiss if we were not concerned about parents who receive overpayments and suffer some hardship in making repayments. Judging by my casework, it seems that they come up against bureaucracy. Is there any way in which we can allocate specific caseworkers to families to assist them in taking their case through to a swift conclusion? Some of the problems are caused by the length of time that people are forced to wait for the payments to be sorted out.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o61"><a name="60511-03_spnew18"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will know that I have announced a number of changes&#151;both last May and in the pre-Budget report in 2005&#151;to improve the system. Those improvements are progressing. If he has further suggestions, I will certainly consider them, but I remind Members that tax credits have been the most successful element of raising children out of poverty, supporting families and helping them to move into work. A flexible system gives the best result and that is what we need to preserve.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o62"><a name="60511-03_spnew19"><b> Mr. Paul Goodman  (Wycombe)</b> 
 (Con): Talking of running down the tax credit system, the Paymaster General may have read a recent report by the Fabian Society that said that tax credits were associated with &quot;complexity and administrative problems&quot;, that they posed &quot;risks&quot; for low-income families and that they were &quot;perceived negatively&quot; by many families. The report was welcomed as &quot;very important&quot; by a very important person: the new Economic Secretary to the Treasury, whom we welcome to his post. Indeed, we read that he actually helped to launch the report. Is it not significant that criticisms of the system made by Conservative Members and echoed by others are now shared by the second most important member of the Treasury team?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o63"><a name="60511-03_spnew20"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman misrepresents the views of the Fabians&#151;I cannot think why he might want to do that. He knows full well that the report first contained statements of support for tax credits and noted the contribution that they have made, especially to lifting children out of poverty. Secondly, the society raised various questions about whether or not tax credits and child benefit should be combined. That argument is a matter for the society, but it certainly did not run down tax credits or say that they should be abolished.

<a name="stpa_o12">I can confirm that the adult minimum wage will rise this October from &#163;5.05 an hour to &#163;5.35. The Low Pay Commission monitors its impact on employment levels, and employment has risen, since its introduction in 1999, by just over 1.7 million jobs.

<p><a name="st_o67"><a name="60511-04_spnew2"><b> Ed Balls: </b> 
 My hon. Friend, who has a fine record of campaigning for both a national minimum wage and a return to full employment, is absolutely right. The experience that she describes in her constituency is reflected in constituencies throughout the country. Thousands of families are benefiting, and 1.3 million families are better off. Two thirds of the people who are benefiting are women, and that is alongside record levels of employment. Some said that the minimum wage would cost jobs, but we have proved them wrong.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o69"><a name="60511-04_spnew4"><b> Ed Balls: </b> 
 That is exactly why we introduced the new deal to get people back to work and new investment to improve skills. We combined that with measures to boost people&#039;s incomes and introduced the minimum wage and tax credits to make work pay. Abolishing the minimum wage and tax credits would take Britain backwards, not forwards.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o71"><a name="60511-04_spnew6"><b> Ed Balls: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right that a combination of the minimum wage and tax credits has 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>been responsible for the substantial boosts to income that we have seen. Let me give some examples. A family with one child has seen its weekly income go from &#163;182 a week to &#163;268 a week, which is a 23 per cent. rise. A family with two children on half-average earnings is better off by &#163;3,500 a year as a result of that combination. If we were to go backwards by abolishing the minimum wage or tax credits, we would have both rising poverty and poverty pay in the workplace, which would be the wrong thing for our country.

<p><a name="st_o73"><a name="60511-04_spnew8"><b> Ed Balls: </b> 
 Despite that proposal, I understand that when the hon. Gentleman was a member of the Committee that considered the National Minimum Wage Bill he opposed the minimum wage at every stage. The Low Pay Commission is responsible for monitoring the minimum wage, its impact and all the details, and I am sure that it has looked at that suggestion. As for employers who are trying to make payments below the minimum wage, that is exactly the wrong thing to do. I saw in this morning&#039;s newspapers the comments by Mr. Worrall Thompson, who said that it would be a good idea to abolish the minimum wage for restaurant workers in London.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. In his constituency, as in all constituencies, the minimum wage has had a substantial impact.

With regard to the obligation, its terms will lead the design of the new measure and determine the draft legislation and regulations that will be required to put it into place. It represents some of the important policy work which I explained to the House a moment ago, to make sure that we have in place the carbon assurance schemes that will mean that we get the maximum environmental benefit from the measure in the future.

 Our progress has been excellent, and we are on track for our target of more than &#163;20 billion-worth of efficiency gains by 2008.

 The National Audit Office has stated that the biggest risk with Gershon efficiency savings is that they will be accompanied by an unintended fall in the quality of public service production.

 I have not seen that report, but I agree with my hon. Friend&#039;s point about the benefits of maximising collection. The key reason for the success of our efficiency programme has been the new stability in the public finances that the Government have achieved. That meant that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor was able in the Budget to tell the Department for Work and Pensions, the Home Office, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office how much they will have to spend in five years&#039; time. That is a remarkable change from what used to happen in the past. The more that local authorities are able to be confident about the resources that they will have in future, the better able they will be to plan, to be more efficient, and to continue to make the gains that we have seen. That was never possible before, given the instability created by the policies of the previous Government. It is vital that we lock that stability in as the economy gains momentum.

 Of course. Indeed, we have had means-testing of pensioner incomes in the UK since 1908. The Turner report rightly points out that a large and unpredictable future expansion of means-testing would be a problem, but the commission was right to support pension credit because of its success in reducing pensioner poverty. In 1997, 27 per cent. of pensioners 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 493</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>were below the poverty line. Since then, the poverty line has been uprated in line with earnings, but the number below it has fallen to 17 per cent. That is a reduction of 1 million in the number of pensioners below the poverty line. Half of that reduction followed the introduction of pension credit in 2003. I understand that nowadays the hon.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. The Department for Work and Pensions has done a good deal of work on that and we, too, have been in discussions about it. Approximately 2.7 million households receive pension credit. That number has increased substantially since the introduction of pension credit in 2003 and the Pension Service is taking effective steps to increase take-up further. However, my hon.

<p>
<a name="60511-05_para2">

 Yes, I remember the debates on London. There is insufficient time for all the debates requested. There is also an issue about how long the House wants to sit and whether it wants to sit on a Friday. That is not a problem for me, but it may be for other Members.

 I, too, welcome my right hon. Friend to his new role. I assume that this week he saw the announcement from the Health Minister about the intention to bring maximum waiting times down to 18 weeks by 2008. I was, however, slightly concerned to read from the Royal National Institute for Deaf People that the 18-week waiting time will not apply to hearing services. That is bad news for people who are applying for a digital hearing aid, particularly the hardest of hearing who currently have an analogue hearing aid, and so go to the bottom of the queue when applying for a digital hearing aid. Could he arrange for a debate in this House on those matters, to give credit to the Government for getting waiting times down to 18 weeks, and to look at whether we can extend that to hearing services?

 Health questions take place on Tuesday and that is the appropriate time to pursue the matter. I am glad my hon. Friend mentioned all the improvements in the health service that have taken place under this Government. One of the many reasons why I am so pleased to do this job is that it gives me an opportunity to talk about the Government&#039;s record and the dramatic way in which we have improved the health service. Yes, there are problems and there will always be problems. Now we have 85,000 more nurses, 32,000 more doctors and a huge increase in investment. As everybody knows, that benefits every constituency. Notwithstanding some of the problems, there have been dramatic improvements in the health care being delivered. It is a testament to the success of our policies. Just to mention Blackburn once again&#151;I spent 18 years in Opposition, receiving letters from Health Ministers saying that they would provide us with money for a new hospital; the only problem was that the cheque never came. My right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) ensured that the cheque was delivered within a year of Labour taking office, and that &#163;140 million hospital is now close to completion.

 We have always accepted that there needs to be special provision for the isles, and I will ensure that that particular point is pursued with my right hon.

I, too, have looked into this, and there are two reasons why the BBC&#151;not the Government&#151;decided to let the contract to a private company rather than to the Post Office. First, it estimated that tens of millions of pounds would be saved from the costs of collection, which could be spent on programming. Secondly, it wished to see a new system of collection of the television licence fee, which had more, not fewer, points of sale, and could be used on Sundays and at night. I gather that the new system will provide that.

<a name="time_2">
<a name="60511-10_time0"><h5>12.17 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_60"><a name="60511-10_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department  (John Reid): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the 7 July bombings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_48">I am today publishing the official account on the bombings in London on 7 July last year. Also today the report of the Intelligence and Security Committee into intelligence aspects of the bombings has been published, together with the Government&#039;s response. I very much regret the sombre nature of my first statement to the House as Home Secretary. I send my condolences, as the new Home Secretary, to all those who suffered in those events and I pay tribute to the work done by my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_49">The official account published today summarises what we know about the bombers and how and why they did what they did. It is not yet a complete picture, both because we have had to withhold some information for legal and security reasons and because the police investigation is continuing and we may discover more. It will be for the legal process to confirm formally what happened, but as is now well known, there were four suicide attacks carried out by four British citizens. Mohammad Sidique Khan, Shehzad Tanweer, Jermaine Lindsay and Hasib Hussain. Those attacks killed 52 people over and above the bombers themselves and injured over 700.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_50">The first three bombs went off simultaneously at 8.50 am on the underground. The first, in a Circle line tunnel between Liverpool Street and Aldgate stations, was carried out by Tanweer and killed seven people and injured 171. The second, on the Circle line just outside Edgware Road, was carried out by Khan and killed six people and injured 163. The third, on the Piccadilly line between King&#039;s Cross and Russell Square, was carried out by Lindsay and killed 26 and injured over 340.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_51">Just under an hour later at 9.47 am, Hussain detonated the fourth device on a No. 30 bus in Tavistock square. This killed 13 and injured over 110. It remains unclear why Hussain did not detonate his bomb at the same time as the others. It may be that he was frustrated by delays on the underground heading north from King&#039;s Cross. However, it now appears that he bought a battery after coming out of the underground system, which could mean that he had difficulty detonating the device earlier. But I stress that this remains speculation at this point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_52">We now know from CCTV footage and witness statements that Khan, Tanweer, and Hussain travelled down from Leeds in a hire car that morning and met up with Lindsay in Luton station car park. Further devices were found in one of the cars which may have been for self-defence or diversion in case of interception during the journey down. They do not appear to indicate a fifth bomber and there is no evidence to suggest this elsewhere. The four then travelled from Luton to King&#039;s Cross, leaving at 7.40 am and arriving at 8.23 am.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_53">Owing to some outstanding police and security service work in the immediate aftermath of the bombings, the police were able publicly to confirm the identities of Tanweer and Hussain on 14 July and Khan 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 511</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and Lindsay on 16 July. The key factors leading them to this were finding credit and other cards in the names of the four at the sites&#151;in Khan&#039;s case his cards were found at more than one site&#151;Hussain&#039;s family calling the police emergency hotline reporting him missing, and subsequently discovering that he had travelled to London with Khan and Tanweer; the discovery by the security service that Khan, and subsequently Tanweer, had been picked up on the periphery of another investigation; the CCTV images of four men with rucksacks matching their descriptions at King&#039;s Cross and Luton; and the discovery of the two cars in Luton car park.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_54">Khan, Tanweer and Hussain were all second-generation British citizens of Pakistani origin from the same small area of Leeds. Lindsay was a British citizen of Jamaican origin who had grown up in Huddersfield and moved to Aylesbury after his marriage. Khan was a well-respected teaching assistant and youth worker, aged 30 at the time of the bombings. Tanweer, who was just 22, had recently left university. Hussain was only 18 and had just completed sixth form college, and Lindsay, who was 19, had left school and had a series of odd jobs thereafter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_55">The account which is published today sets out what we know about their early lives and how they may have been radicalised. The picture remains incomplete at this stage, but, with the partial exception of Lindsay, there is little that marks them out as particularly vulnerable to radicalisation and little in their subsequent behaviour which could have given much indication to those around them of their intentions. It is not yet known whether others in the UK were involved in indoctrinating the group or helping them to plan, but Lindsay appears to have been influenced by an extremist preacher who is now serving a prison sentence. Their motivation appears to have been a mixture of anger at perceived injustices by the west against Muslims and a desire for martyrdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_56">The account that we publish today also details what we know about influence from abroad. Khan is known to have made a number of trips to Pakistan, including one in July 2003 when he is believed to have had some relevant training. Khan and Tanweer travelled together to Pakistan between November 2004 and February 2005 and are assessed as likely to have met al-Qaeda figures during this visit. There were a series of suspicious contacts from an unknown individual or individuals in Pakistan in the immediate run-up to the bombings. We do not know their content. Al-Qaeda has claimed responsibility for launching the attacks, but the extent of its involvement is unclear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para12">
<a name="stpa_57">Shortly after the second Pakistan trip&#151;the trip from November 2004 to February 2005&#151;the group appear to have begun planning in earnest. They appear to have assembled the devices at 18 Alexandra grove, a flat in another part of Leeds. As far as experts can establish, the bombs were made with ingredients that are readily commercially available, and to have required only limited expertise to assemble. The operation appears to have been self-financed and the cash raised by methods that would be extremely difficult to identify as related to terrorism or other serious criminality. Our best estimate is that the operation cost less than &#163;8,000 overall.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 512</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para13">
<a name="stpa_58">The account published today does not address the emergency response, but it is right that I should place on record my thanks and admiration for the bravery of so many&#151;the police, those working on the underground, buses and trains, medical staff, firefighters, disaster recovery teams, volunteers and ordinary people, including and perhaps especially the survivors. The Government have separately conducted a lessons learned exercise addressing many aspects of the emergency response, and we will publish the results shortly. The London Assembly&#039;s inquiry, due to report soon, is also considering this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para14">
<a name="stpa_59">I now turn to the Intelligence and Security Committee report. The Committee is, of course, independent of Government, but it has had access to a wide range of highly classified documents. Its report assesses what was known prior to July, how the threat level and alert state systems operated, how the threat was assessed, and issues of coverage, resources and co-operation between the security and intelligence agencies and between the agencies and the police. The House will obviously wish to give it serious consideration. The Prime Minister has presented to Parliament today the Government&#039;s response to the report, which generally welcomes its conclusions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para15">
<a name="stpa_60">I know that my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), as Chairman of the Committee, has spoken in more detail about the report this morning, but I note first that the report sets out that the security service had come across two of the bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer, on the margins of other investigations. On the basis of what was then known, the security service made the judgement that they were peripheral to the main investigation and there was no intelligence to suggest that they were separately interested in planning an attack against the UK. Although limited attempts were made at that stage to identify the two men, the security service decided to concentrate its resources on higher priorities, including plots known at that time to attack the UK. The ISC report concludes that this decision was understandable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para16">
<a name="stpa_61">Secondly, the report concludes that it was not unreasonable to reduce the country threat level from &quot;severe general&quot; to &quot;substantial&quot; in May last year on the grounds that there was no intelligence of a current credible plot to attack the UK at that time. The term &quot;substantial&quot; still represented a high level of threat, and the report concludes that that reduction was unlikely to have altered the alertness of the responders or to have affected the chances of preventing the 7 July attacks. None the less, the Committee recommends changes to the system. The Government have reviewed it and will be making changes to create a simpler, more flexible and more proportionate system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para17">
<a name="stpa_62">The report makes a number of other useful recommendations, which we have addressed in the Government response. It also covers the issue of resourcing, which I will address in a moment. I am grateful to the Committee for its very thorough and constructive approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para18">
<a name="stpa_63">What the official account and the ISC report demonstrate is the very real challenge that the police and the agencies face in combating this new kind of terrorism. The bombers were ordinary British citizens 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 513</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with little known history of extremist views, far less of violent intention. At least three were apparently as well integrated as anyone else. Their radicalisation, to the extent that we know how and where it happened, appears to have been conducted away from places with any obvious association with extremism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para19">
<a name="stpa_64">The willingness of the men to use suicide bombing as their method and to attack vulnerable, civilian targets&#151;as is familiar from previous attacks&#151;made them doubly difficult to defend against. That is not a comfortable message, but it is important that we are honest about it if we are to defend ourselves against the threat effectively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para20">
<a name="stpa_65">The key lesson&#151;this is at the heart of the Government&#039;s counter-terrorist strategy&#151;is that the response needs to be collective, with Government, Parliament, police, agencies, local communities, faith leaders and international co-operation all playing their part, and that it needs to be completely comprehensive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para21">
<a name="stpa_66">We have a counter-terrorism strategy for achieving that, known as &quot;Contest&quot;, which aims to reduce the risk from international terrorism. As part of the strategy, we are seeking to prevent terrorism by stopping young people being indoctrinated into extremist violence. In that, we need the help of Muslim leaders and the community to fight the distortion of Islam that turns young people into terrorists. We have taken new powers to criminalise encouragement to terrorism. We need to work together to show that democracy is the only legitimate means of changing policies, and to ensure that all young people in all communities can see how engagement in British society can bring about change for the better. I know that my predecessor as Home Secretary led an extensive round of consultations with all sections of the Muslim community, and I intend to develop that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para22">
<a name="stpa_67">Secondly, we need an effective and adequately resourced law enforcement and intelligence effort. The ISC report suggests that we might have had a better chance of preventing the July attacks if more resources had been in place sooner. Even that, of course, would have been no guarantee of preventing the attack. The Government have put in substantially increased resources, particularly since 9/11. Further resources were provided last autumn. The Security Service is expanding as fast as its top management believes is organisationally possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para23">
<a name="stpa_68">The specific police budget for counter-terrorism will have grown fourfold between the financial years 2002&#150;03 and 2007&#150;08&#151;that is, in the period after 9/11. We have allocated &#163;30 million extra next year and &#163;60 million the year after to expand special branch and other specialist counter-terrorism capacity outside London. Indeed, the total cross-Government budget for counter terrorism and resilience has more than doubled, from less than &#163;1 billion to more than &#163;2 billion in the same period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para24">
<a name="stpa_69">In addition, general policing makes a significant contribution to the counter-terrorist effort. We will implement neighbourhood policing in all forces by next April and will expand the number of community support officers from around 6,500 to 16,000 in that period. That will improve our capacity to gather local intelligence to support the counter-terrorist element.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 514</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para25">
<a name="stpa_70">In that context, I want to put it on the record that the police and agencies have disrupted many attacks against the UK since 9/11, including three since last July alone. However, the reality is that difficult choices have to be made between priorities in intelligence-led operations, whatever the level of resources.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para26">
<a name="stpa_71">Thirdly, we need effective international co-operation. This is both a local and a global threat. We are a long way from being the only targets. As the House will know, there have been appalling attacks in the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and Indonesia, to name but a few. We need to have the closest possible law enforcement and intelligence links with our many allies in the war against global terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para27">
<a name="stpa_72">We also need rapidly to develop European co-operation. The former Home Secretary made that his key priority for the UK presidency last year. He achieved important concrete outcomes, including common provisions on the retention of telecommunications data that will make it more difficult for terrorists to communicate across borders to plan their crimes. I will make it a major priority of mine to develop that co-operation further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para28">
<a name="stpa_73">The bombings were despicable attacks on ordinary people going about their normal daily business. It is a tribute to Londoners&#151;the people of our capital city&#151;that the city recovered with such remarkable speed. The victims have shown tremendous courage in rebuilding their lives, but I know that many victims, and particularly bereaved families, are still trying to find their own way to come to terms with what, for them, was a terrible personal tragedy. I think that it is right that we try to explain what the Government know about what happened that day, and I hope that many of the victims will find the account that we have published today helpful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para29">
<a name="stpa_74">I know that some will find it painful to relive those terrible events again, and that some will continue to feel that there should be a public inquiry. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport is responsible for supporting victims. In the short period that I have been Home Secretary, and before that, she has explained to me the strong views that some of the families hold on that subject. I find that perfectly understandable, but the House will know that my predecessor as Home Secretary explained last year why the Government had decided that it was not right to hold such an inquiry, a decision with which I concur. However, I should like to offer some further explanation to those most directly affected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-10_para30">
<a name="stpa_75">I shall therefore be writing to all those who were bereaved by the 7 July attacks to offer them the chance to come and talk the issue through. I and my right hon. Friend the Culture Secretary will convene a series of meetings, at which families will be able to ask detailed questions about the documents that have been published today. At those meetings, I hope that I will be able to explain to them why I do not think a public inquiry would be the best step to take. Not least among the reasons is that such an inquiry would involve diverting very precious resources needed for the security and protection of everyone, at a critical time.
</p>

<p>

 I welcome the Home Secretary to his new post and am sorry that his first outing is on such a tragic subject. I join him in offering our condolences to those who suffered in the attacks and our thanks to and admiration for those whose bravery and commitment on the day and afterwards saved so many lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_77">The issue before us is, as the Home Secretary implied, of great importance. The attacks in London on 7 July and 21 July were attacks on our people, our country and our way of life. Accordingly, our ability to deal with such attacks and to learn from our errors is critical to the defence of the realm, our people and our way of life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_78">It is important to start by acknowledging the real strengths of our security services, which have thwarted a significant number of attacks. For that, the whole House thanks and congratulates them. However, it will not serve them or the safety of the British public if we do not learn from the mistakes made in these cases, the better to prevent them in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_79">During the attack and in the immediate aftermath, the Government claimed that the bombers were previously unknown to the authorities, because they had no record of previous criminal or terrorist activity. We now know that that is untrue. Both Sidique Khan and Shezad Tanweer were known to the authorities in connection with another very serious terrorist bomb plot. On the basis of accounts in the newspapers, rather than the reports, it appears that Shezad Tanweer was picked up by a foreign intelligence agency one month before the attack, but that that information was never acted on by the UK security services, so I ask the Home Secretary whether that is true. Again on the basis of documentation given to newspapers rather than these reports, it seems that MI5 taped Mohammad Sidique Khan talking about his wish to fight in the jihad and saying his goodbyes to his family&#151;a clear indication that he was intending a suicide mission. The newspapers also tell us that he was known to have attended late-stage discussions on planning another major terror attack that was subsequently thwarted. Again, I ask the Home Secretary whether that is true.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_80">Despite all that, the surveillance on Khan was called off months before the attack. Why? Was it, as intimated in the Intelligence and Security Committee report, because of a shortage of resources? Is it true that there were not enough MI5 agents to cover possible suspects and that that led to surveillance on dangerous terrorists being terminated on that occasion? The ISC report states that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;better appreciation of the speed and scale with which the threat against the UK could develop might have led the Services to achieve a step change in capacity earlier&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_81">Did that occur because the resources for MI5 were not increased to meet the necessary step change until 2004, some three years after 9/11? And, because it takes three years to recruit, screen and train agents, the expansion will not take full effect until 2008.

<a name="stpa_82">Two of the bombers went to terrorist training camps in Pakistan and undertook weapons training, as the Home Secretary mentioned in his statement. Paragraph 75(e) of the official account is very vague on that matter. It is said that the British intelligence agencies did not obtain any usable information on these people&#039;s activities from the Pakistani intelligence services. Why did that happen?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_83">We are also told&#151;the Home Secretary alluded to it&#151;that Khan and Tanweer met al-Qaeda leaders and discussed jihad with them. How, then, can the Government represent these people as members of an independent freelance group? If they are, how did al-Qaeda get a copy of Khan&#039;s suicide video in order to splice on to it its own propaganda, which involved its second most important member, before it was broadcast in September?

<a name="stpa_84">I take the opportunity of paying tribute to the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), who has done a remarkable job with his Committee, which produced an extremely insightful report, as the Home Secretary recognised. Having said that, although the Intelligence and Security Committee is impartial, wise and of the highest integrity, it is constitutionally limited in what it can achieve. That is partly because of the limitation on its investigative resources, partly because of its remit and partly because it is constituted in such a way as to be entirely dependent on the intelligence agencies for its information and on their willingness to disclose such information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_85">The process has, frankly, raised more questions than answers. After the 9/11 tragedy, the United States Senate had a very well resourced and independent report with very hard-hitting conclusions. After Madrid, the Spanish Government had an independent report and learned serious lessons from it. In this country, after the Falklands war, even though secret intelligence issues were at stake, we had the independent Franks report. Almost every previous major intelligence failure was dealt with by an independent inquiry, but I am afraid that that is not what we have today in the official account, which expresses the Government&#039;s view rather than an independent view. As a result, the process has left too many questions unresolved.

<a name="60511-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_88">I merely point out, in the same spirit of generosity with which he welcomed me, that the scope, remit and statute under which the ISC was established was defined not by this Government, but by the Conservative Government in which the right hon. Gentleman served. Secondly, the reason for public inquiries, including the Franks inquiry, prior to the establishment of the ISC, was precisely because of the absence of such a scrutiny Committee. It was appropriate for the ISC to be given the task. It is independent of the Government and values its independence. To the best of my knowledge, it has been given as much assistance, aid and leeway as possible, and I believe that it has produced a very useful report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para12">
<a name="stpa_89">Let me turn to some of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s specific points. It was legitimate for him to raise them, and I will answer insofar as I can, without intruding into areas that affect operational matters. His first point was about several newspaper stories on the four bombers. As to the Tanweer story, relating to what happened a month before 7/7, I am told by the Security Service that it has no record of that allegation, so I do not think that there is a factual basis to it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para13">
<a name="stpa_90">What is known is that there was some peripheral intelligence of two of the bombers in connection with another investigation. So far as I can understand from paragraph 45, on page 14, from all the relevant intelligence material and the from independent scrutiny of the Intelligence and Security Committee, a judgment was made on whether the actions and assessments of the Security Service were understandable and correct at the time. The report confirms that the Security Service came across two individuals, who were subsequently identified as Khan and Tanweer, on the peripheries of another investigation. However, I should mention three heavy caveats.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para14">
<a name="stpa_91">First, it was only after 7 July that the Security Service was able fully to identify the two men, given the massive concentration of resources then transferred. Secondly, there was no intelligence at the time that these men were interested in planning an attack on the UK in the UK. That is specifically alluded to on page 13, in paragraph 43 of the ISC report. Thirdly, the intelligence at the time did indeed suggest a focus, but either on training and insurgency operations outside the country in Pakistan, in which the men might be interested, or on fraud. In relation to the investigation at the time, it was peripheral to what was regarded as a bigger and more important operation. It is in that light, on that important subject&#151;I accept that it is an important and legitimate one for the right hon. Gentleman to raise&#151;that the ISC says
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;we conclude that, in the light of the other priority investigations being conducted and the limitations on Security Service resources, the decisions not to give greater investigative priority to these two individuals were understandable&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para15">
<a name="stpa_92">Incidentally, officers followed up a report on the third bomber, Jermaine Lindsay, because again there was a peripheral connection to another case&#151;of aggravated burglary&#151;but it was only established later that the contact telephone number was on file.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para16">
<a name="stpa_93">I dealt with that matter in some measure, because the right hon. Gentleman raised an important point. I shall turn to resources, which he also mentioned. I covered them earlier, but in the period after 9/11 until 2007&#150;08, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 518</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>there has been a quadrupling of the resources available to the police and counter-terrorism. In the same period, across Government, there has been a doubling of resources for counter-terrorism and resilience, from less than &#163;1 billion to more than &#163;2 billion. At any given stage, there are physical limitations on what can be achieved, because of difficulties in recruitment, skills identification, training and so on. It is not merely a matter of applying resources and bringing in lots of people without relevant skills.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para17">
<a name="stpa_94">Let me give two quotes. The director general of the Security Service told the ISC:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;What we are trying to do is the maximum we think we can bear in terms of recruitment, training, vetting, expansion, scale, new officers, a big northern operations centre . . . it is a very challenging programme.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para18">
<a name="stpa_95">In other words, according to the director general, the limitations are not the resources being allocated but the fact that the service cannot expand any faster.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para19">
<a name="stpa_96">At paragraph 140 of the report, the head of the Secret Intelligence Service, C, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;If you try to bring in more than a certain number of new people every year you can literally bust the system . . . you can only tolerate a certain number of inexperienced people dealing with very sensitive subjects.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para20">
<a name="stpa_97">On al-Qaeda, there are circumstantial links, some of which the right hon. Gentleman pointed out: the recording of the video, the Khan reference to al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda&#039;s claim of responsibility and so on. There are assumptions and speculations about contacts. The ISC report says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;The extent to which the 7 July attacks were externally planned directed or controlled by contacts in Pakistan or elsewhere remains unclear.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-11_para21">
<a name="stpa_98">That is what I said at the beginning. The matter is still under investigation. Yes, there is circumstantial evidence, but I do not think there is anything that would merit my saying at this stage that there is conclusive evidence that the attack was planned in advance rather than being claimed as a success afterwards, ex post facto, by al-Qaeda.

 I, too, welcome the Home Secretary to his new position. As the gravity of the events being discussed shows, he occupies a position of enormous importance to the security and welfare of the country. I share, of course, in his and the other expressions of condolence extended to the victims and the families of victims of the horrific attack on 7 July last year. I thank the right hon. Gentleman for advance sight of his statement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_99">We welcome the Intelligence and Security Committee report. As has been said, it is a thorough, insightful and highly professional report and raises crucial questions about the resourcing and organisation of our security services. Its scrutiny of the system of threat level warnings must in particular be responded to swiftly in order to safeguard public confidence, as the Home Secretary acknowledged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_100">The report raises queries about the increase in resources demanded by and made available to the security services. It is always easy to be wise with hindsight, and I acknowledge what the Home Secretary has just said about the practical limitation of increasing resources too fast in too short a period. Notwithstanding those caveats, there 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 519</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>seems to be some lingering reasonable doubt about whether resources were increased with sufficient speed before the events of last July, not least because we now know that the real step change in the increase of resources did not really kick in until late 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_101">Notwithstanding the quality of the ISC report, does the Home Secretary agree that it and the Home Office narrative on the events of 7 July that he set out today are by definition limited in scope and leave some of the most important questions unanswered? To deal with the new threat of home-grown terrorism, we need to do more to try to understand the nature of that threat. Surely, there is no logical reason why the right hon. Gentleman should resist calls for a public inquiry when such an inquiry could deal with issues not covered by the reports. It could help to foster public understanding about the evolution of home-grown terrorism in our cities and towns and thus help our intelligence services to target resources effectively in those cities and towns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_102">We strongly welcome the Government&#039;s organisation of seven working groups under the aegis of the preventing extremism together initiative, which reported last November. That was an important first step in helping to assess, analyse and tackle, in a collaborative approach with members of our Muslim communities, the complexity of home-grown fundamentalism in some of those communities. Would not a public inquiry help to pick up from where the initiative left off to promote the collective anti-terrorism effort that the Home Secretary rightly emphasised in his statement?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_103">Finally, may I urge the Home Secretary to consider carefully the emphasis in the ISC report, at paragraph 137, on the crucial role of effective local policing in gathering intelligence to identify individuals and communities susceptible to the kind of fundamentalism that can lead to such horrific terrorist atrocities? Does not he accept that the headlong rush towards the regional merger of police authorities, more often than not against their will, risks uprooting the foundations of our local police exactly when we should be strengthening, not weakening, the value of local policing in our counter-terrorism strategy?
</p>





<p><a name="st_66"><a name="60511-12_spnew1"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman. On his last point, yes, local intelligence is obviously important. That is why we have about 13,000 more police officers on the beat and the number of community support officers is increasing to 16,000. The hon. Gentleman will understand if I decline his invitation to comment on another major issue, police restructuring, which I have not had the chance to look at&#151;it has been a rather busy five days&#151;but I accept the need for local intelligence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_104">The hon. Gentleman raised three other matters, the first of which was resources. He appeared to indicate that there was little increase in resources in the years after 2002 and that it was slanted towards the end of the period. Actually, if we consider counter-terrorist and resilience spending since 2001 by Department, across Government, the amounts are &#163;923 million and &#163;988 million, with &#163;1,257 million immediately afterwards; the next figures are &#163;1,479 million, &#163;1.665 billion and &#163;2.045 billion, so there has in fact been a steady cross-Government increase.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_105">Although I fully accept that there will always be a demand for greater resources, Members should be cautious, as was the ISC, when talking about them. The paragraph in the report referring to resources begins with the following words:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;It could be argued (but it would be largely with hindsight)&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_106">the only exact science known to men and women is hindsight. The Committee phrased that paragraph very carefully; before saying that perhaps more resources could have helped, it noted that the observation was made &quot;largely with hindsight&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_107">I have one more point about resources. There has been a substantial increase, but even if resources were infinite, the truth of the matter in respect of intelligence is, as we must say constantly&#151;and as the Butler inquiry pointed out&#151;that even with unlimited resources we can never be 100 per cent. certain. We cannot predict the future. There is not 100 per cent. security, nor 100 per cent. predictability. Intelligence is, by its nature, a collection of fragmentary, partial, sometimes subjective and sometimes mistaken pieces of information, which must be put together by human judgment. So there is a matter of resources, but we should not pretend that, if then or in the future, we supplied infinite resources, we would have infinite wisdom about the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_108">More briefly, on two things that the hon. Gentleman mentioned&#151;the first was an inquiry, which is very important&#151;I fully understand the concerns of the families of victims and those caught up in the attacks. I fully understand the questions that they have to ask about the trauma and the whos and whys of how this happened. All of us would understand that&#151;it is a natural human reaction&#151;and this week I have therefore carefully considered the call for a public inquiry, as did my predecessor, but it would mean a pretty massive reallocation and diversion of resources over an extended period if it was done. That is not just an inconvenience and an expense; it is a serious matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_109">It would mean a reallocation of resources away from those needing protection at a critical time, when our security forces and security agencies are carrying out an absolutely essential job&#151;the protection of people in this country&#151;and in my judgment that diversion of resources would truly put others at risk to achieve an objective that can be achieved largely in other ways, which is why I am offering these meetings and reports. Of course, the Home Affairs Committee, the ISC, the London Assembly, the coroners and the ongoing criminal investigations, as well as our account, contribute towards that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-12_para11">
<a name="stpa_110">I agree entirely, however, with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s remarks about the need to engage the Muslim community. We need to work together in this country&#151;every single one of us&#151;because the threat is against every single one of us. In the aftermath of 7/7, we set in train both a short-term working programme of ministerial visits and then the longer-term actions in the Government&#039;s prevention delivery plan. I do not pretend that that is perfect, but it is the start of serious, prolonged and, I believe, in-depth engagement with the Muslim community in this country, because we need that.

Speaking as someone who represents the area in which the two worst atrocities took place, I think that it is necessary for us to accept that the activities of the security services will always be imperfect. It looks as though they had been geared largely to trying to trace connections to centrally organised atrocities, and we may have been caught out a little in the response to what might be described as semi-spontaneous local groups, which may have had vague connections&#151;but that is a very difficult task.

In that spirit, I refer the Home Secretary to paragraphs 103 and 108, which suggest a complete misreading of some major issues internally in the UK; that of whether suicide bombings were every likely to take place in the UK or Europe, when there was already evidence of the shoe bombers and others in Tel Aviv, and also the idea that home-grown terrorists were not a major issue for the UK.

 May I particularly welcome the Government&#039;s response to the specific recommendations of the Committee that the threat level and alert state system arrangements need clarity, transparency and simplicity? When will the review that the Government say have been completed be published, and, more importantly, when will the recommendations be implemented? Does the Home Secretary agree that part of the confusion that arose between threat levels and alert states was due to the fact that, although the threat level was reduced, the alert states were not? The alert states are the ones that matter to the people on the ground. In particular, as far as London Transport was concerned, that alert state remained very high and was not reduced. Finally, there have been reports in the press over the past few days that, had different decisions been made about the priorities, this atrocity might have been avoided. Is not the other side of that coin that, had the resources been put into trying to prevent this atrocity, one of the other atrocities that was prevented could equally well have happened?

 That is precisely the point. The right hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. That is also my worry about allocating and diverting resources towards a public inquiry. On his question about the threat level, I accept the recommendations of the Committee. As he will know, the difference between the two threat levels reflected whether there was knowledge of a specific threat at that time. &quot;Substantial&quot; is still a very high level of threat, but it meant that there was not specific knowledge at that time. As he said, that can be confusing. The response or readiness level was not automatically reduced, although the threat level came down. The reduced threat level indicated to experts that there was not a specific threat. However, to the man in the street, it could be taken to mean a reduction in operational capability. It did not mean that&#151;thank goodness&#151;on this occasion. I will undertake to review that and implement things as soon as possible, and to publish what I can, although I do not pretend that I can give a carte blanche that we will publish everything to do with threat levels.

 On the compensation arrangements, I am aware of a potential contradiction.

I know that that represents an incongruity and an apparent unfairness and so I am looking at the case of the July victims. It is an exceptional case, in my view, and I am considering whether something can be done exceptionally and what that might be.

However, with hindsight the Committee was able to discover&#151;from what had been done after the bombings&#151;that there had been room to do more and to do it more quickly. Perhaps the caution was understandable, but more could have been done.

 I absolutely agree with the hon. Lady. I suppose that, for the country, what is more important is that the independent scrutiny of the Intelligence and Security Committee has led to the same conclusions. I remind the House, as I did earlier, that, in extremely difficult circumstances, working against hugely difficult technological networks and a high level of threat, the security agencies and the police have not just protected us in general, but have specifically prevented quite a number of potential terrorist attacks. As I said earlier, I know of three since July last year. For that, we should be eternally grateful.

 In what I hope will be a completely non-polemical way, may I say to my right hon.

 I know that my hon. Friend has taken a huge and detailed interest in the matter over a long period. There is nothing&#151;no degree of intelligence, or infinity of resources&#151;that will allow human beings, however intelligent, with absolute certainty to predict or prevent attempts to commit atrocities of this nature. The question is whether some resources and instruments will help us better to prevent such atrocities. I must say to him that in the five days in which I have been in the Home Office, it has occurred to me, when going through the several big issues that I have looked at, that ID cards would indeed have prevented some of the problems that we face over deportations, in this case and in other areas.

However, just as it is impossible for me to guarantee that no other terrorist attack will ever get through, it would be wrong of me to suggest that there can be some form of infinite expansion of our security and intelligence services when I know that the skills, training, aptitude, vetting and experience required to carry out the jobs is considerable. The process thus takes time, and without having the almighty prescience of knowing what might come in the next generation, we will always be up against those physical constraints. It is true to say that the security services and agencies have been given anything that they have asked for as a priority. However, of course, if there are other areas that they feel are absolutely essential, I will look at them.

 It is quite clear that home-grown terrorists were operating in an international framework.

 I very much agree, as I am sure that the whole House does, with my hon. Friend&#039;s second point. On her first point, international solidarity and action on borders, the transfer of intelligence and working together operationally are of increasing necessity not only inside the European Union, but with countries that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 528</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are geographically far apart from the European Union. Those actions are especially important with countries that are largely composed of people of the Muslim religion or culture. In my previous job, in which, as the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) pointed out, I took interest and enjoyed, I had a great deal of discussions with some of those countries and formed operational partnerships with them. I am sure that such work will benefit greatly those countries and us because the threat is common to us all. The threat starts off as justifying attacks on foreign soldiers and ends up, in attack theory, as blowing apart innocent Muslim women and children in the streets of Jordan or Iraq. The whole of civilisation is challenged by the threat and should unite against it.

 May I thank the Secretary of State for his dignified and informative statement? He will be aware from the ISC report that the tragic events of 7/7 followed years of failure, going back to before 1997, to appreciate the scale of the Islamist threat. In particular, this country operated a system&#151;the covenant of security&#151;under which terror propagandists were left at liberty, so that they and their potential recruits could be kept under watch. Given that one key terror propagandist under observation could abscond from his known home address, where he received housing benefit, and remain on the run for 10 months, does the Home Secretary not agree that a full public inquiry could do a great deal to address deep and systemic failings?

 I am not sure that the answer to what the hon. Gentleman calls systemic failure, which he illustrated with one case, is a public inquiry. Rather than willing the ends and not being prepared to will the means, the House needs the will to will the means. He urged us to take action against people who glorify terrorism, to undertake more competent operational investigations and to let people know about the threat, but I hope that as we do all those things, rather than accuse us of tub-thumping, over-egging the pudding or taking draconian measures against a threat, he and his colleagues will support us as we take the necessary measures to achieve the ends that he identified.

That is why, in the aftermath of 7/7, we set in train, as I said earlier, short-term work, including a programme of ministerial visits to engage local communities. Many Ministers, including my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, are actively engaged in dialogue and action with faith communities. Whether we have reached the parts that we ought to reach is an open question, and that is something that I want to look at. I think, too, that it will be high on the agenda of my right hon.

 Post-incident analysis and learning from our mistakes is a vital part of intelligence work. The House should not hold back from scrutinising the Government and the Committee&#039;s report on the event. Will the Home Secretary clarify something that remains unclear in the report and his previous answers? Were the two bombers, Tanweer and Khan, under surveillance at any stage in the lead-up to the incident and, if so, was that for years or months? I am not just talking about tracing their telephone calls. As a result of the report, will he undertake to consider whether we have the right balance between human intelligence&#151;informers and people working with the community&#151;and intelligence gathered purely from surveillance?

I therefore strongly support the positive side of the hon.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_117">We had considerable discussion in Committee of a short Bill that enjoys widespread support in the House, both for its content, as I said, and for the need for a speedy response from Parliament to the issue that has arisen for the Housing Corporation. The provisions are not the most dramatic, but they are extremely important to the Housing Corporation, the housing associations that it regulates, the lending community and, ultimately, the 2 million people who depend on social housing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_118">In Committee we undertook extensive scrutiny of the details of the Bill and its underlying purpose. I shall summarise the conclusions of that debate. The Bill&#039;s purpose is simple. It gives the Housing Corporation a power of delegation from board to below-board level, either to a committee of the board or to officials, with retrospective effect. It also deems the corporation always to have had such a power, since it was founded in 1964. Over the past 40 years the board had been acting, in good faith, on the basis that it had an implied power of delegation, until it was discovered at the end of last year that the board did not have that express power of delegation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_119">It was not just the corporation that thought it had such a power, but everyone else with an interest, including the Department, the lending community, housing associations and the residents of housing associations. When the Housing Corporation was created, it was common for public bodies and non-departmental public bodies not to be given an explicit power of delegation. At that time, powers of delegation were more readily taken to be implied. Since then, the majority of bodies set up without explicit powers have been wound up or have had their legislation modernised to confer such powers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_120">That did not happen in the case of the Housing Corporation because of administrative oversight on a series of occasions. Hon. Members asked whether we were aware of any other NDPB being in the same predicament as the Housing Corporation, but we are not. As I assured the Committee, we have examined all the NDPBs that were responsible to the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I will need to confirm that any new non-departmental bodies that may arrive in the Department as a result of the change in the Department&#039;s responsibilities are similarly checked, in order to ensure that we have addressed the issue. We have contacted the Cabinet Office, which is co-ordinating further consideration of the matter across Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_121">Hon. Members will be aware that as soon as the issue for the Housing Corporation was discovered, we set about addressing the many decisions that have been taken, so as not to leave housing associations, the corporation and lenders in a state of limbo about previous decisions that had been delegated.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 535</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_122">The Opposition raised concerns on Second Reading and in Committee about the retrospective nature of the legislation and the fact that it will legitimise past decisions that the corporation board had delegated. We had an extensive discussion of retrospective legislation on Second Reading and in Committee. We are clear that the concerns expressed by hon. Members about retrospective legislation do not apply. The Bill does not seek to alter the rights of individuals to the benefit of some and the disadvantage of others, or seek to unravel previous transactions that were      undertaken in good faith with unforeseeable consequences. It does not attempt retrospectively to change people&#039;s understanding of the position that they are in; in fact, the converse is true. It seeks to restore what was thought to be the status quo and restores the parties to the position that they all considered, in good faith, they were in before the problem was discovered.
</p>

<p><a name="st_127"><a name="60511-17_spnew0"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> 
 On what evidence does the Minister conclude that all parties thought that way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_128"><a name="60511-17_spnew1"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 We are certainly not aware of any that thought otherwise. If the hon. Gentleman is challenging me because he thinks that I am, so to speak, unreasonably presuming that all swans are white because I have never seen a black one, he is probably making a fair logical point. However, on the basis of the evidence that I have and the consideration that was given to the historical files, I am not aware that any of the many organisations that engage with the Housing Corporation considered that this implied power did not exist. Certainly, if any of the lenders had considered that that was a possibility, they would have raised it with us pretty quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_123">As I made clear, the Bill restores to the Housing Corporation and to other stakeholders something that everyone previously thought already applied. It also ensures that they can move on, on a secure footing, in making decisions in future, and that they do not have to call a meeting of the board to consider a series of decisions that should sensibly be delegated either to sub-committees or to officers. It therefore allows the Housing Corporation to manage its business more effectively and efficiently and to take sensible decisions in exactly the same way as many other non-departmental public bodies. At an earlier stage of the Bill&#039;s passage, we discussed a range of other organisations and non-departmental public bodies that have similar powers to those that we are introducing for the Housing Corporation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_124">We discussed in Standing Committee the kinds of delegated decisions that are involved. These are not merely decisions about the kinds of coffee and biscuits that are got in for meetings&#151;they are about the statutory functions of the Housing Corporation. A series of different types of decisions is covered. Our main concern centred on consents under section 9 of the Housing Act 1996. It was important to ensure that those were covered by the ability to delegate. That section requires a registered social landlord to obtain the consent of the corporation for any disposal of land under section 8 of the Act. That includes the placing of charges by lenders as security against a loan and rule changes for RSLs. It is important to have certainty about such consents, as they have important 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 536</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>implications for the future of social housing, new build and the levels at which housing associations can borrow. Legal advice assured us that, through provisions in the Land Registration Act 2002, housing associations could continue to borrow against their assets and regard their homes, which might have been transferred from another housing association, as their own, and could make decisions about the future on that basis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_125">However, we were also advised that notwithstanding the existence of such other provisions, there remained a degree of legal uncertainty about the validity of the decisions of the corporation. We felt, given the extent of long-term investment in the social housing sector, that it was critical to ensure that that uncertainty could be addressed. It could, for example, have affected the ability of housing associations to borrow against their assets, the rate at which they could borrow, the draw-down of loans, and the confidence of lenders. We are all agreed across the House that we want to maintain confidence in the social housing sector in those long-term decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_126">Another aspect that we covered was the status of regulatory decisions such as statutory appointments to the board of a registered social landlord. We wanted to ensure that those were also properly covered and that there was no uncertainty about them given the need to be able to regulate in the public interest. Similar concerns involved housing association registration and rule changes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_127">In each of the areas where we have pursued this matter, it is possible to provide some legal comfort regarding rule changes that might be provided by other legislation such as the Land Registration Act and the Companies Act 1985. Nevertheless, it became clear that each of those provisions offered insufficient certainty and comfort, whether for the Housing Corporation itself, for the housing associations, for their lenders or, ultimately, for social housing residents, who would bear the consequences were that uncertainty not resolved and were there to be any difficulties in terms of lending decisions that might follow.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_128">There is wide-ranging consensus among the stakeholders, as well as in the Department and among hon. Members, on the need for the Bill and the need to respond relatively swiftly to the problem that has arisen for the Housing Corporation. We believe that the Bill is the only way to solve that problem. I thank all Members for their support and commend the Bill to the House.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the Minister in this debate. It is also a particular pleasure to see the new Minister for Trade in his place on the Front Bench. I say that because this Bill is small and, some might argue, perfectly formed, in that it has attracted no amendments and comes to us in its original pristine form. It would therefore be natural for many to conclude that it was flawless from the beginning. Indeed, given the well known attachment of the new Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to the Roman Catholic Church, one might even say that it had an immaculate conception.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_129">However, I would not like anyone to think that this brief measure has passed through the House without scrutiny, because several hon. Members made valuable 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 537</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>comments on Second Reading and in Committee. I should like in particular to pay tribute to the hard work of my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), who is in his place, and my hon. Friends the Members for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps), for St. Albans (Anne Main), for Banbury (Tony Baldry) and for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands). I think that in every case where there were local elections in the constituencies of those of my hon. Friends who spoke on Second Reading, the Conservative party made gains&#151;in some cases, sweeping gains. I would like to think that there was a direct causal connection between their commitment to extending social housing and Conservative success, but I suspect that other factors to do with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister may have played an even greater part in those results.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_130">While on the subject of Whitehall manoeuvres, I congratulate the Minister on retaining her portfolio. I would like to think that the Prime Minister was taking such a close interest in the passage of the Bill that he did not dare move the Minister during its passage lest it, or she, come to some harm&#151;but I suspect that he may have had other things on his mind in the past week.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_131">As the Minister and the House will know, we have been happy, indeed eager, to assist the Government with this business, not only on the compassionate Conservative basis that we should help the vulnerable but because, as we outlined on Second Reading and in Committee, we think that the Bill is necessary and urgent. As the Minister made clear, it seeks only to correct an anomaly that came to light earlier this year. It will grant to the Housing Corporation the power to delegate that that body, and all independent observers, always believed that it had. It will regularise in law a state of affairs that has been ongoing for years, which everyone accepted and to which no one objected until an eagle-eyed lawyer discovered a technical breach in the corporation&#039;s constitution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_132">At every stage of the legislative proceedings, the Minister has been helpful and to the point in explaining the need for the Bill. However, as hon. Members have raised certain questions during its passage, I should like briefly to explain why we believe that it passes the tests that qualify it for speedy transfer to the statute book. Any legislation should pass at least three tests: the test of necessity, the test of proportionality, and the test of consequentiality. First, is it necessary, or could we achieve this goal by other means? Secondly, is it proportionate, in that it does what it says on the tin, or does it carry within it additional measures beyond those required to achieve the desired effect? Finally, what consequences will its passage have on the broader legislative and administrative framework in which we operate? Does it create precedents, or will its operations have ramifications that have profound and unheralded consequences?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_133">As the Minister made clear, the Bill passes the necessity test. We all know that it is necessary to keep housing associations buoyant and effective and enable them to continue carrying out their superb job of providing social housing and acting as social enterprises. Their success has depended on their access to debt finance on competitive terms.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 538</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_134">As the Minister again made clear, lenders lend to housing associations because they have absolute security and first call on their assets. They have that security because of the section 9 consents that have been granted through prior legislation. In many cases, they were granted under delegated powers. If there is any uncertainty about the legality of the exercise of those powers, an element of risk is introduced. As we all know, introducing an element of risk into the lending process places a premium on loans. That means additional costs&#151;for the taxpayer or housing associations or those in genuine need, who depend on social housing. We therefore share the Government&#039;s commitment to removing that risk, restoring certainty and helping those in need. That is why we believe that the Bill passes the necessity test.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_135">Let us consider the proportionality test. My hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough made some telling points on Second Reading and in Committee when he asked whether it was disproportionate to introduce a measure to deal with something that the Housing Corporation could tackle through a retrospective consent. There are some attractions in his case. However, the best advice from all lawyers is that both the Housing Corporation and housing associations would be on a securer and more certain footing if primary legislation were passed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_136">Given the speed with which the House has considered the measure, and that we now teeter on the precipice of seeing it on the statute book, it appears foolish to argue that there is any method other than the original course of speedy legislation to provide the security and certainty that lenders, the Housing Corporation and housing associations deserve. The Bill is, therefore, not only necessary but proportionate. At 22 lines long, it tries to do nothing more than address the specific anomaly. Some hon. Members suggested in Committee that it should be used to achieve other ends. The Minister was attentive to their concerns, and promised to revert to them by other means.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_137">Let us consider consequences. The Bill is narrowly and precisely drafted, so few consequences flow from it other than the rectification of the existing anomaly. As the Minister was gracious enough to point out, it raises a specific question. Do any other non-departmental public bodies in Whitehall have similar or related loopholes or lacunae in their constitutions? She gave us an absolute assurance that all the non-departmental public bodies under her Department as it was before the recent reshuffle were covered, and that she would consider all those that now come within her bailiwick. She also assured us that the Cabinet Office would examine all non-departmental public bodies throughout Whitehall.

 Let me clarify my assurance. We asked the Cabinet Office to examine the issue more widely. There may be, for example, non-departmental public bodies that it makes no sense to examine because they clearly have no need of such a delegated power, and so on. We await further consideration from the Cabinet Office about how the matter should progress; I do not want to give the hon. Gentleman the inaccurate impression that we are conducting a grand search of every measure if there are more appropriate methods of dealing with the matter.

<a name="stpa_139">I acknowledge the great contribution to the debate of the hon.

My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) first raised the matter on Second Reading.

<a name="stpa_140">The Housing Act 1996 has been mentioned.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_141">The Bill is sensible. It acknowledges a change in practice that has emerged during the operation of the Housing Corporation and its sister bodies in devolved parts of the United Kingdom. When the Housing Corporation was established, delegation was far less common in public bodies. The Housing Corporation&#039;s work load and responsibilities has increased because of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 540</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the shift from local authorities&#039; provision of social housing to more provision by registered social landlords. The Government, like the previous Administration, have tried to encourage that. If that is to continue, it is crucial that delegation be allowed to continue to ensure that local consultations can take place and effective decision making can happen at the appropriate level. The anomaly should have been picked up earlier, but at least it is being tackled now. We are considering a sensible tidying-up measure to reflect the reality. My party supports it for that reason.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_142">Several hon. Members raised the concept of retrospective legislation. I agree that in principle the House takes a dim view of it. However, as the Minister said, the Bill is trying to secure decisions that have been made in the past, not to undermine them. It aims to increase confidence in the sector. If the Government want to pursue further private investment in social housing as opposed to public investment through local authorities, such confidence will be crucial. Confidence is also crucial for tenants who want the housing association from which they rent to be in a secure position to ensure that their tenancy remains secure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_143">The Bill also covers the possibility that some of the delegated decisions may have been wrong.

<a name="stpa_145">The Bill will go through the House unopposed today, but it represents a missed opportunity. As it progressed through its Second Reading and into Committee, events occurred and statements were made that changed the nature of the Bill. On Second Reading, it appeared that the main purpose of the retrospective part of the Bill was to address concerns about disposals, where housing associations had disposed of properties or, perhaps more importantly, where they had granted charges on properties. Subsequently, however, it transpired that a general consent under the terms of the Housing Act 1996 would have been sufficient to address that problem. Even if there were no consent, lawyers were of the opinion that the transactions would still be valid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_146">In Committee, however, it became apparent that other matters, rather than the disposals, were the reason for the retrospective legislation.

<a name="stpa_149">The problem is that the primary legislation did require the board to make those decisions, and in all the intervening years, no one thought that the board should not do so. It might appear to the layman that the board would have to look into every detail and work out every fine part of any disposal. What actually happens is that the housing association does all that work. It does all the investigation and due diligence, then sends the request to the Housing Corporation. I am unaware of the Housing Corporation having rejected any such request. The purpose of the Housing Corporation is to regulate housing associations, not to be involved in a great deal of paperwork. So I see no practical disadvantage in the retrospection.

We did not want that uncertainty and anxiety among lenders to have an impact on the day-to-day decisions on the draw-down of loans or the rate at which housing associations can borrow, for example. Such uncertainty could have a serious impact on the viability of those decisions, should those problems start to escalate.

New legislation was also introduced, with the help of a former Conservative Member for York who lost his seat in 1997&#151;it is still a Labour constituency&#151;to ensure that smoke alarms were fitted in all new property. It also required that all old property for rehabilitation had to have such alarms fitted.

Some of our more recent initiatives will provide valuable assistance to the most financially disadvantaged in society, including extra funding for debt advice and tackling the menace of loan sharks. I shall explain those schemes further later.

<a name="stpa_171">The Government remain committed, as we have always said, to a system of competitive markets, with the pressure to retain custom as a powerful incentive on business to be efficient and act with integrity and responsibility. Companies that thrive in a competitive market are those that give their customers what they want. Those companies that do not do so will struggle to stay in the market. Confident, empowered consumers must be key to the success of competitive markets. That confidence helps drive markets. Consumers who are confident have the right information to know how to spot a good deal, have the confidence to know when they are being ripped off, and are confident that they are backed up by enforcers with the power to protect them from crooks and dodgy dealers.

 On Consumer Direct, which is a splendid initiative on which the Government should be congratulated, West Yorkshire had one of the pilot schemes, which has proved successful and has been rolled out nationally.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the next few months, I would be happy for him to join me in looking at Consumer Direct. I shall set out some of the facts to which he has alluded, which are important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_173">We will need to ensure that Consumer Direct is not just value for money but gives appropriate advice. Let me describe some of the things that it has done in that regard. Consumer Direct has handled nearly 1.5 million calls since its launch. It currently receives 25,000 calls per week across England, Scotland and Wales. I can list the five most common complaints from consumers in 2005: 42 per cent. concerned defective goods, 17.8 per cent. concerned sub-standard service, 8 per cent. concerned misleading claims, 6.6 per cent. concerned delivery, collection and repairs and 3.7 per cent. concerned prices. One of the products that attracted most complaints was the second-hand car. Some things never change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_174">People clearly like Consumer Direct. A recent customer satisfaction survey reported that 87 per cent. of callers were satisfied or very satisfied with the service. Eight out of 10 callers now feel confident about dealing with similar problems should they occur in future. Because of Consumer Direct, an extra 350,000 people will have access to clear practical advice this year. That means total benefits to consumers through advice on sorting out their problems&#151;for example, money saved on repairs and replacements and through refunds&#151;of at least &#163;135 million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_175">As well as educating consumers and giving them information, we are trying to improve consumer advocacy. That is why earlier in the year we announced plans to set up a new consumer body called Consumer Voice to bring together the National Consumer Council and some sectoral consumer bodies, including Energywatch and Postwatch, to represent the interests of consumers across markets and to offer the best possible consumer protection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_176">We have also proposed new ombudsman schemes in energy and postal services to deal with consumer complaints when companies have not provided satisfactory resolution, and to provide redress where necessary. The new schemes will be able to enforce the resolution of consumer complaints on companies, and provide compensation. That means that service providers will need to take proper responsibility for resolving consumer complaints.An ombudsman scheme that charges companies per complaint will provide directive incentives for companies to do that. Such schemes already operate in the telecoms and financial services sectors, and we want to build on that good practice and extend it to other sectors.
</p>





<p><a name="st_150"><a name="60511-20_spnew4"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 The Minister said that Consumer Voice would act as an advocate for the consumer. Will it be an advocate for the consumer in general, or will it be able to advocate on specific complaints on behalf of the individual?
</p>





<p><a name="st_151"><a name="60511-20_spnew5"><b> Mr. McCartney: </b> 
 It will provide general advice and assistance. I shall explain later how the regime will develop in a coherent way. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and to the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford to keep them in touch with developments, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 547</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>because I do not consider this to be a partisan issue. That sounds good coming from me, does it not? I may regret having said it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_152"><a name="60511-20_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bone: </b> 
 Many people come to see me in my constituency about consumer problems, but they also visit the citizens advice bureau, which helps them greatly. Are the Government planning to fund local citizens advice bureaux directly?
</p>





<p><a name="st_153"><a name="60511-20_spnew7"><b> Mr. McCartney: </b> 
 In a few moments I shall give some good news about citizens advice bureaux. First, however, I have good news about the energy sector. Anticipating what would be done by other sectors, the energy regulator, Ofgem, has asked energy suppliers to appoint an ombudsman on billing complaints by July, and I know that the sector is working hard to achieve that. It must be borne in mind that existing consumer bodies such as Energywatch cannot&#151;I repeat, cannot&#151;decide on complaints or enforce redress for consumers. Ombudsman decisions are binding on companies but not on consumers, who can pursue their claims through other means if they wish. Ombudsman schemes are free to consumers: the companies pay the costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_177">Our plans were subject to consultation earlier this year. We expect to announce the outcome of that consultation, and the details of how we intend to implement our proposals, in July. We will need primary legislation, and if that is passed, it may be possible to introduce the first changes towards the end of 2007. When I know more, I shall write to hon. Members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_178">As I said earlier, we have worked hard to establish better protection for consumers. Following the recent introduction of the Consumer Credit Act 2006, millions will enjoy greater protections when borrowing money. More than 74 million credit cards were issued at the end of 2004&#151;the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) probably owns half of them&#151;and about 50 per cent. of households have at least one credit agreement. The new Act constitutes the biggest overhaul of credit legislation since 1974 in relation to both rights and redress. It also changes the licensing of consumer credit businesses, and introduces new powers to drive undesirable elements out of the market.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_179">We shall implement the new Act in stages over the next two years. Consumers will then be able to take complaints about lenders to the financial ombudsman service, challenge unfair credit agreements in court and receive more information about the state of their accounts, which will help them to identify potential problems before it is too late.

 I thank my hon. Friend for those remarks. My constituency, like his, has been bedevilled by illegal loan sharks who terrorise individuals and communities. They have no place in our communities or on our streets and doorsteps. Such prosecutions and subsequent ones will send the clear message that there is no hiding place for these people, who inflict misery on families and communities, particularly the elderly and other vulnerable people.

<a name="60511-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_186">Prosecutions aside, the teams are preventing illegal money-lenders from operating by generating publicity for their work. They are demonstrating that loan sharks can, and will, be prosecuted, and directing victims toward seeking money advice, and toward third-sector lenders such as credit unions. Credit unions are an important means of accessing affordable credit. One of my first actions in my new role was to sign off legislation that will help the Treasury in its plan to encourage the growth of credit unions, so that they can offer loans to a broader range of people.

<a name="60511-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_187">I turn to the unfair commercial practices directive. The Government are committed to simplifying regulations in order to provide effective protection for consumers. That is why we will introduce into the UK regime&#151;through the implementation of this directive&#151;a general duty not to trade unfairly. That will assist us in tackling aggressive doorstep selling; scams requiring competition &quot;winners&quot; to call premium-rate numbers; bogus closing-down sales; the advertising of unavailable products at low prices to attract consumers, in order to then sell them higher-price goods; and false claims that consumers will get a better deal if they sign up immediately, to prevent them from buying elsewhere. We have already consulted business and consumers on how to implement this new law, and we will publish our response before the summer. We aim to introduce this legislation next year.

 My right hon. Friend is displaying his customary generosity in giving way. Many of the scams that he has just described are perpetrated by fraudsters who use accommodation addresses provided by mailing companies. Such an address often proves to be just one of many post-boxes at a particular, sometimes prestigious location. A couple of weeks ago, I had an Adjournment debate on this issue. The Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner), was so impressed that he invited me to meet him and his officials to discuss the issue, and to bring trading standards officers with me. Given that my hon. Friend has been shuffled off to another Government coil, and that, essentially, this is a consumer protection issue, will my right hon.

They contain the records of scam companies that every day throughout Britain are scamming pensioners and other vulnerable people and those who are unsure of their rights. Trading standards officers write to, or visit, the posh addresses given. The records are filed, and that is the last than anyone sees of them. These companies know that they are operating in this way. Those looking after such records know that such schemes are scams, and they are making a living out of doing so.

Unfortunately, when they are closed down they often reappear. I will definitely meet my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) and his delegation to discuss this issue.

We need to protect vulnerable consumers, the vast majority of decent businesses and the market itself by cracking down on these crooks. That means effective enforcement. The Department of Trade and Industry&#039;s company investigation branch is a powerful weapon in the fight against undesirables such as those whom my hon.

<a name="stpa_192">Many hon. Members are interested in the Government&#039;s review of any further liberalisation of Sunday shopping laws. I attended a stakeholder 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 552</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>conference on that issue yesterday and heard first hand both the economic evidence and the concerns of stakeholders. The current laws governing Sunday opening were put in place 12 years ago. The Sunday Trading Act 1994 restricts large shops in England and Wales from opening for more than six hours between 10 and 6, and prevents them from opening at all on Easter Sunday. Sunday shopping hours have never been restricted in Scotland, but in 2003 the Government passed the Sunday Working (Scotland) Act to ensure that Scottish shop workers have the same right to choose not to work on Sundays as shop workers in England and Wales. The Government also supported the Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004 which ensures that large stores cannot open on Christmas day, no matter which day of the week Christmas falls on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_193">The fact that the regulations have been around for 12 years does not necessarily mean that they are wrong, but it means that it is sensible for us to review them. According to the Office of Fair Trading, which recently announced that it was studying certain areas of online shopping, internet retail sales in the United Kingdom have increased by 350 per cent. in the past five years. Between January and April this year the Department for Trade and Industry asked informally for the views and evidence on a possible extension of Sunday shopping hours. I have not yet seen the results, but I know that there is a wide range of opinions and some are exceedingly strongly held. This is the time for the Government to listen, so if I may, I shall say that I am shopping around for a few good ideas.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_194">I want to run through some of the strongly held views to illustrate the strength and complexity of the debate outside the Chamber. No one will agree with all of them. Indeed, some may not agree with any of them. For example, some consumers are keen to be able to shop at all hours of the day and night; others cannot imagine why they would ever want to do so. Some employees value the chance to work on Sundays; others say that Sunday opening has made their working life more difficult. Some people feel it is not the Government&#039;s place to regulate in this area; others would like to see Sunday protected as a day of rest by as much regulation as possible. Some religious groups feel either that it is wrong that shops open at all on Sundays or believe that family life benefits from having a day in the week without shopping and that it is extremely important to the social fabric of the country. Some have commented that the current rules under which many shops open and close at similar times, for example 10 am and 4 pm, cause congestion on the roads and say that it would be better to allow shops to decide for themselves when they close, similar to the greater freedom now available to public houses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_195">There is also a wealth of interest into the effects on small shops, as I have witnessed at first hand in the Makerfield constituency. Some people are worried that small shops near them might have to close; others think that it is good for small shops to have to raise their game

<br>&nbsp;<br>to compete. Those and all other views expressed have to be weighed in the balance. My right hon.

<p><a name="st_174"><a name="60511-22_spnew14"><b> Michael Fabricant: </b> 
 I rise to point out that the Minister is right that the arguments are finely balanced. I was personally reassured that the previous Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was inclining to the view that time has moved on. The Minister will be aware that 12 years ago the John Lewis partnership, which now employs 64,000 partners all of whom have a stake in the company, was dead against Sunday trading. Now they take a neutral view because they recognise that time has moved on. The arguments made 12 years ago may not be so relevant today.
</p>





<p><a name="st_175"><a name="60511-22_spnew15"><b> Mr. McCartney: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for trying for the second time in 18 years to be friendly to me. I, too, must be neutral in this matter. I know that he is trying to entice me for the best of reasons to comment on this. The whole point of what I have been saying is that we are genuinely looking to have proper consultation. I shall come to that in a minute.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_196">We have not yet reached a conclusion on what should happen with regard to Sunday shopping hours. Given that I have only just arrived in the job, it will be no surprise that I have a generally open mind. No decision will be taken until I have assessed all the evidence and given appropriate advice to the Secretary of State. Secondly, we have promised that if we decide to continue to look at the question of changing the restrictions on Sunday shopping hours, there will be a formal consultation on the issue. We will keep that promise. We have said, and this remains the case, that the legislative process will be transparent, with any changes part of a consumer Bill and subject to a full vote in the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_197">Thirdly, I give the House an absolute commitment that the special protection that shop workers have, allowing them to choose not to work on Sundays, is here to stay. The review will not include changing that protection because we are firmly committed to keeping it in place. Fourthly, I make it clear that the Government are committed to values of economic and social justice. Although the economic case is important, it is only one part of the equation. The Government support a greater work-life balance. We also support the regeneration of communities and we want to see small family businesses flourish. We also know that many large companies are at the forefront of community regeneration. Many have developed strong partnerships with unions and have taken a positive approach to campaigning to end age discrimination and allow older men and women to return to the labour market after many decades in which such people were not able to find work.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_203">Why do we need consumers to be confident? In this context, that means that they should be informed and empowered. I contend that confident consumers will encourage higher standards among manufacturers, shops and other service providers. Equally, informed consumers can better recognise and avoid the scams or frauds that the Minister described.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_204">Confident consumers also encourage innovation and good value simply by using their spending power wisely. Sectors such as information technology or the computer games industry show how consumer feedback directly affects future product development. That increases our competitiveness and productivity and so contributes to making this country the best place to do business. Sadly, there remains considerable room for improvement: in 1997, when the Minister was last in the Department, the UK was the world&#039;s fourth most competitive country, but it is now the 13th.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_205">Informed and empowered consumers are good for their own welfare and for the economy as a whole, but what do those qualities mean in practice? Informed consumers know what advice they need and where to get it. They understand the consequences of their purchasing decisions but, with new and more complex products and services entering the market each week, providing that information is increasingly difficult. Ironically, it is in the areas where the financial consequences are greatest&#151;financial services, for example&#151;that consumers are often least well placed to make informed decisions. Indeed, I recently hosted a seminar on consumer credit that looked at issues to do with financial exclusion and education. We also examined ways to ensure that consumers are enabled, rather than trapped, by the choices that they make.

 The Financial Services Authority is tasked to do a lot of work in the area of consumer and financial education. I believe that the jury is still out on whether it has been effective, or whether its approach has been too laid back and complicated. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be good to know how much impact that work has had in schools? If younger people do not have the relevant knowledge, we will all be&#151;to use the old expression&#151;doomed.

<p><a name="st_182"><a name="60511-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Prisk: </b> 
 I hate to admit that I am of the generation that understands the reference that the hon. Gentleman makes, but he is right that we need to establish the FSA&#039;s role in education. It has not been engaged in the process long, and some would say that it could face a conflict of interest in trying to be both regulator and educator. When the Government go ahead with the financial services consumer panel, it will be interesting to see what sort of relationship the panel has with the new advocacy bodies.

<a name="60511-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_206">Empowering customers cannot be achieved simply through education and information. Customers also need to have confidence that appropriate and convenient means of redress will be available and enforced, when that is justified. Clearly, there are many forms of redress to deal with the different harms that consumers can suffer, but they need to be accessible and effective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_207">The Minister referred to the ombudsman system. It has worked well but, as expectations change, the standards of enforcement may need to change too. The central policy question has to do with how we create confident consumers. The responsibility must be shared between Government, business and consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_208">It is the Government&#039;s role to ensure that the right balance is struck between protecting consumers&#151;and especially the most vulnerable in our community, as the Minister rightly pointed out&#151;and allowing business to trade without being handicapped by over-burdensome and often ill-considered regulation. The Government also have the responsibility to ensure open and competitive markets, in which business and consumers can operate. In addition, they should provide a legal framework that is clear, simple and easily understood, and put in place effective resolution and redress systems. Given the Government&#039;s ambition to make Britain among the best consumer regimes by 2008, is the Minister still confident that they will fulfil this target, and how far have they progressed to date?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_209">Business must also share in the responsibility. It is not, and should not be, the role of business alone to educate consumers, but I believe that it is clearly in the interests of reputable businesses to ensure that their customers are well educated and informed about their services and products. It is in their interest to be accessible to consumers, to make their offers clear and to be responsive to feedback and complaints. In fact, I would contend that that can be a source of genuine competitive advantage for businesses. The John Lewis Partnership, which was referred to earlier, is well known for its slogan, &quot;Never knowingly undersold&quot;. That means that its customers can be confident that they will not be beaten on price. Recent showings suggest that the partnership is offering something that is well received by some customers.

: As in all things, if consumers are to be fully informed, they sometimes have to be careful.

</p>





<p><a name="st_184"><a name="60511-23_spnew8"><b> Mr. Prisk: </b> 
 All of which generously leads me on to my third point. I believe that consumers themselves have a personal responsibility to take informed decisions. It is not for the Government to protect consumers who took rash decisions when they were in a position to have made an informed choice. It is right, in cases where information is available, to make a rational choice or decision, but consumers must face the consequences of their choice if they make it carelessly. In fact, if the truth be told, the distinction between Government, business and consumer may be partially false, for we are all consumers and we all have a responsibility to ensure that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 557</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>we are appropriately informed. The Government can, of course, help to ensure that the most vulnerable consumers are protected by clamping down on companies that use rogue practices.

First, he has had the pleasure of reading many papers this week, so he may be aware that we have been pressing for a national debate on the future of small shops. Promoting the health of our high streets is a classic example of how shared responsibility can work. It is the Government&#039;s responsibility to ensure that there is a level playing field and that players within the market are not unfairly disadvantaged. That is why we welcome the Competition Commission&#039;s inquiry into the grocery market, so long as it is thorough and comprehensive. I am pleased to say that I have had a direct assurance from the commission that that will be the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_211">As the Minister and the House will know, allegations have been made of predatory pricing and unfair behaviour to suppliers. If they are proven, they must be exposed and dealt with properly. It is in the interest of retailers and consumers alike that those claims are investigated thoroughly because, in the end, if the final report produced after 18 months or two years is not trusted by the market, the danger is that we shall face calls for a fourth inquiry into the market. That would not be good for retailers, large or small, or for consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_212">Equally, in addition to the role of the Government and business, it is the responsibility of small independent retailers to respond to changing consumer demand and to seek out and develop the new market. Most of them already do, but there is a need to encourage firms constantly to seek to improve and not to assume that the Government can always protect them from open competition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_213">Consumers need to realise that they have a vital part to play in the shopping world. Many consumers rightly say that they value their small local shops. If they do, they have a responsibility towards them. After all, it is their spending power that can make the difference. They must recognise that if they genuinely value their local shops, they must use them. Indeed, that is one of the reasons I have endorsed the excellent campaigns by the <i>Evening Standard</i> and, more recently, by Friends of the Earth, which have encouraged people to use their local shops more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_214">The second issue is the growing concern about instances of alleged chip and pin fraud. This week, we have heard that hundreds of customers at garage forecourts have had their details stolen as they paid for petrol using their chip cards and pin numbers. Those incidents highlight the need for customers to make sure that they do not allow the advent of new technology to lull them into a false sense of security&#151;as the Home Office knows, no IT system is completely foolproof. However, it is vital that consumers have confidence that the systems they use are generally secure. Given the clear public interest, will the Minister tell the House what action his Department is taking to establish the nature 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 558</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of the problem, what steps might be taken to minimise it and how the industry intends to maintain consumer confidence in what is after all a relatively new scheme? In particular, does he intend to meet APACS&#151;the Association for Payment Clearing Services&#151;to establish the facts? If not, I urge him to try to do so, although I appreciate that these are early days in his job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para16">
<a name="stpa_215">I turn to some of the Government&#039;s proposals to rationalise the process of consumer advice, advocacy and redress. In principle, there appear to be considerable benefits from such a move. However, there are a number of points on which we shall seek clarification and reassurance, not just today but as the Bill is debated and implemented. Indeed, the implementation timetable is one of the issues that concerns me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para17">
<a name="stpa_216">The Government have set out a timetable for consumer voice to be established as a shadow body by November 2007&#151;the Minister alluded to that earlier&#151;which will take up its full responsibilities by January 2009. Significant changes of that nature cannot and should not be rushed, but I would welcome, either today or when he has had the chance to consider them carefully, the Minister&#039;s views on the matter, especially on the measures that will be taken to avoid policy and management drift over what could be a three-year period as the existing system is phased out and the new one phased in. What arrangements will be made to ensure that staff are aware of the status of their employment so that they can concentrate properly on implementing the new scheme effectively? A distracted and unmotivated staff is in no one&#039;s interests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para18">
<a name="stpa_217">The Government hope that one result of a consolidated advocacy and redress system will be to deliver better value for money. Incidentally, I enjoyed the Minister&#039;s vociferous starter for 100 at the beginning of his speech and I look forward to similar exchanges of a partisan nature. On a non-partisan point, however, can the Minister give me an assurance that the attempt to seek better value for money is not actually a cost-cutting exercise and that there will be no net reduction in the resources dedicated to consumer support?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para19">
<a name="stpa_218">As the Government contend in their document, the new joint association will be both large and powerful and will thus enhance the voice of the consumer in Government, which could prove helpful. However, there is a risk that other equally legitimate bodies could be marginalised in that policy development; for example, the Consumers Association and Citizens Advice, both of which are highly respected organisations. They have gained tremendous experience over the years and are trusted by the public. They perform a useful role and it will be important for the Government to make a clear commitment that such independent bodies are not crowded out by the Government&#039;s new, substantial advocacy body.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para20">
<a name="stpa_219">What assurances can the Minister give me that the body will not prove overly dominant in both the advice and representation roles envisaged in the consultation document? Equally, it will be vital for the credibility of consumer voice that it is seen to be independent of, with the ability to dissent from, Government. Is the Minister satisfied that the structural arrangements proposed will provide that degree of impartiality and independence? The Government plan a range of options for the structure of consumer voice. Can the Minister give us an 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 559</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>indication of their preferred option, and can he assure us that the views of all those consulted will be properly taken into account in reaching that conclusion?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para21">
<a name="stpa_220">I think that the Minister alluded to this in his remarks, so I suspect that he will accept that an effective enforcement and sanctions system is only one of the ways in which responsible business practice can be ensured. Given the earlier comments about the Hampton review and the need to target energy on enforcement, what action will the Government take to encourage suppliers to manage complaints effectively, as well as to impose sanctions when they do not? After all, I very often think that carrots prove more effective than sticks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para22">
<a name="stpa_221">I would also welcome the Minister&#039;s views on how consumer emergencies will be handled. If a utility company, for example, fails to make urgent repairs, principal redress seems to lie in an ombudsman system and will very often occur some months after the event. Frankly, that is of little help to the people affected. Last year, Energywatch dealt with 280,000 such problems. Does the Minister, like me, understand that there is a possible danger that those consumers will be simply stranded by the proposed new system, which will work very differently from the current system?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para23">
<a name="stpa_222">Will the Minister offer further clarification about where responsibility for consumer education will lie? We touched on that issue earlier, when the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who is sadly not in his place now, asked a question about it in the context of the financial services sector. What will be the role of consumer voice, given the existing role of the Office of Fair Trading? In particular, how will consumer voice co-ordinate its new role in educating consumers, which is anticipated by the Government, with the OFT&#039;s mandate to promote a &quot;national consumer education strategy&quot;?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para24">
<a name="stpa_223">Informed and empowered consumers benefit us all. They can use their knowledge and spending power to get what is best for them and their families, and they are better able to avoid fraudsters and conmen. They can both encourage producers and retailers to raise their standards and businesses to innovate and respond to their needs. Where consumers recognise the wider social value of, for example, a healthy high street, they can support good local shops, which very often form the focus of both our rural and our urban communities. That is why effective competition and consumer laws are important to a modern economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para25">
<a name="stpa_224">The Government have stated that their ambition is to create the best consumer regime by 2008. That is a good ambition, if it is tempered by a recognition that consumers&#039; rights must be balanced with responsibilities and, frankly, that each of us&#151;the Government, business and consumer&#151;share those responsibilities. But effective consumer policy must also balance the rights of the consumer with a healthy attitude to vigorous but fair competition and a recognition that, if we hamper business with unnecessary rules and regulations, none of our worthy ambitions can be realised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-23_para26">
<a name="stpa_225">I look forward to hearing from the Minister&#151;whether at the end of the debate or in writing&#151;on the points I have made, and I certainly look forward to what I can see will be a lively debate, as the Bill is developed and presented to the House.

<p><a name="st_185"><a name="60511-24_spnew0"><b> Sir Robert Smith  (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</b> 
 I, too, welcome the debate as a chance to take forward the issue of consumers and the important role that empowering consumers can play in helping not only the individual but the economy, business and the general well-being of society. Creating confident consumers clearly not only needs informed consumers and fair competition, but for consumers to have the tools to make use of the information&#151;the numeracy and literacy skills and the understanding of risk&#151;because what goes wrong with many products and what causes many problems for consumers is that the person who is doing the selling can take advantage of their misunderstanding of the risk profile of what is being sold. A good consumer regime will benefit business and allow good businesses to thrive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_226">The Minister touched on the structure of the Department of Trade and Industry, and we still believe that a separate Department of consumer affairs would put the voice of the consumer very much at the heart of Government and separate out the Department&#039;s responsibilities for advocating the needs of business and consumers. In reply to my intervention, the Minister said that he would write further on the subject of the consumer and trading standards agency, but if the agency is to be effective it must be effectively resourced, and it must be brought together in a way that ensures that the sum of the parts is greater than that of the individual organisations that make it up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_227">As the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) has made clear, the Competition Commission&#039;s welcome reinvestigation of supermarkets will help consumers by ensuring that there is a fair and level playing field for local shops. I reinforce the message that if the local shop is valued, it will be used. The shop will be there only if consumers are there to make use of it. Competition is one way in which consumers can benefit. The liberalisation of the car market and the opening up to competition of the sale of cars has improved the rights of consumers. They have benefited from price reductions and a more open market. Making sure that there is effective and open competition can often be the way to benefit consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_228">Consumers can also ensure the delivery of other concerns. A consumer&#039;s decision is the sum of all sorts of different interests that they have when they go out to buy a product, such as the price and the benefit of the product to them. Consumers also quite often have a wider interest. The fair trade movement has shown that those who are concerned about the conditions of suppliers in less developed countries can influence behaviour through their consumption. However, they need to be informed. The Minister should reconsider the Government&#039;s decision to abandon the operating and financial review requirements of company law that would have forced companies to make sure that consumers had information on how they traded and operated. That would have meant that the market was more informed. As he recognises, informed consumers are able to make those decisions. If consumers do not have all the facts to enable them to assert their views, they will miss out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_229">I welcome the Consumer Direct approach, which means that the informed consumer knows where to go to access information to take up their case and to make 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 561</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>their case more strongly. Clearly, that organisation is guiding many consumers to the right place to assert their rights. Many consumers are able to assert their own rights, but I am concerned about the &quot;consumer voice&quot; role. In certain specialist areas&#151;particularly energy and the postal services&#151;where complex nationalised monopolies have been regulated and privatised and complex markets are involved, we need to be careful about the loss of individual advocacy. The Government may want to reconsider to ensure that less informed consumers and vulnerable consumers, who cannot assert their own rights, do not lose out; I shall come back to the energy sector in that context. If consumers have to rely on an ombudsman scheme, they have to access that scheme. The great benefit of what Energywatch and Postwatch have done in the past is that they have taken up individual problems on behalf of consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_230">We need to look at the effectiveness of delivery in a wide area of consumer concerns. The telephone preference service assists people who face unwanted calls. People register with that service. However, what is being done to deliver what those people want? People still get the calls, and then they make a complaint. Some of the top companies have 1,800 complaints against them, but still have not faced a fine for breaking the rules of the telephone preference service. Clearly, consumers are trying to make use of a service to assert their rights, but the Information Commissioner needs more effective powers and resources to deliver what the consumer wants from the telephone preference service.
</p>





<p><a name="st_186"><a name="60511-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Prisk: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman think that the problem is resources, or sanctions?
</p>





<p><a name="st_187"><a name="60511-24_spnew2"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 It is a mixture of both. The Information Commissioner&#039;s department is snowed under with freedom of information inquiries, so he may well have a resource problem. If he had effective resources, he might be able to make use of the sanctions and fines. However, as fines have not been levied, he might need more powers to make it easier to impose sanctions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_231">I have a worry about the regulation of financial services. There have been attempts to protect consumers from buying products that are not suitable, or do not deliver what is expected, and to ensure that consumers are informed. However, as financial products become more effectively regulated, it is possible to link them more imaginatively to products that are less regulated. Financial products for buy-to-let might be well regulated, but the information that a person gets about the underlying property, such as its value and the likely expectations built into the product, might well be less regulated and effectively delivered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_232">As the world becomes ever more complex, it is important that regulators are able to see beyond the part of a product that they are regulating and examine the underlying substance of what is being sold to the consumer so that consumers can make informed and effective decisions. We could, as a nanny state, stop people from making their own choices, but we should not do that. If people want to expose themselves to high-risk property speculation, they should be able to do so, but they should do that in an informed way, with the knowledge that the underlying product is at risk.

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_233">The Government have not only the role of enforcement and ensuring that the right regulations and systems are in place, but the fundamental role of setting an example through the way in which they deal with consumers. A classic example of the way in which the Government are setting a bad example is the Post Office card account. Consumers took out the account in good faith and the belief that it would be a permanent product. They did not know that behind the scenes the Department for Work and Pensions had always assumed that the accounts would come to an end in 2010. The Government preach to the private sector that they should treat customers in an open and transparent way, but they are setting a poor example.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_234">The Minister talked about the danger of over-indebtedness. The Government need to understand that many people use the card account specifically to avoid the risk of over-indebtedness. Many such people have a bank account for savings, but choose to use the card account for their regular budgeting, in part because they know that they are at absolutely no risk of being exposed to charges, or &#163;20 or &#163;30 letters from the bank to tell them that they are overdrawn. The preferable option would be to keep the card account, but if the Government are not going to, they must ensure that there is a Post Office product in place that offers the same protection from indebtedness as the card account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_235">The Government could have given a lead to industry with the way in which they treated the ombudsman&#039;s report on pensions. However, given the way in which they rejected the report quickly and summarily, what kind of example did they set to the wider industry on how it should respond to an ombudsman service, which is the Government&#039;s preferred solution to ensure that there is effective dispute resolution?
</p>





<p><a name="st_188"><a name="60511-24_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bone: </b> 
 The Minister made the case for ombudsmen very clear. He said that an ombudsman would protect vulnerable people because they would not have to pay for the service or abide by it. He said that the big organisation would have to pay for the service and be bound by the decision. That would be great, but it does not happen with the parliamentary ombudsman.
</p>





<p><a name="st_189"><a name="60511-24_spnew4"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 The Government seem to have two standards: one for business outside, and another for the way in which they act when consumers deal with Government Departments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_236">Experiences in the energy sector throw up various aspects of the way in which consumers can influence and make decisions. Everyone says that it is a no-brainer that consumers will benefit from improving the insulation of their houses, yet we still find it difficult to promote conservation and energy efficiency. Perhaps that is because consumers do not necessarily have confidence in, or information about, the product, or because they do not trust those selling it. One may have a good solution, but unless the market is well informed and consumers are confident, one cannot deliver it. The market may not be the only means of delivering measures such as energy efficiency. Building regulations and minimum standards set by the Government are still important in delivering good-quality products to the market.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_237">As has been said, Energywatch offers an important advocacy service for individuals. It would be a great mistake, however, to assume that every individual has the skills and powers to make use of an ombudsman service. In the telecommunications sector, people must wait 12 weeks before being allowed access to the ombudsman, Otelo. If people are about to be cut off, that is far too long to wait to resolve the problem. Some of 87 per cent. of Energywatch&#039;s cases are dealt with within seven weeks, but under an ombudsman scheme there would be an additional five-week wait before the resolution process even began.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_238">It is extremely important that the Minister should look at the consultation to see whether the new regime can maintain an advocacy service for individuals and provide a more robust ombudsman scheme, following the initiative with Scottish and Southern Energy. If Energywatch receives a complaint from a consumer about Scottish and Southern, it works with the company to fast-track the complaint and refer it within two weeks. That is different from the traditional ombudsman&#039;s role, but it is a much faster way of resolving disputes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_239">The role of citizens advice bureaux has been mentioned. The decoupling of the work on individual complaints from the role as a general advocate for the consumer could lead to a loss of touch with the coalface. Because Members of Parliament deal with individual cases, we can start to see patterns emerging. If we deal with a significant amount of Child Support Agency casework we realise that we cannot solve the problem by tackling the failure of bureaucracy&#151;there is an underlying policy failure. Similarly, consumer advocates such as Energywatch, Postwatch and so on can build up a picture from the cases with which they deal and identify problems in the sector. They act as a general advocate, but their work is informed by individual experience. The Government must look at the way in which the consumer voice is heard so that the consumer experience is understood.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060511/debtext/60511-25.htm"/>




<p><a name="st_190"><a name="60511-25_spnew0"><b> Mr. Prisk: </b> 
 Given the strong role that the Government anticipate for the consumer voice and the development of policy, is it not equally important to set out the role of citizens advice bureaux, the Consumers Association and others in any legislation that is introduced, so that their detailed experience and on-the-ground contact is not lost in policy development?
</p>





<p><a name="st_191"><a name="60511-25_spnew1"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 It is important to set out that role. If consumer voice informs policy making, it should not become a judge of its own advice. If it advocates a strategy that the Government take on board, but that strategy fails to deliver, it may not be the most effective advocate, given that its original advice will have been wrong. Someone who handles cases day to day will know whether the strategy is working, so their voice needs to be heard in the system. The Government must make sure that people who deal with individual cases have a strong voice that informs policy making. Finally, I welcome the concept of informed consumers as an important aspect of delivering fair competition and effective business. However, I reinforce my view that that cannot be delivered if we throw away effective advocacy for individuals who cannot pursue a case on their own.

<a name="stpa_240">It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith), who made some powerful points. I shall deal with some that he did not mention. The debate is entitled &quot;Creating confident consumers&quot; and we could probably discuss such an enormous subject until midnight. Introducing the debate, the Minister had a go at the Conservative manifesto, when he said that we would drastically cut back the Department of Trade and Industry. As I understand it, unless he has changed his mind, the Department&#039;s numbers are to be cut by 30 per cent. If we are trying to create confident consumers and increasing protection, will the Department have the resources to do it? Perhaps the Minister could deal with that when he winds up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_241">We speak of consumer confidence as though it applies to the private sector. Of course, it is equally important in the public sector, and that has not been discussed today. Children are perhaps the most vulnerable consumers. They are consumers of education, and they have the right to be confident that they are safe where they are being taught, yet the Minister could not give me an assurance that all future schools would be protected by sprinkler systems. That would protect consumers and build confidence. One of the problems may be that the Government are prepared to undertake prevention, but not reaction. However, the topic may not be entirely germane to the debate.

<p><a name="st_193"><a name="60511-25_spnew3"><b> Mr. McCartney: </b>

The problem is that the Government did not provide the resources or allow time to register people in the security industry, so for some months, the industry has been in flux. People who should be registered are not registered, and people who are acting illegally should be closed down. It is rather a mess. When consumer legislation is introduced, I urge that enough time should be allowed for the right regulation to be enforced and that it is not rushed through.

<p>
<a name="60511-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_243">Creating confident consumers in the health service is particularly important. Back in November, the Prime Minister gave a guarantee to consumers of the health service that nobody would have to wait more than six months for an in-patient operation at an NHS hospital. The Government failed to meet that in November, December, January or February. The number of people waiting more than six months is growing.

Should there not be a method whereby they can be transferred to another hospital for an immediate operation, given compensation or treated in the private sector?

Members across the country hear the same comments&#151;that they are dealing with more and more debt management problems. Unfortunately, some of those are coming about because vulnerable people have been given tax credits, have found that they have been overpaid and are being asked to pay back thousands of pounds. I have had people in my constituency office in tears, saying, &quot;I can&#039;t possibly meet these bills&#151;what are my options? Am I going to go bankrupt? I can&#039;t sleep. My marriage is on the line.&quot; Those problems are being sorted out by local citizens advice bureaux. I was horrified to learn that no Government money goes directly to them, but only to the national organisation. If the Minister wants to improve debt management, and I think that he genuinely does, I am not sure that creating a semi-state advice centre is the way forward. That money should be given directly to local citizens advice bureaux, which have the great advantage of being seen to be completely independent of the state and of business, and will give impartial advice. That would represent a change in attitude from the Government, who always seem to think that they can impose from the top, whereas this would be a great solution from the bottom upwards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_246">The Minister is right to say that ombudsmen have a significant role to play in protecting vulnerable people if the banks do someone wrong, as they often do. The process may be lengthy and frustrating, but it does not cost anything, and ultimately the bank is bound by it but the person is not&#151;they can still challenge the ombudsman&#039;s decision through the court if they are not happy with it.

<a name="60511-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_247">I fail to see why the Government cannot accept that principle when it comes to themselves. They are the only organisation&#151;the most powerful organisation in the land&#151;who, when they are found guilty of maladministration, say, &quot;Sorry, but we don&#039;t agree; we&#039;re not guilty&quot; I am sure that half the time banks do not think that they are guilty of maladministration, but they still have to pay up. If the Minister could go back and say, &quot;We&#039;ve been unfair to these pensioners&quot;, I think that the country would say, &quot;This Labour Government are beginning to listen.&quot; However, I fear that that will not happen.

<a name="60511-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_248">I should like to talk mainly about the travel industry, which I have been involved in for several years. When it first developed, many years ago, people had to pay a fortune to go abroad, and only the rich travelled. Then came the invention of the package holiday, Freddie Laker and the Association of British Travel Agents. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 566</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>People went into their local travel agent, looked at brochures, and picked a holiday. If the holiday company went bust, they were covered either by ABTA or the ATOL&#151;air travel organiser&#039;s licence&#151;system. Everybody had consumer confidence, and in a highly competitive industry, no consumer ever lost out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_249">Now, the travel industry has moved on. People do not necessarily go to their local travel agent because they are able to book online or by telephone. A system called dynamic packaging has been introduced, whereby people do not book a package holiday but book the airline, hotel and car separately. It is also called split contracting. The problem with that system is that if any provider of the travel arrangements goes bust, the consumer is most unlikely to be covered by protection. If they have booked online, they are not covered in any form whatsoever. They will have an element of protection if they happen to have paid by credit card, but most people do not like to do that because they have to pay a fee on top of the cost of the holiday. If a major low-cost airline were to go bust, many thousands of people would lose out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_250">The waters have been muddied even further by the European Union. There is an EU directive on travel that is so incomprehensible that I am sure that the Department of Trade and Industry does not understand it, let alone local travel agents and consumers. All the EU has done is confuse matters. People could book a holiday to America on an American airline, which might fly under chapter 11 protection. In other words, it might be bankrupt. Many consumers in this country are likely, sooner or later, to lose a great deal of money. I fear that the Government will be blamed for sitting on their hands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_251">The travel industry has welcomed a proposal to charge a levy of &#163;1 on every ticket, thus building up a fund. Every consumer would then be covered. It is a simple solution that does not require all sorts of bonding or ATOLs. People would be covered whether they booked through an ABTA agency or online. Such consumer protection would give people great confidence. I urge the Minister to consider that because the travel industry is highly competitive and produces great value for money. In the past, when big firms have gone bust, all consumers have been protected. I fear that, although we still have the highly competitive industry, we also have difficult times because of higher fuel costs and the possibility of booking with airlines that fly under bankruptcy protection, and consumers could lose a lot of money.

 First, I apologise to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and to my right hon. Friend the Minister for missing part of the opening speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_254">The debate is important and well informed, and there is a measure of agreement between all parties on some of the issues. I want to speak about the role of information in creating confident consumers and mechanisms for protecting them. I also want to speak about my trade union interests and those who supply the consumer with information. Consumers can be confident only if those who serve them are well trained and motivated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_255">It is obvious that consumers need access to adequate information to be confident. In several services&#151;for example, financial services&#151;that we all use, such information is not available. Most of us are used to the plethora of credit card letters on our door step every morning that offer us many different deals, structures and so on. That does not inform consumers, it simply bewilders them. One of the problems with financial services is that, although we have a system of necessary regulation, we have no system of standardising the important parts of product information. I hope that my right hon. Friend, as Minister responsible, will consider the matter. The Treasury Committee recommended that in one of its most recent reports and I strongly endorse the recommendation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_256">Let us consider food provision. We have perhaps become a more cranky and individualistic society in many ways. That is healthy and what consumers should do when there is choice. We have taken huge steps forward on food labelling, some of which have been absolutely vital. Some of my children have specific allergies, and they need the protection that proper labelling can provide. One of my daughters has an allergy to corn, for example, and it is important for her to know when a particular food product contains corn. We have made advances in the provision of information on food products, but we have not yet gone far enough to give consumers the confidence to make these choices. There may be personal moral choices involved&#151;for vegetarians, for example&#151;or health choices.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_257">I urge my right hon. Friend the Minister to consider one particular anomaly in the food production system. It is perhaps a difficult question, but it is worth examining. It involves the big gap that now exists between the producers of food sold through shops and those who produce for the restaurant or caf&#233; trade. Food labelling in restaurants and caf&#233;s is still virtually non-existent, and we need to look at that issue if we are to offer adequate protection to the public.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_258">I agree with the points made by Opposition Members about what we should be looking for in our systems of regulation.

The same arguments apply to the other utilities and energy industries.
</p>

<a name="60511-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_259">I have a great deal of sympathy with the points made by Opposition Members on the role of Energywatch. When we change the way in which we protect consumers, we must be careful not to throw away the advantage of the personal service that Energywatch has provided. We must recognise that we need that type of direct advocacy service when dealing with the large utilities. Perhaps we can manage to retain that, with Consumer Direct as well. It should not impossible to ensure the continuation of the good work that Energywatch has done in the past.

<a name="60511-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_260">In some industries, regulation is not yet up to speed. Legal services have been mentioned in that regard. I have never been a great fan of the Law Society being the regulator of solicitors when complaints are made against them. We need to look at how we regulate such services. Fortunately, most of us use them only rarely, but it can be very stressful for people when things do go wrong. I am sure that all Members of Parliament have had that experience.

<a name="stpa_261">Many years ago, I had a fairly detailed knowledge of the building trade.

It is difficult to determine how much and what kind of regulation we should have such industries, and I am prepared to accept that sometimes the most appropriate regulation can be provided from within the      industry. However, those services are not comprehensively regulated at the moment.

<a name="stpa_262">There are interesting examples from other countries, in which membership of a trade association is mandatory, and that may or may not be a way forward here. I can see the value of such an arrangement, because trade associations can help to inspire confidence by providing properly structured trade agreements that offer the necessary protection. The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) mentioned his own experience in that regard. Such an arrangement could serve as a model for the building trade.

<a name="60511-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_263">My right hon. Friend the Minister mentioned shop workers and Sunday trading. It is axiomatic that, if we are to create consumer confidence, our consumers need to be served by well motivated, well trained staff, be they shop workers or people who work in the hospitality industry. We still have some way to go in this country in relation to changing public attitudes towards people who serve in those roles. Unlike in the United States, their jobs are sometimes seen as menial. However, many of our constituents now look to those industries for employment, and we need to guarantee that they will have a system of career development through properly structured training schemes. Trade unions have a strong role to play in that form of training and education.

 The hon. Gentleman is right that where companies clearly abuse their position, they must be dealt with thoroughly and properly. Does he also accept, however, that one of the ways in which we can change behaviour among businesses is to use the carrot rather than the stick; to show that, for many businesses, customers value good service, which therefore provides a competitive advantage? That language might be more likely to encourage the vast majority of people involved in business and in providing services, public or private, to up their game?

 I probably did not explain my original point fully&#151;I was talking about the customer, not the company. Assaults on shop workers are, I hope, rarely done by their employer; it is not a good motivational technique in the modern world. <i>[Laughter.]</i> We certainly know of cases in which shop workers have been assaulted by irate customers, and all of us have probably been irate customers from time to time, but that is not an excuse to subject those who provide such service to physical or verbal abuse.

<p>
<a name="60511-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_265">The hon.

<a name="stpa_266">Finally, I want to refer to the debate about the consultation on Sunday trading. My right hon. Friend the Minister, who is new to his job, must take a dispassionate, neutral attitude. However, I do not feel that I must be neutral or dispassionate. We altered the laws on Sunday trading only 12 years ago. At the time, a compromise was struck between those who argued from different perspectives, ranging from those who wanted no Sunday trading whatever to those who wanted total deregulation. That compromise recognised the different feelings in society. Of course, society is not static, so there is no inevitability that we will stay where we are for ever. Not enough has changed in those 12 years, however, to alter that fundamental compromise.

 Does the hon. Gentleman recall that when we debated this issue 12 years ago we had a free vote? Does he wish, as I do, that when we eventually get round to voting on the issue again, whichever view we take, it will be a free vote, not one divided on party lines?
</p>





<p><a name="st_201"><a name="60511-27_spnew1"><b> Tony Lloyd: </b> 
 Most of us are pragmatic and believe in a free vote when it guarantees that our side wins the vote. I may have to allow the argument to develop a little before I come down on one side or the other. This type of debate raises some genuine issues, and our approach should be to try to build the largest consensus. I think that we have a consensus at the moment. I have family members who work in the retail industry and who make the point to me that they quite like to work on Sundays. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 570</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>That is okay; it is what they choose. However, they like to work on the present Sunday, not a Sunday that might ultimately look like every other shopping day of the week. Keeping Sunday as a rather different day of the week is not necessarily to pander to ultra-Sabbatarians but to recognise that our way of life is best protected if our ordered week at least maintains something of the present character.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_267">I live in the middle of one of the most bustling cities in Britain, in the area where arguably such considerations apply least. Nevertheless, people still value the fact that one day of the week is a little different, and shop workers want to maintain the benefits of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_268">It could be said that the argument is not about the interests of consumers but about those of the very large stores, which still believe that they can gain a competitive advantage if they can open for longer on Sundays. That is questionable. It may not be in the interests of consumers if the result of longer opening hours for the large operators is smaller distributors being squeezed out of the industry. Interestingly, Tesco, which was one of the leading advocates of a change in the regulation of Sunday hours, has withdrawn from the deregulation coalition. I do not know why that is, but I am pleased that Tesco may have realised that it is not in its corporate interest to advocate a change that would be unpopular with the public.

A key aspect of that fundamental renaissance is bringing sustainable local businesses back to communities. This Government have pumped, and continue to pump, billions of pounds into the renaissance not just of our cities, but our out-of-town areas, villages and estates, all of which the previous Government abandoned.

<a name="stpa_285">There were some problems on the security industry registration. Let us be straight about this. The vast majority of people not being registered could not be registered because of their criminal record. The point of introducing the registration scheme was to clean up the act and stop the industry being undermined by cowboys. This is a good industry. It is a good employer and an international industry. It provides global public and private services from the United Kingdom. It will continue to grow as we need the services of that industry in many areas. When I first raised the issue, the industry was worried, but it now has a protection that will help it expand and offer new services here, in Europe and beyond.

<a name="stpa_286">I am proud that there are people in my community who are not registered. They should never have been in the industry in the first place. I am glad they are out of it and will not get back into it. Those who are in the industry can now join a union and get better pay and training. The training system is recognised. There is security in the industry. Those working in it have a skill and can be respected. Many of those who work in it, particularly door security people, are good, skilled and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, on occasions they face violence caused by drink or other reasons. Because the industry has been cleaned up and because these people have skills, knowledge and a clean record, the industry as a whole will flourish. I am pleased about that, as I hope the hon.

I hope that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents have now registered and have a career. I am sure that they have. Over the years many of my constituents have just had to say goodbye to their holiday. We will come back to that because it is a good tale to tell about that industry too. Mistakes can and do happen, unfortunately. We have lots of regimes so that whenever there is a mistake, there is a remedy for it&#151;not just a legal or financial remedy. The big issue is getting cultural change within business systems and organisations to prevent mistakes in the first place. Rather than a remedy afterwards, prevention is always the best policy. Where that breaks down because of human or business frailty, whether public or private business failure, there must be a remedy.

An average wait in hospital during the winter months under the Conservatives could be 20, 21, 22 or 24 hours. Take your pick. There have been substantial changes in the NHS. It is a good news story.

 While the Minister is preparing his release for the trade press, I want to return to the important point about the difference between local citizens advice bureaux and the national organisation. The people who work in my local bureau, for instance, worry that money given by the Government is often held at the national association level. Some support is given with computer systems, for example, but my experience is that many local bureaux&#151;which are funded by local authorities of all political persuasions&#151;rarely see the benefit of that money, even though they bear the burden of the work. Does the Minister understand the distinction between the local bureaux and the national organisation? They are not the same thing.

<p><a name="st_226"><a name="60511-29_spnew6"><b> Mr. McCartney: </b> 
 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, but I stick to what I said. All the new local bureaux services being rolled out across the country are funded directly. The national organisation redistributes the resources that the Government make available, according to where the money is needed. No one would expect the Government to meddle in that. The partnership agreement requires that the national organisation distributes resources and provides services in a way that achieves value for money, but local funding is provided, by agreement, where that is deemed to be more suitable. We are committed to the massive new local investment that I described, and the organisation has made it clear that it is delighted at the huge increase in its capacity to deal with clients in local communities and to help vulnerable people who get into unnecessary debt.

I first became involved as a Member of the Scottish Parliament for the South of Scotland region.

 I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents, who clearly feel aggrieved, but is there not a quid pro quo? Although the Tweed flows in England and would be subject to Environment Agency rod licensing in normal circumstances, anglers are effectively exempt from paying for that licence, as a quid pro quo for the similar but converse situation in Scotland. Is that a balancing factor in the debate? I am genuinely interested, and I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman can inform the House.

<p><a name="st_231"><a name="60511-30_spnew3"><b> David Mundell: </b> 
 I can inform the hon. Gentleman on two points. First, as has been confirmed again today in the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Executive have no plan at all to introduce rod licences in Scotland on any river for which they have responsibility, including the Tweed. Secondly, even though parts of the Tweed are physically in England, people fishing on those parts of the river are not required to pay for rod licences. The hon. Gentleman highlights the important point that an accommodation has been reached to avoid an incredibly complicated situation where different regimes might apply to either bank of a river. That accommodation has been put in statute in some ways, but it is mostly informal and there is no particular reason why it should not apply the other way around. It probably dates back to some border reiving activity, which is probably the ultimate historical origin of the choice of which authority covers which river.
</p>





<p><a name="st_232"><a name="60511-30_spnew4"><b> Martin Salter: </b> 
 Particularly in salmon rivers in Scotland and elsewhere, it is common practice to wade across the river to fish a pool on the other side and back again, so the hon.

Again, the hon. Gentleman highlights an important point that has arisen recently: the Environment Agency&#039;s capacity to prosecute those who do not have rod licences through the Scottish courts, when its framework is geared for England and Wales. I will refer to that later. There have been some recent instances of prosecutions that have not been proceeded with, and although the Environment Agency claims that it has the right and ability to proceed with those prosecutions, the suggestion is that it has drawn back because the law may be over-complex. Again, that reinforces in my mind the need for a solution that can commend itself to all interested parties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_312">I cannot accept, however, that is it equitable that a rod licensing regime should apply to the Esk when one is not applied to any other river in Scotland and, as I have just indicated, there is no plan to introduce any. None of the issues that have been raised by the Environment Agency justify the introduction of the licensing regime. Indeed, I find the issue of the costs and recovery of costs a particularly ironic one, since so much money must have been spent on dealing with the local dispute and the questions and correspondence from myself and others, that the sum raised through the licences cannot come even close to the cost of introducing them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_313">My preference today would be for the Minister to announce that the Environment Agency has indicated that it has thought again and will not now continue to proceed with the rod licensing regime on the Esk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_314">However, having received his letter and the Environment Agency briefing, and having pursued this matter over many years, I am realistic enough to know that that is not likely to happen. As was the case when I met the Minister, I am genuinely seeking a solution within the legislation that will allow the Environment Agency to meet what I consider to be its tick-box requirements, but which will also allow my constituents to fish on the River Esk without making the payments that others in Scotland do not have to make, without individual rod licence payments and without fear of prosecution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_315">The solution that I suggest is one that I raised during my meeting with the Minister on 12 October. It has been the subject of discussions in the Esk and Liddle Improvement Association. It would allow a form of general licence to be granted to the association. That provision is allowed under section 25 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975. That could allow any angler, including a child or pensioner, with a valid Esk and Liddle Improvement Association fishing permit to be covered by the general licence granted to the association. Of course, any angler who does not have a valid fishing permit from the association would not be covered by the exemption and would have to have a rod licence. I accept that if we are going to have rod licences, that would be the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_316">The Environment Agency briefing anticipates that request by pointing out that a general licence is not usually an alternative to a charging scheme, and fees are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>based on the number of people who would wish to fish under the licence. However, the Act also makes it clear, as a special provision, that the Environment Agency has the power to waive rod licence duty when it deems that there is a special case. What more special case could there be than a river that is physically in another jurisdiction and is the only one flowing outwith England and Wales within the remit of the Environment Agency? The Border Esk is like no other river under the control of the Environment Agency and so I believe that it falls within the definition of a special case in the legislation. That would allow the general licence to be granted without the payment of a fee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_317">The Environment Agency is very keen on the letter of the law, and there can be no doubt that the legislation makes provision to enable it to waive the fee for a general rod licence for the Esk and Liddle Improvement Association. That would provide a solution that would meet the Environment Agency&#039;s stated requirement that the rod licensing regime should apply on the river, but it would also ensure that local anglers on the River Esk were treated the same as other anglers in Scotland in relation to the payment of rod licensing fees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_318">I would have hoped that the Minister and the Environment Agency would welcome the association&#039;s efforts to encourage fishing among young people by a favourable licensing policy for that group, and for retired people too, to allow them to continue to participate in angling. Those initiatives are to be welcomed, not stifled by petty bureaucracy. Only last week, the Environment Agency said how important fishing was in diverting young people from antisocial behaviour. Apparently, the agency hopes to attract 200,000 extra young people to the sport by 2015. According to the statement to the media on the matter, all those extra 200,000 people are to be in England and Wales. If one reads Environment Agency documents, one realises that they generally make no recognition of the Border Esk. Clearly, that reflects the reality that the Border Esk is an anomaly in the Environment Agency. That is another reason why it is a special case and should be treated differently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_319">One thing that must come out of the situation is a review of the way in which the Environment Agency has conducted itself. It has been a public relations disaster, which surely has been to no one&#039;s benefit. I was a little surprised that the Minister&#039;s letter of 3 November 2005 to Baroness Young stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;We (and no doubt you) would regard approaches to the press on the lines of &#039;MUNDELL GETS DEFRA/EA TO BACK OFF OVER ROD LICENCE DUTIES ON THE BORDER ESK&#039; as entirely inappropriate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_320">For me, the issue has been about getting not headlines, but a fair and equitable situation on the Esk. No one is more disappointed than I am that headlines have been easy to obtain. Adverse headlines have appeared about the Environment Agency, such as the latest in the <i>Eskdale and Liddesdale Advertiser</i> of 27 April, which read: &quot;Esk Fishing Licence Cases Are Dropped.&quot; I would prefer to move towards a solution to the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-30_para17">
<a name="stpa_321">I am at an absolute loss to understand how the Environment Agency believes that it has benefited from not carrying out effective communication with stakeholders on the Scottish part of the Border Esk and why it thought that a brusque and unrelentingly strident line would achieve its goals. Even in the letter that was 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 584</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>faxed to me from the Minister this morning, the Environment Agency says that it wants undertakings about the way in which it will be portrayed in any future discussions on the matter. I am sure that those undertakings can and will be given, but the requirement seems to strike at the heart of the issue. The agency has been more worried about the way in which it is perceived than about fishing on the Esk. At the same time, its stock, rather than the fishing stock, has plummeted. That is why I hope that the agency can now move forward without any baggage and discuss the proposal that I have put on the table this evening of a general licence for the Esk and Liddle Improvement Association with no fee under the special case provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-30_para18">
<a name="stpa_322">Whether or not I get the response for which my constituents would hope, it has been extremely important to put the issue and their concerns once again on public record. I express my gratitude for the opportunity of doing so and await with interest what the Minister has to say.

<p><a name="st_234"><a name="60511-31_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </b> 
 May I start by apologising to the hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell)? Despite my writing to him back at the end of November, following our October meeting, to promise that I would contact him again when I had heard from the Environment Agency, that did not happen until earlier today. Following our meeting, I did, as promised, write to Barbara Young, the chief executive of the Environment Agency, to ask her to consider the hon. Gentleman&#039;s request about the possibility of granting a general licence to fishers on the Scottish side of the Esk. She replied on 21 February with an offer from the Environment Agency to meet him and representatives of the Border Esk&#039;s fisheries interests to discuss the possibility of a general licence. I apologise that the letter got lost in the system and was not sent to the hon. Gentleman. He alluded in his speech to the fact that it came to my attention only when I met officials yesterday to discuss the debate, so I am extremely sorry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_323">As the hon. Gentleman will have seen from the letter&#151;I hope that he has had a little time to digest it&#151;its offer is not without conditions. The agency requires an assurance that the fisheries interests will not try to portray its willingness to meet and discuss the matter as indicative of any change to its position that the Border Esk and its Scottish tributaries are managed under English law and thus subject to the agency&#039;s licensing regime. However, if any of the Esk fishery associations applied for a general licence, the agency would look into the possibility. Nevertheless, the fisheries associations must be sure that their members have exclusive rights, as the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 requires, and that a suitable administrative system is put in place so that the agency can be sure that people who fish are licensed and can collect the associated catch statistics to assist management. While a general licence could be the way forward, our position on the question of who should manage the Esk and the legal entitlement of the Environment Agency to collect licence fees remains the same.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_324">The hon. Gentleman raised the matter in the Scottish Parliament in February 2005 as an MSP and was told that under section 25 of the 1975 Act the Environment 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 585</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Agency has no option but to regulate fishing on the Scottish side of the Border Esk with a rod licensing scheme. He has raised the issue on a number of occasions, but I am afraid that the answer remains the same. Now, however, he has the offer of talks with the Environment Agency. The Government, the Scottish Executive and the agency have adopted a consistent position. Under the provisions of the law, the agency is obliged to regulate fishing by rod and line licence in all the areas for which it has responsibility and to collect rod licence duties from people wishing to fish by rod and line in those areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_325">As the hon. Gentleman knows, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter) has learned in our debate, the whole Border Esk has been regulated for the purpose of fisheries under English law since the 1860s. Section 6(7) of the Environment Act 1995 requires the Environment Agency to carry out its functions in regard to fisheries on all of the river Esk in Scotland, including its banks and tributary streams, up to their sources. Although it may seem an anomaly that English law covers the Scottish part of a cross-border river, the Tweed&#151;another cross-border river&#151;falls under Scottish law, as my hon. Friend reminded the House. Tweed anglers on the English side may &quot;benefit&quot; from not having to pay for a rod licence, but funding is generated for the operation of the fisheries by the payment of permit fees to the owners, who 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>11 May 2006 : Column 586</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>pay a levy to the River Tweed council. It is worth bearing in mind, as my hon. Friend said, that rivers are managed according to their catchment areas, not according to administrative boundaries. The House will acknowledge that that makes obvious sense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60511-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_326">As I have said, the Environment Agency is willing to discuss the arrangements that must be in place for a general licence to Scottish fishers on the Border Esk, and I urge the hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale and his constituents to take up that offer as soon as possible. As I have already cautioned, however, if the necessary conditions cannot be met, there is no alternative to the standard rod licence scheme. The resolution of outstanding issues is properly a matter for the agency and the fishery interests without, I hope, the need for further involvement from the House.
