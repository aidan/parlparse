he plans to replace the Canberra Bomber as a wet film camera platform.
[79710]</p><p><a name="0606262000026"><b><a name="0606262000317">The
Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Mr. Adam Ingram):</b>
After the retirement from service of the Canberra PR9 at the end of
next month, we will continue to provide military intelligence,
surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance capabilities
through a combination of in-service systems and new equipment
programmes such as ASTOR and Watchkeeper, which will incrementally
deliver enhanced
capability.</p><p><a name="0606262000027"><b><a name="0606262000318">Mr.
Gale:</b> The analysts are all agreed that wet
film&#151;traditional film&#151;provides a higher definition and
resolution than any other service. What the Minister has described is a
platform for providing digital surveillance, which is not good enough.
We have known for a long time that Canberra is going out of service at
the end of the month. What will provide a platform for the wet film
cameras?</p><p><a name="0606262000028"><b><a name="0606262000319">Mr.
Ingram:</b> We propose to invest between &#163;2 billion and
&#163;2.5 billion per annum over the next 10 years on our
network-enabled capability. That will give us a range of stand-off
surveillance systems, which will greatly enhance our capability. The
hon. Gentleman says authoritatively that wet film is the only way
forward, but that is not the analysis of those who are considering our
new requirements for a network-enabled capability, which co-ordinates
what is happening in the field and what we see from the sky and
provides enhanced communication to people on the
ground.</p><p><a name="0606262000029"><b><a name="0606262000320">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> Is there
any risk that the successor to the Canberra will not be end-on to the
retirement date for Canberra, and that we shall therefore avoid a
capability gap of the sort that some analysts have been predicting for
some time?</p><p><a name="0606262000030"><b><a name="0606262000321">Mr.
Ingram:</b> We have a range of new systems coming on-stream,
one of which is ASTOR, which is the overall capability, while the
Raptor reconnaissance pod will be fitted to Tornados and is expected to
be ready for operation before the end of this year. That will provide
an enhanced capability and is a wet film concept upgraded to digital
technology. I hear what my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for North
Thanet (Mr. Gale) say, but our proposal is based on what we believe to
be the appropriate technology for the decades ahead. It is a major
investment based on the best analysis of what we need to meet our
requirements in the field.</p><p><a name="0606262000031"><b><a name="0606262000322">Mr.
Henry Bellingham (North-West Norfolk) (Con):</b> Will the
Minister find time today to pay tribute to the last remaining Canberra
PR9 squadron based at RAF Marham? Such squadrons are in many ways the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 3</b><br>unsung heroes of numerous conflicts over the past 40 years or so, flying
in extremely tough conditions in all
weathers.</p><p><a name="0606262000032"><b><a name="0606262000323">Mr.
Ingram:</b> I am only too happy to do so. The media has shown
some good news footage about all that recently, pointing to the age of
some of the crew who have been with that aircraft for a considerable
number of years and provided work of incredibly high quality. I am sure
that those who fly on the replacement reconnaissance aircraft, combined
with the unmanned facility, will provide an equally high standard in
the decades to come.</p><p><a name="0606262000033"><b><a name="0606262000324">Mr.
Gerald Howarth (Aldershot) (Con):</b> I join my hon. Friend
the Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) in paying
tribute to this singular aircraft, its contribution to the Royal Air
Force and its capabilities over the past 55 years. No other aeroplane
can hold a candle to the service that the Canberra has given. I
understand that even Her Majesty the Queen had a small tear in her eye
as she saw the last Canberra fly over Buckingham palace.</p><p><a name="0606262000034">I have seen the Canberra in
operation in Oman, where I spoke to the crew. As my hon. Friend the
Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) says, there is no substitute for wet
film. Given the Minister&#146;s acceptance of the singular capability
of the Canberra, its replacement with what he described as a
combination of incremental improvements is no substitute for the
Canberra. When will Project Dabinett, the Ministry of Defence&#146;s
study of the long-term replacement for that capability report? Are not
our armed forces again being made to carry the operational risk of yet
another capability gap because the Ministry of Defence makes it
decisions not on military imperatives but to deliver more short-term
savings to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who now struts around the
country pretending to be the new friend of the armed
forces?</p><p><a name="0606262000035"><b><a name="0606262000325">Mr.
Ingram:</b> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman wanted to
ask a question or to make a political attack. I shall deal with the
political attack first. Let us remember that we have seen the largest
real-terms increase in defence expenditure for 20 years. That will
procure, for land, sea and air, a substantial upgrade of all our
equipment needs for decades ahead.
</p><p><a name="0606262000036">The hon. Gentleman
asked about a specific project. I do not have any information to hand
on when a report on it is likely, but I will write to him.</p><p><a name="0606262000037">As for the idea that what we are
doing is short-term and represents a cut, I have given the figure for
the investment that we shall be making in digital technology. What we
are doing is all about improving the capability of our operatives in
the field. That is the direction in which our European allies and the
United States are going, and it will give us inter-operability with our
main allies. I do not see it as a cut; I see it as an enhanced
capability.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606262000012">Iraq</h3><p><a name="0606262000038">2.

Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b> Before I
answer the question I will, with the permission of the House, take the
opportunity on a special day to pay tribute to those who, through their
exceptional valour, have earned either the Victoria Cross or the George
Cross. My ministerial colleagues, along with members of Her
Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition and representatives of the Liberal
Democrats, were privileged to be at a commemorative service for the
150th anniversary of the Victoria Cross and the 50th anniversary of the
Victoria Cross and George Cross Association in Westminster abbey this
morning in the presence of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales.
Those of us who were present at that very simple and dignified service,
in the presence of holders of those decorations, were both honoured and
humbled to be there.</p><p><a name="0606262000040">While there has been an increase
in violence across Iraq in recent months, the majority of attacks
remain confined to four out of 18 provinces. Although across three of
the provinces in Multi-National Division (South-East) the security
situation remains relatively calm, in Basra there has been a recent
increase in violence. However, on 19<sup>( )</sup>June the Prime Minister
of Iraq announced a security plan for Basra which has been agreed with
the coalition forces. He also announced that the Iraqi security forces
would take responsibility for the security of Muthanna province from
next month. Both those events were unfolding during my visit last week.
As they have very important implications for our troops, I am sure
Members will understand why I decided there and then to extend my visit
at the expense of my contribution to the defence policy debate in the
House on
Thursday.</p><p><a name="0606262000041"><b><a name="0606262000328">Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Nearly a quarter of the British soldiers lost in
hostile action in Iraq were in Snatch Land Rovers at the time. Those
vehicles are widely recognised to be inadequately armoured to withstand
roadside bombs, and are consequently seen as a soft target for
insurgents. In the interests of preventing unnecessary deaths, will the
Secretary of State tell us which specific vehicles he is considering
deploying as replacements for Snatch Land Rovers in
Iraq?</p><p><a name="0606262000042"><b><a name="0606262000329">Des
Browne:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made a good point. The
Snatch Land Rover was a popular option earlier in the campaign in
Afghanistan, because it was mobile and a good all-rounder, and had the
right profile to help our troops to engage with the people of Basra in
Multi-National Division (South-East). I think Members will appreciate
that a vision of our troops thundering down narrow streets with battle
tanks was not exactly what we wanted to convey to the people of Basra
and other parts of south-east Iraq.</p><p><a name="0606262000043">Things are changing. As I have
said, the level of violence in Basra has increased. I will not go into
detail for obvious reasons, but the weapons that the terrorists are
using have changed radically, as I have seen for myself on visits. I
have seen that that is a serious issue, and have asked for a review.
There are medium and long-term plans relating to vehicles, and I shall
be considering what we can do to respond to the situation in the short
term&#151;although we do also respond by means of tactics and
operational
instructions.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 5</b><br><p><a name="0606262000044"><b><a name="0606262000330">John
Smith (Vale of Glamorgan) (Lab):</b> Is my right hon. Friend
satisfied that enough is being done to secure the border with Iran, and
to prevent Iranian influence in southern Iraq and Basra? I am thinking
particularly of the transport of improvised explosive devices which are
being used against Snatch
vehicles.</p><p><a name="0606262000045"><b><a name="0606262000331">Des
Browne:</b> I am sure my hon. Friend is aware of the size of
the land border between Iraq and Iran. I am sure he is also aware of
something that is very clear to me: many of the people living in that
area do not necessarily accept in their lifestyles the lines that
others have drawn on the maps for them. There are tribes that move
freely across the borders and have done so for generations, long before
any European country had any interest in that part of the world. It is
highly unlikely that any military operation will change that way of
life. That having been said, we are very aware of the malign influence
that interference by those outside Iraq&#146;s borders can have on
its politics and destiny. My hon. Friend can rest assured that that is
significantly high in our interest and that of the Iraqi Government,
and will figure as part of the Basra security
plan.</p><p><a name="0606262000046"><b><a name="0606262000332">Ann

specific question about sizes of streets, and I apologise to her if she
thinks that I should be able to do so. I shall look into the issue and
if it is of any relevance to the point that I think underlies her
question, I will be in touch with her. Decisions on which vehicles to
use on operations are for the commanders on the ground. They have to
weigh up several points&#151;including the levels of protection,
which have been the focus of the debate on the Snatch Land Rover, its
mobility, and the ability to reduce the threat through
tactics&#151;and they then make a choice. In the view of the general
who has responsibility for that area, protection is 30 per cent. about
equipment, 60 per cent. about tactics and&#151;because soldiering is
a difficult and dangerous operation in those circumstances&#151;the
other 10 per cent. is accounted for by other
elements.</p><p><a name="0606262000049"><b><a name="0606262000334">Mr.

year?</p><p><a name="0606262000050"><b><a name="0606262000335">Des
Browne:</b> I know that the right hon. Gentleman had an
important and informative visit to Iraq with his Select Committee. I am
not in a position to give him a direct response to that question at
this stage, but NATO training is very important to building capacity in
the Iraqi security forces. It is certain that beyond the date that he
mentions, when the planned multinational 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 6</b><br>training comes to an end, there will continue to be a need for training

that.</p><p><a name="0606262000051"><b><a name="0606262000336">Nick
Harvey (North Devon) (LD):</b> What assessment does the
Secretary of State make of the effect that the indefinite detention of
14,000 Iraqi prisoners, under the authority of the multinational
forces, is having on perpetuating the insurgency? What measures are in
place to charge and try those people under any recognisable judicial
procedure and what hope is there that the reconciliation moves being
mooted by the new Prime Minister might lead to the release of some of
those people
soon?</p><p><a name="0606262000052"><b><a name="0606262000337">Des
Browne:</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that, in addition
to those who are in the detention principally of the United States,
some 30,000 others are in the detention of the Iraqi Government. In all
my meetings last week with a significant number of Iraqi Ministers,
including the Prime Minister and the President, I discussed the issue
of detention. It is an important issue and, in my view, there is no
possibility of a sustainable and long-term future for the new
Government of Iraq beyond the point of relying on coalition forces if
they have large numbers of people in detention and insufficient
judicial capacity to deal with them. Consequently, I was pleased that
the need to address the significant number of people in detention was a
significant part of the reconciliation statement made yesterday by
Prime Minister Maliki. However, hon. Members have to understand that
many of those people are detained because they are a danger to the
Iraqi people. The Government&#146;s ability to deal with those
detained in the context of reconciliation will be a function of their
ability to build a judicial system that can deal with that number of
people.</p><p><a name="0606262000053"><b><a name="0606262000338">Dr.

associated with Iran in the delivery of violence through terrorist
activity in other parts of the world, some of them are believed to have
their roots in Iran. Whether they are being brought into Iran on the

The fact is that British forces in Basra have seen an improvement in a
significant number of the services available to the people of Basra.
There has been an increase in violence over the last few months, but
that is entirely coincidental with the period between the election and
the formation of the Iraqi Government. The Iraqi Government are now in
place and the Prime Minister, the new Defence Minister and the new
Minister of the Interior have publicly stated that security in Basra is
a priority. They have developed a plan that will be led by the Iraqi
security forces themselves, in the form of the Iraqi army. There are
significant difficulties; the Iraqi police have been significantly
infiltrated by violent groups who are part of an outside process and
there is a degree of corruption, but the plan addresses those issues.
To suggest that the situation for the ordinary people of Basra is no
better since British forces have been there is not true&#151;it has
improved for
them.</p><p><a name="0606262000069"><b><a name="0606262000350">Mr.

make a statement on Veterans&#146; day.
[79714]</p><p><a name="0606262000074"><b><a name="0606262000355">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Tom
Watson):</b> I am pleased that the first-ever national
Veterans&#146; day is taking place on 27 June. Not only will
a major event be organised at the Imperial War museum in London, but we
know of 150 events that are being organised locally across the UK. More
than 70 events have received financial support from the Department at a
total cost of about &#163;130,000. I am delighted that this
opportunity to celebrate the achievements of our veterans is being
embraced so enthusiastically by organisers, veterans and the general
public.</p><p><a name="0606262000075"><b><a name="0606262000356">Ben
Chapman:</b> While many congratulations are due on the
introduction of Veterans&#146; day and all that has been achieved,
may we turn our attention to how we recognise those involved in more
recent conflicts, such as the Falklands, now approaching its
25th anniversary? But a more pressing point&#151;at least for
me&#151;is the situation of those interned by the Japanese during
hostilities in the second world war. Can my hon. Friend update me on
how we are settling that debt of
honour?</p><p><a name="0606262000076"><b><a name="0606262000357">Mr.
Watson:</b> I shall answer both parts of that supplementary
question. I can confirm that there will be a major celebration of the
25th anniversary of the Falklands. I probably speak for both sides of
the House when I give the reason why. Today, many of us were in the
company of the most remarkably brave people, who have served their
country in military and civilian capacities. Some of them served in the
Falklands and they deserve a commemoration 25 years on. My view is that
the anniversary should be celebrated in the UK and the Falklands. I am
not in a position to sketch out the detail yet, but I will report to
the House when we have more information.</p><p><a name="0606262000077">On my hon. Friend&#146;s
second point, I am pleased to say that the criteria for the new 20-year
residence criterion for the far east prisoner of war scheme have been
agreed with my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) and the
chairman of the Association of British Civilian Internees Far East
Region. They will be implemented with effect from 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 10</b><br>today. I hope to place the detailed rules in the Library of the House.
Those who were British at the time of their internment who think that
they meet the criterion of 20 years residence in the UK between 1945
and 7 November 2000, whether they were civilians or members of
the armed forces of the British empire, should apply to the Veterans
Agency. We expect the first payments to be made very
shortly.</p><p><a name="0606262000078"><b><a name="0606262000358">Sir
Patrick Cormack (South Staffordshire) (Con):</b> The
Minister&#146;s answers to both those questions will be warmly
welcomed throughout the House and the country, but would it not focus
attention on what we owe to the veterans, and also enable young people
to be taught just what is involved, if we had the commemoration as a
public holiday?</p><p><a name="0606262000079"><b><a name="0606262000359">Mr.
Watson:</b> The granting of a public holiday is not in my
gift, but the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about young people, for
whom the Falklands war is something that they learn about in history,
is well made and I hope that, as part of our commemorations of 25
years, we can involve school and youth groups up and down the
country.</p><p><a name="0606262000080"><b><a name="0606262000360">Ann
Coffey (Stockport) (Lab):</b> The Stockport British Legion was
presented with a cup for its outstanding fundraising last year. This
year, it will surpass even last year&#146;s effort. Will my hon.
Friend join me in congratulating the British Legion, the Normandy
Veterans Association and the Combined Services Association in Stockport
on the valuable work that they do in helping veterans? His announcement
on extending the veterans medal has been warmly
welcomed.</p><p><a name="0606262000081"><b><a name="0606262000361">Mr.
Watson:</b> The whole House will wish to congratulate
Stockport British Legion. My hon. Friend failed to invite me up to
visit the British Legion personally, but if she were to do so, perhaps
I could do that during the summer recess.</p><p><a name="0606262000082"><b><a name="0606262000362">Mr.
Mark Harper (Forest of Dean) (Con):</b> I welcome the
Minister&#146;s announcement about the far east prisoners of war. I
know that that has taken a good deal of time, and I hope that that will
deal with the rest of the outstanding cases. As for the suggestion from
my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick
Cormack) about a veterans day, it may not be within the
Minister&#146;s power to grant a day&#146;s holiday, but since
there has been some criticism this year of the extent to which the
Chancellor has tried to involve himself with veterans day and since he
appears to be all-powerful in the Government, perhaps the Minister
could have a word with him to see whether he could grant such a
day.</p><p><a name="0606262000083">Turning to next
year&#146;s celebrations, veterans day in 2007, which will
be coterminous with the 25th anniversary of the Falklands
conflict, will be particularly poignant. I urge the Minister to assert
the primacy of the Ministry of Defence on that issue and to work
closely with Opposition Front-Bench Members to make sure that we have a
day that will truly be worthy of our
veterans.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 11</b><br><p><a name="0606262000084"><b><a name="0606262000363">Mr.
Watson:</b> Let me give the hon. Gentleman a commitment that
we can do that. The whole House needs ownership of that commemoration.
I hope that his input and that of his colleagues will be paramount. As
for the Chancellor granting a bank holiday, I am not sure whether that
is in his gift either, although, of course, he is
all-powerful.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606262000016">Afghanistan</h3><p><a name="0606262000085">6.
<b><a name="0606262000364">Mr.
Andrew Mackay (Bracknell) (Con):</b> What the
mission statement is for United Kingdom troops in Afghanistan.
[79715]</p><p><a name="0606262000086"><b><a name="0606262000365">The
Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b> UK forces in
Afghanistan are primarily deployed as part of the international
security assistance force. The ISAF mission, as published, is to help
the Afghan Government to create a secure environment in which their
authority can be extended across the entire country and reconstruction
of the country can be taken forward. Of course, that objective will not
be achieved by military means alone, and consequently the British
Government have undertaken an unprecedented degree of
cross-governmental co-ordination to ensure that we deliver a fully
integrated package that addresses governance, security, economic
development and political and social
change.</p><p><a name="0606262000087"><b><a name="0606262000366">Mr.
Mackay:</b> I am sure that the Secretary of State will agree
that that objective will also not be secured with only 6,000 NATO
troops in the southern part of Afghanistan. Is it not essential that
more troops are made available, and what is he doing to ensure that
that
happens?</p><p><a name="0606262000088"><b><a name="0606262000367">Des
Browne:</b> The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that no one
is yet at full operational capability in southern Afghanistan. We are
in southern Afghanistan with several international
partners&#151;Canada, the United States, the Netherlands, Estonia,
Denmark, Romania and Australia&#151;and for our part, in Helmand
province, we believe that we have deployed an important and appropriate
force. I do not necessarily accept that there are insufficient forces
in any other part of southern Afghanistan. However, the issue will need
to be kept constantly under review by ISAF and NATO. It will be
incumbent on us to ensure that we deploy sufficient forces to enable us
to carry out the task in hand. However, the right hon. Gentleman should
not forget that the Afghan army itself is increasingly deploying forces
to that area. The assessment of those soldiers that I am given is that
they are of the highest
calibre.</p><p><a name="0606262000089"><b><a name="0606262000368">Mr.
James Gray (North Wiltshire) (Con):</b> I know that the
Secretary of State will agree that central to a successful deployment
in Afghanistan will be the heavy-lift capability provided by the
Hercules aircraft from RAF Lyneham, which is in my constituency. In
that context, he will know that one of the contributory factors to the
tragic crash of a Hercules in Iraq last year might have been the
absence of foam flame retardant in the wing tanks. Will he tell us how
quickly the retardant will be fitted in the Hercules fleet and 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 12</b><br>how many planes will be fitted with it? Will he confirm that all the
planes that are deployed in Afghanistan will have that safeguard fitted
to
them?</p><p><a name="0606262000090"><b><a name="0606262000369">Des
Browne:</b> I am happy to accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
invitation to pay tribute to the contribution that the
Hercules&#151;and, more importantly, those who fly the
Hercules&#151;have made to military operations in not only
Afghanistan and Iraq at present, but elsewhere. He knows, as I am sure
that the House does, that we intend to fit the flame-retardant foam
into Hercules and to ensure that those that are deployed to the theatre
are fitted with that. I have said in public, so I have no reason to say
anything different from the Dispatch Box, that we hope to be able to do
that by August for the first of them. We will ensure that sufficient
numbers of Hercules are fitted with the appropriate retardant foam so
that operations can be
conducted.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606262000017">Royal Marine

Fabricant:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that answer.
I think that hon. Members on both sides of the House will recognise and
applaud the work of the Royal Marines, especially in the deployment to
Afghanistan that will take place shortly. What thoughts do the Minister
and the Department have about the formation of a future additional
fourth commando of the Royal Marines? Has he thought about the
formation of a new special operations group with commandos from the
Royal Marines, the Parachute Regiment and others who have done the
commando course at
Lympstone?</p><p><a name="0606262000094"><b><a name="0606262000373">Mr.
Ingram:</b> On the latter point, the hon. Gentleman might be
aware that a special support regiment has been stood up and is based at
St. Athan. The question of the fourth manoeuvre unit of the
Commando Brigade is being examined, although no recommendations have
reached Ministers&#146; desks yet. I will wait and see what the
recommendations are before giving the hon. Gentleman an answer to his
specific question because I will have to see the merits, benefits and,
perhaps, disbenefits of the proposal before reaching a considered
opinion. Work is in hand to achieve that,
however.</p><p><a name="0606262000095"><b><a name="0606262000374">Mr.
Mike Weir (Angus) (SNP):</b> The Minister will know that there
has been a lot of speculation in Scottish newspapers recently about the
possible deployment of 45 Commando, which is based in my constituency,
to Afghanistan. Those troops have 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 13</b><br>special expertise&#151;they are technology experts&#151;in winter
warfare. Given the Secretary of State&#146;s earlier answer, will the
Minister assure us that any such deployment would keep UK troops within
the agreed ISAF parameters and would not represent an extension to the
UK&#146;s involvement in Afghanistan?</p><p><a name="0606262000096"><b><a name="0606262000375">Mr.
Ingram:</b> No decision has been taken as to the next
deployment, but 45 Commando clearly has particular capabilities and is
trained for specific purposes, and that comes into play as part of the
planning process, in both the medium and long term. However, I do not
know whether the hon. Gentleman is arguing for it not to be deployed or
he is in favour of it being deployed. I do not know where his party
currently stands on that because we are talking about a NATO mission,
and his party is of course opposed to NATO. Therefore, I am unsure
where he is coming from on this issue. I meet 45 Commando personnel
regularly and I can say that, in common with all other members of Her
Majesty&#146;s armed forces, they actually like being deployed. We
have to make proper judgments accordingly as to when and how often that
deployment takes place.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606262000018">Dr.

the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on
Iraq&#146;s chemical and biological weapons capabilities, the work of
the United Nations Commissions dealing with inspections in Iraq, and on
issues relating to the chemical weapons convention and the biological
and toxin weapons convention. Dr. Kelly also advised the UN

United States and the UK that was delivered to the US on 27
May 2003, and which made it clear that the so-called mobile biological

notice of it. However, what I will say is that it is my understanding
that although the hon. Gentleman has publicly said, in terms, that he
is about to devote one year of his life to pursuing investigations in
relation to Dr. Kelly and the circumstances surrounding his death, it
is not my intention, periodically or consistently, to start an
investigation from the Dispatch Box. The position is that Lord Hutton
investigated fully the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr. Kelly
and it would be entirely inappropriate for me to start picking up
aspects of that case piecemeal. However, I will look carefully into the
question he has asked to see if I can provide any information, despite
the fact that my Department was entirely open in respect of Dr.
Kelly&#146;s role and all the evidence that it had for the Hutton
report. If, contrary to my view, there is anything of assistance that I
can communicate to the hon. Gentleman, I will do
so.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606262000019">Army

trends he has identified in levels of recruitment to the Army.

Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Mr. Adam Ingram):</b>
A combination of high employment, a prosperous and strong economy,
attractive alternatives in further education and stiff competition from
other employers have all increased the pressure on the Army in its
efforts to attract young men and women. To counter this, the
Army&#146;s recruiting group has redoubled its recruiting effort
through advertising campaigns. During recent months, its intensive
marketing campaign has paid dividends and the number of applications
has increased. The challenge now is to convert that interest into
enlistments.</p><p><a name="0606262000104"><b><a name="0606262000382">Mr.
Dunne:</b> With unprecedented numbers of Territorial Army
soldiers and other reservists currently serving in Iraq and
Afghanistan, and yet with TA strength at its lowest level since its
formation more than 100 years ago, what do the Government plan to do to
fix the recruitment crisis now affecting all our reserve
forces?</p><p><a name="0606262000105"><b><a name="0606262000383">Mr.
Ingram:</b> As of 14 June 2006, some 574 members of the
Territorial Army&#151;about 1.8 per cent. of the TA&#151;were
deployed on operations overall, of whom 397 are serving in Iraq.
Extensive efforts are being made to achieve better recruiting. As at
April 2006, the TA&#146;s strength was more than 2 per cent. higher
than it was one year ago, and it is at its highest level since June
2004. Its strength has increased by about 900 since the beginning of
the year, which could indicate a trend. However, in respect of the TA,
the reserves and the regular forces, constant effort needs to be made
to keep the marketing intensity high, because that is what the
competition is doing to attract young men and women into their areas of
interest. We are beginning to see some trends that are to our benefit,
but we can maintain them only through such intensive
effort.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 15</b><br><p><a name="0606262000106"><b><a name="0606262000384">Mr.

Friend is well aware that Lancashire and the entire north-west is a
very fertile recruitment area for the armed forces. However, has the
time not come to ensure that, in addition to good recruitment, we enjoy
good retention in the north-west by moving Army bases from the south to
the north, which is where the families live? That is much overdue and
much needed, and the time has come to recognise the needs of our
troops.</p><p><a name="0606262000107"><b><a name="0606262000385">Mr.
Ingram:</b> It is about recognising the need of the armed
forces overall&#151;in this case, the Army. Part of the basing reason
is to be close to training areas, and that is why we still have
extensive basing in Germany and in the south&#151;to be close to
those training areas&#151;but my hon. Friend raises a good point,
which he should follow with interest in the months and years ahead.
Super-garrisons are being considered as part of the future Army
structure, but it is too early to say where the lay-down of such
garrisons will be&#151;whether in Northern Ireland, Scotland, the
north-east, the north-west, the midlands or the south. However, all
that work is under way. Moving troops involves spending an extensive
amount of money on infrastructure and has to be planned for. That will
not happen overnight, but work is under way to achieve some of those
objectives.</p><p><a name="0606262000108"><b><a name="0606262000386">Sir
Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield) (Con):</b> I am very pleased
indeed to follow the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) in emphasising
the importance of the north-west to Army recruitment. Will the Minister
accept that the TA makes an increasingly important contribution to our
armed forces, and certainly in respect of recruitment? He recently
admitted to me that there has been a problem with the payment of the
bounty to TA soldiers in the north-west, in that soldiers who deserve
the bounty have not been awarded it. Will he ensure that that matter is
corrected at a very early
date?</p><p><a name="0606262000109"><b><a name="0606262000387">Mr.

Gentleman&#146;s comments: the TA plays a substantial part in all
that we do, and not just in Iraq and Afghanistan, but elsewhere. In
many ways, that is perhaps why we are beginning to see, once again, an
increase in recruitment. In fact, we are getting indications that
people want to join the TA because deployment is becoming a feature of
the role, whereas before, that was not necessarily the case. The
rebalancing of the TA is about restructuring it to make it more usable
and better focused on the regular service, so we have attended to some
of those issues. I do not recollect saying to the hon. Gentleman what
he said that I said about the bounty, although I might have done so in
a written answer, of which I write hundreds in a given period. I do not
think that I have given that answer, but I will check whether I have,

be.</p><p><a name="0606262000110"><b><a name="0606262000388">Dr.

beginning to see some benefit from our intensive marketing campaign. I
do not deny that we are under-strength, that we find it hard to hit our
targets, or that we are under-target, but I should point out that,
historically, that has always been the case. What we have tried to do
through the new future infantry structure and future Army structure is
to get the balance right&#151;to set realistic targets and then to
try to achieve them.</p><p><a name="0606262000112">In my reply to the hon. Member
for Newark (Patrick Mercer), I said that the recruiting environment is
difficult. The economy is very strong and we face a lot of competition
from elsewhere in the marketplace, so to speak, which is why we are now
investing so heavily in the marketing campaign. We can measure the
impact in two ways: one of our marketing strategies led to 15,000
expressions of interest, and the Everest west ridge campaign led to an
additional 15,000 expressions of interest. What we have to do now is
turn those expressions of interest into actual enlistment. That is the
next objective.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606262000020">Iraq</h3><p><a name="0606262000113">10.

Minister for the Cabinet Office (Hilary Armstrong):</b> I beg
to move, That the Bill be now read a Second
time.</p><p><a name="0606262000149">The Bill is part
of a renewed drive by the Government to break down the barriers that
face the charitable sector. Charities and voluntary organisations play
a fundamental role in the fabric of our society, and provide a vital
service to individuals and communities. By creating the office of the
third sector and introducing the Bill, we have underlined our
commitment to the growing importance of charitable endeavour in our
society by helping to release charities&#146; potential for further
public good. There are about 190,000 charities on the public register
in England and Wales, with a combined annual income of
over &#163;39 billion.</p><p><a name="0606262000150">The sector has significant
social and economic weight, but as society evolves, so our charities
must be given the freedom to meet the challenges of the modern world.
The Bill will enable them to keep pace with the modern social landscape
while ensuring that they are accountable to the public whom they serve.
One of the most important ways in which the Government can support and
enable the charitable sector to develop is to create a framework within
which charitable endeavour can thrive.</p><p><a name="0606262000151">We have three clear aims for the
Bill. First, we wish to provide a legal and regulatory environment that
enables all charities, however they work, to realise their potential.
Secondly, we wish to encourage a vibrant and diverse sector,
independent of Government, and thirdly, we wish to sustain high levels
of public confidence in charities through effective
regulation.</p><p><a name="0606262000152"><b><a name="0606262000417">Andrew

Armstrong:</b> The hon. Gentleman might like to wait to hear
what I say about that, but I am confident that religion certainly has a
charitable purpose and that religious organisations will be able to
demonstrate effectively that they are of public benefit. That is the
key point of the Bill. Both criteria have to be met. Any organisation
that is charitable and produces public benefit is allowed considerable
tax concessions, which 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 22</b><br>is public money, because otherwise they would be paying that. However,

would be able to meet both
criteria.</p><p><a name="0606262000156">The Bill will

intervention. One concerns the status of universities, to which I will
come later. If, say, they are part of a research programme that a
medical charity is undertaking, again they will have to meet the public
benefit test, but I am confident that they would do so. As I say, I
will come to the particular status of universities

1993, referring to registration of charities, subject to the negative
procedure of the House or to its affirmative counterpart; and whichever

sequence, but I have not yet begun to deal with the Bill&#151;I was
still in my preamble.
</p><p><a name="0606262000167">The Bill will make
improvements in several areas of the law and in the regulation of
charities. The most 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 23</b><br>important improvements concern the definition of
&#147;charity&#148;, the constitution, functions and powers of the
Charity Commission as regulator and in its relationship with the
Government, the creation of a new corporate legal form for charities,
which will be called the charitable incorporated organisation, changes
to ensure that effective and proportionate regulation applies right
across the charitable sector, including those charities which are not
currently required to register with the Charity Commission, and the
regulation of people who collect in public for charity. I shall deal
with each of those specific areas in more
detail.</p><p><a name="0606262000168">The Bill is the
result of a thorough process, including extensive consultation with
charities themselves and significant time spent in the other place. I
know that many hon. Members are active trustees, volunteers and,
indeed, supporters of charities, and they are well aware of the strong
support for the Bill across the breadth of the charitable
sector.</p><p><a name="0606262000169">The Bill
originated in a review by the Prime Minister&#146;s strategy unit,
which was published in 2002, of charities and the wider not-for-profit
sector. We received more than 1,000 responses to the public
consultation on that review, and those responses showed clear and
strong support for the great majority of the review&#146;s
recommendations, which form the main content of the Bill.</p><p><a name="0606262000170">The Bill was
published in draft in May 2004, and it received thorough
pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee, which was skilfully
chaired by my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr.
Milburn), who is in his place today. The Government accepted more than
three quarters of the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendations, and the
Bill emerged the better for
it.</p><p><a name="0606262000171">The Bill was first
introduced in December 2004 in another place, where it was extensively
debated, and it fell when Parliament was dissolved in April last year
for the general election. It was reintroduced at the first opportunity
in this Parliament, and it has had more than 60 hours of debate so
far.</p><p><a name="0606262000172">It has been well
over a decade since any significant changes have been made to charity
law, and many of the aspects of the current law are considerably older
than that. Charity law has simply not kept pace with changes in our
society and in the diverse voluntary sector.</p><p><a name="0606262000173">The Bill extends to England and
Wales, but not to Scotland or Northern Ireland, where charity law is a
devolved matter. Even before devolution, there were three different
systems of charity regulation in the UK&#151;one for England and
Wales, one for Scotland and one for Northern Ireland. In July 2005, the
Scottish Parliament passed an Act including many of the reforms that
our Charities Bill will make for England and Wales, and similar
proposals are being worked up in Northern Ireland. After all those
reforms have been enacted, the three systems will continue to be
compatible without being identical.</p><p><a name="0606262000174">The Charities Bill contains 78
clauses and 10 schedules, and it is divided into four parts. Part 1 of
the Bill contains the provisions defining &#147;a
charity&#148;, which are very important. Any organisation
which falls 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 24</b><br>within the definition gains access not only to valuable tax exemptions,
but to a special status, which enjoys a high degree of popular trust
and
confidence.</p><p><a name="0606262000175"><b><a name="0606262000429">Richard
Burden (Birmingham, Northfield) (Lab):</b> I welcome the Bill,
which contains many useful provisions. Will my right hon. Friend
comment on one issue concerning definitions? She may be aware that one
of the purposes which falls within the definition is the advancement of
amateur sport. A number of activities which common sense indicates are
sports are often excluded from the definition of being sports by the
Charity Commission, including angling, ballooning, billiards, pool,
snooker, crossbow shooting, rifle shooting, pistol shooting, flying,
gliding, motor sports and parachuting. I declare an interest as a
participant in one of those sports&#151;while I am on my feet, I
shall declare another interest, because I am married to the chief
executive of a national
charity.</p><p><a name="0606262000176"><b><a name="0606262000430">Hilary
Armstrong:</b> My hon. Friend, whose main interest is in motor
sport, recognises that we are, for the first time, classing amateur
sport as a charitable purpose. In doing so, the main aim was to promote
healthy recreation, so sport has been defined as, in many ways,
involving physical skill and exertion. I am not sure how much motor
sport fulfils that criterion. However, the Charity Commission, in
consultation with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, will be
willing to consider any representations on what exactly the addition to
charitable purposes will mean. As my hon. Friend suggests, and as hon.
Members&#146; earlier interventions made clear, once one puts any new
definition into a Bill, there arise all sorts of questions about its
interpretation. One of the aspects that Ministers are struggling with
is the possibility that putting certain things into the Bill will raise
uncertainties in the minds of charitable organisations, and others, as
to whether they will be covered. I am anxious not to put money into
lawyers&#146; pockets, so I am being fairly careful in that
respect.</p><p><a name="0606262000177">The scope of
charities has developed over the centuries to reflect changes in what
society has at any one time regarded as worthy of inclusion. Some sorts
of endeavour, such as the relief of poverty, have always been seen as
charitable, while others, such as the promotion of human rights, have
been accepted relatively recently. Clause 2 provides a list of the many
forms of charitable endeavour or charitable purposes, at the same time
preserving the flexibility to recognise new charitable purposes in
order to accommodate future changes in society. The Bill does not take
away the charitable status of any purpose that is already charitable.
No charity will wake up on the day after the Bill becomes law to find
that as a result the purpose for which it exists has ceased to qualify
as charitable.</p><p><a name="0606262000178">An
organisation cannot be a charity unless its purposes are exclusively
charitable. That means that its purposes must fall wholly within the
purposes listed in the Bill. To qualify as a charity, an organisation
must not only have exclusively charitable purposes but be for the
public benefit. The Bill preserves the existing law on the definition
and test of public benefit, with one change. Under the existing law,
there is the presumption that charities established for the relief of
poverty, the advancement of education or the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 25</b><br>advancement of religion are for the public benefit. Charities
established for all other purposes do not benefit from that
presumption. The Bill abolishes that presumption. That will create a
level playing field on which all charities will have to show that they
are for the public benefit. To do so, an organisation will have to show
that it generates identifiable benefits that reach, or are available
to, a sufficiently large section of the public. Given the great
diversity of charitable endeavour, the nature of those benefits and how
they reach the public will vary
greatly.</p><p><a name="0606262000179"><b><a name="0606262000431">Sir
Patrick Cormack (South Staffordshire) (Con):</b> The right
hon. Lady will know that the Christian Institute, among other bodies,
has expressed concern about the withdrawal of that presumption. It
worries, for instance, that missionary activities could be liable to
reinterpretation. Can she reassure it, and me, that that will not be
the
case?</p><p><a name="0606262000180"><b><a name="0606262000432">Hilary

reassurance that that will not be the case. However, I would like to
clarify the position on the charitable status of fee-charging
charities.</p><p><a name="0606262000181"><b><a name="0606262000433">Bob
Spink:</b> I seek further clarification. When a charity
registers, it must establish that it is working its activities in the
public good. According to the Bill, it must also do so on a continuing
basis. How often would that question be raised by the Charity
Commission, and how burdensome might that ongoing requirement be for
charities?</p><p><a name="0606262000182"><b><a name="0606262000434">Hilary
Armstrong:</b> That will be for the Charity Commission to
determine, but any charity already has to publish annually a report
outlining what it is doing. That has to be public and I expect all
organisations to take that opportunity to express what they are doing
to meet the Bill&#146;s public benefit demands. It will be for the
Charity Commission to issue guidance and to pursue the matter that the
hon. Gentleman raised.</p><p><a name="0606262000183">As I was saying, I would like to
clarify the Bill&#146;s position on the charitable status of
fee-charging
charities.</p><p><a name="0606262000184"><b><a name="0606262000435">Mr.
Andrew Turner (Isle of Wight) (Con):</b> The Minister
mentioned that charities would have to have &#147;identifiable
benefits&#148;, so will she explain the identifiable benefits of the
advancement of
religion?</p><p><a name="0606262000185"><b><a name="0606262000436">Hilary
Armstrong:</b> The issue is based at the moment on case law. I
know that religions could mention some significant aspects of what they
do that relate to public benefit, though they may differ from religion
to religion. It is nevertheless important for them to be clear, if they
are securing taxpayers&#146; money, that they are accountable. That
is the whole purpose of public benefit. If organisations are exempted
from paying taxes, they need to be able to demonstrate to the public
how it will benefit. It is not identifiable in the sense that I can
describe precisely what the benefits should be, but it is identifiable
in that it must be clear that activities benefit the public in a way
that the public can identify and respond to. The Bill is partly about
securing public confidence in charitable status.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 26</b><br><p><a name="0606262000186">I really must move on now to
issues about fee charging. I am aware of considerable discussion among
right hon. and hon. Members and the media about that matter,
particularly with regard to the independent schools sector. Until now,
owing to a presumption built up through case law, independent schools
have automatically been granted charitable status if they requested it.
Previous legislation, including the Charities Act 1992, did not deal
with the problem, but the Bill before Parliament today will abolish the
presumption that independent schools can be charitable simply because
they provide educational services. For the first time, they will have
to demonstrate public benefit in order to gain charitable status. That
same principle will apply to all fee-charging charities in whatever
sector they operate.</p><p><a name="0606262000187">Many
organisations&#151;whether they be a hospice, a local museum, an
outreach programme or any other organisation that charges a fee but is
charitable&#151;provide vital services and are held in great
affection by the communities that they serve, and the Bill will require
each to be assessed on its own merits and judged accordingly. Several
of my hon. Friends have already suggested that they would prefer an
amendment to specify more clearly in the Bill what the public benefits
should be. I remain to be convinced of the necessity of that and am
anxious about the downsides. By trying to be more specific, we do not
want to exclude organisations that should not be excluded. I hope that
hon. Members, especially my hon. Friends, understand that we are
determined that there will be a test of public benefit, which we expect
to be meaningful, but that trying to identify matters too clearly
frequently brings disbenefits that nobody
anticipated.</p><p><a name="0606262000189"><b><a name="0606262000437">Martin
Horwood (Cheltenham) (LD):</b> The Minister has been clear
about some of the organisations that would not be affected by the
Bill&#146;s new version of the public benefit rule but will she
clarify&#151;for her hon. Friends as well as me&#151;whom she would
expect to lose charitable status as a result of the Bill? To be
meaningful, the measure must affect somebody when compared with current
legislation.</p><p><a name="0606262000190"><b><a name="0606262000438">Hilary
Armstrong:</b> The measure means that every organisation that
seeks charitable status will have to be clear about how it believes
that it benefits the public, and the Charity Commission will assess
that. The Charity Commission is the regulator, which will produce
guidance. It is not its aim to ensure that some people lose charitable
status. It will listen to what Parliament is saying, and I believe that
Parliament is strongly of the view that it wants the public benefit
test to be meaningful. I would expect the Charity Commission to reflect
that in its
guidance.</p><p><a name="0606262000191"><b><a name="0606262000439">Alun

an independent body&#151;listens to Members of 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 27</b><br>Parliament, that is infinitely preferable to a tight hand of legislation

way.</p><p><a name="0606262000192"><b><a name="0606262000440">Hilary
Armstrong:</b> My right hon. Friend understands well how
Ministers approach such matters. There are frequently so many different
legal interpretations, and we do not want charities to become too
engaged in legal cases. Another aspect of the Bill makes it easier for
matters to be sorted out through tribunals. They should be sorted out
on a case-by-case basis and I believe that the Charity Commission will
listen carefully to what we say. I trust that it will be guided by what
Parliament
says.</p><p><a name="0606262000193"><b><a name="0606262000441">Tom
Levitt (High Peak) (Lab):</b> My right hon. Friend knows that
many independent schools have excellent drama, sporting, field study

the country are entering into partnerships and gaining access to those

more or less likely to share those facilities if they are forced to
lose 4.5 per cent. of their income through the removal of charitable
status?</p><p><a name="0606262000194"><b><a name="0606262000442">Hilary

ensure that we get the best educational opportunities for every child

envisage the Charity Commission considering such direct and indirect
benefits.</p>

to my earlier intervention. I accept the point made by the right hon.
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael). Will the Minister
ensure that the Charity Commission&#146;s attention is drawn to what
is said not only on the Floor of the House today but in Committee and
during remaining stages? It is important that it knows that Parliament
is passing it great power, and is not asking it to nit-pick, ride
hobby-horses or have agendas, but to consider, in the broadest way,
what can deliver benefit and good to the public, and interpret matters
accordingly.</p><p><a name="0606262000196"><b><a name="0606262000444">Hilary
Armstrong:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman. I hope that I have
made it clear to the House that I would encourage the Charity
Commission, although I would not want to interfere in its independence,
to take note of all our debates on the Floor of the House and in
Committee.</p><p><a name="0606262000197">Part 2 of
the Bill is divided into 11 chapters, each of which deals with some
aspect of the regulation of charities. Chapter 1 of part 2 converts the
Charity Commission into a corporate body. Currently, its functions are
discharged by the five charity commissions. The chapter also contains
reforms to the commission, modernising its constitution, governance and
powers to build on its current effectiveness. We are giving the
commission five new statutory objectives and are requiring it to report
annually to Parliament on the extent to which it has met its
objectives. I hope that 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 28</b><br>that reassures the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick
Cormack) and others about the commission&#146;s relationship to
Parliament.</p><p><a name="0606262000198">We are
also putting the commission under a duty to have regard to the
principles of best regulatory practice, including the principle of
proportionality under which a regulator&#146;s action must be
proportionate to the risk posed by the problem with which it deals. We
included that Joint Committee recommendation after listening carefully
to the debate in the other place. In fact, the commission already
operates in accordance with that principle, and recent surveys have
recorded the high levels of satisfaction among charities that have
dealt with it.</p><p><a name="0606262000199">The
commission is and will remain a non-ministerial department. We believe
that its independence from Ministers is of paramount of importance for
the proper regulation of charities and for public confidence in the
regulatory system. The Bill expressly prevents any Minister from
controlling or directing the commission in its regulatory work. Those
changes are to ensure that we have a Charity Commission that is
independent and emboldened but accountable, regulated and
effective.</p><p><a name="0606262000200">Chapter 2
of part 2 creates a new charity tribunal. At the moment, anyone wanting
to challenge a regulatory decision or order made by the commission must
take it to the High Court, which is daunting and prohibitively
expensive for the vast majority of charities. The new tribunal will
provide a simpler, quicker and cheaper route through which to challenge
the commission and improve its accountability.</p><p><a name="0606262000201">Chapter 3 of part 2 deals with
the registration of charities. There are three main changes. First, the
Bill raises from &#163;1,000 to &#163;5,000 the income threshold
above which a charity must register with the Charity Commission. The
Joint Committee on the draft Bill found that there was a consensus for
a registration threshold of &#163;5,000. Charities whose income falls
below the threshold will be able to register with the commission if
they so wish, which will give more freedom to smaller, local
charities.</p><p><a name="0606262000202">Secondly,
the Bill brings the arrangements for excepted charities into line with
those for other charities. Excepted charities are those which fall
within the regulatory powers of the commission but which are not
currently required to register with it. They include some charities
within the Church of England and other Christian Churches, and some
charities within the armed forces. Requiring such charities to register
will not significantly increase the regulatory burden on them but will
rightly increase the transparency and accountability of those
charities, which have exactly the same entitlement to tax relief as
registered charities. To ease the transition from excepted to
registered status, we are starting by requiring only those with an
income of more than &#163;100,000&#151;the top 10 per cent. or
so&#151;to register. As we have said, we expect gradually to bring
more of those charities into registration in
future.</p><p><a name="0606262000203">Thirdly, the
Bill introduces new arrangements for the so-called exempt charities,
which will include the universities, other places of further and higher
education, some registered social landlords and some museums and
galleries. Exempt charities are those that are currently outside the
Charity Commission&#146;s supervisory and monitoring powers. They
enjoy the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 29</b><br>status and fiscal benefits that other charities have, but there is
currently no mechanism for monitoring their compliance with charity
law. The Bill changes
that.</p><p><a name="0606262000204">When a regulator
is already in place&#151;for example in the case of registered social
landlords who are regulated by the Housing Corporation&#151;that
regulator will take on responsibility for monitoring compliance with
charity law. When no suitable regulator is already in place, the
Charity Commission will take on that responsibility. The proposed new
regulators have been identified following extensive discussion with the
relevant regulators and charities, and will be prescribed by
regulation. The purpose of the changes is to ensure that modern and
effective regulation extends right across the charity sector, not just
to some parts of
it.</p><p><a name="0606262000205">Chapter 5
modernises the Charity Commission&#146;s regulatory powers. It
includes new powers for the commission to suspend or remove trustees
and employees from membership of their charities. Chapters 6 and 7
raise the income threshold above which charities must have their
accounts professionally audited, releasing about 3,000 charities from
that obligation.</p><p><a name="0606262000206">A
development that we believe will be particularly useful in the longer
term is the creation by chapter 8 of part 2 of a new legal form called
the charitable incorporated organisation, or CIO. That could bring
significant deregulatory benefits by allowing charities to take an
incorporated form without having to submit to regulation under company
law as well as charity law. A charity in CIO form will be treated and
regulated as a charity, but not as a company. Existing charities will
be able to take on CIO form, and new charities will be able to start up
in CIO form.</p><p><a name="0606262000207">Perhaps
three quarters of a million people in England and Wales are trustees of
charities, giving their time, commitment and expertise, unpaid, to the
service of others. Trusteeship is a demanding yet personally rewarding
endeavour. We want to encourage more and a greater diversity of people
to be trustees of
charities.</p><p><a name="0606262000208"><b><a name="0606262000445">James
Duddridge (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con):</b> Would the
Minister react warmly to the tabling of amendments that would allow
people with learning disabilities to be trustees in organisations where
there are learning-disability
issues?</p><p><a name="0606262000209"><b><a name="0606262000446">Hilary
Armstrong:</b> I never like to make commitments on amendments,
but I should be very surprised if that were not already possible. I am
fairly sure that it is, because I am fairly sure that I know someone
with learning difficulties who is involved. I shall examine the
position.</p><p><a name="0606262000210">Chapter 9 of
part 2 contains three provisions that will be helpful to trustees in
their stewardship of charities. The first will allow a charity to pay a
trustee who is willing and able to provide his or her charity with a
professional or trade service that it needs. I emphasise that the Bill
will not allow payment of a trustee for carrying out the ordinary
duties of trusteeship, nor will it allow charities&#146; paid
employees to be trustees at the same time. It preserves the voluntary
principle of trusteeship which is part of the ethos of charity. The
second provision will allow 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 30</b><br>trustees to apply to the Charity Commission for relief from personal
liability for breach of trust when they have acted honestly and
reasonably, but their action has nevertheless caused some loss to their
charity. The third will allow trustees to pay for trustee indemnity
insurance using their charity&#146;s
money.</p><p><a name="0606262000211">Those measures
are intended to encourage more people to become or continue as trustees
by giving them confidence that they will not be personally penalised
for an honest mistake. The fear of having to pay out of one&#146;s
own pocket to make good an honest mistake can be a real deterrent both
to the taking on of a trusteeship and to innovation in the running of a
charity.</p><p><a name="0606262000212">Chapters 10
and 11 of part 2 will allow smaller charities to alter their own
constitutions without needing the Charity Commission&#146;s
permission. The rules restricting charities&#146; abilities to spend
their capital endowments will also be relaxed, though the concurrence
of the commission will be required before they may override the wishes
of a donor who has given a large sum as an endowment on condition that
only the income from it can be spent. Some legal and technical
obstacles to mergers between charities will also be removed. Decisions
whether or not to merge will of course remain for charities themselves:
it is not the Government&#146;s role to procure mergers between
charities or to put pressure on charities to merge. However, it should
be easier for them to merge, if that is their
wish.</p><p><a name="0606262000213">An important part
of the Bill, part 3, is the reforms to the regulation of public
charitable collections. The present arrangements do not work as well as
they could, because different types of collection are subject to
different sets of licensing rules, and because the rules are applied
differently from one local authority to another. Through the Charities
Act 1992 it was intended to introduce a new scheme for the regulation
of fundraising, but the relevant part of the 1992 Act was never
introduced because the proposed scheme was thought to be unworkable in
practice.</p><p><a name="0606262000214">We propose in
part 3 of the Bill a new, unified licensing scheme to iron out the
inconsistencies. We responded to a recommendation made by the Joint
Committee on the draft Bill by giving the Charity Commission the role
of determining the eligibility of organisations to carry out public
collections. Charities and other bodies wanting to carry out public
collections will be able to apply to the Charity Commission for a
public collections certificate lasting for up to five years. Public
collections in the street will continue to require, as well as that
certificate, a permit from the local authority to authorise the time
and place of the collection. For public collections from house to
house, which includes from pub to pub, a public collections certificate
will be needed and the collection must be notified to the local
authority. The Bill brings face-to-face fundraising, sometimes called
&#147;chugging&#148;, within the statutory licensing
scheme.</p><p><a name="0606262000215">Elsewhere in
part 3 there is a reserve power for the Government to introduce a
statutory scheme for the regulation of charity fundraising generally.
We have said that that power will be exercised only if self-regulation
fails. I am glad to say that self-regulation, led by the recently
established Fundraising Standards Board, is getting off the ground very
well. 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 31</b><br>The Government hope and expect that self-regulation will be effective in
the longer term, although the power in the Bill will be available
should self-regulation
fail.</p><p><a name="0606262000216"><b><a name="0606262000447">Tom
Levitt: </b>My right hon. Friend describes some welcome
changes in regulation that involve some significant new powers and
responsibilities for the Charity Commission. Can she assure the House
that the commission will have the capacity and the funding to deliver
on those
powers?</p><p><a name="0606262000217"><b><a name="0606262000448">Hilary

estimate of what the reforms will cost. We will have to consider the
situation once the figures are clearer than they are at
present.</p><p><a name="0606262000218">Other
provisions of part 3 include provisions to put beyond doubt the
Government&#146;s power to fund charities and other voluntary
organisations. That responds to the concern of the Home Affairs
Committee about the lack of a proper statutory power for the Home
Secretary&#146;s funding of voluntary organisations. The Bill gives
the National Assembly for Wales the same funding power as it gives to
the UK
Government.</p><p><a name="0606262000219"><b><a name="0606262000449">Mr.
David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I am surprised that the
fiscal regime for charities is not addressed in the Bill and I hope
that we will be able to take account of that in consideration of the
Bill. In particular, the question of whether VAT can be recovered is
crucial in determining whether charities in the social and health care
area are effective in spending their money. Is that an issue that the
redefinition of charities will help to address? Discussions with the
Treasury just seem to lead to even greater
opacity.</p><p><a name="0606262000220"><b><a name="0606262000450">Hilary
Armstrong:</b> I hear my hon. Friend, but the problem is that
his &#147;opaque area&#148; carries a bill of about &#163;500
million. In any financial matter, the Government must take an overall
view about their priorities. It is always for the Treasury to take that
view first, through the Budget and its proposals in the Finance Bill,
rather than it being done in a Bill such as the one before us. Matters
will move and change over the years, and the Government take the
overall management of the economy very seriously. We have done very
well at it, and I do not want to be the Minister who undermines it
through something in this Bill, given that the economy is a matter for

the League of Friends of the Royal Shrewsbury hospital raises hundreds
of thousands of pounds every year to buy vital hospital equipment,

that the Minister takes on board its view that it would benefit greatly

very good job, but we have put additional money into the health
service&#151;considerably more than &#163;500 million. Priorities
must be set and judgments made. I could make a comment, but I am not
going to do so. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I am sure that the hon. Member

provisions, including one that will require the Government to
commission a general review of the operation of the Act within five
years of Royal Assent and to report it to Parliament. That is an
important provision. We will then be able to consider some questions
about which hon. Members, for perfectly sound reasons, have concerns.
The Government are introducing the Bill, but the regulator will be at
arm&#146;s length&#151;at least&#151;from the Government.
Parliament will want to review how measures such as the public benefit
test are interpreted. We will have the opportunity to do so, because
the Bill provides for a review within five years. The Bill will allow
us to judge the legislation&#146;s effect on various matters,
including public benefit, as I said, and public confidence in
charities.</p><p><a name="0606262000226">Another
provision in part 4 will pave the way for the consolidation of
charities&#146; statute law to make it easier for charities and their
advisers to read and understand the law. I am sure that many of us
welcome that.</p><p><a name="0606262000227">The Bill
will support the work of thousands of people and organisations, working
throughout the country to make a real impact on their communities, by
improving the ways in which charities are run and regulated. The

charities and enable them to provide an even better service, while
ensuring that they are fairly and rigorously accountable to the
public.</p><p><a name="0606262000228">The Bill

talked briefly to some youngsters in my constituency about the Bill.
One aspect of it interested them. It was not the public benefit test or
the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 33</b><br>establishment of the charity tribunal. It was not even the
transformation, after 400 years, of the charity commissioners into a
body corporate. The thing that interested them was the section on
fundraising and whether we will retain the ban&#151;as they see
it&#151;on volunteers shaking their tins during street collections.
Those youngsters, like youngsters nationally, are the best&#151;they
keep up a tradition of fundraising for charity at the numerous
carnivals in my constituency, which date back to the first documented
carnival in Britain that took place in Ryde in 1888. However, as
collectors compete with the amplified music on many carnival floats and
with bands such as the Medina marching band, the Wight Diamonds or the
Vectis corps of drums, and 40,000 excited spectators, it is difficult
for them to draw attention to themselves if they are banned from even
rattling their collecting tins. If local councils have the power to
impose such a ban&#151;many people think they do&#151;they should
use it sparingly, if at all.</p><p><a name="0606262000231">I would not be forgiven if I did
not pursue that point in Committee because little things, as well as
strategic issues, matter in legislation. If we get the little things
wrong, as the Licensing Act 2003 is demonstrating, we disrupt
people&#146;s lives and destroy the local voluntary effort that is at
the heart of much charity work, whether it is fundraising for large
charities such as the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children, with a national turnover of nearly
&#163;90 million a year, or for small charities such as the Isle of

parties are enthusing about the role of the third sector in the supply
of public services, it is as well to remember that charities and
voluntary organisations were the first providers of public services.
That is because they were set up by a diverse, and sometimes eccentric,
range of individuals and groups to do the good that those individuals
and groups wanted to do. Some of that will fit into a national or local
strategy, but much of it will not. Those benevolent institutions have
continued to serve their public right into the 21st century, while the
state has learned from them and taken on some of their
responsibilities. Some of that state involvement was to ensure equity
of access to essential services; some was rooted in the belief, sadly
reflected in the words of a Government Back Bencher, that</p><a name="0606262000304"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;philanthropism...applied in
the 19th century&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0606262000238">and
that</p><a name="0606262000305"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;private charity is
no substitute for organised justice.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official
Report</i>, 15 March 2006; Vol. 443, c.
1541.]</p></ul><p><a name="0606262000239">That sentiment is now
thankfully rare and the value of the voluntary sector as a deliverer of
services, an innovator and a social entrepreneur is recognised and
celebrated across the political spectrum.</p><p><a name="0606262000240">Indeed, the Government&#146;s
confidence in community organisations as deliverers of change, in
relation to foundation hospitals and trust schools, has sometimes found
more support on the Conservative Benches than on the Government
Benches. None the less, I welcome the Prime Minister&#146;s
announcement last week that there is no longer an ideological barrier
to involving the private and voluntary sectors in the delivery of
public services. Perhaps, as Steve Bubb, the chief executive of the
Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, told the
<i> Financial Times </i>on
Friday,</p><a name="0606262000306"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;things are
finally beginning to
move&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0606262000241">after repeated
pledges since 2000, but limited action. Like him, we will believe it
when we see it. The <i> Financial Times</i>
said:</p><a name="0606262000307"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Tony
Blair announced a review of the procurement and supply of community
equipment worth &#163;200 million a year. This included everything
from wheelchairs to the provision of aids needed to keep people out of
care homes and to get them out of, or prevent them from entering,
hospital.</p></ul><a name="0606262000308"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Big
organisations including the Royal National Institute for the Deaf and
Royal National Institute for the Blind and the Red Cross will be
involved in the review and will be encouraged to bid for the revamped
service that will
result.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0606262000242">I am
underwhelmed. Out of an NHS budget of &#163;75 billion, the
Prime Minister is able to find &#163;200 million-worth of
work for the charity sector. I have news for him: in my constituency,
the Red Cross already has that sort of contract. He will have to do
better than that to turn his good intentions into reality.</p><p><a name="0606262000243"><b><a name="0606262000460">Tom
Levitt:</b> I was present at the conference at which the Prime
Minister gave his speech on Thursday, as was the Parliamentary
Secretary, Cabinet Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster,
North (Edward Miliband). The Prime Minister&#146;s announcements, of 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 35</b><br>which that was one example&#151;we are talking about something that is
in addition to the valuable work that the voluntary sector already does
in the health service&#151;were widely welcomed not just by people
from the third sector and the voluntary sector, but by everyone at that
conference, including partners in the private sector and the local
government sector. It was a good conference with a positive outcome
that will take us forward in a way that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
Government never managed to do in the past.</p><p><a name="0606262000244"><b><a name="0606262000461">Mr.
Turner:</b> Of course, we all welcome the sentiment. The
question is how long it will take the Prime Minister to implement
sentiments that he expressed in 2000.</p><a name="0606262000298"><p>It is right for the
Government to see the third sector as an alternative provider of public
services, but they must realise three things. If a charity is
commissioned to deliver a service, it must be able to decide how.
Voluntary organisations work so well because, as the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster said, their independence leaves them free to
innovate. If Governments&#151;national or local, of whatever
political colour&#151;prescribe how the service should be provided,
the hard-won expertise of those charities will be wasted and the
contract will not be delivered as well as could have been the case. If
one sets up a national or regional contract&#151;perhaps that is what
the Prime Minister intends for home-care appliances&#151;one loses
the local autonomy and local commitment, and probably the local
fundraising, which add love and care to contract
delivery.</p><a name="0606262000299"><p>If we demand that
voluntary organisations meet the Government&#146;s objectives too
closely, we may find, as the National Council for Voluntary
Organisations suggested in its discussion paper in 2001, that
each</p><a name="0606262000309"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;may be
perceived as little more than an agent of the
state.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0606262000245">It is essential
that charities are not too restricted so that the public continue to
trust them. Furthermore, we have known for years that too many
Government contracts with charities and voluntary organisations last
only a single year. Funding often arrives late from Departments. If a
contract is too short, long-term planning is impossible and
organisations cannot take the risk of investing for the future. Indeed,
they sometimes have to divert other income to keep the contract afloat.
Staff become uncertain about the future and thus look for new jobs, and
delivery declines and the vulnerable
suffer.</p><p><a name="0606262000246"><b><a name="0606262000462">Meg
Hillier:</b> The hon. Gentleman is being dismissive of the
important step that the Prime Minister announced. I speak as someone
who saw one relative die while waiting for a wheelchair to be provided
by a private company on contract, while another waited six months. In
the meantime, it was the voluntary sector that provided. The view of
the Prime Minister and the Government that such things should be
provided properly and well through a good contract with the voluntary
sector is the right step
forward.</p><p><a name="0606262000247"><b><a name="0606262000463">Mr.

dispute with that at all.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 36</b><br><p><a name="0606262000248"><b><a name="0606262000464">Tom
Levitt:</b> The hon. Gentleman should read the Prime
Minister&#146;s speech of last Thursday in which he identified the
problem of short-term funding. We are addressing that through the way
in which local authorities and others are funded, and it should also be
addressed through the way in which the voluntary sector is funded. Is
the hon. Gentleman aware that the sector is a partner in the delivery
of services? The nightmare scenario that he described will not happen
in a proper partnership in which the views of different sides are
respected. If the partnership cannot agree how the services should be
delivered, there simply will not be a partnership, but we will not see
the nightmare about which he
talks.</p><p><a name="0606262000249"><b><a name="0606262000465">Mr.
Turner:</b> I am not sure that I was talking about any kind of
nightmare at all. I was saying that there is a great opportunity for
the voluntary and charity
sectors.</p><p><a name="0606262000250">The problem is
that seven out of 13 Departments still do not even keep records of
whether funding is agreed before the beginning of the financial year,
or of whether their contracts run for more than one year, despite the
advice of the Public Accounts Committee. Of those Departments that kept
records, the Northern Ireland Office was best&#151;I congratulate it
on that&#151;but the Home Office, which was the sponsoring Department
for the voluntary sector, was
worst.</p><p><a name="0606262000251">The Bill is
important for the charity sector and the people and purposes that that
sector serves. It has already been thoroughly scrutinised. It was one
of the first Bills to be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny and it has
twice been rigorously examined in another place. However, several
provisions remain that will need to be debated and, perhaps, amended in
Committee if the Bill is to allow the sector to meet its
potential.</p><p><a name="0606262000252">The most
contentious matter is clearly the public benefit test. Since the 17th
century&#151;and in codified form since 1891&#151;there has been a
requirement to demonstrate public benefit for most charitable purposes.
However, as the Minister said, there has been a presumption of public
benefit for the relief of poverty, the advancement of religion and the
advancement of education. The Bill will abolish that presumption, so
any organisation with a charitable purpose will have to demonstrate a
public benefit. The Bill provides for a tortuous and
near-incomprehensible formula. Ministers have reassured Parliament that
although that will mean that our case law will be allowed to develop,
the public benefit test will remain
unchanged.</p><p><a name="0606262000253">Three groups
seem to want to the public benefit test to become more onerous. The
first is represented by the Charity Commission, the NCVO and, rather
surprisingly, the British Red Cross. The second is a group of lawyers
and other who think that although the law on charities has never been
the same in England as in Scotland, there should be a post-devolution
situation in which Scotland drives England. I was grateful to the
Minister for pointing out the objective that the three legal systems
should be compatible, but not identical. The third group is the few
Government Back Benchers who are chaffing at their failure to maintain
the iron grip of mediocrity on Britain&#146;s state schools, with the
support, for some reason, of the illiberal democrats to my left. Their
motive is essentially to strike down independent schools, which 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 37</b><br>have shown that pupils can get a better education than they could have
done from the state. They ignore the damage done to voluntary hospitals
and to charitable retirement homes. They do not seem to have thought of
the effect on universities, all of which have always charged
fees.</p>

public benefit ought to be able to be demonstrated. Every organisation
is now expected, as it registers, to publish information annually, so
that the public know what it is doing, what its objectives are and how
it is fulfilling them, and how it is raising money. Most organisations
also want to tell the public what they are spending that money on, and
that they are not spending it mainly on administration. I do not
believe that individual organisations will face any additional costs if
they are already seeking to inform the public properly. One of the
purposes of the Bill is to maintain public confidence in the charitable

religion.</p><p><a name="0606262000275">Can any hon.
Member say what it is in religious activity that confers an
identifiable public benefit&#151;the words used by the Minister for
the Cabinet Office? I am talking not about the relief of poverty, which
is ancillary to much religious activity, but about religious activities
such as prayer and moral leadership. How is an organisation to go about
demonstrating the public benefit of prayer, which is work for the
advancement of religion? How does one demonstrate objectively that
prayer offers a public benefit? It may in fact be extremely difficult
to prove that the work of an organisation for the advancement of
religion is for public benefit, and our fear is that the way will be
opened to interminable disputes, which will be no more than a job
creation scheme for lawyers and the Charity Commission.</p><p><a name="0606262000276">Finally, who can argue that

Hillier:</b> In my constituency, there are many groups of
different faiths, and it would be hard for me to find a single one that
did not provide some demonstrable public good other than moral
leadership and prayer, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. If I would
find that hard in my multicultural, multi-faith constituency, I suspect
that that would be true in other parts of the
country.</p><p><a name="0606262000278"><b><a name="0606262000483">Mr.
Turner:</b> That is precisely the point that I was
trying&#151;clearly unsuccessfully&#151;to make. The good, other
than prayer and moral leadership, is covered by other charitable
purposes. The Bill requires a religious organisation, if it is claiming
charitable status only under clause 2(2)(c), to demonstrate that the
religious activity itself&#151;the prayer and moral
leadership&#151;gives a public benefit. I am at a loss to see how one
demonstrates the public benefit of prayer.</p><p><a name="0606262000279"><b><a name="0606262000484">Martin
Horwood:</b> It seems to me to be fairly demonstrable that if
a large number of people take comfort from prayer&#151;they can be
asked whether it comforts them&#151;that is a public benefit.
However, my question is on the relief of poverty. The hon. Gentleman
said that he could not imagine an organisation for the relief of
poverty being challenged on whether it is in the public benefit, but I
remember that when I worked for Oxfam in the 1990s, large numbers of
Conservative Members fairly frequently challenged Oxfam and other
voluntary organisations on whether what they were doing was in the
public benefit. Does the hon. Gentleman wish to return to that
situation?</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 40</b><br><p><a name="0606262000280"><b><a name="0606262000485">Mr.
Turner:</b> The hon. Gentleman fails to recall what was
happening at that time. Challenges were put to some charities that they
were campaigning politically, not that they were failing to confer a
public benefit. The challenge was that they were also unlawfully
campaigning using charity money. Some people have changed their views
on that.</p><p><a name="0606262000281">Who can argue
that education is not for public benefit? The principal argument for
education being provided at the taxpayers&#146; expense is that it is
in everyone&#146;s interest that we have a better educated nation.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer argues that we should extend free
education across the developing world, presumably for the same reason.
How can it be argued that education that people pay for&#151;those
who can afford to do so&#151;is of less benefit than other benefits?
In all of these instances the Bill moves the onus. No longer will the
Charity Commission have to show that an existing charity is not for
public benefit. In future, each charity will have to show that it is
for public benefit, making some charities that have lasted for hundreds
of years guilty until proven innocent. Just in case anyone advances the
argument that an individual charity may not be as beneficial as it
should be, I remind the House that the removal of the presumption is
merely
that.</p><p><a name="0606262000282"><b><a name="0606262000486">The

consensus in the

that has not been the case. That was codified at that time. Secondly, I
think that it was Gladstone who thought that tax relief was public
expenditure. I do not share that view. Tax relief is people keeping
their own money, not the state spending
money.</p><p><a name="0606262000284"><b><a name="0606262000488">Edward

There is no question that a more beneficial tax regime that is
available for those organisations that have charitable status is
beneficial, and it represents a loss to the Exchequer. I ask the hon.

on these matters. Does he agree with the principle that all

<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 41</b><br>public benefit is at the heart of the Bill. Is it his intention to lead
his troops through the no Lobby this
evening?</p><p><a name="0606262000287"><b><a name="0606262000491">Mr.
Turner:</b> That question is somewhat premature. I am sure
that the right hon. Gentleman will find out before the end of my
speech. I know that he was a member of the Joint Committee. I shall
answer his question later.</p><p><a name="0606262000288">There are some who have advanced
the argument that an individual charity may not be as beneficial as it
should be. I remind them that the removal of the presumption is only a
removal of the presumption. Even where it remains, the commissioners
can now, and will be able to do so in future, intervene&#151;as they
did in the case of the Finsbury Park mosque, or refuse registration as
they did in the case of the Scientologists&#151;where an applicant
looks likely to go off the rails. We are not conferring on every
charity for ever, even in the three categories that I have mentioned,
the presumption of public benefit. It is more than the presumption of
public benefit.</p><p><a name="0606262000289">The
lack of a definition of religion is causing some concern. The
definition is important to ensure that those organisations that are
traditionally viewed as religious are able to maintain their charitable
status while preventing other organisations that are merely
philosophical from meeting that definition. This part of the Bill needs
further work to secure a satisfactory
definition.</p><p><a name="0606262000290">There is
great concern about the commissioners&#146; proposal to</p><a name="0606262000312"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;interpret the public benefit
requirement in the light of...modern conditions&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="0606262000291">as it would constitute a major attack on
religion if it were judged only in modern terms. It is possible to
initiate complaints to the commission but, given the time-consuming
inquiries that would ensue, that would significantly disrupt and
undermine a charity&#146;s activities.</p><p><a name="0606262000292">One of the biggest problems
facing the sector is over-regulation. Far from reducing the regulatory
burden on charities, as the Minister for the Cabinet Office claimed,
the Bill increases it, and we have already heard evidence of
over-zealous interpretation of the charity commissioners&#146; role.
I received a letter from Girlguiding UK last week, which
said:</p><a name="0606262000313"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Recent
emphasis in Charity Commission publications on the responsibilities of
charity trustees and the prospective penalties for non-compliance is
unhelpful to a largely activity-based organisation... Insistence
on highlighting charity trusteeship is discouraging adult
volunteers.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0606262000293">I welcome
the Minister&#146;s assurance that the Bill recognises and reduces
trustees&#146; fears, and we will examine that assertion with
interest in Committee. We should all focus on the need to reduce
bureaucratic demands on charitable organisations if we wish to avoid
driving the doers out. Some new regulatory measures should be removed
from the Bill, including the &#163;100,000 asset limit on
registration, but the &#163;5,000 threshold should be increased. I am
concerned that double regulation will be imposed on charities that have
hitherto been exempt, such as universities, and I am surprised that
they are prepared to be regulated not by the independent Charity
Commission, but by the Higher Education Funding Council&#151;a
creature of the Education Secretary.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 42</b><br><p><a name="0606262000294">The Bill does not say anything
about making the commission&#146;s annual public meetings accessible
to as many representatives of small charities as possible, but it is
important to do so if such charities are to continue to play a vital
role in the sector. We welcome the creation of the charity tribunal,
which provides a resolution procedure for disputes without resorting to
High Court, and thus reduces costs, but greater transparency is
required. The Bill does not allow for the award of compensation to
charities by the tribunal, the commission or, in a case of
maladministration, the ombudsman, and it does not include a provision
to assist charities and trustees that wish to refer the commission to
the tribunal. Charities must be able to challenge the
commission&#146;s decisions before the tribunal without hazarding
charitable funds, so the proposal of a suitors&#146; fund for that
purpose is attractive, and the commission is well-placed to resource
such a fund.</p><p><a name="0606262000295">Above all,
charities must not be diverted from meeting their objectives, and in
times of difficulty those objectives must be protected. When the
tribunal makes decisions it can award costs, but there is no protection
to ensure the survival of a charity that could become bankrupt in
attempting to meet such costs, so we propose that the tribunal be
required to take charities&#146; long-term survival into account when
awarding costs. We propose, too, that the commission&#151;not the
charity&#151;meet the costs of an appointment of the interim
manager&#151;previously known as the receiver.</p><p><a name="0606262000296">Finally, the Bill can take
further steps to make charities more accountable, and representatives
of trustees such as local authorities should be required to act in a
charity&#146;s best interests. We welcome the fact that the
commission has been established as a non-ministerial Government
Department, but it should be accountable to Parliament through a Select
Committee. Appointments to the commission should be subject to Select
Committee approval, to ensure that the commission is openly accountable
to Parliament and hence to the public. The Bill gives the commission
three jobs&#151;to provide advice, to regulate, and to
police&#151;but it will sometimes be hard for charities to
distinguish between those roles. The commission should be required to
make clear what is advice and what is policing so that charities
neither inadvertently break the law nor are unduly circumscribed in
their activities because there is a lack of clarity from the
commission.</p><p><a name="0606262000297">In
conclusion, we support the Bill&#146;s overall aims and we wish to
see it make reasonable progress, especially after 110 days&#146;
delay between First and Second Reading. We will work with the
Government to turn the Bill into the best framework possible within
which charities can provide the best services possible to the public.
Most charities were around long before we were, and will be around long
after. We have a duty to hand them over in good shape, and the Bill
must put no obstacles in the
way.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062611000063">4.55
pm</h5><p><a name="06062611000001"><b><a name="06062611000064">Mr.
Alan Milburn (Darlington) (Lab):</b> It is an unusual event,
at least nowadays, that a Government Bill receives an almost universal
welcome, but that is what this Bill by and large has received
from charities, from organisations representing charities, 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 43</b><br>from commentators, from the media, even from many lawyers, with the
possible exception of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner).
Given the consensus around the Bill, I was beginning to wonder whether
there was something wrong with it. But having heard the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s pretty extraordinary speech, I am beginning to
believe that most things about it are right.</p><p><a name="06062611000002">As my right hon. Friend the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster was kind enough to say earlier, I
was privileged enough to be able to chair the pre-legislative scrutiny
Committee dealing with the draft Bill some two years ago, and I should
like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the officials and
advisers who served us admirably on the Joint Committee, and to those
colleagues on both sides of both Houses, who, without exception, were a
joy to serve with and to chair.</p><p><a name="06062611000003">I like to think that the report
that we produced, in keeping with the consensus around the Bill, was
also pretty consensual, in tone and outcome. There is only one small
caveat, which is that I cannot be held personally responsible for all
the conclusions because, sadly, I had to leave the Committee before it
finalised its conclusions in order to rejoin the Cabinet, and for the
rather less consensual purpose of co-ordinating the Labour
party&#146;s general election campaign. I like to think that the
Joint Committee was a successful endeavour, and I like to think that
the general election campaign was reasonably successful too.</p><p><a name="06062611000004">I remain a real convert to the
pre-legislative process. I very much endorse what the hon. Gentleman
and my right hon. Friend said. That process is far less partisan and
far more open to analysis and debate, and, as a consequence, makes,
where it is possible, for far better law. Indeed, I should like to see
it go much further in this House and in the other
place.</p><p><a name="06062611000005">The fact that
the Government also took on board so many of the Committee&#146;s
deliberations is testimony to Ministers&#146; willingness to listen
in order to improve the Bill&#146;s content. I welcome in particular
the decisions to guarantee the independence of the Charity Commission;
to improve the proposed licensing arrangements for public collections,
to which my right hon. Friend referred; to consolidate, importantly,
charities&#146; legislation, once the Bill has successfully completed
its passage through the House; and finally, and very importantly, my
right hon. Friend&#146;s preparedness to review the performance of
the Bill in the real world five years following its completion. Each of
those changes has undoubtedly improved the Bill, as will have the
detailed scrutiny that it has already received from the very many
charity experts in another place.</p><p><a name="06062611000006">There are three principal
reasons why the Bill is needed. The first is the necessity to modernise
what is at best outdated and at worst pretty chaotic charity law. 1601
was no doubt a very fine year. It was for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth
I. She managed to thwart a rebellion led by the Earl of Essex. It was a
less successful year for the Earl of Essex because he was beheaded. I
do not say in any way, shape or form to my hon. Friends that I am
looking for such a measure to deal with latter day rebels, although I
bet that on 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 44</b><br>occasion my right hon. Friend when she was Chief Whip would have
welcomed that for certain of my hon.
Friends.</p><p><a name="06062611000007"><b><a name="06062611000065">Mr.
Andrew Mitchell (Sutton Coldfield) (Con):</b>Name
them.</p><p><a name="06062611000008"><b><a name="06062611000066">Mr.
Milburn:</b> I shall resist the temptation to name them.
However, 1601 was also the year when charities legislation was first
codified. Perhaps understandably given the huge amount of case law
covering the work, the purposes and so on of charitable organisations,
that legislation requires modernisation, and it is not surprising that
the National Council for Voluntary Organisations has called the current
law, &#147;complex and
inconsistent&#148;.</p><p><a name="06062611000009">Secondly,
today&#146;s charitable sector would be completely unrecognisable to
those who set out the first framework for charitable law, and it is
characterised by its huge diversity and enormous size. As my right hon.
Friend the Minister has said, there are about 200,000 charities, which
have an income of almost &#163;40 billion a year. Charities, from the
smallest to the largest, play a hugely important role in our country
and, indeed, in each of our constituencies. Taken together, charities
and the wider voluntary sector employ more people than the national
health service, which makes them as big, if not bigger, than the
Chinese red army or the Indian Railways, although they are hopefully
more enlightened and
efficient.</p><p><a name="06062611000010">Although
the mainstay of the sector remains small, volunteer-led, locally run
charitable organisations, we have seen some formidable and fundamental
changes in the nature of what charities do and in the way in which they
look in recent years. Organisations such as Turning Point, the British
Red Cross and the Royal National Institute for Deaf People belie the
image of an amateur, poorly run, volunteer-led organisation. Such
organisations are extremely successful, extremely large and extremely
professional, and they make a real difference&#151;for example,
housing associations are the main providers of affordable homes in our
country
nowadays.</p><p><a name="06062611000011">Organisations
such as Christian Aid, Oxfam, Save the Children and the Red Cross play
an important role in development. Most instructively, voluntary
hospices have not only become the main providers of care for the
terminally ill, but given birth to a new branch of modern medicine in
this country and throughout the
world.</p><p><a name="06062611000012"><b><a name="06062611000067">Mr.
Drew:</b> On the roles and functions of organisations, the
number of social enterprise organisations is clearly growing. Will
redefining the law on whether charities are fit for purpose help social
enterprises to expand? Social enterprises are clearly not set up with
charitable purposes, but they are not private businesses and are
obviously not part of the
state.</p><p><a name="06062611000013"><b><a name="06062611000068">Mr.
Milburn:</b> My hon. Friend has made an extremely good point.
The voluntary sector is now characterised by huge diversity not only in
terms of size, but in terms of form&#151;there are social
enterprises, community organisations, residents&#146; organisations
and charities.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 45</b><br><p><a name="06062611000014">In a moment, I shall touch on
the point that the Government have tried in this Bill and other
legislation to make it easier for voluntary organisations to choose
from a variety of different legal forms. My right hon. Friend the
Minister has referred to the charitable incorporated organisation,
which we touched on in Joint Committee, and there are other forms, too.
I welcome the blossoming in voluntary and community organisations,
which are making a difference in how services are delivered not only
locally, but nationally, and I welcome the diversity that we are
beginning to see within the voluntary
sector.</p><p><a name="06062611000015">The third
reason why the Bill is needed is that the right framework of law and
regulation can help realise the potential, which the hon. Member for
Isle of Wight has touched on, that undoubtedly exists for the sector to
grow even further, which would help the Government to deal with some of
the formidable social challenges faced by a modern society such as
ours. Because charitable organisations are often grounded in local
communities, they are well placed to grow social capital, which can
deal with big social issues such as fighting crime, improving health or
regenerating communities. Some of the most inspiring people whom I have
met in my constituency are members of community organisations who are
leading the local effort to tackle such types of
disadvantage.</p><p><a name="06062611000016">The
truth is that we now live in an era in which, by and large, citizens
are far more informed and inquiring; they know more and want to be
engaged more. The old proposition that our job here is to do things to
people no longer applies&#151;doing things with people holds the key
to progress. In that context, charitable and voluntary organisations
have an enormous role to play. A vibrant voluntary and, in particular,
charitable sector forged from the combined efforts of millions of
unpaid volunteers should surely be the bedrock of a modern civil
society based, as it is, on active
citizenship.</p><p><a name="06062611000017">In other
words, charities can do more than do good&#151;they have at least the
potential to change the way in which our country is governed. That is
long overdue. For decades, policymakers&#151;this is not a partisan
point, as it applies to all parties of Government&#151;have practised
a top-down approach in dealing with the big social issues of the day. I
see that graphically illustrated in my own part of the world, the
north-east, where the inner-city regeneration schemes of the 1970s and
the 1980s were characterised by one thing&#151;the pouring in of
millions, in some cases hundreds of millions, of pounds of public
investment, with, at its heart, the fallacy that was the failure to
consult and, more importantly, to involve the residents who were the
supposed beneficiaries of such resources. It is hardly surprising that
such schemes came and went, came and went again, and failed. Some of
the new programmes that I am proud to say that this Government have
pioneered, such as the new deal for communities, have begun to change
that top-down approach and to substitute a bottom-up approach whereby
local residents are not only consulted on, but involved in, how
services are provided and how their communities are run.</p><p><a name="06062611000018">However, we need to go beyond
individual initiatives, however good they might be, to a wider approach
encompassing what the Government do, and how the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 46</b><br>state behaves, to empower individual citizens and local communities to
take greater control and thereby exercise far greater responsibility
for themselves. That is where charities not only have a key role but
stand before an open goal. Over recent years, the reforms that the
Government have made in our public services to introduce common
standards and systems of inspection allow our country to make progress
towards a system that is commonplace in other European countries, where
the origin of the provider becomes far less important than the quality
of services that they provide.</p><p><a name="06062611000019">In local government nowadays,
more and more services are run by the private sector. In social
services, the majority of elderly care services have been contracted
out to the private sector. There are issues about standards and so on,
but by and large it is fair to say that standards are better than they
were 10 or 20 years ago. In education, we have more
partnerships between the public and private sectors. I would argue that
those partnerships have helped to drive up standards, particularly in
the most disadvantaged communities. As for health, when I was Health
Secretary I signed a concordat with the private sector. That was not
universally popular with Labour Members, and was indeed subject to a
great deal of criticism from Opposition Members. We brought in new
overseas providers, again from the private sector. The end result has
been to improve standards and outcomes and to shorten waiting times to
the benefit of NHS patients.</p><p><a name="06062611000020">The next step is to move beyond
an automatic assumption that the only alternative to the public sector
is the private sector. Over the next decade, the charitable and
voluntary sector should become as integral to public service delivery
in Britain as either the public or the private sector. It can help to
open up public services so that they become far more responsive and
offer those who use them far greater
choice.</p><p><a name="06062611000021"><b><a name="06062611000069">David
Taylor:</b> My right hon. Friend eulogises the benefits that
he asserts have resulted from partnerships between the private and
public sector in the world of education. Does he not accept that at
least some of those benefits have been somewhat tokenistic and that
most partnerships have come about as a result of sharing sports
facilities, musical access and so forth? Very few indeed have been
rooted in the sharing of teaching and learning skills of a more
conventional nature.</p><p><a name="06062611000022"><b><a name="06062611000070">John
Bercow:</b> With friends like
that!</p><p><a name="06062611000023"><b><a name="06062611000071">Mr.
Milburn:</b> Thank you to my supposed hon. Friend, or whatever
he is. I will come to precisely that point in a few moments. When the
Joint Committee was taking evidence, we heard about some good examples
of meaningful partnership between the private and state sector,
particularly in education. To be honest, we also heard about some
pretty poor examples, where the lack of partnership between the sectors
was more evident. In large part, the test of public benefit, which some
have decried, can help to address the deficiencies and to realise the
potential of partnerships. I will return to that theme in a
moment or two.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 47</b><br><p><a name="06062611000024">It seems to me that, if we can
get the framework right, the voluntary and charitable sector could be
doing far more than it does. I have never really understood, for
example, why voluntary or charitable organisations should not be able
to run more welfare to work or child care programmes. I have never
understood why cancer charities should not be given the opportunity to
run more cancer services. I would certainly like to see us building, as
a society and a country, on the pioneering work undertaken by an
organisation such as the Royal National Institute for the Deaf in
negotiating substantial discounts on behalf of NHS patients on the
supply of digital hearing aids and then going on to work with NHS
hearing services in order to ensure that those aids can be properly
provided and fitted to the deaf or hard of hearing.</p>

<p><a name="06062611000025">My argument, unlike that of the
Conservative party, is not that charities can or should replace the
state, but that the public sector, the voluntary sector and the
charitable sector should be partners rather than rivals. While
charities can do much more, there is much that the state, for reasons
of efficiency and equity, has to do. In truth, in this era of worldwide
terror, mass migration and global competition in which we live, only
Governments can provide security to citizens. Modern Governments,
however, have another equally critical role&#151;to empower more
people so that the opportunities that some have always enjoyed are
redistributed more widely in our society and it is here, I believe,
that the charitable and voluntary sector comes into its own.</p><p><a name="06062611000026">The potential is already there,
but I believe that realising it will require a new drive to bring in
the sector from the cold. That depends, first, on the Government
providing fair rules and fair funding. A good start has already been
made, but Ministers recognise that there is more to do. Secondly, it
depends on the sector&#151;charities and voluntary organisations
alike&#151;putting its own house in order. Charitable organisations,
just like private or public sector organisations, cannot expect to get
something for nothing. The Parliamentary Secretary, my hon. Friend the
Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband) is quite right that, to
get a better funding regime, charitable organisations need to
demonstrate the added value that they can bring to our key public
services. They need to be clearer about what they are promising and
what they can deliver and they need to get tough about the value of
their work, not just its cost.</p><p><a name="06062611000027">Thirdly, charitable
organisations need a system of regulation and law that allows them to
demonstrate that they are fit for purpose as they broaden their role
and provide more services. That is where the Bill, in my view, becomes
so important, but has a delicate balancing act to perform. On the one
hand, it needs to assure the public that there is probity in the
charitable sector as its role expands. On the other, it needs to avoid
the temptation of over-prescription and burdensome regulation. It is
worth recalling that, according to one survey at least, charities come
second only to churches in the public&#146;s league table of
trustworthy organisations. They have a trustworthy rating of 48 per
cent. By contrast, Government have a rating of 6 per
cent.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 48</b><br><p><a name="06062611000028"><b><a name="06062611000072">Bob

political parties have a rating of 1 per cent. I am not sure whether
the Liberal Democrats score. The Joint Committee was especially keen to
ensure that smaller charities did not find that their volunteers and
necessarily limited resources were swamped by paperwork, more red tape
or over-regulation. We took evidence from organisations that represent
small charities and heard their concerns about that. We made a series
of suggested changes to the draft Bill as a result. I am personally
pleased that many of our recommendations have been taken on board in
the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06062611000030"><b><a name="06062611000074">John

over-prescriptive regulation and we often complain about that, but I
hope that he accepts that the flipside of the coin can be unduly
ambiguous legislation and that the Government would want to avoid that,
too. Earlier, the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) spoke
powerfully about independent schools sharing facilities, to the public
benefit, and how that might be viewed as a criterion for retaining
charitable status. I do not object to that&#151;it is perfectly
sensible. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that another way forward
might be to say that, if those independent schools can prove that they
provide permanent access to people from low socio-economic groups, it
might also be proof of their public
benefit?</p><p><a name="06062611000031"><b><a name="06062611000075">Mr.
Milburn:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting and
telling point. I received an interesting letter from the Independent
Schools Council, which, as many hon. Members know, represents the vast
majority of private schools and charitable private
schools.</p><p><a name="06062611000032"><b><a name="06062611000076">Helen

that that has clarified the point.</p><p><a name="06062611000034">Jonathan Shepherd of the
Independent Schools Council gave evidence before the Joint Committee
and he made an interesting point in a letter to me dated 22
June. He referred to the presumption that the hon. Member for
Isle of Wight defended: because an organisation is
educational, it is automatically charitable. The letter
stated:</p><a name="06062611000059"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
presumption has sheltered lazy charities because they did not have to
demonstrate public benefit... The new Charity Commission checks
will not allow charities to get away with being lazy or disengaged from
society.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062611000035">The hon. Member
for Buckingham (John Bercow) therefore makes a good point. Perhaps he
could make it privately&#151;or publicly&#151;to the hon. Member
for Isle of Wight.</p><p><a name="06062611000036">On
regulation or deregulation, the charitable incorporated organisation,
which is the new legal form for charities, to which my right hon.
Friend the Minister referred, is genuinely deregulatory. It avoids the
need for dual registration that most charities 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 49</b><br>currently experience. Similarly, the advent of a legal appeals mechanism
through the charity tribunal is an important antidote to the additional
powers that the Bill gives the Charity Commission. I welcome the fact
that the Government have agreed with the Committee&#146;s call for a
review of the burden of regulation on charities. I believe that that
review is now under
way.</p><p><a name="06062611000037">It is slightly
less welcome that the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendation that the
Charity Commission should be required to use its powers
proportionately, fairly and reasonably has been only partially
incorporated in the Bill. As my right hon. Friend suggested, the word
&#147;proportionate&#148; appears in the measure. However,
&#147;fairly&#148; and &#147;reasonably&#148; do not. One out
of three is not too bad but given the genuine concerns that were
expressed in another place and the continuing need to reassure
especially the smaller charities that they will not face some sort of
Big Brother Charity Commission with extensive new powers at its
disposal, I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends might be able to
go a little
further.</p><p><a name="06062611000038">If the
balance can be got right, regulation as proposed in the Bill can be a
protection, not a distraction for charities. Part of the purpose of the
Bill, the Committee was told by the Government, was to protect the
charity brand. We heard evidence from elsewhere in the world&#151;I
remember in particular the evidence that we received from the United
States of America&#151;about how organisational and regulatory
failure had combined in a succession of scandals affecting individual
charities, such that the charity brand was contaminated and public
confidence in charities severely dented. In that sense, charities face
an especially tough accountability test. They rely ultimately on public
giving, so they must be confident of public support. As we know,
however, there is much public confusion about the most basic of facts:
what qualifies to be a charity and what does not. There is a perception
gap between what people think is, or at least should be, charitable and
what is charitable according to the law. We know, for example, that 97
per cent. of people surveyed think that Oxfam is and deserves to be a
charity. Only 15 per cent. of people think that Tate Modern&#151;not
too far from this place&#151;is a charity. Fewer still think that
Eton is a charity. Closing that perception gap is clearly important if
charities are to enjoy continued public
confidence.</p><p><a name="06062611000039"><b><a name="06062611000078">Bob
Russell:</b> I apologise for my late arrival at the
debate&#151;I had other parliamentary commitments this afternoon. The
right hon. Gentleman will recall that I served on the Committee under
his chairmanship. I shall put the point to him now that I put in the
Committee. Does he agree that were Eton to have a flag day, people
might accept that it is a charity?</p><p><a name="06062611000040"><b><a name="06062611000079">Mr.

</p><p><a name="06062611000041">The Bill&#146;s
answer is to introduce a public benefit test, which all charities will
have to pass in order to gain charitable status. Unlike the
Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, I very much welcome the
introduction of that test. We must concede, however, that it is by far
the most controversial aspect of the Bill, particularly when it applies
to private hospitals and private schools. It was certainly the issue
that took up most time on the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 50</b><br>Joint Committee, with many different points of view represented, and it
sparked sometimes fierce debates in the other place. The Committee
concluded:</p><a name="06062611000060"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Since the purpose of
the Bill, according to the Minister, is to protect the charity brand,
it is important that any new law on charity must properly deal with the
issue of public benefit.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062611000042">For some, this is deeply
ideological terrain. There is antipathy in some quarters&#151; even,
I guess, among those on these Labour Benches&#151;towards private
education per se. That is not my starting point. For me, politics is
not about taking things away from people, or levelling down, but about
giving things to people&#151;levelling up. That is why I support the
proposition that we should have more choice, not less. It is also why I
am a long-term advocate of partnerships between the public and private
sectors. The widespread recognition nowadays that the old divide does
nobody any good is welcome. In the national health service, for
example, partnerships between public and private sectors are now
commonplace and, for most patients, welcome.</p><p><a name="06062611000043">As the briefing that all
Members received recently from the Independent Schools Council
demonstrated, many enlightened private schools have made a great effort
to open their doors to the wider community. Partnerships with state
schools to teach minority subjects, to develop distance learning
materials, to undertake summer schools and even to prepare pupils for
university have been fostered. Therefore, we know that partnership can
deliver the goods. The creation of both city academies and trust
schools provides further opportunities to make partnerships between
private and state schools even more meaningful and to help to bring an
end to the educational apartheid that has in the view of many been so
damaging to schooling in our country.</p><p><a name="06062611000044">Where private schools engage in
such partnerships, they make a good case for providing genuine and
direct benefit to the wider public. The argument that we heard on the
Joint Committee that private schools deserve charitable status because
they save the taxpayer money by educating children who would otherwise
have to go to the local state school, however, is not helpful to their
case. That is both a fallacious and deeply complacent argument. On the
same basis, private gyms, I presume, might become charities, as it
could be argued that they dampen demand for local authority facilities
and so reduce the cost to the public purse.</p><p><a name="06062611000045">Charitable status should not be
a given; it should have to be proven. While many private schools make
their facilities available to state schools, the latest report by the
Independent Schools Council&#151;&#147;Good Neighbours&#148;,
published in 2003, which is about relationships between state and
private schools&#151;says that the majority do not, and
that</p><a name="06062611000061"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;absence of
charitable status makes little difference to... a school&#146;s
willingness to make its facilities
available.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062611000046">When,
according to the Independent Schools Council&#146;s own report, 48
per cent. of private schools that are charitable never make any of
their facilities available to state schools, people are bound to ask
what the public get back for the &#163;100 million of public
expenditure that such schools enjoy in tax benefit earned as a direct
consequence of their charitable status. At present, only some can
answer that question. In future, all will have to be able to answer it,
because 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 51</b><br>the Bill removes the automatic presumption that every educational
venture is, by dint of being educational, also charitable. Instead, it
introduces the much-decried public benefit
test.</p><p><a name="06062611000047">Public
expenditure is not, and cannot be, a free good. It rightly comes with
strings attached: it must be a something-for-something deal&#151;in
this case, tax advantage in exchange for public benefit. I have no
objection to that principle. Indeed, I think it is a principle that we
should enshrine far more fairly than we do at present, and that applies
as much to private charitable hospitals as to private
schools.</p><p><a name="06062611000048"><b><a name="06062611000080">Mr.
Andrew Turner:</b> Would the right hon. Gentleman apply that
to any form of tax
relief?</p><p><a name="06062611000049"><b><a name="06062611000081">Mr.
Milburn:</b> We are not discussing any form of tax relief, but
leaving that aside, I think it no bad thing to ask what we are
receiving in return for public expenditure. The hon. Gentleman may not
think that it is public expenditure, but it could at least be described
as public expenditure forgone. As he would be the first to say, it is
not our money; it is the taxpayer&#146;s money. It just so happens
that when we are in government, we are responsible for applying
different purposes for the taxpayer&#146;s money. It seems to me a
good principle that when people work hard to earn money and pay it into
the Exchequer, we, as custodians of the public purse, should say
&#147;Here: this is what you get back.&#148; If the hon. Gentleman
is inclined to say that that applies to some areas of public
expenditure but not others, I think people are entitled to ask him why
he thinks that a level playing field should not apply to all areas of
public
expenditure.</p><p><a name="06062611000050"><b><a name="06062611000082">Mr.
Andrew Mitchell:</b> The right hon. Gentleman knows that that
was the key point raised in the scrutiny Committee, and the point of
greatest contention. Surely what we should be pointing out today is
that after a great deal of discussion, some of it very heated, the
entire Committee was able to camp on the position set out in our
report, which the Government have endorsed. Will the right hon.
Gentleman urge his right hon. and hon. Friends not to try to unpick a
deal with which everyone can
live?</p><p><a name="06062611000051"><b><a name="06062611000083">Mr.
Milburn:</b> I think that I have done quite a bit of urging
already in my speech, but the hon. Gentleman is right: we had heated
discussions, but we reached a consensus. I shall say more about that
shortly.</p><p><a name="06062611000052"><b><a name="06062611000084">David
Taylor:</b> In the &#147;costs&#148; column of the
cost-benefit analysis applying to private schools, my right hon. Friend
lists only the estimated cost of various tax reliefs. Should he not
also have included an estimate of the cost of the damaging impact on
local state schools of academically selective, socially divisive
schools in the community that tend to cream off the most motivated and
academic young
people?</p><p><a name="06062611000053"><b><a name="06062611000085">Mr.
Milburn:</b> We addressed that point in questioning the
various representatives of the private school sector who appeared
before the Committee. I am not here to 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 52</b><br>defend private schools or otherwise; what interests me is whether the
public receive benefit in exchange for the expenditure that we make on
their behalf. That is my fundamental
concern.</p><p><a name="06062611000054">If properly
applied, the public benefit test could drive forward partnerships
between the private and the public sectors and, in particular, between
private and state schools. I was very taken with the evidence to the
Committee of one private school head teacher when he
argued that the new public benefit test will
accelerate the trend for the rest to follow the lead of the best.
Indeed, the Independent Schools Council has welcomed the Bill and its
general secretary, Mr. Jonathan Shephard, told the Joint Committee that
he agreed with the proposition that the new test should be used as a
lever to get more schools to provide more public benefit.</p><p><a name="06062611000055">And here we need to be certain
that the Bill will do what it purports to do. On that
count&#151;notwithstanding strong differences of opinion on the
question of the charitable status of individual schools and
hospitals&#151;the Joint Committee had grave concerns. Those concerns
were accentuated by evidence from the Charity Commission that the
public benefit test as defined in the draft Bill would have no impact
on the charitable status of private schools or hospitals. That led us
to conclude that</p><a name="06062611000062"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;while
a detailed statutory definition of public benefit would be too
inflexible, nonetheless there is a need for a more explicit definition
of public benefit in connection with the
Bill.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062611000056">We went
on to recommend that a set of principles should be included in the Bill
or in government guidance. New clause 4 requires the Charity Commission
to issue such guidance which it has already helpfully drawn up in draft
form.</p><p><a name="06062611000057">The challenge
now for Ministers is to assure themselves and the House that the clause
and the draft guidance are clear enough in setting the framework for
the Charity Commission to guarantee public benefit; otherwise there is
not much point in introducing a new test. In evidence to the Joint
Committee, the Government told us that the public benefit test was
intended to have teeth. Providing it bites, that test can guarantee
that all charities&#151;including private schools and private
hospitals&#151;do what only some currently do: provide public benefit
that is direct not indirect, high not low, and meaningful rather than
tokenistic. That after all is the direction of travel shared in common
by all political parties, the Government, the opposition on
the Joint Committee, charities, organisations representing charities,
individual schools and the Independent Schools
Council.</p><p><a name="06062611000058">Getting
the public benefit test right is central to guaranteeing public
confidence in what charities do. Charities do good. Few if any Members
of Parliament or the public would disagree with that proposition. But
in a world where accountability is tougher, scrutiny is greater, and
the role that charities play is potentially wider, the assumption of
good is simply not good enough. It has to be proved. I welcome the Bill
because it provides a golden opportunity for charities to do just that.
It will make a huge difference to the work of charities and the wider
charitable and voluntary sector, and to each and every one of the
communities that we
represent.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 53</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06062616000107">5.33

charity in this debate and I am sure that it will not be the
last.</p><p><a name="06062616000002">I also welcome
the new ministerial team and congratulate them on bringing this Bill
before us after so long a wait. Credit is also due to the right hon.

Colchester (Bob Russell) and the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr.

and the welcome degree of consensus that has been achieved&#151;at
least, until today&#151;although I cannot go along with the rather
extreme penalties, such as beheading, that the right hon. Member
appeared to recommend for some of the dissenters. In any event, I pay
tribute to the Joint Committee&#146;s work.</p><p><a name="06062616000003">This Bill has been so long in
preparation that I remember briefing voluntary sector colleagues on the
new Charities Bill that I thought was to become law imminently long
before I was even a candidate for Parliament, let alone an MP. Now that
we are finally debating it in the Commons, I hope that with the help of
a sufficiently brisk and efficient Committee stage, we might just see
it complete its passage before the summer recess. There will certainly
be groans of disappointment from my former colleagues if we allow it to
be delayed by another three months. However, all credit to the
ministerial team for having rescued it from the long grass at
all.</p><p><a name="06062616000004">To extend the
horticultural analogy, Ministers have entered an area of public policy
that is like a huge garden, worth billions of pounds in income, as the
Minister said, and which employs 600,000 people, according to the
National Council for Voluntary Organisations. It is a garden in which
Ministers are just visiting gardeners, and they would do well to tread
carefully. The garden has diverse species of many colours and sizes. It
has plants as different in size, function and characteristics as
daisies and oak trees: from Cancer Research UK, with its &#163;240
million income and huge marketing budget, to wonderful but hard-pressed
charities in my constituency, such as Cheltenham Open Door and
Cheltenham Community Projects; from democratic membership organisations
with large volunteer bases to highly specialist trusts; and from
charities that only sell Christmas cards to important service providers
whose fees pay for the education, care and support of large numbers of
the most vulnerable in our society. This Bill must look after the
interests of them all.</p><p><a name="06062616000005">If left unattended, the garden
will not wither&#151;probably quite the reverse&#151;but weeds will
creep in, often looking pretty at first, but threatening the future
reputation of the whole. However, if the garden is cultivated and
nurtured, it will flourish, grow and produce enormous benefits for us
all.</p><p><a name="06062616000006">With this Bill,
the Government show every sign of not charging in with a mechanical
digger, as they have in a few other areas of legislation and policy.
The 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 54</b><br>careful and consultative approach has brought them the overwhelming
support of the voluntary sector, and I am pleased to say that the Bill
continues to enjoy the full support of the Liberal Democrats,
too.</p><p><a name="06062616000007">There are many
benefits of a new Charities Bill. I highlighted them to my colleagues
all those years ago, and I still commend them to the House today. They
include many of the practical steps that the Minister outlined, which
will make easier the roles of trustees, finance directors, company
secretaries, and treasurers in particular. I am sure that those
measures will be much appreciated.</p><p><a name="06062616000008">We all have delicate balances
to strike between the voluntary foundation of the best charities and
the professionalism demanded of them in today&#146;s risk-averse
world, and between the need to regulate and avoid the misuse of
publicly donated funds and the risk of over-burdensome red tape. Public
opinion will punish us either way if we get those balances
wrong.</p><p><a name="06062616000009">Public opinion
is also a strong factor in the Bill&#146;s fundraising provisions,
which we might have expected to be more contentious. However, I am
pleased that the Institute of Fundraising fully supports them as
proportionate and equitable. As a paid-up member still, I shall follow
my institute&#146;s lead in the hope that the provisions do not
impact unduly on the income of national charities or increase too much
the bureaucracy with which they have to deal.</p><p><a name="06062616000010">I was a little upset by the
Minister&#146;s reference to chugging. I do not know whether she
knows this, but it is short for charity mugging. It is an insulting
reference to hard-working paid and unpaid charity fundraisers, and I
hope that she will avoid it in future.</p><p><a name="06062616000011">From fundraising to
campaigning, the new heads of charity recognise among other things the
importance of what might be called campaigning functions, such as the
prevention as well as the relief of poverty, the advancement of human
rights and the promotion of religious or racial harmony, equality and
diversity. That is in line with previous Cabinet Office policy advice
that charities should not keep the experience of their front-line work
to themselves, but should be encouraged to share it with legislators
and decision makers such as ourselves, and, where appropriate, campaign
for change. It is right that we no longer ask charities to witness
poverty, injustice, ill health or cruelty, but not to speak out about
the fundamental causes of those ills.</p><p><a name="06062616000012">To put my point into new
Labour-speak, the direction of travel is broadly good. However, I agree
with the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who is no longer in the
Chamber, that the Bill, perhaps out of necessity because it is not a
Finance Bill, leaves out a big issue&#151;VAT. The Minister was
worried that including such a provision would mean a bill for half a
billion pounds, but that is exactly the bill faced by charities at
present because VAT is not recoverable. We cannot address that question
in this debate but we might find a way of doing so in Committee,
perhaps through the reporting measures proposed in part 4&#151;no
spending commitment
implied.</p><p><a name="06062616000013">The new heads
of charity will provide a level playing field as between the
educational, religious and poverty charities, mentioned by the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), which did not previously have to

<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 55</b><br>pass a public benefit test under various Charities Acts, and the vast
number of organisations that had to pass such a test. They range from
St. John Ambulance, which saves lives in local communities, to Survival
International, which works for the rights of tribal peoples around the
world. It is right, as Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts said,
that</p><a name="06062616000093"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;all charities
should have to meet a public benefit test, no matter what their
purposes&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 28
June 2005; Vol. 673, c.
154.]</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000014">The question of
whether we should add clarification and guidance to the Bill&#146;s
provisions on public benefit is already generating a lot of hot air
outside this place. On the one hand, the Independent Schools Council is
lobbying hard against any strengthening of the public benefit test, and
schools such as Fettes college in Scotland are talking about the
&#147;politics of envy&#148;. On the other side, a former aide to
Cherie Booth, writing in <i> The</i><i> Guardian</i> this weekend,
predicted &#147;class war&#148; headlines. So far, so
unhelpful.</p><p><a name="06062616000015">Today, we
witnessed the astonishing spectacle of the official Conservative
spokesman setting out in the House of Commons an even more reactionary
position than the one advocated by his noble Friends in another place.
In effect, he argued for the insertion of a special status that would
require a public benefit test of St. John Ambulance but not of
Eton college. That is an astonishing position. I do not know whether
the Leader of the Opposition is aware of what his hon. Friend is
proposing, but it does not sound like the new model Conservative party
to me.</p><p><a name="06062616000016">The Minister
gave reassuring responses to various interventions about the bodies and
organisations that would not be affected by the Bill&#146;s public
benefit test, but as the right hon. Member for Darlington said, it
would seem desirable that such brave new legislation should make some
kind of difference to somebody in terms of the public benefit test. I
shall, therefore, clarify the Liberal Democrat position, which has been
consistent throughout the Bill&#146;s long history. Along with the
NCVO and the Charity Commission in some of its guidance, we believe
that the current public benefit test leaves the law in a muddle and
that the Bill needs to be strengthened in that respect. I draw the
attention of Members to the comments signed by Stuart Etherington of
the NCVO, David Harker of Citizens Advice, Michael Lake of Help the
Aged and John Low of the Royal National Institute for Deaf People. They
say:</p><a name="06062616000094"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Clarity
is vital if we are to secure a level playing field for all charities
operating today and for others being formed. If the public believes
access to a charity&#146;s services is unduly restricted because of
high fees, or for any other reason, the case for charity will be
undermined. We hope that MPs will support our call for clarity and put
this vital question beyond
doubt.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000017">The Bill does not
yet do that.</p><p><a name="06062616000018">An
interesting new law has been passed in Scotland. Adopting its
terminology, which was supported by Labour and Liberal Democrat
Ministers north of the border, would seem to have much to commend it,
not least the obvious advantage of consistency. That is not compulsory,
but it is clearly desirable for charities that operate both north and
south of the
border.</p><p><a name="06062616000019">The ISC is
simultaneously lobbying against such clarification and advising its
members on how to 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 56</b><br>respond to the tightening of the law on public benefit. Its 2005
briefing on the subject
stated:</p><a name="06062616000095"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Schools
should, therefore, be fully prepared to demonstrate public benefit as
early as possible, and not later than the autumn of 2007. ISC advice
for the past year has consistently been that schools should audit the
public benefit they provide, and should be prepared to think
imaginatively of ways of extending public
benefit.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000020">I could not put
it better myself&#151;exactly the outcome that Liberal Democrats
seek.</p><p><a name="06062616000021">Today,
I consulted Tim Hastie-Smith, the headmaster of Dean Close school, an
independent school in my constituency, who told me
that</p><a name="06062616000096"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;schools are big
money-making ventures whether they like it or not. How can we look the
public in the face as charities unless we are doing things that are
obviously charitable in their
intent?&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000022">Before the
Minister nods too much, I should tell her that Mr. Hastie-Smith told me
that he supported strengthening the public benefit test and thought
that Dean Close school had nothing to fear from it. I suspect that the
hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), who is also no longer in his
place, might even support that, judging by the sentiment of his
intervention.</p><p><a name="06062616000023">Having
enjoyed Dean Close&#146;s excellent theatre facilities&#151;not
because I pay fees, but as the parent of a local four-year-old in a
wonderful community-based dance production&#151;I fully understand
Mr. Hastie-Smith&#146;s confidence. He also cited the example of
Christ&#146;s Hospital, which has the kind of endowment fund that the
Charity Commission might rightly look twice at in any charity, but
which has such a good record of charitable activity that it too would
be at no risk from a reasonable public benefit test of the kind that we
would support.</p><p><a name="06062616000024"><b><a name="06062616000111">Hilary

the hon. Gentleman has been talking are speaking about public benefit.
The issue is the means of getting there. There is much argument among
lawyers about whether anything new would bring clarity to the whole
sector or whether including something else in the Bill would bring
further uncertainty, given that we are talking about something that, up
until now, has largely been delivered by case law. That case law would
have to be undone and we would have to start again. I wanted to assure
him that we all will the ends; the question is, what are the right
means to achieve those ends?</p>

Armstrong:</b> The Charity Commission goes on to say that it
would have to be absolutely clear that any further&#151;I cannot
remember the exact words&#151;deliberation did not bring with it
unintended consequences. That is precisely what I am referring to.
Clarity in one aspect may bring a lack of clarity in other aspects in
terms of how the public benefit test was to apply to other
charities.</p><p><a name="06062616000027"><b><a name="06062616000114">Martin
Horwood:</b> Again, I am grateful to the Minister. I suspect
that we may be citing different parts of what the Charity Commission
has said. I was not citing guidance relating to the effects of the
Bill; I was referring to guidance advising charities on whether there
is clarity in the current situation, which there is not. I still
support taking the opportunity to add clarity.</p><p><a name="06062616000028">In case there is any doubt
about the effect that our amendments would have, or in case any party
is thinking of caricaturing them as intending some kind of bonfire of
charitable status, I should say that we will aim to table amendments in
Committee that will make it absolutely clear that, just as fee-charging
special schools or carers support charities should not be caught by a
stiffer test, nor should independent educational establishments that
follow the ISC&#146;s guidance on imaginatively seeking ways to
increase their public benefit. As the first ever friend of the
country&#146;s leading independent specialist college for disabled
young people, the National Star college, based in and next to my
constituency, I would be in trouble if I suggested any measure that
threatened its charitable status.</p><p><a name="06062616000029">The last area that I will touch
on are the role and powers of the new improved Charity Commission
established by the Bill and of its new overseer, the charity tribunal.
I use this opportunity to restore a measure of consensus on this side
of the House by supporting the comments of the hon. Member for Isle of
Wight when he suggested the establishment of a suitors&#146; fund to
reduce the risk to charitable funds in approaching the charity
tribunal. There is much to recommend that and I support it. Hon.
Members should pay tribute to the outstanding individuals, such as
Geraldine Peacock, who have led or served as charity commissioners, but
we must also acknowledge the dissatisfaction with the practical results
of the Charity Commission&#146;s action&#151;and occasionally
inaction&#151;which has occasionally run high. I am afraid that I
have my own examples of that from personal
experience.</p><p><a name="06062616000030">While I
was the director of fundraising of the Alzheimer&#146;s Society, a
new charity called the Alzheimer&#146;s Foundation was set up. It was
registered by the Charity Commission, but it had no background in
Alzheimer&#146;s research, no volunteer or supporter base and no
donor base. However, it suddenly started running an extremely large
and&#151;to us&#151;threatening fundraising campaign through which
it sought large amounts of public funds. It turned out that the charity
had a close association with an American direct marketing agency. We
believed that that agency loaned the trustees of the charity the money
to establish the fundraising campaign, and that the donations that
resulted from it were used to pay back the American agency. That was
obviously good business for the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 58</b><br>American agency, but extremely poor value for the donors whose money had
overwhelmingly been used to pay a business, rather than for
Alzheimer&#146;s research, as they
believed.</p><p><a name="06062616000031">At the time,
we approached the Advertising Standards Authority, the Charity
Commission and, on the side, the <i> Daily Mirror.</i> The most useful
of the three was the ASA, which came down on the organisation like a
ton of bricks and stopped the misleading claims that it was making in
the public arena. The <i> Daily Mirror </i>was pretty useful, too, but I
am afraid that the Charity Commission considered the matter for a long
time before deciding that there was no problem. It was only when we
approached the then Minister, the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona
Mactaggart), and she took up the matter&#151;I am grateful to
her&#151;that we miraculously got a result from the Charity
Commission. There are thus weaknesses in the regulatory
regime.</p><p><a name="06062616000032">While there is
such disquiet about the role of the charity commissioners at present,
the Government want to extend the number of charities to be registered,
add a new status of charitable incorporated organisations, which will
be regulated by the Charity Commission, rather than by Companies House,
and add new powers and responsibilities to advise and guide charities.
A Government who want to do that without suggesting how the
organisation will cope with its expanded responsibilities are pretty
brave. Each of those measures is welcome in itself, but nothing will
damage faster the critically important public confidence and trust to
which the Minister rightly referred than the creation of a regulatory
regime that&#151;however accidentally&#151;turns out to be less
effective than the one we have at present. We will have to pay careful
attention to that matter in Committee, but it should not disturb the
healthy cross-party consensus in support of such a worthwhile and
long-overdue
Bill.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062616000108">5.52

Michael (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I
welcome my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office to her
new role. I also congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet
Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward
Miliband), on becoming the first Minister with responsibility right
across the third sector. I warn him that that is not only a big
opportunity, but a big challenge. It is a pleasure to speak after my
right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn). I
congratulate him on his contribution to both the scrutiny of the Bill
and the general election
campaign.</p><p><a name="06062616000034">I want to
develop three points. First, we should celebrate the arrival of the
Bill and engage keenly with the outstanding issues of detail, such as
the meaning of &#147;public benefit&#148;. Secondly, we should see
the Bill in the context of the wider third sector of value-driven
organisations. Thirdly, we should accept that there is no quick fix.
The Bill should be seen as being about not the Government or Parliament
laying down the law, but relationships in the sector, among sectors and
between the Government and the third sector. Like all relationships,
they will need hard work and a lot of give and take if they are to be
successful, as has been illustrated during the debate.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 59</b><br><p><a name="06062616000035">We should celebrate the Bill as
a staging post in the Government&#146;s support for charities and the
wider voluntary and community sector. It is worth recording, with some
pride, that the Labour party has taken the sector seriously as a
partner in a way in which no previous Government have done. The Prime
Minister&#146;s interest goes back to his time as shadow Home
Secretary, when he launched what became the leader&#146;s review of
the relationship between Government and the voluntary sector. That
culminated in &#147;Building the Future Together&#148;, which was
published in 1997, and the introduction of the compact arrangements.
Those arrangements were themselves only the start of a journey that was
stimulated by both the review, which I led, and the sector&#146;s own
work, which was led by Professor Nicholas Deakin. Indeed, I welcome the
development of compact plus as the next stage of the
process.</p><p><a name="06062616000036">The
Chancellor has always emphasised the importance of values. He
introduced many improvements on the treatment and encouragement of
charities. I am especially excited by the way in which he has built
work on the role of the whole third sector into preparations for the
forthcoming comprehensive spending review by both engaging the sectors
in that work and creating connections across Whitehall. It is in that
context that the long-awaited Bill, as several hon. Members have
described it, is
important.</p><p><a name="06062616000037">The lack of
modern legislation on charities partly reflects a reasonable fear of
getting things wrong. It also reflects the sensible judgment that the
matter is not just for the Government and that a
top-down approach will not work. However, a lot has happened
in 404 years. The existing law is old and case law is too rare to cover
all contemporary issues. There are thus matters that must be grasped by
the Government and Parliament, and the need to modernise charity law is
inescapable. However, that is a difficult matter with which to deal, as
our debate has demonstrated, so introducing even such a carefully
crafted Bill, which has emerged from long consultation, deliberation
and scrutiny, must be seen as an act of courage by Ministers. The way
in which my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office made
her speech showed that she knows how courageous she is
being.</p><p><a name="06062616000038">Although
removing the presumption of charitable status in favour of the concept
of public benefit is clearly greatly welcome and a sensible minimum
step towards modernising the law, it is courageous. It is naive to
think in the modern world that all education bodies, or bodies formed
with religious aims or the aim of alleviating poverty, are
automatically charitable and working in the public interest. However,
we need to be clear about what we mean by the public interest test,
which is a job for Parliament and, especially, the Committee to which I
hope that the Bill will be committed. The last thing that we want is a
tightly-worded definition that becomes a straitjacket, so the idea that
the Charity Commission should work on the concept and consult widely is
probably sensible, as long as we are clear about the general terms of
reference for that work and the commission listens to
parliamentarians, too.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 60</b><br><p><a name="06062616000039">Our constituency work gives many
of us a useful insight into the situation in addition to any expert
knowledge or experience that we may have, as has been illustrated in
our debate. However, my hesitation arises from a past experience with
the Charity Commission that is not too far removed from that of the
hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood). During the Thatcher era,
the commission listened to people on the right wing of politics who
suggested that charities should be banned from campaigning and seeking
changes to the law or the policies of Government. The hon. Member for
Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) tried to portray those people&#146;s
pernicious activity as being against illegal activity, but it was no
such thing&#151;it was outrageous. How can organisations such as the
Alzheimer&#146;s Society, to which the hon. Member for Cheltenham
referred, NCH, Mind, Age Concern or even a local citizen&#146;s
advice bureau choose between providing a service to those whom they
exist to help and arguing the case for those with no voice of their
own? Those people were attempting to muzzle
charities.</p><p><a name="06062616000040">Of course,
charities should not undertake party politics, but charitable judgments
are inevitably also political judgments. That is why so many of us came
from community and voluntary action into political action and why we
MPs generally know where the line needs to be drawn. On that occasion,
the commissioner, to his credit, listened to cross-party concerns, and
the subsequent guidance made it clear that charities could campaign,
but that such campaigning had to be undertaken in the context of an
organisation&#146;s charitable objectives. That guidance made all
sorts of sense because it said that charities could campaign on the
issues that they existed to
promote.</p><p><a name="06062616000041">Another
example of common sense is the list of 12 specific charitable
purposes, plus a catch-all, that is set out in the Bill. Again, the
matter has been sensitive. I especially welcome the inclusion of animal
welfare on the list because it is something for which I have long
argued. There is always a danger of the reactionary argument that
animals are not part of the public, but the way in which we treat those
with which we share the planet has long been recognised as an important
measure of our humanity and is thus a proper charitable purpose. The
inclusion of animal welfare puts that beyond doubt in respect of
charities. They, like schools and like organisations that are concerned
with saving life, will have to show how they deliver the public
benefit. However, the Bill is about the vehicle for providing public
benefit, so it is a mistake to get bogged down in political detail in
respect of public schools or any other political issue.</p><p><a name="06062616000042">I hope that the Committee will
grasp the issue of public benefit intelligently. Let us explore what
those words mean and, from the debate on that, give clarity to the
Charity Commission in developing the concept further, but let us also
try to avoid being too prescriptive. The Scottish definition, which was
mentioned by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, has some merit. It is a
brave effort, but even it might turn out in the long term to be a
straitjacket, and we must avoid such dangers, otherwise we will return
to charitable legislation year after year, which would be a
mistake.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 61</b><br><p><a name="06062616000043"><b><a name="06062616000116">Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, both
for giving way and for comments he has made on matters about which we
obviously agree, but I remain puzzled as to why including something
such as the Scottish formula in the Bill would be any more prescriptive
or confusing than having that in guidance from the Charity
Commission.</p><p><a name="06062616000044"><b><a name="06062616000117">Alun
Michael:</b> There are organisations, such as the National
Council for Voluntary Organisations, that would like there to be
something in the Bill but start to express concern as soon as a
particular wording is looked at, including the Scottish wording. It is
very difficult to change anything that is in primary legislation, but
if there is a debate that looks into the concept of public benefit and
develops the idea so that it is clear what Parliament means, and that
idea is then developed further by the Charity Commission, we may be
able to deliver the consensus that we all want, and to strengthen
it.</p><p><a name="06062616000045">I am coming to
the conclusion that there is no a quick fix in terms of the wording,
although I am sure that we will all applaud if the right words are
found. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office
indicated that if there is perfect wording, she will welcome that.
However, it will be the worst of all possible worlds if we get the
wrong wording and we are then trapped by that and do not have the
flexibility to develop.</p><p><a name="06062616000046">The other argument I would make
is that the purpose of Government and Parliament must be to enable
rather than to constrict. The issue under discussion affects not only
the public sector and the responsibilities of Government, but the
active engagement of citizens. We therefore need to be very careful,
and the more flexible the definition, the better, provided that we all
work on getting clarity and consensus in the delivery of the definition
and what it means in practice.</p><p><a name="06062616000047">In its briefing to Members last
week, the Charity Commission indicated its willingness to listen to the
debate and to engage with parliamentarians as they get on with the
development of the guidance to which the hon. Member for Cheltenham
referred. I suspect that that would be a very constructive way to
proceed&#151;saying neither, &#147;No, we are not
interested,&#148; nor, that we must define too closely in law the
nature of the public benefit
test.</p><p><a name="06062616000048">Having set up a
number of bodies such as those under discussion over the years, I very
much welcome the ending of dual registration as a charity and as a
company limited by guarantee. That has worked, but it is not logical
and charitable incorporation completes a range of options, along with
the community interest company, which I had the pleasure of bringing
into effect last year, and models such as industrial and provident
societies. That will make much more sense for social and charitable
entrepreneurs in the future, because they will be able to choose the
model that best suits what they want to do, rather than having to
artificially constrain the nature of their organisation.</p><p><a name="06062616000049">As I said, my second point is
to set this debate in the context of wider developments in the third
sector. When I undertook the review of the Government&#146;s
relationship with the sector, I often referred to the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 62</b><br>voluntary and community sector as a loose and baggy monster. That is the
term that Henry James used to describe the novel, but in my mind, when
applied to the voluntary sector, it describes a friendly, creative and
dynamic creature, and it indicates the impossibility of neatly defining
a sector that includes major grant-giving trusts, major service
providers, quirky specialist organisations, universities, museums, many
of the types of organisations that have been referred to in the debate,
and a whole host of local and even neighbourhood organisations. Indeed,
the scope and variety of the sector leads to many people extrapolating
from contact with one or two charities and thinking that they know it
all. In truth, none of us knows it all; we never can, and we never
will.</p><p><a name="06062616000050">I suspect that
that is a particular problem in Whitehall, where the language used is
frequently wrong&#151;and language does matter. All too often, the
best intentions expressed in the wrong words give offence in a way that
the speaker did not intend, as when John Major tried to woo the sector.
The then Government did not spot that the &#147;make a
difference&#148; initiative would immediately be reduced to an
acronym by the machinery of government and become the &#147;MAD
initiative&#148;. However, I am talking about much deeper language,
usage and meaning. To communicate, it is necessary to understand the
language of the listeners and what is behind the terminology in
question. That is a big challenge to Government, and I know that my
hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary takes it very
seriously.</p><p><a name="06062616000051">That
challenge is even greater than before, as we now have a family of loose
and baggy monsters. There is considerable engagement between the
charitable and the wider voluntary and community sectors and the
co-operative and mutual sector and the burgeoning social enterprise
sector. The rapid development of that sector offers tremendous
opportunities. Let us not forget that we are talking about businesses
that have to achieve success in a competitive market, as well as to
deliver in respect of the values on which they were
established.</p><p><a name="06062616000052">These
sectors overlap in places, and the variety and energy are great. There
is also engagement with the activity of volunteering&#151;something
that I regard as the &#147;essential act of citizenship&#148;, and
which is not just a part of the voluntary sector but which contributes
across the piece, including to the public sector. Indeed, it is
important to realise that there is a link between these ideas, the
development of the wider third sector of overlapping entities and the
growth of corporate social responsibility&#151;and even the ideas of
enlightened shareholder value that we discussed recently in the Chamber
in relation to the Company Law Reform
Bill.</p><p><a name="06062616000053">So in looking at
the role of charities in the wider third sector, I warmly welcome three
developments in particular. The first is the engagement between these
sectors, in order to agree what they have in common and to develop a
capacity to speak to Government with a single voice when appropriate. I
stress the words &#147;when appropriate&#148; because such varied
sectors have widely varied interests and agreeing where to agree cannot
be allowed to be a substitute for a whole plethora of contacts and
engagements with both national Government and local government across
the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 63</b><br>whole piece. Having said that, the Third Sector Network&#146;s
statement of principles is enormously important in that it provides a
position statement that is necessary for dialogue with Government and
sets out the importance of independence, and the focus on social
justice, diversity, dignity and respect and on issues such as
participation and empowerment&#151;again, a theme stressed by the
Prime Minister only last week.
</p><p><a name="06062616000054">I will not go through
the whole document, but it is important to recognise that
sustainability is important and that accountability&#151;a word that
has come up time and again&#151;is to wider humanity and to enduring
values, rather than merely to the Government of the day. I hope to
continue to play a part in nurturing a dialogue on this&#151;I have
had the privilege of taking part in some discussions&#151;because it
is good for all parts of the sector in question and good for Government
that such discussion takes place. I pay tribute to the NCVO for
nurturing the process, and to all the other players for coming to the
table.</p><p><a name="06062616000055">Secondly, it is
in this context that I earlier welcomed the Chancellor&#146;s
initiative. Given the considerable overlap between different parts of
the third sector and that the one thing they have in common is that
they are driven by values, and given that the way that the Government
treats them is often very significant, it is surely right to nurture a
dialogue in pursuit of a level playing field where people can pursue
their values through a business model or a charitable model, or an
association or a partnership, or even through a company model as with
the new community interest
company.</p><p><a name="06062616000056">Thirdly, the
Prime Minister&#146;s speech last week broke with tradition by
starting a dialogue with both the wide third sector and
business&#151;together, and at the same time&#151;on the nature and
future of public service delivery. That really is joined-up thinking. I
worry a little that some parts of Whitehall see the third sector merely
as a vehicle for public service delivery. The sector does have a role
in service delivery, and there is scope both for the sector to play a
bigger role and for the sector itself to grow. But that is not the
sector&#146;s whole job and, in the case of many existing
organisations, it is not &#147;what they&#146;re there for&#148;.
The Government must be sensitive to those differences, too.
</p><p><a name="06062616000057">I point back to the
Thatcher era when the then Government failed to attract the private
sector into the provision of social housing. In a panic, they sought
instead to use the housing associations as a vehicle; that was like the
friendly grip of a hungry boa constrictor. Many small organisations had
to choose between very fast expansion, linked to a radical change in
their ethos, or going out of existence altogether. Many were forced
into being poor property developers and large-scale property managers,
and lost their way. Later, many in the sector did find the way to
combine values with that expanded role&#151;it is now a mature and
effective sector in its own right&#151;but at the time, it was a case
study for how government should not do
things.</p><p><a name="06062616000058">By contrast,
new vehicles that are created and designed for a specific purpose can
use the experience of charities in the third sector, while meeting the
aspirations of government. We are seeing that with foundation
hospitals, which have embraced principles 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 64</b><br>of co-operation and community ownership. I pay tribute to my right hon.
Friend the Member for Darlington for not only seeing, but seizing, that
opportunity when he was Secretary of State for Health. I hope that the
same will happen with trust schools, and in other fields such as
regeneration and crime
reduction.</p><p><a name="06062616000059">My point is
that if the Government want to offer new roles to the sector, it is
vital to do so through a partnership approach from the very beginning
of policy development, and certainly at the design and delivery stages.
Charities might be able to take on such roles in their existing
form&#151;some of the bigger ones certainly can&#151;but in other
cases, it might be a question of working with the sector to create new
types of vehicle, and of being sensitive to those differences.
Ministers need to recognise that this might take time, and officials
need to be encouraged to develop the capacity for partnership working.
Shortcuts do not work: they are damaging to both sides and lead to
tears. Just producing a policy document does not create a relationship.
Capacity has to be built, and relationships have to be worked at.
Policies have to reflect relationships, rather than setting down
requirements.</p><p><a name="06062616000060">This
can be done and it can add value, but it is hard work and the relevant
Government Departments have to work in new ways. Indeed, Ministers and
officials have to be empowered to work in ways that break the mould,
just as happened in the early days of the social exclusion unit, for
example. Such things do happen in government, but for the future, they
have to become the
norm.</p><p><a name="06062616000061">In many ways, I
have already presented the evidence for my third point, on which I
shall be extremely brief. I just want to warn the Government and
Parliament&#151;and certainly the Opposition&#151;that this is
always going to be hard work. Does Whitehall yet speak the language? I
doubt it, and I share the concerns expressed by John Cridland of the
CBI at last week&#146;s conference. Supporting the charitable sector
is not about paying lip service to motherhood and apple pie; rather, it
is about hard work, engagement and dialogue. Indeed, it is more like
the reality of motherhood and the job of baking an apple
pie.</p><p><a name="06062616000062">Most charities
exist because individuals have invested in them an extraordinary amount
of personal time, energy and creativity. Rarely has that happened
because someone planned and costed the job in advance and calculated
that it will work. Mature organisations do become more
calculating&#151;they use business techniques&#151;and hurrah for
that. But most third-sector organisations and certainly most
charities&#151;at national and local level&#151;can trace their
history to somebody who was like a bumble bee. Nobody told the bumble
bee that, technically, it cannot fly, so it does. Charitable endeavour
has always been about saying, &#147;Something must be done&#148;,
and then setting out to achieve the impossible. That is why charity has
to be nurtured, encouraged and believed in and its integrity protected.
That is why the Government have been right to hasten slowly with this
Bill, and to make sure that it is the right legislation for our times
and for many years to come. That is why we must give it a warm welcome
and debate the detail with great care, as well as with
enthusiasm.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 65</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06062616000109">6.13

grateful to be allowed to speak in this debate this afternoon, in view
of Mr. Speaker&#146;s ruling that members of the shadow Cabinet may
not &#147;moonlight&#148;, so to speak, on issues from the Back
Benches. I should explain to the House that I sat on the Joint
Committee of both Houses set up to scrutinise this Bill in draft, and
it is on that basis that I have sought to catch your eye this
afternoon, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p><p><a name="06062616000064">Many Members in all parts of
the House believe that the pre-legislative scrutiny process needs to be
strengthened and used to a far greater extent, and the Joint Committee,
which was chaired so ably by the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr.
Milburn), did a service to the House in terms of the quality of such
scrutiny. I am, of course, referring&#151;as he did&#151;to the
staff of the House who staffed that Committee and to the many experts
who appeared before us, but also to the great expertise of the other
place, which, in contributing to that Committee, underlined the
advantage of the non-elected principle. I hope and believe that our
Committee performed a very useful task, and some of that benefit is on
display in today&#146;s

right hon. Member for Darlington did a really excellent job in chairing
the Joint Committee. He tried to put some minor distance between
himself and the conclusions reached, on the ground that he went off to
another&#151;rather less laudable&#151;job, but he missed only one
meeting and his spirit certainly brooded as we reached our conclusions.
He kept us facing in the right direction, and it is perfectly clear
that he is ideally suited to being the next deputy leader of the Labour
party. He knows that I have some modest experience of leadership
elections&#151;on the losing side, admittedly&#151;but if there is
anything that the Opposition can do to help him, he has only to pick up
the telephone.</p><p><a name="06062616000066">On the
Government&#146;s reaction to our Committee&#146;s work, which is
enshrined in the Bill, I congratulate them on accepting most of our
recommendations. They deserve about seven and a half out of ten for
their efforts today and I hope that, if they listen fair-mindedly to
what has already been said in this debate and in another place, they
will have done even better by the time that we reach Third
Reading.</p><p><a name="06062616000067">Given that
this entire process was set in motion by the Prime Minister&#146;s
own strategy unit and progressed through a Joint Committee of
both Houses, I was surprised to learn that the Government seem
to have ignored a number of that Committee&#146;s recommendations,
particularly bearing it in mind that it was chaired by the right hon.
Member for Darlington&#151;a senior and well-respected former Cabinet
Minister, Blairite and close confidante of No. 10. Perhaps the
Government need to hear again today some of the arguments that they
appear to have rejected.</p><p><a name="06062616000068">The recommendations left out of
the Bill that the Government have yet to see fit to include are
relevant to both the charity sector and the British public, who are so
generous with their support through donations not only of money, but of
time and expertise. One of the most important points that our work on
the Joint 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 66</b><br>Committee reinforced was that Britain does have a charitable sector of
which we should all be really proud. We have heard today from the
Minister that there are more than 160,000 main charities on the Charity
Commission&#146;s register. That figure is growing by almost 2,000 a
year, and that is not the only upward trend. Between 1998 and
2000, for example, employment in the charitable sector grew by
almost 7 per cent., which is a faster rate than in both the
public and private sectors. In 2005, the total annual income was almost
&#163;38 billion&#151;equivalent to more than &#163;600 for every
man, woman and child in the
UK.</p>

<p><a name="06062616000069">However, people in
Britain are as generous with their time as they are with their
hard-earned cash. Home Office figures show that in 2003, more than 20
million people were involved in some kind of volunteering in the
community, half of whom were involved in formal volunteering more
frequently than once a month. Some 3 million volunteers do work for one
or more registered charities, and such work is equal to 1.5 million
whole-time equivalent jobs. It was estimated in 2000 that the value of
unpaid work to charities was more than &#163;15 billion a
year.</p><p><a name="06062616000070">Baroness
Scotland has stated:</p><a name="06062616000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government&#146;s
three aims for the Bill remain. The first is to provide a legal and
regulatory environment that will enable all charities, however they
work, to realise their potential as a force for good in society.
Secondly, we want to encourage a vibrant and diverse sector,
independent of government. Thirdly, we want to sustain high levels of
public confidence in charities through effective
regulation.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 7
June 2005; Vol. 672, c.
783.]</p></ul><a name="06062616000092"><p>Those aims have been
affirmed by the Minister today. However, the Joint Committee had some
serious concerns that have not been addressed. The first was that
smaller charities should not be overburdened with regulation, but
should be encouraged in a climate that promotes philanthropy. Secondly,
the independence of the Charity Commission and the charities sector
should not be compromised. Thirdly, the new definitions of charities
and the removal of the presumption of public benefit should not hit
private schools, hospitals and religious groups the hardest. Last, but
certainly not least, the Committee was concerned about the ludicrous
proposal that excepted charity status should be abolished for armed
services mess and sports non-public funds&#151;a proposal that should
be removed in its entirety from the Bill. It is the rejection of
certain of the Joint Committee&#146;s key recommendations covering
those points that could prevent the Government from achieving all their
stated and laudable
aims.</p><p><a name="06062616000071">I shall
deal first with the independence of the charities sector generally.
Among charities and the general public alike, there is growing disquiet
that in Lord Dahrendorf&#146;s words, the third sector
has</p><a name="06062616000098"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;become a
semi-government sector of public life&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 20 January 2005; Vol. 668, c.
938.]</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000072">In his interesting speech,
the right hon. Member for Darlington spoke of the importance of
partnership between government and the charitable sector, and it is the
importance of getting that balance right that I wish to flag up. There
is a degree of ambivalence&#151;on the one hand, the voluntary and
charitable sector has an enviable record of providing outstanding care,
but on the other, we are talking of a desire to see a thriving, 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 67</b><br>independent charitable sector, which should not be dominated, fettered
and generally taken over by the state. The Cabinet Office paper,
&#147;Private Action, Public Benefit&#148; clearly defined the
Government&#146;s objective as one of ever closer union, aiming
to</p><a name="06062616000099"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;enable the sector to
become a more active partner with Government in shaping policy and
delivery.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000073">That was the
burden of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments. The Charity
Commission, however, has made it quite clear that that approach is not
a panacea. It
warns:</p><a name="06062616000100"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Increased
co-operation increases charities&#146; reliance upon the State for
funding and, in turn, creates a potential risk to charities&#146;
independence.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000074">Such a
loss of independence, the commission says, could lead to bodies
being</p><a name="06062616000101"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;created with a
stated purpose that is charitable, but with an unstated purpose that is
concerned with giving effect to the wishes and policies of a
governmental
authority.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000075">The Charity
Commission
concludes:</p><a name="06062616000102"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It
would be difficult to avoid the conclusion that a body of that kind was
not really a charity at all. Instead of being set up for the stated
charitable purpose, it would exist in fact for the purpose of securing
the benefits of charitable status while carrying out the wishes and
policies of the governmental authority.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000076">In fact, there are already 731
charities that have a local authority as a trustee. More worrying is
the fact that for 595 of them, the local authority is the sole trustee.
In response to that, one of the most important of our unanimous
recommendations was in relation to the independence of the Charity
Commission and the provision that it should exercise its
powers</p><a name="06062616000103"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;on behalf of the
Crown&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000077">an arcane
form of words that means that the Charity Commission would be closely
bound in to the Government, ministerial diktat and departmental
governance. In the light of the Government&#146;s stated objective to
encourage</p><a name="06062616000104"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a vibrant and
diverse sector, independent of government&#148;&#151;[<i> Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 7 June 2005; Vol. 672, c.
783.]&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000078">it is
incomprehensible that the Government have, as yet, failed to remove
what was clause 4(1) of the draft Bill, which proposed that the Charity
Commission would perform its functions</p><a name="06062616000105"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;on behalf of the
Crown.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000079">With that
clause in place, the commission will continue to be, in effect, a
Government Department, albeit a non-ministerial one. That means that it
cannot appear to be fully independent of government. Witnesses before
the Joint Committee warned of the risk of greater political
interference and of prejudice to the commission&#146;s quasi-judicial
functions&#151;I draw the House&#146;s attention to paragraph 177
of the report. The Government&#146;s rejection of our recommendation
does not adequately answer those concerns. As if to add insult to
injury, the Government failed to adopt the Joint Committee&#146;s
recommendation that the Charity Commission be more accountable to
Parliament and its Committees and declined to give statutory force to a
requirement for the commission to report to either House.</p><p><a name="06062616000080">A number of witnesses from whom
the Committee took evidence expressed grave misgivings about the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 68</b><br>effect of such a proposal on the credibility of the Charity Commission.
For example, in its evidence to the Joint Committee on the draft Bill,
the Charity Law Association stated that if the
commission</p><a name="06062616000106"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is a
Government Department, then it is likely to lessen, rather than
increase, public confidence in charities. It will be seen as
susceptible to being used by the Government to further its own
policies.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062616000081">It is
important that the commission be accountable to Parliament rather than
to the Crown. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations went
even further, arguing that it was not enough for the Bill simply to
stipulate that that the commission be answerable to Parliament, but
that it must give at least some outline of how the mechanism of that
accountability should operate in
practice.</p><p><a name="06062616000082">Parliament
would need to enforce regular and detailed monitoring of the finance
well-being and the regulatory effectiveness of the Charity Commission.
Speaking from my experience on the Joint Committee, I hope that the
Home Affairs Committee will take up the recommendation that it hold an
annual evidence session with the Charity Commission. I also hope that
there can be a debate every year, in Government time, on the annual
report of the Charity Commission in both Houses, as the Joint Committee
suggested.</p><p><a name="06062616000083">My next
point is on the introduction of a blanket public benefit test. At
present, if an organisation&#146;s purposes lie within the three
named heads of charitable purpose&#151;the relief of poverty, the
advancement of religion and the advancement of education&#151;it is
presumed to be acting in the public benefit, unless a positive reason
for doubt is presented. In the Bill, it is proposed to change that
presumption, requiring all bodies to show that they are acting in the
public benefit, as defined in law, before they are granted charitable
status. The reversal of the presumption of public benefit will
primarily impact on private schools and hospitals and religious groups,
which previously came under the three headings of the preamble to the
legislation about which the right hon. Member for Darlington spoke so
eloquently, but which now, as the House knows, must prove a public
benefit.</p><p><a name="06062616000084">Although the
Bill does nothing to override existing case law, so it will not change
the definition of public benefit itself&#151;it is inevitable that
the requirement to demonstrate public benefit will make it harder both
to register as a charity and to remain as such. Moreover, the nature of
the legislative requirements will mean that charities will be subjected
to ongoing public benefit checks. Inevitably, it will be the smaller
charities that will bear the brunt of the legislation, which are the
least able to deal with that sort of regulation in terms of both
manpower and expertise.</p><p><a name="06062616000085">Ultimately, everything will
turn on how the Charity Commission operates the public benefit test.
One of the most valuable contributions that the Joint Committee was
able to make, and where it had a positive effect on clarifying the
thinking within the Home Office and the Charity Commission, was in
causing them to produce what I believe we called a concordat on how
that part of the legislation will be operated. However, that is no
guarantee that the change to the public benefit test will not produce
uncertainty and turbulence to educational and medical bodies, whose
activities have long been regarded as for the public benefit.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 69</b><br><p><a name="06062616000086">None the less, I urge the
Government to stick to what has been agreed and what is in the Bill and
to ignore the old Labour class warriors chuntering on the Government
Back Benches and revving up to amend the Bill in that respect. Let us
hope that the new arrangement will work out as most of us believe it
should. In that sentiment, I have no doubt that I have the full support
of the right hon. Member for Darlington.</p><p><a name="06062616000087">Lastly, I wish to join Lord
Craig of Radley in his outrage at the intention to abolish excepted
charity status for armed services mess charities. An excepted charity,
as authorised by a 1965 statutory instrument, has no obligation to
register with the Charity Commission, although it must still meet the
requirements of the Charities Act 1993. The real concern must be that,
in due course, the threshold for registration will be reduced from a
turnover of &#163;100,000, and that more and more small armed forces
charities will be required to register and to come under the closer
regulation of the Charity Commission.</p><p><a name="06062616000088">Excepted charities that choose
not to register with the commission do not have to submit accounts,
prepare and transmit annual reports, or complete annual returns. The
rationale behind this reduced regulation is that accepted charities,
such as the armed services charities, are those that are under the
control of another body acting in a regulatory capacity. There are
about 15,000 armed services funds, which are charities. They are spread
across the three armed forces. Their purposes range from officers and
sergeants&#146; mess accounts to service, sporting and recreational
activities. A defining characteristic of such funds is that they derive
their income not from the public, but exclusively from military
personnel.</p><p><a name="06062616000089">Ministers
have assured the Grand Committee in the other place that those funds
will not lose their charitable status. On Report, a Government
amendment has included in the list of charitable purposes the promotion
of efficiency in the armed forces of the Crown. However, that does not
change the fact that an entirely superfluous bureaucratic burden will
be added. It will be superfluous because the funds are more than
adequately supervised by the Adjutant General. Far more so, I might
add, than by the Charity Commission, which in the past has failed to
satisfy the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office. It
caused the Joint Committee to express doubts as to its ability to meet
the demands of the proposed wider remit. The commission has some way to
go, and I sincerely hope that it will do so compellingly to demonstrate
clearly, in today&#146;s parlance, that it is fit for
purpose.</p><p><a name="06062616000090">The points
that I have raised are minor but extremely important. They could make
the Bill even better if they were included in the measure. I hope that
the Government will reconsider them in the terms in which I have put
them, and consider seriously including them in the Bill in Committee or
on Report.</p><p><a name="06062616000091">I end
where the right hon. Member for Darlington, the Chairman of the Joint
Committee, ended his speech, in saying that the Bill is long overdue.
It will make a tremendous contribution to updating charity law. It will
help to ensure that the brand is protected and enhanced. There are
tremendous opportunities, working with the charitable sector, to
advance the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 70</b><br>objectives that we all hold within society. I hope that the Government
will consider what I have said on these minor points to see whether the
Bill can be made yet
better.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062618000092">6.32

Lepper (Brighton, Pavilion) (Lab/Co-op):</b> First, I place on
record that I am a trustee of a small local charity, Ardis, that is
based in Brighton and Hove. It works on behalf of people with dementia
in that area. I am also a member of the Association of Town Centre
Management. The reason for that declaration might become clear when I
say that I wish to concentrate my remarks on part 3, and particularly
on street collections. Despite the comments of the hon. Member for
Cheltenham (Martin Horwood), I have no hesitation in referring to the
street collectors as chuggers&#151;charity muggers. That is because
of the outrageous activities of some paid street collectors in my
constituency.</p><p><a name="06062618000002">I am
talking of those who are paid on behalf of charities to stop people in
the street and encourage them, on the spur of the moment, to sign up to
regular direct debit payments to extremely worthy charities. I question
whether that is the best way to encourage people to make thoughtful
donations regularly to a charity. Perhaps payroll giving might be a
better form of making donations. Nevertheless, a number of charities
use the street collector
method.</p><p><a name="06062618000003">When the Bill
was in draft form, I think that the Government took the view that the
problems caused by street collections could be dealt with by
self-regulation. I welcome the terms of the Bill generally, as have
others, and as debate on the Bill in draft form and in another place
has continued, I am glad that there are now to be two stages of
regulation in terms of collections. Those stages will not, it seems,
harm in the least local charities that collect by holding the tin and
not shaking it, or from time to time shaking it, but I hope that
regulation will help to curb the
chuggers.</p><p><a name="06062618000004">The two
stages involve the charity obtaining a certificate from the charity
commissioners, followed by a form of local authority licensing. I
gather that the Government&#146;s proposal is to talk with local
government representatives and councils about guidelines for the
licensing system. Alongside that, a self-regulatory code of fundraising
practice will be developed. That is all good, but when it comes to
discussing the guidelines I hope that those involved will bear in mind
the local experience in Brighton city centre, in my constituency. I am
sceptical about the self-regulatory approach on the basis of that local
experience.</p><p><a name="06062618000005">I shall
quote from a letter about chuggers&#151;I could quote from
others&#151;from one of my constituents, which was written in
September 2005. It
reads:</p><a name="06062618000075"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The

money...would be better spent on helping those who the charity is

than on paying the collectors. It continues:</p><a name="06062618000076"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;People should have the
right to go about their business without being insulted for not being
able to afford to give a monthly donation to charity.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 71</b><br><p><a name="06062618000007">That, unfortunately, is not an unusual
experience that I have had reported to me by one of my constituents.
Others have told me of similar
stories.</p><p><a name="06062618000008">Local traders
have contacted me, particularly about the North Laine area of Brighton,
where there are quite narrow streets and many small shops and
businesses. Day after day and week after week, many charity collectors
gather there. They stand close together and they block shop doorways.
It is obvious from what is reported to proprietors that those
collectors are intimidating potential customers. Sometimes they are
offensive to those who ask them to move on.</p><p><a name="06062618000009">All that has happened despite
attempts to negotiate a local code with the help of the Public
Fund-Raisers Regulatory Association. I have raised with that
association issues that have been discussed at meetings of the
all-party group on charities and voluntary organisations, and there
have been failed attempts with the association to sort out a local code

as the standard requirements of the voluntary code of
practice&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06062618000013">That was the
experience after attempts to resolve those issues voluntarily. I spoke
to the chief executive of the Brighton and Hove business forum, Tony
Mernagh only last week to ascertain the position now. He wrote in a
letter of 22
June:</p><a name="06062618000080"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Chuggers
continue to be as much of a problem as they ever were. Our attempts to

half-hearted about asking their members to abide by the voluntary code
and the vast majority do
not.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062618000014">Tony Mernagh
attached an 11-point code, most of which is based on a national
voluntary code with some local amendments, a code which, he told me, is
still, by and large, being
flouted.</p><p><a name="06062618000015">For those
reasons I have no hesitation, despite the comments of the hon. Member
for Cheltenham, in referring to many street collectors as charity
muggers. Far too many chuggers have been operating in my constituency
and I hope that the proposals that are before us will help to regulate
an unacceptable situation. When it comes to Ministers or officials
working with local councils or local council representatives on
guidelines for a licensing system, I hope that local experience will be
considered. From what I read in newspapers, the experience in my
constituency is not perhaps unusual because similar complaints are made
elsewhere. As I have said, I hope that local experience will be taken
into account when drawing up the guidelines to allow local authorities,
in issuing licences, to have genuine powers to control the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 72</b><br>location and the frequency of collections and the numbers of collectors

repeating my earlier recommendation: people should think seriously
about whether a spur-of-the-moment decision in the street to sign up to
a regular donation to a charity is the best way to make such a
donation. Payroll giving is surely a far better
alternative.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062618000093">6.40

certainly been a shaker, and I am concerned that, according to my hon.

said that it is sometimes important to make a small difference. From
the outset, may I say that I support the Bill, and welcome the changes

concerned that people with learning disabilities cannot contribute as
trustees. Like a number of Members on both sides of the House, I offer
my constituents, particularly organised groups, the opportunity to
visit to the House of Commons and, a few weeks ago, I was pleased to
receive a visit from the SHIELDS&#151;supporting, helping, informing
everyone with learning disabilities in Southend&#151;parliament,
which is a group of people with learning disabilities who have been
directly elected as councillors to act as an advocacy group in Southend
and, more widely, to represent the interests of people with learning
disabilities. Last week, it adopted a constitution, but it was
distressing for people who had been elected by their peer group to
discover that they could not make a contribution as trustees. In fact,
they were lumped into a single group with people with general mental
incapacity. While those councillors have serious social problems,
collectively they are a bright bunch and have a huge contribution to
make. It is therefore deeply unfair that they should be thrown together
with people who, under the Charities Act 1993, are convicted of
offences including dishonesty and deception or who have become
bankrupt.</p><p><a name="06062618000019">The SHIELDS

themselves.</p><p><a name="06062618000022">The SHIELDS parliament and its
facilitators have worked closely with the Charity Commission, so it is
unacceptable that they should have had to resort to a rather
cack-handed way round the problem, as mandating trustees to gather
views via elected councillors is hardly the ideal solution. I therefore
urge the Minister to take the opportunity offered in chapter 9 of the
explanatory notes to table Government amendments or accept cross-party
amendments to allow people with learning disabilities who can make a
contribution to become trustees, particularly, but not exclusively, of
charities that work with people with learning disabilities. I accept
that a trustee organisation with a critical mass of people with
learning disabilities is slightly more challenging from a legal
perspective than general groupings, but both groupings are extremely
important.</p><p><a name="06062618000023">Having
made my main point, may I touch on other subjects? I am concerned about
the removal of the presumption of public benefit, as it constitutes an
attack on schools with charitable status. Members have talked about the
direction of travel which, I believe, should encompass foundation
hospitals, greater choice in education, and trust schools, and should
lead us to the conclusion that more schools, not fewer, should have
charitable status. I am concerned, too, about mega-charities that
conduct large-scale operations. One cannot look through the
appointments section of the big papers without finding jobs with
attached salaries that, in some cases, are as large as that of the
Deputy Prime Minister. I am concerned, not about the impact of
professionalisation on charities&#146; output, but about that career
path, which is detached from
reality.</p><p><a name="06062618000024">Unlike the
right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael), who is
no longer in the Chamber, I remain concerned about the involvement of
charities in political and campaigning activities. I do not wish to
mount a general attack on charities, but I am reluctant, or certainly
less willing, to give money to organisations such as Oxfam that do good
work in Africa, where I have worked, and Christian Aid, because they
have been involved in political activities or things that I perceive as
political activities. Guidance would create greater confidence in what
the Minister described as the charities brand.</p><p><a name="06062618000025">I have raised a number of
subjects, but the one on which I should like the Parliamentary
Secretary to dwell is the question of trusteeships for people with
learning disabilities&#151;I would be more than happy to meet him
with a delegation to discuss the issue. The SHIELDS parliament, which
is a very good organisation, believes that it is unique&#151;I
suspect that there are other such organisations, but they have not been
brought together&#151;and it has made a good proposal. With the
Minister&#146;s help in the Bill, perhaps we can improve its
representation.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062628000291">6.47

John Grogan (Selby) (Lab):</b> It is a great pleasure to
follow the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James
Duddridge), who made a measured speech which, while based on local 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 74</b><br>experience, had national implications on which we should all reflect.
The highlight of our debate, however, was the moment when my right hon.
Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), at the end of a long
and thoughtful speech, asked Ministers to satisfy themselves that the
public benefit test, as applied by the Bill, will make a difference. In
my brief and modest remarks, I should like to ask whether Ministers
have satisfied themselves that it will be a rigorous test of public
benefit.</p><p><a name="06062628000013">The hon.
Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) characterised some Labour
Members as old-fashioned class warriors. I do not look at myself that
way: I am a Yorkshireman who does not believe in &#147;summat for
nowt&#148;, and I think that all institutions that benefit from the
public purse should justify themselves. Representing one of the United
Kingdom&#146;s more rural constituencies, I like to think that I have
my ear to the ground of middle England. When organisations such as the
National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Royal National
Institute of the Blind and Age Concern ask for further clarification in
the Bill, I sit up and take notice, and that is what I seek from
Ministers.</p><p><a name="06062628000014">We have a
dream team on the Front Bench. It is a great pity that the Minister for
the Cabinet Office is not in the Chamber, as she gave me a great deal
of good career advice when she was Chief Whip. Her talent for tact and
diplomacy is known throughout the House, as is her closeness to No. 10,
and those qualities will be important in securing the passage of the
Bill. To complement her strengths, we are lucky to have a rising star
in the Parliamentary Secretary, who is close to the Chancellor, speaks
about the renewal of the Labour project and, indeed, social democracy,
and has demonstrated great intellect in his interventions. I hope to
persuade that dream team to just go a little further and ask the
questions that my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington
asked.</p><p><a name="06062628000015">I refer to the
voice of middle England and what the Charity Commission is saying about
the Bill. I attended the same briefing that my right hon. Friend the
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) attended last
week. I noted carefully the words of Andrew Hind, the chief executive
of the regulator. He said that there was a worrying lack of clarity in
the underlying case law. He certainly did not want inflexible wording
in terms of a definition of public benefit on the face of the Bill, but
he said that he would like clarification, possibly on the face of the
Bill, about the application of this
test.</p><p><a name="06062628000016">We have all seen
the press release from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations
and the words of its chief executive, Stuart Etherington. The NCVO says
that, at present, the Bill extends the public benefit test to all
charities on the basis of existing case law. However, it goes on, for
charities that charge high fees for their services, this means that
they will have to show only that the less well off are &#147;not
entirely excluded&#148;. This does not go far enough. Anyone able to
benefit from a charity service must have a reasonable chance of doing
so, says the NCVO. Stuart Etherington is quoted as
saying:</p><a name="06062628000235"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Charities
have long recognised the need to update charity law, and have pressed
for this important legislation. The Charities Bill must protect and
promote the charity &#145;brand&#146;, by making it clear that only
those organisations that benefit the public can be
charities.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 75</b><br><p><a name="06062628000017">We have had a number of
suggestions as to how the application of the public benefit test could
be clarified in the Bill. The example from Scotland was given, and
there are other examples. The noble Lord Phillips in the other place
made a suggestion. I do not think that the fact that Scotland has
passed one law and we may be about to pass another one can be entirely
dismissed. For example, if, to take a completely random example, Fettes
in Scotland was ruled not to be worthy of charitable status in Scotland
under one regime, could it then apply in England under another regime,
and perhaps up ship, and so on? One of the phrases that keeps coming up
in many of these amendments concerns charges not being &#147;unduly
restrictive&#148;. That has some merit and should be considered by
Ministers. After all, the alternative is simply to rely on case law. My
right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington, whom I feel very close to
on this issue, said that he did not think that it was a sufficient
defence for, shall we say, private schools to claim public benefit just
on the ground that they saved money from the public purse. But when one
considers the only major case in this area in the last 40 years, one
can draw precisely that conclusion&#151;that public schools would
have that defence. In 1967 the case of Re:Resch, concerning a private
hospital run by nuns in Australia, was appealed to the Privy Council.
Lord Wilberforce, in giving the judgment upholding the charitable
status of the hospital,
said:</p><a name="06062628000236"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It would
be a wrong conclusion...to state that a trust for the provision of
medical facilities would necessarily fail to be charitable merely
because by reason of expense they could only be made use of by persons
of some means&#148;.</p></ul>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060626/debtext/60626-0649.htm"/>


<p><a name="06062628000018">In other
words, the level of charges did not matter. He goes on to justify that
by saying that the
judgment</p><a name="06062628000237"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;results from
the relief to the beds and the medical staff of the general
hospital&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000019">in
other words, the saving from the public purse. Therefore, I urge
Ministers that, if we are to meet the test set by my right hon. Friend,
that the Bill should make a difference, we need to heed the words of
the Charity Commission and the NCVO, not old-style class warriors, and
look for further clarification in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06062628000020">My right hon. Friend and
the Joint Committee went much further in one of their musings than I
would choose to do and
said:</p><a name="06062628000238"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Nonetheless
we believe that the Government should consider reviewing the charitable
status of independent schools and hospitals with a view to considering
whether the best long term solution might lie in those organisations
ceasing to be charities but receiving favourable tax treatment in
exchange for clear demonstration of quantified public
benefits.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000021">I would not go
that far, but I urge Ministers to look at the question of the
application of the public benefit test.</p><p><a name="06062628000022">Perhaps my right hon. Friend
was reacting to some of the evidence before the Committee. A former
public school headmaster, Dr. Anthony Seldon,
said:</p><a name="06062628000239"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There
are two very different kinds of independent school.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000023">I think that he is right. There are what
he characterised as the small minority: what my right hon. Friend
referred to as up to 50 per cent. of private schools, 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 76</b><br>according to figures from the Independent Schools Council. Dr. Seldon
referred to</p><a name="06062628000240"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the small
minority which are very wealthy which are doing extremely
nicely...and which...I do not think are very innovative. They
look after themselves and they pay lip service to odd charitable
things, but they are a self-perpetuating oligarchy and...they have
great wealth, and I think they should be doing much
more&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000024">That is the voice
of someone with knowledge of the private sector.</p><p><a name="06062628000025">We are talking about
&#163;100 million of public money. We are talking about giving 80 per
cent. relief on uniform business rates; tax relief on bank deposits and
income from investments; the ability to claim back tax paid by
benefactors; and exemption from VAT payments on fees&#151;not
inconsiderable matters. This test should be a rigorous test.</p><p><a name="06062628000026">There are two possible
scenarios. I hope that my neighbour, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary
Secretary, will listen to the debate and the moderate voices of the
NCVO, the Charity Commission and his many friends on the Labour Back
Benches who wish him well in his future career, and consider adding to
the Bill with regard to the application of public benefit. If he does
that, he could create a progressive consensus in the House. Not only
those on the Government Benches, but in this instance at least the
Liberal Democrats may well be part of that progressive consensus, and
we could be faced with a Conservative party which, remarkably today, is
to the right of the Independent Schools Council in that it insists that
the public benefit test should not apply to private schools. That is a
remarkable position. I do not think that the right hon. Member for
Witney (Mr. Cameron) has noticed this, and that position may well
change by Third Reading. Even so, I think that the Conservative
Opposition would oppose such an amendment. Such a progressive consensus
could be created. The alternative is probably for an amendment in line
with the wishes of NCVO and the Charity Commission to be moved, perhaps
from the Government or the Liberal Democrat Benches. Then we would have
the unedifying spectacle of those on the Government Benches being
divided on the issue. If the renewal of the Government was one of my
central concerns, I know which of those two political scenarios I would
be aiming
for.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062628000292">5.7

public benefit.</p><p><a name="06062628000028">I rise
as the chair of the all party group on the community and voluntary
sector, a Home Office-appointed chair of the Community Development
Foundation, and a former trustee of a major national charity, to
welcome the Bill, which has had more than its fair share of scrutiny
over quite a long time, as a number of hon. Members have said. But it
is a little rich to hear protestations from Opposition Members about
the time that the Bill has taken. They will recall that before the 2005
general election, the Bill was one of those that the Opposition was
asked to co-operate with in order to give it a fair wind to complete
its 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 77</b><br>parliamentary stages before that election, on the ground that it was
relatively uncontroversial. They declined, and that was their right as
an Opposition, but that meant that the process had to start again. That
is why it is now some six years since the strategy unit report was
commissioned to consider the relationship with the voluntary sector in
its wider sense. That is why it has taken six years for us to reach
this point. Clearly, we are now approaching the end of the process, and
I am sure that we will come out with a Bill that we will all be pleased
to work with and see
implemented.</p><p><a name="06062628000029">As my
right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) has
said&#151;I think that I have read the same report as him&#151;the
public strongly support the work of the voluntary sector. For example,
88 per cent. of people believe that charities are well managed and
spend their funds wisely, while 84 per cent. of people claim that they
have implicit trust in the activities of the best known
charities.</p><p><a name="06062628000030">The public misunderstand some
aspects of the sector. My right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington
has referred to the statistic that while 97 per cent. of people know
that Oxfam is a charity, only 15 per cent. of people know that
Tate Modern is a charity. The Charity Commission report also states
that 90 per cent. of people say that they have received no assistance
or advice from a charity, although 75 per cent. of them actually have
received assistance or advice. I suspect that that is because people
have received what they regard as professional and sound advice, which
they do not believe could come from a
charity.</p><p><a name="06062628000031"><b><a name="06062628000302">Mr.
John Gummer (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> In discussing the
public perception of charities, does the hon. Gentleman agree that
there will always be some charities which do very good work in
unpopular circumstances? Examples include charities that work with
certain categories of prisoner and small religious groups of which we
may not approve but which contribute in their own way. It is important
to recognise that the charity field covers unpopular areas as well as
popular
areas.</p><p><a name="06062628000032"><b><a name="06062628000303">Tom
Levitt:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right,
which is why it is important that there are organisations such as the
Big Lottery Fund to make objective decisions rather than simply giving
the most money to, for example, the organisation that gets the most
votes on a television programme. There has to be public input, but
equally funds must be distributed rationally and objectively. Those who
are in receipt of services provided by the voluntary sector are
impressed by its work, and it enjoys very high levels of esteem and
confidence.</p><p><a name="06062628000033">I have
one slight reservation about the title of the Bill, because I had hoped
that we could move on from the word &#147;charity&#148; and deal
with issues in terms of the wider sector. I have come across elderly
constituents in High Peak who have told me that they are aware of
pension credit but will not claim it, despite being in poverty, because
&#147;I don&#146;t want charity.&#148; There is still the
Victorian idea of charity being a handout rather than a leg-up, but
charities and voluntary sector organisations enhance people&#146;s
capacity to deal with their own lives and give people a leg-up rather
than a handout.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 78</b><br><p><a name="06062628000034">Communities in which the
voluntary sector is healthy are themselves healthy communities, and we
can judge how healthy and effective a community is by the activities of
the voluntary sector within it. I shall provide three examples of how
different voluntary sector organisations in my constituency have
changed in the past 10 years.</p><p><a name="06062628000035">Ten years ago, I was on the
management committee of my local citizens advice bureau, a modest
organisation in Buxton which delivered advice and which was known for
being well meaning. However, access was limited, and the advice was
made available to those who knew where the CAB was, who knew how to
access it and who could understand the advice when it was given. That
organisation has changed in the past 10 years: it is still a voluntary
organisation and its principal function is still to provide advice
through highly trained volunteers, but it has a professional local
leadership, a professional way of working, two fully equipped offices
and a sub-office and a contract with the Legal Services Commission to
deliver legal aid. It is a much bigger organisation than it was, and
many of the volunteers have developed specialist areas in which they
advise their
clients.</p><p><a name="06062628000036">The
information and advice provided by Citizens Advice can be accessed by
us all through its excellent website, so one does not have to go to an
office. It has done something tremendous in my constituency: in
partnership with the PCT, it provides a volunteer adviser once a week
in every GP surgery in the rural area in my constituency, which has led
to some &#163;2 million in previously unclaimed benefits
going into people&#146;s pockets in the past two years. Those
people are getting their entitlement because a voluntary
organisation dedicated to the public benefit has delivered, which is
why I was upset when the Conservative and Liberal High Peak borough
council decided to freeze its funding for the CAB this year. It took
people like me&#151;I swam 100 lengths of Buxton swimming pool to
raise &#163;1,700&#151;to make sure that my local CAB was not in
deficit this year.</p><p><a name="06062628000037">My
second example concerns the council for voluntary service in High Peak,
which did not exist 10 years ago&#151;my constituency
comprises 650 sq m of territory where 75,000 adults live, but there was
no co-ordinating body for the voluntary sector. Nowadays, the council
for voluntary service is a professionally led organisation which is the
main source of advice for voluntary organisations. It provides physical
resources, such as office facilities and meeting facilities, and access
to funding, and it is an incredible source of training for people who
are setting up their own voluntary sector organisations and charities
or working in their communities. Through the council for voluntary
service, the voluntary sector is well represented on the local
strategic partnership between local authorities and other service
providers in my area. The council for voluntary service provides an
invaluable service, and it has the respect of other public services
with which it works to provide rounded, comprehensive, holistic and
personally focused services. It is a wonderful example of the sector
flourishing and helping people by delivering a public benefit, and I
wish that more local strategic partnerships around the country treated
the voluntary sector with the importance that it receives in
my constituency.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 79</b><br><p><a name="06062628000038">My third example of a local
organisation concerns the Nepal Children&#146;s Trust. My
constituency does not stretch as far as Nepal, but before I visited
that country a few weeks ago, I was contacted by the trust, which began
with four ladies in the New Mills area in my constituency. One of those
ladies went on holiday to Nepal, where she saw the problems that
children were having in one of the world&#146;s poorest countries and
decided to do something about it. She has built up a network of a few
dozen people around the country who not only engage in fundraising, but
go over to Nepal to make sure that schools are built, that the children
of prisoners get the support that they need and that children&#146;s
human rights are upheld. The trust is doing excellent work, and it is a
lovely example of how a group of people with a conscience and a sense
of purpose can set up their own charitable organisation and make a
difference.</p><p><a name="06062628000039">All those
organisations will welcome the Bill&#151;for example, if the
children&#146;s trust is one of the smaller organisations, it will no
longer be required to register. The organisations that I have mentioned
are a long way from the traditional image of charities, which was, if
hon. Ladies will forgive me, of members of the blue rinse brigade with
their collecting boxes. In the past, too many of those people saw
volunteering as an end in itself. Volunteering is a vital part of the
way in which a community operates, but it is not an end in
itself&#151;there must be a purpose. One organisation&#151;I could
name it but I will not&#151;was asked to deliver a different service
that was better for its recipients, but withdrew from it because the
volunteers did not like
change.</p><p><a name="06062628000040">We can see the
same changes happening on a national level. For example, Leonard
Cheshire now delivers most of its services on contract to local
authorities. Its residential homes are no longer the independent
organisations that they were. It is providing an essential part of
delivering care but at the same time ensuring that its users are much
more closely involved in the delivery of services, and the shape and
nature of those services. It has become a membership organisation in
order to become more accountable. The Royal National Institute for Deaf
People has also taken that step. More than one Member has mentioned its
tremendous pioneering work&#151;at a time when I was one of its
trustees, although I take no credit for it&#151;in joining up as
partners with the Department of Health and delivering a &#163;100
million programme to bring in digital hearing aids on the NHS for the
first time. It was able to do that because of its professional approach
and because of the economies of scale involved. It was able to use its
power and size to get the best possible financial deal on the purchase
of those hearing aids, which, as my right hon. Friend the Member for
Darlington said, have made a real difference to the lives of millions
of people.</p><p><a name="06062628000041">Another
national example is that of last year&#146;s Make Poverty History
operation, which involved the coming together of a huge coalition of
groups, some of which have their priorities in far-distant countries
and work according to their consciences on behalf of people around the
world who are worse off than ourselves. Many groups have taken on that
initiative and made it into a practical commitment. Two towns
in my 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 80</b><br>constituency are on the verge of acquiring Fair Trade status. They have
achieved that because over the past few years voluntary organisations
have grown up and worked with local authorities, caterers and all sorts
of other organisations to build a coalition of voluntary sector,
private sector and public sector interests that are backing the Fair
Trade cause. The initiative was created by the voluntary sector in a
way that will produce long-term benefit for us all.</p><p><a name="06062628000042">I was fascinated to read in
today&#146;s newspapers about the largest ever donation to charity. A
75-year-old American gentleman by the name of Warren Buffett has just

Horwood:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for sharing with us
the breadth of his expertise in the voluntary sector. He is right to
draw attention to the principle that Warren Buffett has so generously
espoused. Does he agree that it might even apply to much smaller
charities, which are often registered by the Charity Commission but
which might in some circumstances be better off as fundraisers for
larger and better established charities, as they have fewer overheads
and administrative
burdens?</p><p><a name="06062628000047"><b><a name="06062628000305">Tom
Levitt:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I am sure
that for some small charities that is the right way to go, although I
would not include the Nepal Children&#146;s Trust, which was
delivering on a very specific aim. However, this debate is not about
telling the voluntary sector what to do but about giving it its head
and finding out what works. They may well coalesce, by a process of
organic growth, into being fundraisers for larger bodies as the most
practical way of achieving what they set out to do, but that is for
them to discover for
themselves.</p><p><a name="06062628000048">There was
a time when we could talk about the public sector, the private sector
and the voluntary sector as three points of a triangle, but today they
are three points on a circle, with every sort of organisation in
between. In any ward in the constituency of any hon. Member here
tonight, we will probably see a plethora of voluntary sector
organisations. In one of my local wards, an active residents&#146;
association elects representatives to the arm&#146;s length
management organisation that looks after their social housing.
We would also find housing associations, the neighbourhood watch,
various sports groups, older people&#146;s groups, local history

volunteer of the year awards, here in the House.</p><p><a name="06062628000049">The University of the Third Age
is a huge organisation in my constituency. We also have the furniture
project. This weekend, I asked the people at that organisation whether
it was still a charity&#151;a voluntary organisation&#151;or had
become a social enterprise. It collects second-hand furniture and
trains people to repair and build furniture and to recycle furnishing
materials. It is an accredited training organisation and a
not-for-profit company, and in just a few years it has earned the title
of a social enterprise. We will find community transport and volunteer
car schemes, branches of large organisations such as Amnesty
International and Friends of the Earth, and groups such as the one that
I spoke to this morning&#151;the local domestic abuse reduction
partnership. All those organisations are dedicated to the public
benefit of improving the communities in which they work.</p><p><a name="06062628000050">That is not to mention the
trade unions, which represent public benefit in the workplace, and
political parties. If those of us in political parties are not here in
order to promote the public benefit, then what are we here for?
Although it is not a matter for this debate, I hope that we will
seriously consider the possibility of casting political parties in the
same mould as voluntary sector organisations and charities as regards
their treatment for tax purposes. That would be one way of stimulating
a healthy
democracy.</p><p><a name="06062628000051">The issue
that took up much of the time in the Lords, as it has today, is that of
public benefit. I am pleased that the Bill tightens the definition of
public benefit, not least by abolishing the presumption that certain
organisations automatically qualify for charitable status because they
are involved in education, for example. Nevertheless, it is important
that we allow for the necessary flexibility and do not tie ourselves
down by agreeing on a definition that tries to anticipate all future
examples of where public benefit may or may not be
demonstrated.</p><p><a name="06062628000052">Many
charitable organisations have commercial arms. An educational charity
should not be banned from having a commercial arm attached to it, as
long as the public benefit can be demonstrated by the charitable part
of the organisation. I feel the same as some of my Back-Bench
colleagues about the ethos of independent and fee-paying private
education. I believe that the best way of ensuring that we have no need
for it is to make the state sector so good that people will not want to
pay. However, it is a fact of life that such schools and institutions
exist. Some of them are special schools providing services that are not
provided in the state sector. Those organisations should not have their
credibility drawn into question when the public are paying those fees
through sending children to use their
facilities.</p><p><a name="06062628000053">As I
mentioned in an earlier intervention, we are now seeing a growing
tendency of independent schools to make their facilities&#151;their
drama halls, sports equipment, field study facilities&#151;and their
time, in the sense of sixth-form preparation, pre-university courses
and so forth, available to state sector schools that have not been
fortunate enough to provide the same facilities. I believe that those
are good partnerships. 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 82</b><br>Schools in the state sector do not receive any benefit from some
teachers who were trained in that sector, so let us build a
relationship with those teachers, even though they are working in the
independent sector. If facilities benefit only some children, let us
make them available to all children by developing partnerships with
independent schools. I do not believe that a provision to deprive
independent schools of only 4.5 per cent. of their total
income will be for the wider public benefit when we can already see the
tendency for more of their facilities being made available to more
children&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I note that my hon. Friend the
Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) is itching to
intervene.</p><p><a name="06062628000054"><b><a name="06062628000306">Mr.
Grogan:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, but does he
accept that an amendment to deal with unduly restrictive charges would
not require the removal of charitable status from all public schools,
but only that they justify such status? Any schools carrying out the
magnificent things that my hon. Friend describes would clearly pass the
test, but why should those refusing to share any facilities or to offer
any bursaries necessarily be given charitable
status?</p><p><a name="06062628000055"><b><a name="06062628000307">Tom
Levitt:</b> I am confident that the latter sort of school that
my hon. Friend describes would not be able to demonstrate any public
benefit, so it would not be entitled to charitable status, but I hope
that the Bill will encourage schools to go down the former route and
make their facilities and bursaries available.</p><p><a name="06062628000056">I should like to put a few
questions to Ministers on the issue of fundraising and its regulation.
It is claimed that the Bill will reduce the burden of legislation and
bureaucracy on local authorities, but it seems to me that it does so
partly by increasing the burden on the Charity Commission through the
issuing and administration of public collection certificates, which
have to be renewed every five years&#151;a task currently carried out
by local authorities. Of course it makes sense for a national
organisation to have a national public collection certificate, once it
has been granted, but the question remains whether the Charity
Commission has the capacity to deal with it and, secondly, whether it
is really removes all the burdens from local authorities. The question
of when a street collection takes place would have to be administered
by the local authority, as, presumably, would enforcement of the
regulations pertaining to public collection certificates. Co-ordination
remains the local authority role and the issuing of permits for street
collections could be just as burdensome on local authorities as it is
now.</p><p><a name="06062628000057">I was initially
concerned that the legislation did not establish the imperative need
for those involved in door-to-door collections to carry appropriate
identity cards, but I now believe that it does. It is very important to
reassure people on the doorstep that the person they are talking to is
who they say they are and working on behalf of the organisation for
which they are collecting. Members do not need me to explain that any
further.</p><p><a name="06062628000058">The need for
ID cards is established in clause 63, but who ensures that the people
have the correct identity cards, adopting the correct style and
containing the correct information? Who ensures that the identity is 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 83</b><br>somehow authenticated? I cannot believe that it is a job for the Charity
Commission to ensure that every identity card is produced in the
correct way, so I presume that it remains an inspection role for the
local authority to carry out. In view of such concerns about
door-to-door collections, safety and the possibilities for crime or
abuse, it is important for us to seek some reassurances in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06062628000059">To
conclude, every Member has his or her own knowledge of the value of the
charitable and voluntary sector in their constituencies. They know that
the sector can see what is wrong with service delivery and feed back on
it. The sector is capable of some smashing examples of innovation and
it can be less bureaucratic than the public sector, while certainly
personalising services more effectively. In many ways, it can provide a
better quality of service, if that is what is needed. We look to the
sector to be a voice&#151;not necessarily the only voice, but a
voice&#151;of public service users. We look to the sector to be a
partner&#151;not a junior partner, but an equal partner&#151;in
delivering those services and we see it as a viable and respected
sector in its own right.</p><p><a name="06062628000060">As a Government, we need to
build real partnerships with the charitable and voluntary sector. We
need to strengthen the compact and commit ourselves, for example, to
longer-term funding streams and full-cost recovery in all dealings with
the sector. The Bill provides the framework to liberate the sector, to
elevate it and to empower it. It deserves our support and I am sure
that it will receive
it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062628000293">7.26
pm</h5><p><a name="06062628000061"><b><a name="06062628000308">Ms
Celia Barlow (Hove) (Lab):</b> A charity is an organisation
that serves the public good and an institution that benefits people.
Apart from the very necessary legal and regulatory questions, we should
ask ourselves today how we can ensure that our charities can best
function in the interest of those people. That is what I would like to
speak about
today.</p><p><a name="06062628000062">Charities can
serve many purposes, and one of this admirable Bill&#146;s main
accomplishments is that clause 2 gives a clear statutory definition of
charitable causes, thereby updating the law. One purpose can be, as
mentioned in subsection (2), providing relief to the elderly and saving
lives. I would like to refer to one recent example from my Hove
constituency of the closure of a care home that was owned by a
charitable trust. It provides a telling example of a local charity not
acting in the interests of its immediate beneficiaries and we will see
how the problem could be rectified by the Bill and what questions still
remain.</p><p><a name="06062628000063">Before I come
to that, however, I would like to say that I welcome the Bill, as many
Members have today. It was a Labour Party manifesto commitment at the
last general election to provide a new, modern framework for the
voluntary sector in order to promote charities and give them better
legal guidance. The present regulations for charities are indeed
outdated. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr.
Milburn) pointed out, our courts still have to rely on the Charitable
Uses Act 1601, passed under the first Queen Elizabeth, to determine
what a charitable purpose is.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 84</b><br><p><a name="06062628000064">It is also a great step forward
that we now get a clear definition that a charity has to work for the
public benefit, rather than relying on the old circular reasoning that
an organisation pursuing charitable purposes must be a charity. The new
public benefit test will remind all charities that they need to
demonstrate their usefulness to the public on a constant basis.
However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) said
recently, we need to decide on a rigorous definition of public
interest.</p><p><a name="06062628000065">In the light
of recent experience in my constituency since the beginning of the
year, I would like to highlight the reform of the Charity
Commission&#146;s powers. It is the first major shake-up since 1960,
and I hope that it will take effect as soon as possible. Indeed, for
some of my constituents, reform is already coming too
late.</p><p><a name="06062628000066">Mr. Deputy
Speaker, you may have read in the papers about the case of Dresden
house, a care home for elderly gentlewomen in Hove. For many years,
Dresden house was a very happy place for pensioners in Hove, a place
where many members of my local communities wanted peacefully to spend
their final years. It has been run as a charitable trust since 1910 and
was highly praised in official reports. It was therefore a great shock
to all the residents when, in January, the trustees suddenly announced
that the home was to close and all residents were to move out in three
months. Citing economic unsustainability as the reason for
closure, the announcement left only 12 weeks for the elderly
gentlewomen to find suitable alternative accommodation.</p><p><a name="06062628000067">Not only was the building
destined to be closed but the many friendships built up over months and
years by the residents in the community of Dresden house were about to
be brought to an end. The trustees&#146; decision was perceived by
many residents and their relatives to be unnecessary as Dresden house
continued to provide a high standard of care, with new residents being
admitted to the premises as late as December 2005.</p><p><a name="06062628000068">Deeming the closure to be
unnecessary, the residents&#146; group contacted the Charity
Commission for guidance, trying to find some facts about the decision
to close. The group was headed by Nick Steadman, nephew of Dresden
house resident Alice Pink, a 93-year-old gentlewoman who had previously
worked as a nurse. I was introduced to Alice in January and came to
admire greatly her resolve and strength of purpose. She had moved into
Dresden house only in August 2005 and was looking forward to many
happy, relaxing years in beautiful surroundings.</p><p><a name="06062628000069">The residents&#146; group and
my office wrote many letters to the Charity Commission. I talked to
both the commission and the trustees. However, the Charity Commission
replied that, under its current rules, it was unable to help in the
matter. Despite my intervention, the trustees were unwilling to provide
their residents with a clear reason for closure other than general
financial circumstances, which could not be independently verified
because the trustees were unwilling to disclose their accounts before
the end of the financial year and there were no regulations to ensure
that they did so. The financial year would expire after the last
resident was required to leave the home.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060626/debtext/60626-0650.htm"/>


<p><a name="06062628000070">The residents&#146; group
offered themselves as trustees to oversee Dresden house, should the
current trustees no 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 85</b><br>longer wish to handle the responsibility of running such an institution.
The trustees declined the offer. The Charity Commission had no powers
to insist on its acceptance.</p><p><a name="06062628000071">Despite widespread support and
sympathy, the trustees&#146; decision to close could not be
challenged under the existing definition of public benefit. At the
beginning of March, the elderly residents of Dresden house had the
trauma of moving to new premises. Alice Pink was the last resident to
leave at the end of March. Failed by the institutions, she appeared to
lose her energy and will to live after having to move elsewhere. Two
months after leaving, she was found with a note by her bed, which read
simply &#147;I can&#146;t go on.&#148; She had taken an overdose
of painkillers. One week later, she was dead. Another resident,
84-year-old Edna Henshall, died having suffered a stroke on the day she
was due to move out. It is in their memory that I speak today. Dresden
house now stands
empty.</p><p><a name="06062628000072">The
residents&#146; group identified several points on which they felt
that the system failed them. They felt let down by the Charity
Commission&#146;s inability to direct trustees to comply on
consultation and disclosure of financial papers. The new powers for the
Charity Commission in chapters 1 and 5 to direct and advise charities
proactively are therefore much needed, and the commission must use them
effectively. The residents&#146; representatives also complained
about the Charity Commission&#146;s difficulties in influencing the
composition of the board of trustees. The Bill will give the commission
more powers to
intervene.</p><p><a name="06062628000073">May I take
the opportunity to throw my weight behind the request of the hon.
Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge), who is no
longer in his place, to provide that people with learning disabilities
can become trustees of charities of their
choice?</p><p><a name="06062628000074">Chapter 2
deals with the creation of a charity tribunal and also constitutes a
clear improvement in the law. As things stand, if a care home is
council run, residents can bring a case under the Human Right Act 1998
with a reasonable chance of success. In the case of Dresden house,
users and their representatives have had no effective redress, since
the commission essentially has the final say. In my local case, the
people affected felt severely let down by the absence of a strong
authority to handle appeals about Charity Commission
decisions.</p><p><a name="06062628000075">The new
tribunal will give people the certainty that there is indeed an
institution they can approach as a last resort. According to schedule
4, affected individuals will get a right of appeal. The relatives of
the unfortunate former residents of Dresden house humbly request that
the tribunal be given the ability to accept any disputed case for
review, without exception.
</p><p><a name="06062628000076">Charities are
man-made institutions for the benefit of the people. In the other
place, there has been some debate about whether the commission should
have reasonable regard to the well-founded interests of the
beneficiaries of the charity. Material assets are, of course, important
but we should focus on the people involved&#151;our most senior
citizens in the case that I have outlined. The issue was debated on
several occasions in the House of Lords. My noble Friend the Home
Office Minister Baroness Scotland assured the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 86</b><br>Lords that, although the focus on people was not expressed in the text
of the Bill, it was implied. On 28 June 2005, she
said:</p><a name="06062628000244"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There
is no doubt that the commission should take into account the interests
of those affected by its actions. Two of the principles of best
regulatory practice on the face of the Bill are that regulatory action
should be &#145;accountable&#146; and &#145;transparent&#146;,
and these will involve the commission having regard to the interests of
stakeholders.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of
Lords, </i>28 June 2005; Vol. 673, c.
193.]</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000077">I am willing to
believe that that is the case but I press my right hon. Friend the
Minister and my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to assure me
that the interests of stakeholders will play a more central role in the
commission&#146;s work. Will they ensure that, in its guidelines,
there will be a clear undertaking to listen to the people who depend on
charities?</p><p><a name="06062628000078">I do not
claim that further cases such as Dresden house can be easily avoided by
the Bill. However, I am sure that the clear guidelines that it provides
will make it easier for the people affected to make their voices heard.
I hope that the Government will ensure that the Bill stipulates that
the Charity Commission and the charity tribunal will be the champions
of the people who rely on them. We owe that to the many vulnerable
people who depend on charities. We owe it to the elderly gentlewomen,
formerly of Dresden house. It is in their honour and spirit that I
support the
Bill.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062628000294">7.37

Mark Todd (South Derbyshire) (Lab):</b> I am glad to have
caught your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p><p><a name="06062628000080">I noted in the early part of
the debate the increased willingness shared by all parties to consider
the transfer back to the voluntary sector of public services offered
for the public good. I have long been a supporter of that since my time
as leader of a city council in which we actively supported the
voluntary sector through providing a variety of financial and common
services, such as accountancy services&#151;many voluntary
organisations of all kinds greatly appreciated that. I therefore need
no persuasion of the merits of that course of action.</p><p><a name="06062628000081">If one steps back 150 years or
so, many services that we now take for granted were provided by
voluntary&#151;either charitable or mutual&#151;means. There
remains much to commend locally based mutual or other voluntary
structures providing those services. It helps to create stronger
mechanisms of community involvement in the services that people
enjoy.</p><p><a name="06062628000082">Examples
remain. Many hon. Members will have been lobbied about, for example,
transferring air ambulance services to the public sector. I have
surprised many of my constituents by saying that that may be an
inappropriate approach. It is preferable to give better support to the
existing, robust voluntary organisation, which provides the service.
Simply adding it to the national health service is the wrong answer to
the specific problems that the service may encounter.</p><p><a name="06062628000083">Let us consider the lifeboat
service. Few would describe that as anything other than a vital service
that is offered to part of our community. Yet no one would suggest that
the state should provide it directly. We acknowledge that charitable
and voluntary organisations can often provide major public services,
not only smaller, locally based ones.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 87</b><br><p><a name="06062628000084">Recent years have seen the
modernisation of mutual and co-operative law, in which I played a small
part. I see this Bill as a further step towards providing a modern
framework. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth (Alun Michael) set out clearly the importance of choice in
providing models of control and direction for social entrepreneurs.
That is exactly what we should do. There are models that work in
particular circumstances, and we should not be prescriptive. We should,
however, have a modern set of laws that allow people to proceed with
certainty. If we are to facilitate the increased use of mutual and
charitable organisations to provide public services, however, we need
not only to provide the certainty of law but to address how to regulate
them. I listened carefully to those parts of the debate that dealt with
the merits of a lighter touch, to which I will refer when I discuss a
particular local example.</p><p><a name="06062628000085">Two aspects of the Bill are
especially welcome. First, the emphasis on public benefit is absolutely
right. I commend the Government&#146;s approach in that regard, and I
am not that tempted to take a more prescriptive route. I may have the
honour to serve on the Committee, and if I do, I shall listen carefully
to the arguments for a more prescriptive approach. I will need some
persuading, however, that a looser framework in which experience can be
brought to bear might not be better. Secondly, the greater freedom to
trade that charities will have is welcome and absolutely essential in
the modern day.</p><p><a name="06062628000086">If we
are to encourage the use of such models, however, we need to consider
how their functions are to be regulated. The tools to be used must be
proportionate to the purpose in which we are engaged. Normally, small
charities would carry little risk. However, my experience indicates
that a deliberately light touch can attract those wishing to pursue
their own interests with minimal observation, to the extent of having
no proper means of compelling even such basic methods of accountability
as filing accounts and holding appropriate governance meetings. I shall
return to that later.</p><p><a name="06062628000087">Running a small charity can
also be a frustrating activity, and it is only human nature for some to
feel inadequately rewarded for their efforts and to feel that perhaps
there are other routes to enhance their circumstances in recognition of
their efforts. Events in my constituency&#151;I am sad to hear that I
am far from the only Member to criticise the commission in this
regard&#151;suggest that the commission has only modest tools and
rather less will to address those sorts of instincts. That has led me
to suggest alternative models of control to those who are interested in
establishing voluntary groups in my area. I am afraid that, because of
my experience, I have not suggested that people use charitable vehicles
for their purposes. Because of what I have seen, I prefer other, better
regulated bodies to be used. That also led me to oppose vehemently
leaving to the Charity Commission the regulation of trusts that might
run individual or groups of state schools. I felt that that was a
wholly inadequate approach to the regulation of trusts, and I was
relieved that the Government conceded at the last minute that Ofsted
would have a function of inspecting trusts as well as the schools for
which they were responsible.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 88</b><br><p><a name="06062628000088">I urge that further thought be
given to how to identify risk of malpractice, even in relatively small
charities. One approach that I commend is to insist on at least the
basic provision&#151;I do not demand audited accounts&#151;of
accounts of some kind. Another is to insist on all active charities
holding appropriate governance meetings&#151;which do not have to be
frequent, but should at least be annual&#151;to determine their
continued activity and their officers. I shall press those and other
arguments in the Committee if I have the honour to serve on

charitable of me&#151;on behalf of the shadow Department for
Constitutional Affairs team. The tenor and tone of this debate, which
is on a hugely important subject, has been constructive and good
natured.</p><p><a name="06062628000090">We all agree
that the Government are moving in the right direction, but the
Opposition have the job of probing, pressing and improving law as it
passes through the House. First and foremost, I commend the Government
on moving slowly&#151;not always by design, as the general election
intervened&#151;and on taking their time to consult and to try to get
right a major reform of a law that, as several Members have said, has
been in place since 1601, before the Act of Union. As we know, we had
the draft Bill, which was subject to pre-legislative scrutiny&#151;we
heard a powerful contribution from the Chairman of the Joint Committee,
to which I will return in a moment&#151;and which completed most or
all of its stages before falling at the general election. We then had
the amended Bill, which was introduced and passed all its stages in
another place. The Government are to be congratulated on listening at
every stage and on improving the proposed legislation. Much progress
has been made, and we look forward to more progress during the
remaining weeks of the Bill&#146;s passage.</p><p><a name="06062628000091">The job is not yet done,
however, as a number of serious concerns remain. It is worth alerting
the House to the fact that though there is a wide consensus on the
issue, this is not a Bill, if ever there were one, that we should nod
through with our eyes half-closed. It is much too serious and important
for that. There are a number of pitfalls that need to be avoided. The
new Charity Commission will be a powerful institution that can set
guidelines to determine which charities that currently enjoy the
assumption of public interest will do so in future. We must remain
alert to those hugely important new powers as the Bill moves through
every remaining stage of its passage through the House.</p><p><a name="06062628000092">This is also an opportunity to
place on the record the tremendous good that many charities do. As we
know, and as many Members have recognised in the debate, society is not
just about the state and the individual. There is a huge voluntary,
charitable and faith sector in between, which exists to do good, fill
the gap and stand in the breach. That is one subject on which all
Members of Parliament are experts, as we have examples in our
constituencies of unsung heroes&#151;our favourite charities and
organisations&#151;who rush around serving other people. Even
tonight, as we debate this Bill, countless thousands of people in this 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 89</b><br>great country are going out and about serving other people simply
because they want to make their lives better. Let us just imagine the
gaping hole that there would be in our country if that activity did not
happen. Those heroes deserve a legal and regulatory framework that
lifts them up, imposes the minimum of regulation, provides the maximum
clarity and regulates with a light touch. That will be one of our
concerns as the Bill passes through the
House.</p><p><a name="06062628000093">First and foremost, I

job?</p><p><a name="06062628000095"><b><a name="06062628000312">Mr.
Streeter:</b> Being a lawyer was a proper job, was it not?
What did the hon. Gentleman do?</p><p><a name="06062628000096">I used to advise start-up
businesses and charities on organisation as a company limited by
shares, guarantee, trust and so on. Would it not be great to have one
simple, cohesive and straightforward organisational structure that most
new charities will adopt? That is a sensible suggestion, and I hope
that it becomes fashionable and popular. I hope that investment and
effort will be put into producing off-the-shelf templates, which small
organisations can pick up to organise their businesses with little
delay or cost.</p><p><a name="06062628000097">We
heard some excellent speeches today. The Minister for the Cabinet
Office introduced the Bill in a measured way, as befits legislation of
this kind that has wide support. She gave a number of reassurances
about how the public benefit test might apply to organisations already
benefiting from the assumption of public interest. We must wait to see
whether they pan out, but it was reassuring to hear of her
belief&#151;I paraphrase&#151;that all, or almost all, independent
schools, hospitals and religious organisations ought to pass the public
benefit test. I invite the Minister to intervene if she wishes to
clarify that.</p><p><a name="06062628000098">The
Minister also said that each case would be considered and judged on its
merits. I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary, when he
winds up the debate, how that process will work. We have talked about
190,000 charities. What is the time scale for a case-by-case
assessment? It seems to me that it would be a huge
job.</p><p><a name="06062628000099">My hon. Friend
the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) made a typically powerful
speech. As is his shadow ministerial responsibility, he drew attention
to some of the pitfalls that will have to be considered carefully in
Committee. He spoke of the difficulties and costs that will be incurred
by many existing charities on which will fall the onus of proof that
they benefit the public. That process must be clarified. My hon. Friend
called for a light touch in regulation, and for accountability. We do
not oppose the public benefit test, but as Members in all parts of the
House have said today, it represents a controversial and significant
change. We are right to probe the Government to confirm that they have
thought through the new system, and that it will be introduced with a
measure of insight and wisdom.</p><p><a name="06062628000100">The right
hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)&#151;who has not yet
returned from what I am sure has been an enjoyable
evening&#151;chaired the Joint Committee, and 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 90</b><br>the whole House owes him a debt of gratitude for the way in which he did
so. He treated us to his experience of these matters. It might be said
that he rolled out his progressive credentials at the same time,
possibly with half an eye on the future, but we shall see what happens
in that regard. He spoke of an opportunity for the charitable sector to
offer high quality services and to embark on a real partnership with
the private and public sectors. That is exactly what the Conservatives
want.</p><p><a name="06062628000101">The hon. Member
for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood), speaking for the Liberal Democrats,
supported the Bill and brought to bear some specialist knowledge from
his background, which informed and assisted debate. I think that he
slightly misunderstood what my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight
had said, but we were treated to the good news that the Liberal
Democrats had unveiled a new policy tonight&#151;a policy of
consistency. That is warmly welcomed by the whole House. The hon.
Gentleman made important points about the need for clarity, especially
in the Bill&#146;s definitions and the Charity Commission&#146;s
guidelines. That was an important reminder, to which I shall
return.</p><p><a name="06062628000102">The right
hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) also has
great experience in this field. He spoke of the vibrant and important
partnership between the Government and the voluntary and charitable
sector. In giving the Bill a warm welcome, he recognised that removing
the assumption of public benefit was a courageous step&#151;taking
our minds back, perhaps, to the great &#147;Yes, Minister&#148;
programmes&#151;but he said that it was the right thing to do, thus
nailing his colours to the Government&#146;s mast. He called for
clarity on the public benefit test&#151;I think that the whole House
wants the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with that important
point&#151;and said that the Charity Commission should listen to
Parliament. That is crucial&#151;Parliament has expressed itself very
firmly, and we want the commission to listen to us. I am one of those
who have said, on the basis of our experience in our constituencies and
our former lives in the real world, that the commission has not always
impressed people by the degree to which it listens and proceeds
flexibly, without bureaucracy. We look for better performance in the
future. The right hon. Gentleman advised his Front Bench not to be too
prescriptive in its definitions, and spoke of the changing and diverse
nature of today&#146;s voluntary and charitable sector.</p><p><a name="06062628000103">My hon. Friend the Member for
Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) spoke with great authority, having
served on the Joint Committee. He gave the Government 7.5 out of
10&#151;which was pretty charitable, for him&#151;for listening to
the Committee and incorporating some of its recommendations, to which I
have already referred. The right hon. Member for Darlington has just
returned. I know that he has been engaged in important business. As I
was saying, my hon. Friend gave the Government 7.5 out of 10, but he
hoped for a higher score as we approach Third Reading. He was
particularly concerned about certain recommendations that were missing
from the Bill in its current form&#151;for instance, those stating
that regulation should involve a light touch, that the independence of
the charitable sector should not be compromised, that schools,
hospitals and religious 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 91</b><br>bodies should not bear the brunt of the removal of the assumption of
public benefit, and about the recommendation relating to the removal of
excepted status from armed services&#146; mess charities. He urged
the Government to ensure that those recommendations were incorporated
during the Bill&#146;s passage.</p><p><a name="06062628000104">The hon. Member for Brighton,
Pavilion (David Lepper) brought to bear his experience of town centre
management in his thoughtful speech about charitable
collectors&#151;I did not know that they are often described as
&#147;chuggers&#148;&#151;and the undesirable and offputting
nature of some of their activity. He expressed scepticism about
self-regulation in that context. Given his experience, the House should
take account of what he said, and we should give more thought to the
matter in Committee.</p><p><a name="06062628000105">My hon. Friend the Member for
Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge) expressed grave concern
about access for people with learning disabilities to trusteeships of
local organisations. The Parliamentary Secretary may be able to say
something about that. My hon. Friend made his point powerfully and
forcefully. He also expressed concern about large charities spending
too much on salaries and political campaigning, and said that more
guidance for some would make the public more
confident.</p><p><a name="06062628000106">The hon.
Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) made one of his typically concise
speeches. Indeed, it was so concise that I missed it when I nipped out
briefly, but I know that he described his Front Bench as a dream team,
which is an interesting concept. He
also&#151;importantly&#151;called for the public benefit test to be
tightened, an issue to which we will no doubt return in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06062628000107">The hon.
Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt), on the basis of his experience and
background, described the tremendous contribution of a wide variety of
charities in his constituency. He referred particularly to progress in
recent years by, for instance, the Council for Voluntary Services in
his area. He illustrated the difficulty of regulating in the charitable
sector by giving the example of a group of people who were moved by the
plight of some children in Nepal, and set up a charity to do something
about it. They stand alongside Oxfam, which has been doing such things
for ever, and other great British charities. We have a single system
that regulates all of them, and flexibility is very important. I am
sure that the Minister took that on board.</p><p><a name="06062628000108">The hon. Member for Hove (Ms
Barlow) made the important point that all that glisters is not gold. It
is no good our thinking that all charities are wonderful and always
make wise decisions. The House was moved and concerned to learn of the
plight of the hon. Lady&#146;s constituents in Dresden house, about
which she made some powerful points.</p><p><a name="06062628000109">The hon. Member for South
Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) spoke warmly about the role of the voluntary
sector. One of his important points was that it is not necessarily true
that every voluntary organisation would benefit from joining the state
sector. He mentioned the air ambulance service, which we also have in
my part of the world. It is sometimes right for 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 92</b><br>such services to be outside the state sector, but more clarity, support
and guidance from that sector would sometimes be
welcome.</p><p><a name="06062628000110">We had a good-natured and
informative debate. I want to focus briefly on three issues. The end of
the presumption of the public benefit test is controversial. It is a
significant change for many organisations that have enjoyed that
presumption for hundreds of years. We do not know what guidelines the
Charity Commission will produce to help people decide what is and is
not in the public interest. It has already produced some guiding
principles, but it is quite capable of changing those. We do not know
what the final guidelines will look like, so this is very much a step
in the dark. It is imperative for the House to have as much information
as possible about the nature of the guidelines according to which the
industry will operate before the House makes its final decisions on
Report and Third Reading. If there was a common theme on both sides of
the House, it was the need for clarity and certainty, especially for
well-established organisations that need to know what hurdles they have
to jump to ensure that they are operating for the public
benefit.</p><p><a name="06062628000111"><b><a name="06062628000313">Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman describes the removal of the
presumption of public benefit as controversial, but it was not, even
among his noble Friends in the other place. Can he now confirm clearly
that he is in favour of imposing a public benefit test on Help the Aged
and the RSPCA, but not on Winchester and
Eton?</p><p><a name="06062628000112"><b><a name="06062628000314">Mr.
Streeter:</b> The hon. Gentleman made that point earlier. It
was not very good then and it is not very good now. I refute that
facile intervention. We support the Bill and there will be no Division
on it tonight. I am calling on the Minister to provide maximum clarity,
especially in relation to the Charity Commission guidelines, on the
system under which charitable organisations will operate once the Bill
becomes law. The common cry from the House has been for
clarity.</p><p><a name="06062628000113">Secondly, we
are concerned about the independence of the new Charity Commission,
which will be a powerful body. As other hon. Members have pointed out,
its track record is not of the highest order. We agree that it should
be independent of Government. I remember a thousand years ago, when I
was a Minister in the Lord Chancellor&#146;s Department, we had a big
public debate about whether legal aid should be granted in several high
profile cases. I called in the chief executive of the Legal Aid Board
and, flexing my muscles, said, &#147;I want things to change.&#148;
He looked at me and said, &#147;You have no power over me whatever.
Who on earth do you think you are? I will carry on doing as I have
always done.&#148; In my opinion we have too many quangos that are
not properly accountable. I know that it is fashionable to say that
politicians should not make decisions and that we should delegate them
to other organisations, but we have gone too far down that path and it
is time to counter-attack and make many more of those organisations
accountable to Ministers, who are accountable to Parliament. I may be a
lone voice on that point, but that is how I feel. I feel a lot better
now that I have got that off my
chest.</p><p><a name="06062628000114">The new
beefed-up Charity Commission will not be accountable to Ministers. I
accept that it must be 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 93</b><br>independent of Government, but our suggestion of making it accountable
to a Select Committee is very sensible. I hope that the Minister will
consider it carefully. All Members of Parliament inform themselves
about the quality of charitable activity in their
constituencies&#151; we are experts in that&#151;so it is a
sensible suggestion. We are concerned about the current lack of
independence and accountability of that
organisation.</p><p><a name="06062628000115">Thirdly,
we have heard much about partnership between the charitable sector and
Government. Of course, that can work really well, but over the past few
years we have seen that a charitable organisation may have tremendous
success, because it performs its functions in its own way, but once it
enters into a contract or relationship with the Government it slowly
has the life squeezed out of it by red tape and bureaucracy. If that
happens, the organisation can cease to be successful because of too
much prescription by the Government. I place a marker to warn the
voluntary sector and the Government that although we all want such
partnerships, they must not lose the very aspects that make the
organisations successful in the first
place.</p><p><a name="06062628000116">Parts of the
Bill will increase regulation and parts will reduce it. The Bill was an
opportunity to set charities free, but it has not been properly seized.
In particular, the &#163;5,000 limit should be increased, and I hope
that the Minister will consider that point. We want clarity on the
public benefit test, greater accountability for the Charity Commission,
and a light-touch, flexible regulatory regime that genuinely empowers,
enables and supports the wonderful, unparalleled spirit of charity and
compassion of the great British people to arise, shine and be even more
productive in the future. We support the Government&#146;s direction
of travel, but we will seek to improve the Bill in
Committee.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062628000296">8.4
pm</h5><p><a name="06062628000117"><b><a name="06062628000315">The
Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Edward Miliband):</b>
It is a great privilege to wind up this debate. It has been an
excellent debate with some thoughtful contributions from Members on
both sides of the House, and we have seen the House of Commons at its
best. A spirit of charity has abounded, not only in the praise for my
right hon. Friend and myself from my hon. Friend the Member for Selby
(Mr. Grogan), but in the offer by the hon. Member for Sutton
Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) to be the campaign manager for my
right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) in
any future election that might take place. The hon. Gentleman promised
to do for my right hon. Friend what he did for the right hon. Member
for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), so I am not sure how the
offer will be regarded.</p><p><a name="06062628000118">As Members on both sides have
said, it is more than 400 years since the 1601 preamble to the
Charitable Uses Act. The Bill has been a long time coming, and that
creates an added pressure to achieve consensus. Fortunately, the Bill
gets it right. That is partly because it has been well prepared, having
its origins in the 2002 strategy unit report; well scrutinised, thanks
to the work by the Committee chaired by my right hon. Friend the Member
for Darlington; and well debated, 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 94</b><br>with 60 hours in the other place so far on two separate occasions. I
look forward to the further deliberations in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06062628000119">The central
purpose of the Bill is to put in place a framework for charities and
their activities that will enable them to realise their potential,
encourage a vibrant and diverse sector and sustain high levels of
public confidence. The Bill contributes to that through a streamlined
system of law for charity organisation and regulation, a new and
consistent approach to regulation of fundraising, and a clear
definition of charity, with every organisation having to prove public
benefit, all underpinned by an effective, modern regulator in the shape
of the Charity Commission. I shall deal with the important
contributions that have been made to the debate under those four
headings.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060626/debtext/60626-0651.htm"/>


<p><a name="06062628000120">On the issue
of administration and regulation, the Bill takes important steps, not
only in the new charitable incorporated organisation, but the raising
of the registration threshold from &#163;1,000 to &#163;5,000, the
raising of the audit threshold and several other sensible measures.
Hon. Members on both sides raised questions of administration and local
examples of charities and how they organised themselves. I was
especially struck by the contribution from the hon. Member for Rochford
and Southend, East (James Duddridge), who talked about people with
learning disabilities and their role as trustees. My understanding, and
that of the Charity Commission, is that trustee bodies should be
diverse and properly reflect the interests of beneficiaries. People
with learning disabilities are absolutely able to be trustees of
charities and there should be no difficulty for them in being so. If
the hon. Gentleman wishes to write to me further on that, I would be
happy to respond.</p><p><a name="06062628000121">The
hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield, as well as making his generous offer
to my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington, raised several
important points. He mentioned the status of armed forces charities and
I hope that he is pleased that their charitable purpose is confirmed in
the Bill. On the specific issue that he raised about the status of
those charities, I have to say that it is hard in the circumstances to
strike the right balance between the regulation that we need to achieve
a level playing field, and the particular demands of certain charities.
The position on armed forces charities is the same as for other
excepted charities. They will need to fulfil the requirements made of
them, but they are already subject to regulation by the Charity
Commission. The only new requirement will be to register and even then
only if they have an income of more than &#163;100,000. We have said
that that figure will not change before we complete the five-year
review of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06062628000122"><b><a name="06062628000316">Mr.
Andrew Mitchell:</b> The new Minister is doing very well, but
he says that the issue is where to strike the balance. I hope that he
will read the report of the debate in the cold light of day tomorrow
and consider whether, in the particular case of armed forces charities,
he has got that balance right.</p><p><a name="06062628000123"><b><a name="06062628000317">Edward
Miliband:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s role in
speaking eloquently for those charities, but if we make an exception
for them, many others will say that 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 95</b><br>we should make an exception for them, too. However, I shall consider the
points that he raised.</p><p><a name="06062628000124">The second area in which the
Bill makes progress is on charity fundraising. Several hon. Members
raised that issue, and we see the difficulty in striking the right
balance between regulation that is clear and commands public confidence
and the avoidance of excessive bureaucracy. The hon. Member for Isle of
Wight (Mr. Turner), who speaks for the Conservative party, was
concerned that tin-rattling, as he put it, would still be allowed. The
hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) defended the position of
charity fundraisers, and indeed objected to the term chugging, which my
right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office used. My hon.
Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper) who is not in
his place&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> He is but in a different place.
He talked eloquently of concerns about the charity fundraising that
takes place in Brighton.</p><p><a name="06062628000125">I shall set out for the House
how the legislation will work. The current legislation represents a bad
combination of bureaucracy and inconsistency. For example, before
granting a licence, local authorities are asked to judge whether a
charity&#146;s proposals for collections will yield enough in
contributions compared with costs. That should be a matter not for
local authorities but for charities. Everyone in the House knows that
current legislation is implemented inconsistently and does not even
apply to new types of fundraising. The Bill contains important steps
forward in that area, and I shall briefly clarify the new
regime.</p><p><a name="06062628000126">Collections
in buildings such as churches, village halls, Royal British Legions and
shops will not require a licence. Door-to-door collections will require
a public collections certificate to prove the authenticity of the
collector, and I can reassure my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak
(Tom Levitt) that ID cards will continue to be part of that regime.
Finally, street collecting will require a public collections
certificate and a licence in advance from the local authority for
collection on specific occasions.</p><p><a name="06062628000127">In answer to my hon. Friend the
Member for Brighton, Pavilion, clause 60 sets out the terms on which
local authorities will be able to regulate fundraising. There are a
number of ways in which they will be able to do that. The key aspect is
that they must make a judgment about whether a collection</p><a name="06062628000245"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;would cause inconvenience to
members of the public by reason
of&#151;</p></ul><a name="06062628000246"><ul><p class="tabletext">(a) the day
or the week or date on or in which,</p></ul><a name="06062628000247"><ul><p class="tabletext">(b) the time at
which,</p></ul><a name="06062628000248"><ul><p class="tabletext">(c) the
frequency with which&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000128">it
takes place, and so on. I hope that that is of some reassurance to my
hon. Friend.</p><p><a name="06062628000129"><b><a name="06062628000318">Helen
Goodman:</b> I must apologise. I was misled about when the
winding-up speeches would begin, which is why I should like my hon.
Friend the Minister to consider this possibility: to prevent charities
incurring a new and large administrative burden, will he consider
wrapping up the collection certificate with the registration
process?</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 96</b><br><p><a name="06062628000130"><b><a name="06062628000319">Edward
Miliband:</b> There is a two-part process: the first will
involve the Charity Commission and the public collection certificate,
and the second will involve local authorities. It will be for the
commission to determine how it works, but I hope, on the basis of my
hon. Friend&#146;s intervention, that she will join us in Committee,
where we can look forward to talking further about that
issue.</p><p><a name="06062628000131">The third part
of my remarks is about public benefit. Again, we saw the need to strike
a balance. My right hon. Friends the Members for Darlington and for
Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael), and my hon. Friends the
Members for High Peak and for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) all spoke
eloquently about that. A number of principles underlie the
Government&#146;s approach, and it is important for the House and the
wider charities&#146; world to understand them.</p><p><a name="06062628000132">The first principle is that all
institutions, including private schools, will have to show that they
provide public benefit. I genuinely hope that that does not separate
the Opposition and the Government. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight
asked a series of questions about religion, poverty and education. In
all those cases, it is right that public benefit must be shown, but I
reassure him that, at least for religion, the obligation will not be
onerous. We have accepted, and I think others have, too, that making
provision for people to attend acts of worship is clearly a public
benefit. It is clear in case law, and it will remain part of the
charity law of this country. Religions have nothing to fear.</p><p><a name="06062628000133">The hon. Gentleman also raised
the issue of poverty relief, and he challenged us on whether it was
possible for a poverty relief trust not to be charitable. It is
possible. For example, if we take the case of a trust to benefit a few
people in one&#146;s immediate family, one might say that it was set
up for the relief of poverty. However, there might be questions about
whether it genuinely provided public benefit. That would be a question
for the Charity Commission to consider, but even in that case, which
looks deserving of charitable status, scrutiny would be right. The
first principle, then, is that all institutions must show public
benefit.</p><p><a name="06062628000134">In line with
the view of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and
leading charities, the second principle is that the commission, not the
Government, should make the final decisions about charitable status on
a case-by-case basis. It will depend on the circumstances of
fee-charging institutions.</p><p><a name="06062628000135">Our third principle, which
relates to the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for
Darlington, is that we do not believe that indirect benefit&#151;the
claim that, for example, private schools save the state money by
educating pupils&#151;is enough to justify charitable status. We
agree with the Independent Schools Council, which said in its recent
briefing to MPs:</p><a name="06062628000249"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Indirect benefit is not
enough on its own to ensure charitable
status.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000136">I hesitate to
get into a discussion of Re:Resch with my hon. Friend the Member for
Selby, because it might extend my speech far too much, but if he
considers that case, he will see that indirect benefit is not the only
point mentioned to justify the charitable status of independent
schools. Lord Wilberforce, in his opinion, 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 97</b><br>goes on to talk about benefits that can be construed only as direct. For
example, he cites</p><a name="06062628000250"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the
benefit to the standard of medical care in the general hospital which
arises from the juxtaposition of the two
institutions.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000137">Our
fourth principle is that for private schools as a whole, we need to
raise the bar with regard to the contribution that they make towards
the public benefit, to the extent that it has a positive effect on the
overall provision of education in this country. Some private schools
are doing important work with the state sector, but many more must do
so, too. That is why we will remove the presumption that education
automatically confers charitable status.</p><p><a name="06062628000138">Specific amendments will be
tabled later in the parliamentary process, but let me say one thing to
the hon. Member for Cheltenham, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, on the
Scottish system. As others have said, devolution is about different
nations being able to introduce different provisions, and that is what
the Scottish Parliament has done. In practice, both Bills will have
similar implications in Scotland and England, and we are not convinced
that it would be helpful to amend this Bill on the basis of a Scottish
route. That is not simply our view; others agree. I recently had the
pleasure of receiving a letter from Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers,
who has been mentioned in this debate already. He said of the Scottish
provision that</p><a name="06062628000251"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;...it is not well
drafted.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000139">Let
me deal with the contribution of my right hon. Friend the Member for
Darlington, who chaired the Joint Committee. The whole House owes him
great thanks: the Bill is a better Bill for his work. I agree with the
tenor of his remarks. Parliamentary scrutiny is designed to ensure that
the Bill carries out our intentions on public benefit and we shall want
to consider the proposals made by Members and listen to the debate in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06062628000140">The
hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) asked about the process
and timetable for the Charity Commission&#146;s consideration of each
charity. When the Bill is established in law, the commission will hold
consultations about high-level guidance on public benefit before
finalising it. It will then consult on guidance relating to various
subsections on fee-charging public institutions, including schools and
hospitals, to establish how public benefit applies in those cases. The
process will take between 12 to 18 months from the enactment
of the
legislation.</p><p><a name="06062628000141">Finally,
I want to deal with the reforms to the Charity Commission&#151;the
first such modernisation since 1960. The House should be honest: this
is a big challenge for the Charity Commission to rise to being a
thoroughly modern regulator on the basis of new legislation. Many
Members, including the hon. Member for Cheltenham, my hon. Friend the
Member for Hove (Ms Barlow) and my right hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth raised local issues about the performance of
the Charity Commission.</p><p><a name="06062628000142">The basis of regulation has
changed dramatically since 1960 and the Bill takes account of that in a
number of reforms. Most important, it reflects the need for a widely
representative board, whose membership will expand from five to nine
under the Bill; for proportionate regulation, which the
Charity 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 98</b><br>Commission has a specific duty to ensure; and for quick and inexpensive
means of redress if people are dissatisfied, which the Bill achieves
through the provisions for the new charity tribunal. My hon. Friend the
Member for Hove gave an important local example, and I hope that the
new charity tribunal system will provide quicker redress in cases such
as the one she raised. At present, people have to go to the High Court
to seek redress from the Charity Commission, which is an expensive and
difficult process, so it is no wonder that in the last decade on
average less than one case a year has challenged the Charity Commission
in the High
Court.</p><p><a name="06062628000143">Other points
were made about the Charity Commission. The hon. Member for Sutton
Coldfield asked about independence. The Charity Commission carrying out
its functions on behalf of the Crown does not compromise its
independence. The Food Standards Agency is regulated in exactly the
same way as a non-ministerial Department and since the Joint Committee
proceedings we have added a provision of which the hon. Gentleman may
not be aware. It states
that</p><a name="06062628000252"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Commission
shall not be subject to the direction or control of any Minister of the
Crown or other government
department&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000144">precisely to
provide reassurance on that
point.</p><p><a name="06062628000145">The hon. Member
for Isle of Wight raised accountability to Parliament. The Charity
Commission must submit to Parliament a report on its work once a year.
Labour Members are sympathetic to the notion that there needs to be
rigorous Select Committee scrutiny of the work of the Charity
Commission. The Home Affairs Committee has a lot on its
plate.</p><p><a name="06062628000146"><b><a name="06062628000320">Stephen
Pound (Ealing, North) (Lab):</b> My hon. Friend makes a cogent
case that is actually persuading me to support the Government, but will
he give some thought to the 1.5 million citizens of the United Kingdom
who live in a part of the realm not covered by the Charity Commission?
In Northern Ireland, there is no Charity Commission; the
commissioners&#146; writ does not run. I do not expect a response
tonight, but will my hon. Friend look at the recent report of the
Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, which drew the attention of the
House to that anomaly? Will he include that report in the rest of his
reading?</p><p><a name="06062628000147"><b><a name="06062628000321">Edward
Miliband:</b> We are looking at the issue of Northern Ireland
and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his
intervention.</p><p><a name="06062628000148">In the
Standing Committee, we shall no doubt return to other points that were
raised. It is important that the Bill is subject to proper scrutiny, as
it will be. The Bill tackles long-standing and difficult issues in
charity law, such as public benefit, face-to-face fundraising and the
modernisation of the Charity Commission. It will help to nurture the
dynamism and social conscience of the charitable sector. Four years
after the initial report that led to proposals for the measure, it is
on its last lap. The Bill deserves support from all sides and I commend
it to the
House.</p><p><a name="06062628000149"><i> Question put

Brokenshire (Hornchurch) (Con):</b> I am grateful for this
opportunity to highlight the serious and increasing problem of illegal
radio broadcasting and the criminality associated with it. I choose
those terms advisedly, as the description &#147;pirate radio&#148;
does not convey a real sense of the activities undertaken by those
involved.</p><p><a name="06062628000175">Many people
retain a nostalgic view of the pirate radio broadcasters of the
1960s&#151;the Radio Carolines of the era, which challenged the BBC
with their line-up of cheesy disc jockeys, who are now part of radio
history. Indeed, the Minister for Industry and the Regions recalled
that era of broadcasting during a recent debate on the Draft Wireless
Telegraphy (Pre-Consolidation Amendments) Order 2006. When she was
asked by the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) whether Radio
Caroline could be brought back, she
replied:</p><a name="06062628000284"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;None
of us wants to divulge our age, but I assure my hon. Friend that Radio
Caroline, like any other station, may apply for a licence and may even
find it easier to do so once we have simplified and consolidated the
legislation in the way that we intend.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official
Report, Fourth Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation,</i> 17 May
2006; c. 4.]</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000176">As the
Minister&#146;s comments show, there is still a perception that
pirate radio is a bit of harmless fun. I am not referring to the
Minister in particular, but the traditional attitude towards illegal
broadcasting is a significant part of the problem of tackling that
serious issue. Of course, Radio Caroline was not illegal; it was just
not regulated because it broadcast from offshore&#151;my hon. Friend
the Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) nods in
concurrence.</p><p><a name="06062628000177">The real
world of pirate radio stations nowadays is very different from the
romantic and nostalgic picture of the 1960s. The reality is that
illegal stations do real harm to the communities they purport to serve.
They are operated with wanton disregard for the health and safety of
others and, in many cases, are highly profitable operations that feed
other criminal activities. They cause significant disruption and damage
to legitimate businesses that have paid significant sums to the
Government in licence fees for radio frequencies that are in large part
unusable. Many illegal stations are tied to the drugs trade and are
used to promote events where drugs can be bought or sold. A report in
the <i> The Times </i>last November summarised the position well when it
said:</p><a name="06062628000285"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There
are more than 150 illegal stations across the country, a third of which
are said to be run by criminal gangs who use them as a front to sell
drugs. Previous raids have found drugs, guns and ammunition among the
piles of CDs. Drug dealers within earshot of some stations keep tuned
to wait for a particular song to be played or a phrase to be uttered,
knowing that it is the signal that their next shipment is ready for
collection.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000178"><b><a name="06062628000325">Stephen
Pound (Ealing, North) (Lab):</b> I am grateful to the hon.

<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 102</b><br>pirate radio stations in my part of the world. Typically a pirate radio
station occupies a squatted council flat with steel doors. It is a
living embodiment of contempt for the law. I am as a romantic as the
next person and as affectionate for Radio Caroline and Radio London,
but I entirely endorse the points that he is making and I wish him God
speed, because this is a real problem. It is not about music; it is
about menace.</p><p><a name="06062628000179"><b><a name="06062628000326">James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
intervention. I will certainly come on to some of the issues that he
has highlighted and will give some examples of the real misery and
danger that is caused by a number of the operators, because that is a
serious point. The links to crime are demonstrated by an example that
Ofcom, the regulator, gave to me of a raid that was undertaken in the
course of the past month. This is an example of what he was
saying:</p><a name="06062628000286"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Two
persons were found on the premises and were arrested for offences
related to illegal broadcasting. Two knives and two samurai swords were
found during the operation. A further arrest was made of a person
wanted by the police for questioning as part of their operation trident
investigations&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000180">Illegal broadcasting, by its
very nature, is entirely unregulated. It feels no prohibition on
playing music that glamorises gang violence and drug culture. It is
accountable to no one for what it broadcasts. It abides by no
programming codes on taste or decency and it operates without any
regard for the consequences of what may be said on
air.</p><p><a name="06062628000181"><b><a name="06062628000327">Michael
Fabricant (Lichfield) (Con):</b> Is my hon. Friend also aware
that, whereas in the old days people complained that somehow Radio
Caroline would interfere with the radio for air traffic control,
which 30 years ago was absolute nonsense, in this instance
sloppy engineering by many of the pirate stations creates harmonics? In
other words, they end up transmitting not only on the main frequency,
but also, inadvertently, on other frequencies. That interferes with
legal broadcasters such as BBC Radio 4, Radio 3 and commercial
broadcasters, as well as with emergency transmissions used by the fire
service, the ambulance service and, I understand, air traffic
control.</p><p><a name="06062628000182"><b><a name="06062628000328">James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s point about the
engineering that goes into the transmission equipment is right. The
equipment poses dangers in the way he has alluded to. In addition, the
way in which it is installed is highly dangerous for residents living
in the high-rise blocks where such pieces of equipment can often be
found. I will go on to illustrate in more detail some of the points
that he has raised in his timely intervention. A recent example is
germane to the wanton disregard for safety and the issue of the
implications of what is said. It has been alleged that pirate radio was
the trigger behind the Lozells riots in October 2005 because it incited
racial tensions in Birmingham by spreading false rumours that a black
woman had been raped by Asian men. That example shows the serious
nature of the unregulated environment that pirate radio stations
operate within.</p><p><a name="06062628000183">There
are other ways in which pirate radio can cause harm in the manner that
has been indicated in the interventions. Illegal broadcasting causes
interference 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 103</b><br>to safety-of-life radio networks, such as those used by air traffic
control, the fire service, the ambulance service and the police. It is
interesting to note that in 2005, Ofcom responded to 41 safety-of-life
cases. One example was on 14 July 2005, when, following contact from
the Civil Aviation Authority, the Ofcom investigation team were
mobilised to east London to investigate serious interference with the
ground-to-air communication system in use at London City airport. The
source was traced to a pirate radio station in the Hackney
area. The offending transmitter was subsequently removed by Ofcom
staff. The problem was reported as being</p><a name="06062628000287"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the most serious case of
interference for many years&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000184">because London City airport was about to
close as it had no alternative means of reliable communication with the
aircraft seeking to land at the airport. In the wake of that shocking
incident, during a week long operation in London last October, 53
illegal broadcast transmitters were seized and 17 further transmitters
and aerials were disabled&#151;all in just seven
days.</p><p><a name="06062628000185">There are also
other health and safety implications. An illegal broadcaster will
identify a slot in the FM broadcasting band. It will then locate its
transmitter on high ground, usually on the roof of a local authority
building, which will typically be a residential tower block. To feed
the transmitter, the illegal broadcaster will tap into the
building&#146;s power supply, often by diverting electricity from the
lift motor room&#151;in the process, putting the lift out of action
for the residents. In some cases, illegal broadcasters will place their
transmitters on mobile phone
masts.</p><p><a name="06062628000186">Increasingly,
illegal broadcasters are placing obstacles in Ofcom&#146;s path to
thwart enforcement activities. Ofcom has told me that it has recently
encountered: the placement of transmitters down ventilation flues, or
chimneys, and on rooftops, with access to the device being restricted
through the use of scissor-type car jacks; the attachment of live 240 V
electric cables to the access doors on rooftops in an attempt to cause
shock or injury; the utilisation of scaffold poles to jam main access
doors on rooftops; the changing of locks on perimeter fencing and
electrical cabinets; the attachment of barbed wire to structures around
the transmission equipment; and, in some instances, the detachment of
the main access ladders. The illegal broadcasters can cause significant
damage to rooftops when installing apparatus. The pirates have also
been known to intimidate the caretakers and their families in an
attempt to gain access to high-rise blocks. As we have heard, the
transmitters are crude in construction and are not electronically
safe.</p><p><a name="06062628000187">All that can
have a direct impact on the safety of people living in the blocks of
flats that have been hijacked by the illegal broadcasters. One example
given to me by Ofcom was of a woman living in a top floor flat who had
to be evacuated following a carbon monoxide leak into her home. A crack
had appeared in her kitchen wall following the installation of a
transmitter that had been located in an adjacent gas ventilation flue.
The incident was caused by an expanded car jack. Some &#163;7,000 of
damage was caused and the fumes from the flue were allowed to leak into

<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 104</b><br>her premises. I fear that it is only a matter of time before someone is
seriously injured or killed as a result of illegal broadcasters&#146;
activities.</p><p><a name="06062628000188">There is a
misconception that the people behind illegal radio stations are just
enthusiasts with an interest in music and broadcasting. Some claim that
they break the law because they want to serve a community need, but
Ofcom provides an outlet for that through the new community radio
licences that it is advertising. The licences are awarded regularly
throughout the country to meet that unfulfilled
need.</p><p><a name="06062628000189"><b><a name="06062628000329">Michael
Fabricant:</b> In the past, regulators such as the radio
division of the Independent Broadcasting Authority, the Radio Authority
and Ofcom used to say that there was a lack of frequencies. However,
owing to digital audio broadcasting multiplexing and the extension of
the FM band from 104 to 108 MHz, frequencies are available, albeit with
some limitations. As my hon. Friend said earlier, if Radio Caroline was
to ask for a two or four-week local broadcast licence now, it would
probably get
one.</p><p><a name="06062628000190"><b><a name="06062628000330">James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid point about the
use of the spectrum. Indeed, there are various ways in which
communities can promote different types of music or reflect a community
need, whether that is through restricted service licences for the time
periods that he suggests, or the new community licences. I have had the
privilege and pleasure of supporting my local community radio station:
Link FM in Havering. I am pleased to report that it has now been given
a full-time community radio licence. That demonstrates that if people
wish to undertake legal broadcasting, there are the means and method to
achieve that in a regulated environment.</p><p><a name="06062628000191">One of the most famous cases of
a pirate going into a regulated environment was probably Kiss 100. The
station had its roots in the pirate tradition, but was then able to
broadcast music that had perhaps not been accessed before lawfully and
with a licence on FM. The station is now very successful. Those who
argue that pirate radio is about giving a voice to, or promoting music
among, a wider community should be aware that the means exist to do
that. Given the expansion of internet broadcasting, too, it is now even
easier and more cost-effective to produce such output and reach a wide
audience.</p><p><a name="06062628000192">The truth is
that the majority of illegal broadcasters are motivated by money. The
turnover of an illegal station can be significant. Set-up costs are
minimal; a transmitter costs about &#163;350 and a good-quality
studio can be assembled for just &#163;2,000. According to Ofcom, a
large illegal radio station can generate up to &#163;5,000 a week in
cash, without the need to pay tax, licence fees or copyright charges
for the music played. Such stations advertise parties, clubs, records
and the like. A good number even have websites with discussion groups.
The stations are full-blown black market businesses and the licensed
broadcasting industry is bearing the direct economic cost of the
illegal
competition.</p><p><a name="06062628000193">It is
interesting to note that many of the broadcasters and DJs who appear on
pirate radio stations actually pay for the privilege. They are often 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 105</b><br>teenagers and young people who may be impressionable. The pirates often
prey on that and charge them as much as &#163;20 an hour to broadcast
on the stations.</p><p><a name="06062628000194">It is
the mainstream stations that bear the brunt of the problem because
their signals are scrambled and interfered with. It is interesting that
Paul Brown, the outgoing chief executive of the Commercial Radio
Companies Association,
says:</p><a name="06062628000288"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Pirate
radio operators steal music copyright, endanger the lives of airline
passengers and those needing the help of emergency services, and
interfere with the broadcast signals of legal radio services. In doing
so, they rob BBC licence fee payers of services they have paid for and
commercial and community radio listeners of services licensed to serve
them. By reducing listening to legal advertiser funded radio services,
they impair revenue generation and investment in
content.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000195">Locally,
the experience of Time FM 107.5, which serves the London boroughs of
Havering, Barking and Dagenham&#151;it covers my constituency and
that of the Minister for Industry and the Regions&#151;is a good
example of the direct impact that illegal stations can have on the
ground. As Neil Romain of London Media Company, which owns Time and
several other stations, puts
it:</p><a name="06062628000289"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;They
affect our business at its most fundamental level. They prevent us
being heard by potential listeners. We have four pirates on an adjacent
channel with poorly configured equipment which blocks our signal. We
have clear evidence that advertisers who would use us do not do so
because they are aware of the intermittent service. Barking and
Dagenham council who have advertised with us in the past are currently
not doing so because they cannot receive the station in their offices
whilst the pirates are broadcasting.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000196">Another example is LBC 97.3 FM,
in London, which is owned by Chrysalis Radio. Daniel Owen, head of
regulatory affairs at Chrysalis, says the
following:</p><a name="06062628000290"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Interference
from pirate radio is ruining listening enjoyment for LBC listeners and
having a potentially significant impact on LBC&#146;s business. One
pirate station has been on-air on an adjacent channel to ours for many
months and continues unabated, despite being a clearly well-organised
determined outfit with its own website, promotional events and even
phone-in number. The confiscation of pirate transmitters is of
negligible value to LBC. Last time it happened, the offending station
was back within hours on a new
transmitter&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06062628000197">Therein
lies one of the problems. Ofcom has to mount a continual battle against
illegal broadcasters, and it is not being given the back-up that it
needs in terms of resources and the support of other
agencies.</p><p><a name="06062628000198">Although
there is the right to sentence such a person to two years&#146;
imprisonment, and an unlimited fine for unlawful broadcasts, even when
Ofcom secures a conviction, offenders get little more than a slap on
the wrist. There were 58 convictions last year, but the average fine
was a paltry &#163;563, with average costs awarded to Ofcom of just
&#163;452 per case.</p><p><a name="06062628000199">It has been suggested to me
that illegal radio broadcasting offences are treated as little worse
than not having a TV licence. Against that backdrop, it is hardly
surprising that the Commercial Radio Companies Association has resorted
to using its own funds to take out private injunctions&#151;at a cost
of several thousand pounds per case&#151;against twice-convicted
pirate broadcasters, in an attempt to reduce reoffending. But it is
absurd that it should be forced into taking such action.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 106</b><br><p><a name="06062628000200">Given that illegal broadcasters
are making as much as &#163;5,000 a week, such absurdly low fines can
almost be viewed as a minor business cost&#151;assuming that they
ever get paid. Ofcom is currently dealing with &#163;58,000-worth of
unpaid court debts relating to illegal broadcasts; some of those debts
are connected with cases that concluded many years ago. Illegal
broadcasters are employing more elaborate methods of securing their
equipment, and the result is that the cost of enforcement has increased
significantly.</p><p><a name="06062628000201">The
Government have not given this issue sufficient attention to date. The
Minister&#146;s Department needs to make a more significant
contribution in the battle to reduce the impact of illegal radio
broadcasts, but only a co-ordinated approach will work. I understand
that the possibility of a summit meeting is being discussed which would
bring together all interested stakeholders&#151;including
broadcasters, the Government and law-enforcement bodies&#151;to agree
and implement a real solution to the pirate problem. Will the Minister
commit to her officials attending such a
meeting?</p><p><a name="06062628000202">In
concluding, I have a few further questions for the Minister. Will the
Government grant Ofcom additional powers, if they are needed, to make
it more effective in dealing with pirates? For example, will they allow
it to act more quickly to shut down telephone numbers known to be used
by pirates? Indeed, will the Minister undertake to review the funding
made available to Ofcom to enable it to pursue its enforcement
activities? I understand that the licence fees paid by radio operators
are merely a statutory fee for the grant of the licence. The money is
not Ofcom&#146;s&#151;it goes directly to the Treasury, and
Ofcom&#146;s spectrum management and enforcement activities are
funded by grant-in-aid, via the Department of Trade and
Industry.</p><p><a name="06062628000203">If dealing
with the increasing costs associated with enforcement gives rise to
resource issues, that needs to be examined very carefully. If the
Minister is unable to commit to providing additional resources, I hope
that she will at least commit tonight to examining the funding for
enforcement activities undertaken by Ofcom. In addition, will the
Government encourage the police to make dealing with pirate radio a
higher priority, and to work with Ofcom on devising enforcement
solutions and increasing the arrest rate for pirate broadcasters? Will
the Government review sentencing guidelines for pirate radio offences
and encourage magistrates to impose stiffer penalties on convicted
pirates? In many ways the problem is one of perception&#151;the
perception that pirate radio is harmless. I hope that my comments this
evening have given the lie to that and highlighted the need to take
this sort of criminality much more seriously.</p><p><a name="06062628000204">The co-operation of the BBC is
also essential if any co-ordinated approach is to work. The
BBC&#146;s attitude to pirate radio is, to a large extent, unknown.
Will the Government commit themselves to including in the new BBC
charter and agreement a duty to work with Ofcom and commercial radio
broadcasters to discourage illegal radio broadcasting
activity?</p><p><a name="06062628000205">Pirate radio
is a serious problem in terms of crime, the dangers that it poses to
public safety, and the significant business damage that it causes to
legal and legitimate radio companies. It is not a case of
&#147;Smashie and Nicey&#148;; more one of &#147;Dangerous and
Nasty&#148;. As 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 107</b><br>policy makers, we need to tune into the debate on the steps needed to
tackle this criminal activity. I hope that the Government will be on
the right
frequency.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062628000299">8.51

securing this debate. It is a pleasure to debate with him on something
other than the Company Law Reform Bill, to which we will return with
all energy tomorrow morning.</p><p><a name="06062628000207">I come to the debate as a radio
addict, rather than an addict of other media. I have the radio on every
moment I can&#151;although not, I hasten to add, Mr. Deputy
Speaker, on my mobile in the Chamber. The radio brings us massive
benefits, including music and drama, news and information. We can
follow our football or cricket team in action, or listen to
entertainment such as quizzes, games and conversation. I know that the
hon. Gentleman has been talking with LBC; he, I and my hon. Friend the
Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound) have spent much time over the
years in the LBC studios participating in creating radio
broadcasts.</p><p><a name="06062628000208">I also
congratulate the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) on his
contribution. He is better known to us all, and fondly remembered, as
Mickey Fabb, as he was in his younger
days.</p><p><a name="06062628000209"><b><a name="06062628000332">Stephen

Gentleman clearly has something to contribute to the debate.</p><p><a name="06062628000211">The hon. Member for Hornchurch
spoke at length and I do not think that I disagreed with a word of his
analysis of the problem. I admit to having been a Radio Caroline fan in
the days before it was banned, by Harold Wilson, I
believe.</p><p><a name="06062628000212"><b><a name="06062628000334">Stephen

Friend, the rascal was, in fact, the then Postmaster General, Anthony
Wedgwood
Benn.</p><p><a name="06062628000213"><b><a name="06062628000335">Margaret
Hodge:</b> I stand properly
corrected.</p><p><a name="06062628000214">Many of
those who have now become household names learned their trade in the
pirate radio industry and the ships that were anchored offshore in the
1960s, and some of today&#146;s stations, such as Kiss FM, that
started and were nurtured in the pirate radio world now provide a high
standard of entertainment. However, that is a partial view, and I
accept what the hon. Member for Hornchurch said about it taking no
account of the damage that pirate radio can do. It is important that we
do not allow the ring of excitement about the term &#147;pirate
radio&#148; to blind us to the importance of ensuring that use of the
radio spectrum is effectively managed. In that, I disagree with the
hon. Member for Lichfield. The spectrum is a limited and extremely
valuable asset. One of the tasks for Government, and through that
Ofcom, which has the 
<br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 108</b><br>job of ensuring that there is the best use of our spectrum, is to
maximise the benefit to all our citizens from the allocation of
spectrum throughout the media, so it is not that readily
available.</p><p><a name="06062628000215">However
innocent pirate radio may seem to the listener, it is not innocent.
Misuse of the radio spectrum will cause interference to other
legitimate radio users. It can have extremely serious consequences.
Some illegal broadcasters claim that they break the law because they
want to serve a community need. Ofcom enforcement officials believe
that the majority of illegal broadcasts, as the hon. Member for
Hornchurch said, are motivated by money. If it is possible to generate
in excess of &#163;5,000 a week in untaxed revenue that comes from a
mixture of local advertising and charging young and often
impressionable DJs to appear on the station, it is an ill-gotten
business from which there are ill-gotten gains.</p><p><a name="06062628000216">The hon. Member for Hornchurch
is right that owners of illegal radio stations have often been found to
be part of wider criminal families. The joint Ofcom-police raids on
stations have uncovered things such as drugs and weapons when they have
closed down pirate stations. Those involved with this criminal activity
have been known to threaten and intimidate neighbours and communities
to obtain access to rooftops as transmission sites. Sometimes, they
have even booby-trapped aerials by wiring to the mains
electricity.</p><p><a name="06062628000217">As has
been said, in the absence of regulation there is much harmful and
offensive content in transmission. This can be broadcast through
illegal broadcasters&#151;pirate radio. This includes racist and
offensive material that can be put on the air.</p><p><a name="06062628000218">I shall talk about
Ofcom&#146;s role as the regulator. It is Ofcom that takes action.
Funding is not necessarily the issue. Ofcom currently spends&#151;the
hon. Member for Hornchurch may not know&#151;less than 1 per cent. of
its current income on shutting down pirate radios. It may be that
within its budget it will want to consider that issue. Even in my first
few weeks in this ministerial role, I have to tell the hon. Gentleman
that Ofcom has to deal with various abuses of information in the form
of faxes, telephone calls and so on. A great deal of work is undertaken
in tracking abuse within systems by illegal operators. Pirate radio
stations have to be seen in the context of all the other regulatory
activities in which Ofcom has to be engaged in tracking down
abuse. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that. I
am not sure that money is particularly the
problem.</p><p><a name="06062628000219">Pirate radio
is much more of a problem in the UK than it is in the rest of Europe.
Ofcom has estimated that there are more than 150 illegal broadcasters
operating in the UK. We can listen to the radio at any time and find
that there is often an interruption. At any one time there are probably
about 60 illegal radio stations clogging up the radio
spectrum.</p><p><a name="06062628000220">The main
problem is concentrated around the London region and Birmingham. Ofcom
responds to that appropriately and most of its resources are focused on
those areas. It has established a separate investigative team to try to
tackle some of the misuse of the spectrum by pirate radio stations.
Eighteen out of the 21 staff in the investigative team are located in
London and Birmingham.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 109</b><br><p><a name="06062628000221"><b><a name="06062628000336">James
Brokenshire:</b> I have been listening attentively to the
right hon. Lady&#146;s points about resource and where people in
Ofcom&#146;s enforcement department are allocated. There is a
perception, at least in the commercial radio sector, that the issue is
about funding and support in terms of the ability to ensure that
enforcement is dealt with effectively and seriously. I heard what the
Minister said, but I would be grateful if she made a commitment to
examine the situation. Will her officials discuss funding problems with
Ofcom, and determine whether other funding can be secured so that radio
operators can be sure that their licence fees provide value for
money?</p><p><a name="06062628000222"><b><a name="06062628000337">Margaret
Hodge:</b> I do not think that I could persuade the
Chancellor, other colleagues in the Treasury or anyone else that
additional income from the licence fee should be spent on that
function. I was trying to explain to the hon. Gentleman that only 0.8
per cent. of Ofcom&#146;s budget is spent on such activity, so a
small increase in that percentage would have a minimal impact on the
total budget. No doubt, Ofcom would argue that it requires more
resources, as it has to carry out a great deal of policing in all
activities. I heard what the hon. Gentleman said, but that is not
necessarily the key issue.</p><p><a name="06062628000223">The hon. Gentleman said that
very few people have been taken to court or, indeed, been subject to
action. In one time period, Ofcom conducted 770 operations against
illegal broadcasters. Most of that work consisted of seizing the
transmitters, because by the time that Ofcom staff arrived at the
premises, the broadcasters had gone. Only 58 of those 770 operations,
therefore, resulted in prosecutions. We can argue about whether
sentencing guidelines are appropriate&#151;I shall look at the issue
to see whether that is the case&#151;but it is difficult to catch the
criminals, because they have gone by the time that Ofcom and the
police, with whom the regulator co-operates closely, arrive.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060626/debtext/60626-0653.htm"/>


<p><a name="06062628000224">In October
2005, Ofcom conducted Operation Crystal in London, in which 18 of its
field operation staff worked with 32 Metropolitan police officers.
Considerable resources were therefore devoted to that operation, in
which 53 illegal broadcaster transmitters were seized and 17
transmitters and aerials disabled. Some 43 mobile and landline
telephone numbers linked to illegal broadcasting operations were
gathered for further investigation, which led to a 57 per cent. drop in
the number of broadcasts that week. However, I do not think that anyone
was arrested at all. Similarly, in Operation Clavicord, which ran in
Birmingham between 30 November and 1 December 2005, 12 Ofcom field
operation staff worked with seven West Midlands police officers. Three
people were arrested, and 10 illegal broadcaster transmitters were
removed. Six studios were raided, and equipment was seized. Efforts
have therefore been made to tackle the problem, and they were recently
strengthened when Ofcom restructured its field operation unit. Ofcom is
looking at the bigger strategy, too, and it has opened discussions with
King&#146;s College London on research to understand the motivation
of individuals who choose to manage and operate illegal broadcasting
stations. Interestingly, it is considering market research on the radio
audience to determine the popularity of pirate
radio.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 110</b><br><p><a name="06062628000225"><b><a name="06062628000338">Stephen

appear unnecessarily curmudgeonly, but the thought of spending public
or private money analysing why these people want to fill their boots

figures of importance in their local communities is just about the most
total and utter waste of money that I have ever heard of. We have heard
from the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) why they are
doing it. We do not need a university department to analyse it. What we
want is people to kick down the doors and put them out of
business.</p><p><a name="06062628000226"><b><a name="06062628000339">Margaret
Hodge:</b> Ofcom would probably say that what we need to do is
kick down the right doors, although when I read that part of my brief
the same point did occur to me. Perhaps more important is to undertake
research into why people listen to the pirate radio stations and use
that intelligence to determine how to allocate spectrum in the future
so that one takes away the market and hence the profitability of
running a pirate radio
station.</p><p><a name="06062628000227">The
Government of course have a role to play in combating pirate radio, and
officials in my Department have recently discussed pirate radio issues
among other things with the Commercial Radio Companies Association, in
particular in the context of how those illegal operations affected its
members. That was followed up with a meeting with the regulators on 18
May 2006 where officials met Ofcom colleagues to go through the general
issues around pirate radio as Ofcom sees them and to establish what
they are doing on a long-term strategic basis to try to reduce the
problem.</p><p><a name="06062628000228">If a summit
is organised to consider these issues, it is appropriate that a
Government official should be present, and if and when we receive
details, I will ensure that somebody attends. This matter is a high
priority, and I repeat that the policing of all these offences in
relation to the communications industry is important to individuals who
receive unwanted telephone calls or faxes. That creates more of a

there.</p><p><a name="06062628000230"><b><a name="06062628000341">Margaret

tracking down the individuals concerned because the difficulty in the
policing exercise is that it is easier to confiscate the equipment than
it is to identify and charge the individuals. Again, if there is
something that we need to learn from the CRCA activity we shall
consider that.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 111</b><br><p><a name="06062628000231">No one expects the romantic view
