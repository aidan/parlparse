 (LD): What discussions he has had with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on the future of the rural post office network in Scotland. [43210]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60124-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland  (David Cairns): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend and I regularly meet ministerial colleagues and discuss a range of issues.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60124-01_spnew0"><b> Danny Alexander: </b> 
 In the light of the decision not to allow post offices to deal with the new passports, and of reports that the contract for the Post Office card account will not be renewed after 2010, it appears that the Government are planning massive cuts in the number of rural post offices. Will the Minister assure the House that he will impress on his colleagues the essential social importance of the 1,100&nbsp;rural post offices in Scotland and ensure that funding is put in place to ensure their survival long into the future?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60124-01_spnew1"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 It is disappointing that the hon. Gentleman did not mention the more than &#163;2&nbsp;billion of investment that the Government have put into the post office network, including &#163;500&nbsp;million for IT and &#163;750&nbsp;million invested specifically in the rural network. He has to face up to a simple dilemma. There are 800&nbsp;post offices in the network with fewer than five customers a day. People are choosing to shop in a different way and, even before the introduction of the POCA, more and more people were choosing to have their benefits paid directly into bank and building society accounts. Would he continue to support a network that would wither on the vine without that investment, at an ever-increasing cost to the taxpayer? Those are difficult decisions. I understand why the Liberal Democrats are not capable of taking tough decisions, but we may have to.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60124-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. John McFall  (West Dunbartonshire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): The Minister is aware that more than 4&nbsp;million people have been given a POCA and that the account 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1286</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>plays a significant part in the financial inclusion agenda. If it is to be withdrawn by 2010, will he give an undertaking that there will be proper planning and consultation so that the Government&#039;s financial inclusion objectives are realised?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60124-01_spnew3"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is entirely correct. The Government set great store by financial inclusion. As chairman of the Treasury Committee, he has played a large part in advancing that agenda. The fact is that the guarantee to maintain the POCA extended only to 2010. Decisions on what happens after that are the subject of ongoing discussions between the Post Office and the Department for Work and Pensions. Large numbers of those who access their benefits through a POCA also have a bank account, so it is not axiomatic that all those who currently go through a POCA do not have an alternative account, but my right hon. Friend is right to remind us of the need for financial inclusion. We will keep that uppermost in our minds.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60124-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ian Liddell-Grainger  (Bridgwater)</b> 
 (Con): Given that the Post Office successfully continues to supply 170&nbsp;different products, but that 40&nbsp;per cent. of its income derives from pensions and benefits, is not the time now right for the Government to renegotiate with Post Office Counters people&#039;s ability to access bank accounts at the post office, or to use their cards in the post office to draw money from their benefits? Surely both are not possible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60124-01_spnew5"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 It is a fact that basic banks accounts with all the major Scottish banks are accessible at post offices in Scotland, so we have gone some way to deal with that issue. [Hon. Members: &quot;No.&quot;] Basic bank accounts are accessible. What we have to do is ensure that, as we look to the future of the Post Office, which we regard as extremely important&#151;we have invested massively in its future and put in enormous amounts of taxpayers&#039; money to sustain it&#151;we ensure that we continue to meet the social needs that it currently fulfils. However, we must also bear in mind the fact that people&#039;s shopping patterns change and the need to reflect that. We will take on board the point that the hon. Gentleman makes, but I think that the Government are already acting in that respect.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60124-01_spnew6"><b> John Thurso  (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</b> 
 (LD): I hope that the Minister will discuss these matters with his colleagues, and when he does I hope that he will also raise the question of urban post offices. Is he aware of the plans of Post Office Ltd to alter the status of six Crown post offices in franchise agreements and of the consequences that that will have in terms of reduction of service to customers and of conditions for staff? Given that there are many opportunities for the Government to put business into post offices, will they take a lead in ensuring the survival of our post offices, particularly in towns such as Dunfermline?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60124-01_spnew7"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 The question on the Order Paper is about rural post offices and if the hon. Gentleman thinks that Dunfermline post office is a rural post office, it shows his complete and utter ignorance of Dunfermline. It also demonstrates clearly why his party has abandoned all hope of winning the Dunfermline and West Fife constituency. Indeed, so low is the Liberal 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1287</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Democrats&#039; target that they hope only to beat the Scottish National party into third place. We have put significant investment&#151;&#163;2&nbsp;billion&#151;into the Post Office. I am sure that as long as Dunfermline continues to have an excellent Labour MP, as it will have after the by-election in a week or two, she will continue to ensure that the Government continue their policy of supporting the Post Office.

<p><a name="qn_o1">2. <a name="60124-01_wqn1"><b> Mr. Jim McGovern  (Dundee, West)</b> 
 (Lab): What discussions he has had with the First Minister of Scotland on the use of dawn raids in asylum cases. [43211]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60124-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland  (David Cairns): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend has regular discussions with the First Minister on a range of subjects.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60124-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. McGovern: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will be aware of the disquiet felt in certain areas in Scotland about what the tabloid press portrays as dawn raids. Many people regard them as insensitive and unnecessary. Although any sensible politician would say there is no case for a separate immigration and asylum system in Scotland, does my hon. Friend agree that a certain flexibility might be applied to bolster public confidence in the system north of the border?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60124-01_spnew9"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for the moderate and balanced way in which he made his point. The issue is all too often characterised by extremes at both ends: those who say we should have no asylum seekers or refugees at all, which we reject, and those at the other end who say we should have no rules to remove failed asylum seekers. We must have a balance. My hon. Friend is right. Early morning removals of asylum seekers are regrettable. We must do everything we can to avoid that, but if people are given opportunity and financial assistance once their claim for asylum has been turned down, they have lost their appeal, and they are asked to return to the country that they came from or their home country, if they consistently refuse to do so, we regrettably have to take steps to remove them. We must do so humanely and sensitively. I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution to that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60124-01_spnew10"><b> Jo Swinson  (East Dunbartonshire)</b> 
 (LD): I welcome the Minister saying that we should enforce the rules sensitively and humanely, but does he agree that as they are currently carried out, early morning removals&#151;dawn raids&#151;are traumatic for families, particularly when parents are handcuffed and children are separated from their parents and taken away in different vehicles? What reassurances can he give to the constituents who contact me because they are concerned about the matter?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60124-01_spnew11"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 The point that the hon. Lady mentions illustrates perfectly why voluntary removals are far better. That is why it is much better for individuals to leave the country when their appeal has been turned down and they are instructed to leave and given financial help and support to do so. If people 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1288</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>consistently refuse to leave the country after it has been found that they have no claim for asylum, we ultimately have to remove them if we are to have a system that we can enforce at all. It is very regrettable, but the power lies with them to pre-empt that by leaving the country when their appeal has run out.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60124-01_spnew12"><b> Ann McKechin  (Glasgow, North)</b> 
 (Lab): Like my hon. Friend, I agree that if we have a system, we have to deal with applications that are unsuccessful. Following discussions that colleagues in Glasgow have had with the immigration department, a system is being introduced whereby a lead professional will be involved throughout the removal process, from correspondence to meetings, up to the final removal. What measures will the Government take to encourage more people to take the route of voluntary return?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60124-01_spnew13"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to point out the improvements that are being made in the removals system, such as the lead professional and work with schools that have large numbers of asylum seekers&#039; children, as many of the concerns are raised through the children in those schools. Such changes have been brought about across the United Kingdom because of concerns expressed in Scotland. It is proper for us to acknowledge that the First Minister played an important role in raising these concerns in discussions with the Home Secretary. What we cannot have&#151;I know my hon. Friend agrees with this&#151;is a different removals regime in Scotland from the one in England because that would make it more difficult to remove asylum seekers from Scotland, as we would simply be sending a green light to every failed asylum seeker awaiting deportation in England to move to Scotland. That cannot be a sensible position.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60124-01_spnew14"><b> John Robertson  (Glasgow, North-West)</b> 
 (Lab): I thank my hon. Friend for his answers and concur with his sentiments regarding the people being sent home. Is it not the case that Glasgow is the only city accepting asylum seekers? Is it not despicable for the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) to preach to those of us who have to deal with the problem daily, when her constituency and council have nothing to do with those people?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60124-01_spnew15"><b> David Cairns: </b> 
 At Scottish questions, I have repeatedly congratulated Glasgow city council on the work that it has done. I have met Councillor Purcell, the leader of the council, and thanked him personally for the council&#039;s work. It is in negotiations to extend the contract. After a difficult start, as you will remember, Mr. Speaker, it has bedded down well and the families of asylum seekers in Glasgow are contributing to the city, the economy and the schools. I am happy to pay tribute to Glasgow. It is open to any other council to come forward at any time and seek to be part of that scheme.

 (SNP): What recent discussions he has had with the Department of Trade and Industry on energy in Scotland. [43212]


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1289</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60124-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Scotland  (Mr. Alistair Darling): </b> 
 There are regular discussions with Ministers and officials in the Department of Trade and Industry on a wide range of matters.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60124-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Weir: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that uninformative answer. He will know that the DTI launched its energy review consultation document yesterday. Why are the Government determined to foist new nuclear power stations on Scotland when Scotland does not have an energy crisis? We produce eight times more gas than we consume, we have massive coal reserves and a massive potential for renewable energy generation. Is it not the case that Scotland could be energy independent? What we need is not new nuclear power stations but political power.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60124-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 If the nationalists had their way, Scotland would not have any energy generation at all, because they are against nuclear and coal-fired power, and against wind farms unless they are in somebody else&#039;s constituency. They must face the fact that, in the next 15&nbsp;to 20&nbsp;years, Scotland will lose a lot of its generating capacity because it is getting older and we need to plan ahead now to make sure that we have secure energy supplies in the future. That means that we need to examine whether we should extend the life of the existing nuclear power stations, and whether there should be any new building of nuclear power stations and other plants. I must also point out that this Government and the Scottish Executive have given substantial help to renewable energy generation, which is very important. If the nationalists had their way, there would be no plants anywhere at all.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60124-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Frank Doran  (Aberdeen, North)</b> 
 (Lab): The Secretary of State will be aware that, 30&nbsp;years ago, Scotland held a world-class position in the renewables industry, but we lost that position when investment was squeezed out in the rush to go nuclear. Will the Secretary of State ensure, no matter what decision is made on nuclear power following the DTI review of the United Kingdom&#039;s energy requirements, that we maintain our investment in the renewables industry?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60124-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Absolutely. The Government and the Scottish Executive have targets to maintain and expand the amount of electricity generated from renewable sources. However, as I have said before, it is important that we generate electricity from a range of sources, so that we do not become over-dependent on any single one, which would be very risky. The whole point of the review is to have a grown-up discussion about what is best for Scotland. It is simply not possible to have an energy policy in which every option is ruled out, which is the position into which all three Opposition parties have more or less got themselves.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60124-02_spnew4"><b> David Mundell  (Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale)</b> 
 (Con): Last week in the Scottish Parliament, the First Minister said that section 36&nbsp;of the Electricity Act 1989&nbsp;gives the Scottish Executive the power to veto the construction of new nuclear power stations in Scotland. Will the Secretary of State ask his colleagues in the DTI whether they agree with that interpretation?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1290</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60124-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Of course they do. I said at the last Question Time that the Scottish Executive would have to give their consent under the 1989&nbsp;Act. In addition, planning matters are devolved, so the hon. Gentleman is doing no more than stating the blindingly obvious.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60124-02_spnew6"><b> David Mundell: </b> 
 When the Secretary of State next discusses energy issues with his colleagues in the DTI, will he raise the impact of rising energy prices on businesses in Scotland? On the day that has seen the announcement of the loss of 700&nbsp;jobs at Lexmark in Rosyth, will the Secretary of State acknowledge the fragility of Scotland&#039;s manufacturing industry? Does he accept that continuing rises in base costs will lead to further job losses?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60124-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Energy costs are certainly very important. Again, however, it is no use the hon. Gentleman saying that he is concerned about energy prices if he is then going to rule out a whole range of ways in which we could produce more energy, thus reducing prices. In relation to the announcement at Lexmark today, I have spoken to the local manager there and discussed the situation with him. This is clearly extremely disappointing news for the people who are employed at Lexmark, but the Scottish Executive and the Government, through Jobcentre Plus, will do everything that they possibly can to help the people who lose their jobs. In addition, it is also worth noting that more than 1,200&nbsp;jobs have been announced in Fife in the past year. At a time when changes are taking place in the jobs market here and right across the world, it is important that we have a strong, stable economy backed up by as much help as possible to ensure that, if people do lose their jobs, they get back into work as soon as possible. That is something that we have been able to do, and there are now more jobs in Fife than at any time when the Tories were in power. It is important that we continue to maintain that course.

<a name="stpa_o0">Scotland&#039;s energy needs will arise whether Scotland wants them to or not and they will have to be met. What mechanisms will my right hon. Friend provide to allow Scotland&#039;s energy industry to engage in discussions during the energy review?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="60124-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to say how important it is for the Government to maintain a strong and stable economy in Fife and elsewhere, so that jobs continue to be created there. Some 10,000&nbsp;jobs have been created in Fife over the past seven or eight years. Now we must ensure that we can maintain the current conditions to allow the creation of many more jobs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-02_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">It is worth noting that some of the new jobs in Fife that have been announced during the last few months are connected with the construction of a wind turbine there. That is an example of the way in which Fife can gain from the new opportunities. It is important for all energy companies to be involved in the review, and that will certainly happen.

 My right hon. Friend will know that I strongly oppose the idea of delaying the count.

Therefore, if one votes SNP or Green, one is voting for there not to be a replacement bridge.

 I thank the Secretary of State for that unrevealing answer, because I asked him when he last discussed the matter with the Secretary of State for Transport.

<p><a name="st_o46"><a name="60124-03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 In relation to the Isle of Wight, all services are provided on a commercial basis. The reason for that is that about 9&nbsp;million passengers are carried on ferries between the mainland and the Isle of Wight, whereas in the Scottish islands, even on routes such as Stornaway to Ullapool, the figure is about 189,000. A figure of 9&nbsp;million passengers means that commercially justified services are possible, whereas most of the Scottish islands need an element of subsidy. I assume that even the new Conservative party is not arguing that ferry services are not important to the Hebrides and other islands. Such services need to be maintained and subsidised.

<p><a name="st_o64"><a name="60124-04_spnew0"><b> Andrew Rosindell: </b> 
 The Minister will be aware that the Prime Minister has said that an individual would be able to appeal against a fixed penalty.

 I am not sure that the way in which the hon. Gentleman described the situation is right.

 Fine enforcement is very important and it really concerns people if they think that the whole court process has been gone through, a fine has been awarded, yet the person just walks away without paying. That is why the courts have been increasing their emphasis on enforcement.

 My hon. Friend is not right to say that we have lost faith in the courts&#151;far from it. In fact, magistrates courts will have increased sentencing powers, which means that they will be able to deal with more serious cases. In cases where it is accepted that the person in question has committed the offence for which they received the fixed penalty notice, the issuing and paying of such a notice, instead of tying up the courts&#039; time with a guilty plea, leaves the courts free to deal with more serious cases for which a trial is necessary. They are also free to deal with cases where, despite a guilty plea having been made, the offence is more serious and they therefore need to attend to the sentence.

 As I have said, if the person in question regards themselves as not guilty of the offence, they do not pay the fixed penalty notice and they go to court to explain why they are not guilty.

It is not for magistrates to address the issue of charging by the back door, as it were, but I do not want the House to run away with the idea that there is rampant inconsistency in this area, that no overview is taken and that nothing is being done in this respect. If the Law Officers&#151;the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General&#151;think that there is a concern that a particular sentence is unduly lenient, that case can be referred to the Court of Appeal.

<a name="60124-05_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Programming of Legislation</h4>





<p><a name="qn_o11">32. <a name="60124-05_wqn1"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  (Macclesfield)</b> 
 (Con): What recent representations he has received on the programming of legislation. [44673]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="60124-05_spmin1"><b>The Deputy Leader of the House of Commons  (Nigel Griffiths): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Leader of the House has not received specific representations on programming since the hon. Gentleman tabled an oral question in October last year, some three months ago.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="60124-05_spnew6"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </b> 
 The Modernisation Committee, which is chaired by the Leader of the House, is currently undertaking an inquiry into the legislative process. It is considering, among other things, the Standing Committee, Report and Third Reading stages of Bills, and Lords amendments. Surely the Leader of the House is aware that some of the evidence already submitted to him is highly critical of the programming system that we have in the House, which prevents our adequately scrutinising important legislation. Is not it time that the programming procedure was looked at again in order to enable the House to do the job that it is here to do?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="60124-05_spnew7"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 Obviously, the present system is not the most perfect, but it is clear from reviews of the system that any suggested changes have consequences that the House might not intend. There are, of course, strong political pressures on the Opposition to oppose any Government&#039;s proposals for timetabling, which affects all but the least controversial Bills. The system was looked at in 2003&nbsp;by the Modernisation Committee, and the Procedure Committee re-examined it in 2004. Improvements have been brought forward. The hon. Gentleman is a long-standing and much respected Member, and he knows that under the previous guillotine procedures many clauses were never reached. But it is important to have a proper programming procedure that takes account, as far as possible, of one of the most common alleged abuses in the House, which is filibustering.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o95"><a name="60124-05_spnew8"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): When the Modernisation Committee reviewed programming, it made two recommendations. It suggested having internal knives to allow Chairmen of Committees a little flexibility to postpone knives where discussions were advanced but not quite complete. Secondly, it suggested adding injury time when debates in Standing Committee, in particular, were seriously disrupted by Divisions in the House. The Government rejected both recommendations. As a Chairman of a Standing Committee, I recognise their value. Will there be a rethink on those two suggestions?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o96"><a name="60124-05_spnew9"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 The Government do not intend to revisit those matters. They were looked at relatively recently and, as I have said, the volume of representations in recent months has not been 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1302</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>particularly high on this issue, as others have focused on more important aspects of House procedures. However, my right hon. Friend and I have listened and we hear what my hon. Friend says; we keep an open mind on possible improvements. We have to be aware, however, as the House does, of unforeseen consequences, and the Government of the day have to get their business through in an orderly manner.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o97"><a name="60124-05_spnew10"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome)</b> 
 (LD): We all know that consideration of a Bill, especially on Report, is often restricted, and that important groups of amendments are not considered, to the detriment of Back-Bench Members who may wish to raise a particular issue. We also know that there are days and sometimes weeks in which we seem to spend an awful lot of time accomplishing very little in terms of parliamentary debate. Is not it time to look again at setting up an all-party business committee to look sanely at the business of the House not only in the immediate future but over the full parliamentary calendar year?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o98"><a name="60124-05_spnew11"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 I would welcome nothing more than an all-party committee that looked sanely, to use the hon. Member&#039;s words, at the matter. Unfortunately, in my experience of 18&nbsp;years in the House, the lack of sanity on such matters is all too much in evidence. I am sorry to say that one of the reasons why there does not appear to be progress, or that discussion seems to focus around arcane issues during proceedings on a Bill, is that some hon. Members want to delay progress. In turn, that avoids getting on to clauses that hon. Members on both sides would like to debate. We live in an imperfect world, Mr. Speaker.

<p><a name="st_o99"><a name="60124-05_spmin2"><b>The Deputy Leader of the House of Commons  (Nigel Griffiths): </b> 
 We have been considering closely the proposals the Modernisation Committee made in the previous Session on scrutiny of European business. We hope to bring forward ideas for taking this issue further.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o100"><a name="60124-05_spnew12"><b> Mr. Borrow: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for those comments. May I put a suggestion to him for something that he could do straight away? On too many occasions, items referred by the European Scrutiny Committee to the European Standing Committee have been timed to coincide with a meeting of the European Scrutiny Committee. Will he ensure that that does not happen in future so that members of the European Scrutiny Committee who are interested in a particular item can be present for the debate in the European Standing Committee?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o101"><a name="60124-05_spnew13"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 I have considerable sympathy with that point, which has also been raised by other hon. Members. I have considered the issue and I do not believe that there is an easy solution, which is why I cannot, I am sorry to say, give him the assurance that he seeks. I say that precisely because there are a substantial number of both Standing and Select Committees, but 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1303</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>only a finite number of sitting days and hours when it is convenient to meet. Occasionally, there will be the sort of unfortunate clash that my hon. Friend has highlighted. If that can be avoided, business managers do avoid it, and I will certainly draw my hon. Friend&#039;s remarks to their attention. I can promise to do no more than that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o102"><a name="60124-05_spnew14"><b> Mrs. Theresa May  (Maidenhead)</b> 
 (Con): The overall issue of the scrutiny of legislation referred to by the hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow) is important. I note the comments made by the Deputy Leader of the House that the Government will bring forward proposals in due course, but I hope that he agrees that one of the key issues is the House&#039;s ability to scrutinise legislation at an early opportunity before Ministers make decisions in the Council of Ministers. Will he assure the House that that is one of the key issues that the Government will consider and that their proposals will address it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o103"><a name="60124-05_spnew15"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 Of course it is vital that as many hon. Members as possible consider legislation at as early a stage as possible. I remind the right hon. Member that MEPs also have a role to play in this. Given the chaos that there appears to be in Europe in her party, perhaps she can tell the House which group her MEPs are going to join so that they can inform this process. We on the Labour Benches will do our best to make sure that there is proper scrutiny by this House, but there cannot be proper scrutiny by Conservative MEPs as long as we do not know which group they are in or are allying themselves to.

<p><a name="st_o105"><a name="60124-06_spnew1"><b> Julie Morgan: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that reply. May I urge him to take up the issue again and to make a special effort to see whether it is possible to provide child care facilities, perhaps in partnership with the local authority or with nearby neighbours? When I became a Member in 1997&nbsp;I never imagined that nine years later, and after such an influx of women MPs, we

</p>








<p><a name="st_o106"><a name="60124-06_spnew2"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 The Commission did consider the proposal for a child care facility based in the House two years ago, but considered that more flexibility would be provided by a child care voucher system. Many staff of the House come from outer-London boroughs or even beyond Greater London and receive greater benefit from a voucher system that enables them to use child care facilities nearer to home. The voucher system also benefits Members&#039; staff working in constituencies. Nearly 150&nbsp;people take advantage of the scheme, and the Commission felt that it offered more flexibility than something based here.

<a name="60124-06_head0"><h3 align=center>Welfare Reform Green Paper</h3>

<a name="time_0">
<a name="60124-06_time0"><h5>3.32&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60124-06_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr.&nbsp;John Hutton): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement on the Government&#039;s Green Paper, &quot;A new deal for welfare: Empowering people to work&quot;. After eight years of a Labour Government, there are now 2.3&nbsp;million more people in work. There are 1&nbsp;million fewer people on benefits. Some 2&nbsp;million children and almost 2&nbsp;million pensioners no longer live in poverty.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Since 1997, we have worked to build a modern, active welfare state. Through the minimum wage and tax credits, we have made work pay. Through record investment in the new deal and Jobcentre Plus, we are creating an enabling welfare state that responds to the needs of individuals. All that contrasts with the record of the Conservative party. Eighteen years of economic mismanagement and welfare failure resulted in 3&nbsp;million more people of working age on benefit. Unemployment went up 50&nbsp;per cent. The numbers claiming incapacity benefit trebled as it was used to hide mass long-term unemployment, and 3&nbsp;million more children were left to live in poverty. It is time now finally to bring that shameful legacy of Thatcherism to an end. That is why ensuring that people have the right to work must be a fundamental responsibility of any modern Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Work is good for people. Work can be the bedrock of personal responsibility, dignity and well-being. The challenge that we face today is how to build a modern welfare state that allows people to exercise the right to work when our national economy is changing more rapidly than at any time since the industrial revolution. It is not only our economy that is changing. We are confronted by a rapidly ageing society and a falling birth rate. Soon, and for the first time in our history, there will be more people over the age of 80&nbsp;than under the age of five, so our welfare state must continue to adapt to meet those challenges.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">We have set ourselves the ambitious goal of an 80&nbsp;per cent. employment rate. Its achievement will be critical for our nation: for individuals, for families and communities, for the process of wealth creation, for economic competitiveness and for social justice. I do not underestimate the scale of meeting that challenge. It will mean a million fewer people claiming incapacity benefit, a million more older people in work and 300,000&nbsp;lone parents off benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The proposals that we are putting before the House today will make a significant contribution to realising those ambitions. Today&#039;s Green Paper builds on reforms that we have already introduced to remove the remaining barriers that hold people back from work. Our approach is based on a belief in an active welfare state that balances rights with responsibilities, and that provides work for those who can and support for those who cannot. Our proposals will be fair to claimants and fair to taxpayers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">We will reform incapacity benefit. Nine out of 10&nbsp;people who come on to incapacity benefit expect to get back into work, but if people have been on incapacity benefit for more than two years, they are more likely to retire or to die than ever to get another job. That cannot be right. The circumstances of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1306</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>claimants are changing, too. No longer is incapacity benefit associated with only Britain&#039;s industrial heartlands. There are more people on incapacity benefits in the south-east than in the north-east, and there are at least 150,000&nbsp;people on incapacity benefit in every region in the UK. A third of new claimants now cite mental health problems as the main reason for coming on to the benefit, compared with a fifth in 1997. The issue affects all the country, not just parts of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">We have already made a start. The combination of increased support through the new deal for disabled people and the extension of rights through the Disability Discrimination Acts has started to improve the opportunities available to disabled people. Building on those reforms, our strategy is threefold. We will act to reduce the number of new claimants. We will provide greater help for those on the benefit to return to work. For the most severely sick and disabled, we will provide even more support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The Green Paper sets out proposals to improve workplace health. General practitioners have an important role to play in helping to ensure that their patients are able to work, so we will test the impact of putting employment advisers in GP surgeries. The first of those will be in place within a month. We will work with GPs and primary care professionals to support individuals to remain in work or return to work, and we will reform statutory sick pay to simplify it and ensure that it helps people to stay in work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">We will reform the medical test, which acts as the gateway to incapacity benefit. We must ensure that the assessment process is focused on people&#039;s potential capability and capacity to engage in the labour market, rather than just their incapacity. Central to that will be the reform of the exempt category in the existing benefit structure. We must ensure that it no longer writes people off simply because they have a particular condition. For example, if people are blind, the current benefit structure assumes that they will always be incapable of work. That is wrong and unfair. We will correct it by reforming the criteria for exemptions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">In future, all claimants will be assessed to determine not just their eligibility for benefit, but also their capability to work. I recognise the sensitivity and, of course, importance of getting this crucial aspect of the reforms right, and we will consult on that and other issues to ensure that we take a fair and equitable approach. We will also review the mental health component of the test.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">In addition to reforming the gateway, we will also reform the benefit itself. From 2008, new claimants will receive a new employment and support allowance, replacing the current system of incapacity benefits. The perverse incentives in the current system will be removed. Unlike today, no one will be eligible for the benefit until they have completed the proper medical assessments. Claimants will no longer receive more the longer they claim.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">For those who are exempt, the new benefit will be paid at a rate higher than the long-term rate today. As now, they will be able to take up support if they want to, but it will not be a condition of their benefit. However, for the vast majority&#151;those who will not be exempt&#151;the new benefit will have a clear framework of rights and, yes, responsibilities. People will be required to attend 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1307</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>regular interviews, complete action plans and engage in work-related activity. The level of benefit they receive will be above the current long-term rate of incapacity benefit, but those refusing to engage in the help and support offered could see their benefit reduced progressively in stages, to the level of jobseeker&#039;s allowance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">Existing claimants will remain on their existing benefit, which will be protected. Over the next few years, we will ask existing claimants to attend a work-focused interview and agree an action plan to take steps to return to work. Those who do not engage will, as now, potentially see their benefit reduced. That process of re-engagement has already started, but we can only ask more of people if the help and support that they need is in place. Our pathways to work pilots&#151;combining employment and health support&#151;have already shown significant success in getting people off benefit and back into employment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">I can confirm that over the next two years we will be investing a further &#163;360&nbsp;million, from within my existing resources&#151;from my own budget&#151;to extend pathways to work to every part of Britain by 2008. For the first time, as a result of that investment, we will bring new hope and opportunity to some of the most disadvantaged communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">I am confident that the reforms outlined today will move us significantly closer to our goal of an 80&nbsp;per cent. employment rate and the realisation of that vision. I believe that if we take the measures that I have outlined, and work together with health professionals, local authorities and employers, we can get 1&nbsp;million people off incapacity benefit within a decade. In doing so, we could ultimately save up to &#163;7&nbsp;billion a year for taxpayers. That should be the scale of our ambition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">We also need to do more to help lone parents to get back into work. Today, 56&nbsp;per cent. of lone parents are back in work compared with only 45&nbsp;per cent. eight years ago. We know that many lone parents want to work but face barriers to returning to the workplace. That is why we have extended support through the new deals and our 10-year child care strategy. Building on those reforms, we will increase the number of interviews lone parents are expected to attend. We will require those whose youngest child is at least 11&nbsp;to attend interviews every three months, alongside piloting a new premium so that lone parents are better off if they take serious steps towards preparing for work. Those with younger children will have to attend twice a year, compared with once a year now. We will pilot more intensive support for lone parents during the first year of their claim and we will also simplify the rules so that lone parents are not penalised for joining work experience programmes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">A key part of our strategy is to ensure that many more older people are able to remain in work for longer. I have spoken about the challenges of an ageing society. The Green Paper sets out proposals to extend all aspects of the new deal 25-plus to the over 50s. We will improve the back-to-work support for JSA claimants and their partners who are over 50, and will work with employers to extend flexible working opportunities to older workers. The Green Paper also sets out our plans to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1308</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>simplify the existing housing benefit system to improve work incentives and encourage personal responsibility for housing choices.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">The Green Paper sets out a challenging goal&#151;one that central Government acting on their own cannot meet. Instead, we will need to engage those in the public, private and voluntary sectors in a new mission to improve employment opportunities in our disadvantaged areas. Moreover, there is a crucial role for local community leaders. Tackling worklessness can be achieved only if we work with partners in the local community&#151;including the private and voluntary sectors&#151;and harness their energy and commitment to deliver real progress. Some of our biggest cities in particular have a disproportionate number of benefit claimants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">I am committed to opening a new chapter in the evolution of our modern welfare state. Local leaders will be asked to bring together local employment, training and health providers to help tackle concentrations of worklessness. They will be able to ask for greater flexibilities over the use of existing funding. In return, I will ensure that local communities share in the rewards of reducing the number of benefit claimants. For successful bids, I will provide seedcorn funding, and provide outcome payments when they meet their goals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-06_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">The publication of our proposals today will start a three-month consultation process. We will engage with and listen carefully to all who respond&#151;to everyone who shares our commitment to improving the employment prospects of those currently living on benefit. The proposals will help build a modern welfare state that responds to individual need, balances rights with responsibilities, tackles poverty and disadvantage, and invests for the long term.
</p>

While the Labour Government have done &quot;sweet nothing&quot;, total numbers claiming incapacity benefit have gone up, the numbers claiming for more than five years have gone up, the number of young people under 25&nbsp;claiming has gone up by 70&nbsp;per cent., and the number of people claiming on the grounds of mental and behavioural problems has doubled. So we will take no lectures on legacies from the right hon. Gentleman. The test of this Secretary of State will be whether he at last can start to deliver where his predecessors failed to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_24">Unfortunately for the Secretary of State, his plans are presented against a backdrop of a slowing economy, steadily rising unemployment and an unprecedented funding crisis in NHS trusts, all of which will make it much harder now than it would have been a couple of years ago to achieve the laudable objectives of rehabilitating people and then getting them back into work.

<a name="stpa_25">We have not yet had time to analyse the Green Paper in detail, but we have heard enough to identify some of the key areas where we will want to satisfy ourselves that the small print matches the headline rhetoric. Reform of the system so that it delivers a focus on what people can do, rather than what they cannot do, will require changes to the personal capability assessment, as the Secretary of State said. It will also require a change in the mindset of the tens of thousands of people who administer the system. Can the right hon. Gentleman tell the House how the personal capability assessment will be reformed, in particular, to make what is still primarily a physical capacity test more responsive to the high levels of mental illness among claimants?

</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_26">Effective early intervention in respect of new claimants is the key to catching them before they become trapped in benefit dependency. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that prompt and early medical assessment, coupled with the availability of rehabilitation resources, is the key? How will those resources be delivered, given the pressure that primary care trusts are under? Will he buy in NHS services with Department for Work and Pensions funding, or will he buy in rehabilitation services from providers in the private sector? Can he assure the House that he does have, somewhere in his locker, a more subtle approach to the vital question of engaging GPs in the early intervention process than that of offering them cash inducements?

<br>&nbsp;<br>new claimants, but if the new focus is the right one it would be a betrayal both of those who are already on incapacity benefit and of the taxpayers funding them not to apply the same work-oriented approach to them. Off-flow rates have decreased by a third since 1997; will he set himself a specific target for getting current incapacity benefit claimants back into work?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_28">A couple of weeks ago, the right hon. Gentleman identified 100&nbsp;constituencies with the highest concentration of incapacity benefit claimants, which we cross-correlated with job vacancy figures. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that those constituencies have very few job vacancies&#151;in fact, there are only a quarter as many job vacancies as there are incapacity benefit claimants. Does he recognise that in those areas simply refocusing and retraining people to exploit the skills and abilities that they have will not necessarily result in their finding work? How will he deal with the geographical mismatch of work opportunities and incapacity benefit claimants?

<a name="60124-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_29">Can the Secretary of State guarantee some concrete and effective measures that will ensure that private and voluntary sector organisations can compete on a level playing field with public sector organisations? The evidence for the contribution that they can make is clear in the results of the new deal for disabled people&#151;a programme that has been substantially delivered by private and voluntary sector contractors&#151;but the National Audit Office report shows that the playing field is still tilted against private and voluntary sector organisations when contracts are placed. Only if that bias is removed can such organisations play their full role&#151;the role that the right hon. Gentleman says he wants them to play. What specifically is he doing to deal with that matter and is he willing to spend some of his political capital standing up to those who will no doubt fight tooth and nail to preserve the predominance of public sector provision in this area?

 May I start by welcoming the hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentleman&#039;s commitment to work with the Government to bring about these important reforms? I welcome his support and his recognition that incapacity benefit has failed millions of people. Most Labour Members would probably prefer the Conservatives to have done something about it when they had 18&nbsp;years in government. <i>[Interruption.]</i> As many of us can testify, no such measures were taken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-07_para14">
<a name="stpa_34">The hon. Gentleman referred to the record of the present Government, and his hon. Friends have been shouting rudely about it. Incapacity benefit numbers fell last year for the first time ever in the history of incapacity benefit. The numbers coming on to incapacity benefit are down by a third, so the argument that no progress has been made is totally untrue. We are making progress. The reforms will allow us to make further progress still.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-07_para15">
<a name="stpa_35">The hon. Gentleman spoke about the position in the labour market. I remind him that we have in the UK now the highest employment rate of all the countries in the G8, something never achieved under the Conservative Government. We remember their record on unemployment. I do not want to say any more about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-07_para16">
<a name="stpa_36">The hon. Gentleman asked me how the personal capabilities assessment will be reformed. We say in the Green Paper, and I am sorry if I did not make it clear today, that we will be convening an expert group to work with the Department to undertake that reform of the medical procedures. It is important that we do that. We want to build consensus around the new system. That is very important for the success of the reforms, for various reasons. People must have confidence that the assessments are right, and we will work with the disability movement to make sure that that is true.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-07_para17">
<a name="stpa_37">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that prevention is the best tactic that we should deploy to prevent people from coming on to benefits in the first place. The Green Paper contains a series of measures&#151;I did not go through all of them this afternoon&#151;which will make a significant difference, including supporting greater investment in occupational health. I hope the hon. Gentleman will welcome that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-07_para18">
<a name="stpa_38">Where will the health care providers come from? They will come from the NHS and some will come from the private sector. I was in Derby recently and saw at first hand a hugely successful strategy of involving cognitive behavioural therapists employed from the private sector to provide services for people on incapacity benefit.

<p>
<a name="60124-07_para19">
<a name="stpa_39">I can confirm that existing incapacity benefit claimants will have access to the pathways to work extensions. The hon.

Of course, all the work that we do between now and 2008&#151;I think it will be 2008&nbsp;when we have legislated for the new benefit and got the system in place&#151;will, by definition, have to be with

<p>
<a name="60124-07_para20">
<a name="stpa_40">On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about vacancies, I saw his figures, as have hon. Members on both sides of the House. I make two comments about his figures and his analysis. First, Jobcentre Plus holds only about a third of the total number of vacancies in the country at any one moment in time. His figures were based on Jobcentre Plus vacancies. We need to bear that in mind. Secondly, as we all know, some of our constituents work in other constituencies where there might be more vacancies. It is true that that happens, but I do not think that the hon. Gentleman recognised that.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-07_para21">
<a name="stpa_41">We envisage the private and voluntary sectors being very much involved in the pathways to work projects across the country, because we know that if we get the contractual frameworks right and choose our partners correctly, the voluntary sector will be able to make a hugely important contribution to improving the service that we offer. It is true that these reforms will require significant investment. It is equally true to say that we are the first Government ever who have been prepared to stand here and say that we will make that investment to get people with a disability back into work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-07_para22">
<a name="stpa_42">The hon. Gentleman&#039;s final question was about whether we would count people on the new employment and support allowance as unemployed. No, we will not, for one very obvious reason, which I am surprised that he did not recognise. To count as being unemployed, a person has to be available immediately to take up employment. The very notion here is that we are dealing with people with a measure of illness and incapacity, and we will work with them. We are not going to apply the full jobseeker&#039;s allowance conditionality regime to people on incapacity benefit; it would be wrong to do so.

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his very encouraging and positive statement. Does he agree that all those on incapacity benefit have a civil right to work, just as anybody else does? Does he also agree that the state&#039;s role should be to remove any barriers that are preventing those people from taking up employment and escaping from poverty? We still have a major problem in this country because too many employers discriminate against disabled people. Will my right hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>work programme&#151;into which we are putting about &#163;60&nbsp;million. That programme helps people on incapacity benefit who are going back into the world of work to make the necessary adjustments. Sometimes that could involve adjustments to the physical environment in their workplace. We will continue to offer that help, and to emphasise that support. There are also provisions in disability discrimination legislation to require employers to make reasonable adjustments in the workplace. That will be very important. We are also working with a significant network of employers, through the employers coalitions. For example, many big, significant employers are working with Jobcentre Plus to ensure that there are vacancies for people with a disability, which is crucial. The proposals that I have outlined today will help in all these areas, and I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to support them.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60124-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Laws  (Yeovil) (LD):</b> 
 May I also thank the Secretary of State for giving me advance sight of his statement? We share with him the ambition of seeking to help people with disabilities back into work and ensuring that the benefit system and our training systems are designed to help them. The Secretary of State has rightly set a very ambitious target for the reduction of the number of people on incapacity benefit by 1&nbsp;million over the next 10&nbsp;years. Does he agree, however, that even if he achieves that, it will take the level of people on incapacity back down only to the 1991&nbsp;level, which was itself double the level that was inherited in 1979? There is therefore a long way to go, even if the target of 1&nbsp;million is achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_45">I want to ask the Secretary of State some specific questions about the reform of incapacity benefit. Does he accept that delivering tailored support for people with diverse medical conditions is going to be quite expensive? Is he confident that he has the resources to do that, against the background of a decline in Jobcentre Plus staff of some 20,000&#151;almost one in four&#151;employees between 2002&nbsp;and 2008?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_46">The Secretary of State spoke of an extra &#163;360&nbsp;million over the next two years.

Has there been any contraction of expenditure per person to make this scheme possible?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_47">May I ask about changes in the benefit system? Has there been any extension of means-testing that is implicit in the new employment and support allowance? That is not clear from the Green Paper, and it would be helpful to have it on the record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_48">Does the Secretary of State plan to take further action to make the benefit system more accessible to those who can work only for limited periods?

<a name="stpa_49">Safeguards are vital for some of the groups whom we are discussing.

We have already announced changes in the linking rules, extending the 52-week period of grace allowing people leaving incapacity benefit to test whether a new job works for them to two years.

 May I tell my right hon. Friend as a GP that, by the time someone has been off work for six months, say, with a bad back, their chances of getting back to work are disappointingly low? Therefore, the real challenge is to prevent people needing incapacity benefit in the first place. I am particularly pleased by his statement that he wants to introduce employment advisers into primary care services, which is extremely welcome and overdue. Will he ensure that those advisers will be involved with the patient from the moment they are off sick, so that we can reduce the amount of time that they are off sick, and they go back to work before they get anywhere near incapacity benefit?
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="60124-09_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his comments. We should wait to see what the employment advisers can do for patients in primary care trusts. I am confident that they will be able to make a significant difference and provide more choice for people, rather than people being presented just with the unpalatable prospect of being signed off and going on to benefit. We should be able to do more for people in that situation. I hope that the other potential spin-off benefit of putting employment advisers into GP practices will be to relieve some of the pressure and work load on GPs themselves.

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="60124-09_spnew11"><b> Angela Browning  (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con):</b> 
 The Secretary of State has repeatedly referred to getting people back into work, but how will he deal with the group of people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who have never been in paid employment? I am talking about people with lifelong disabilities such as autistic spectrum disorder, chronic mental health conditions and learning disabilities. Is he going to have a special package for them, because to put them through the same process as someone with a back injury would be wrong? They need much more specialised assistance. I would welcome it if some got the opportunity to get into work, but that will not be easy. It will require a lot of resources. Will he bear it in mind that many of them have undertaken independent living and that maintaining independent living and not being overburdened with paid employment will require a lot of flexible packages? 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1318</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Perhaps they can work part-time&#151;even a quarter of a week, not necessarily half of it&#151;in order that independent living remains viable.
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="60124-09_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I pay tribute to the hon. Lady&#039;s extensive knowledge and experience in this area. I would be happy to discuss with her any of those ideas in more detail. That is right and proper. The whole point of the reforms is to try to personalise and individualise as much of the support and help that we provide to people on incapacity benefits as we can. I do not think that a one-size-fits-all approach would be right. I indicated in response to other questions that we are prepared to look at some of the alternatives to encourage part-time work. Nothing in the proposals affects the issue of disability living allowance. We are not proposing any changes to that. I understand that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health will outline shortly further proposals in relation to individual budgets, which I know that the hon. Lady follows with some interest. I hope that that will provide greater choice and flexibility, to which she has referred.
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60124-09_spnew13"><b> Mr. Michael Meacher  (Oldham, West and Royton) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my right hon. Friend recognise that there are considerable differences between north and south? The percentage of working-age adults claiming incapacity benefit, for example, in Merseyside, south Wales and the north-east is six to 10&nbsp;times higher than in the south-east. We all know that the previous Conservative Government shifted probably over 1&nbsp;million people off unemployment benefit on to incapacity benefit to get the unemployment figures down. Does that not suggest that we cannot solve this problem purely by getting tough on incapacity benefit? It can be solved only in conjunction with a much tougher regional industrial strategy to increase employment opportunities in areas of persistent high unemployment.

<p><a name="st_24"><a name="60124-10_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I largely agree with my right hon. Friend. This is not a punitive package of measures; I think that that is clear, and I hope that he is clear about it. The challenge for us on the Government side of the House is to develop proposals that are radical and have that far-reaching effect, but are not characterised by the label &quot;punitive&quot;. I do not believe that that would work. I agree with my right hon. Friend that if we are to succeed in moving people from incapacity benefit towards the opportunity of taking up employment, we shall need a dynamic local labour market and a strong national economy&#151;and I am confident that if the Labour Government continue with the way in which they have managed the economy, we shall achieve that goal as well.

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60124-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mike Weir  (Angus) (SNP):</b> 
 The Secretary of State has mentioned rolling out pathways to work throughout the UK by 2008. Many disability groups have expressed concern about whether the scheme covering the whole country will be of the same quality as the undoubtedly successful pilot schemes. Can the right hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="60124-10_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The national roll-out of pathways to work will certainly be focused on ensuring quality, and outcomes for people who are disabled. I can give the hon. Gentleman that absolute assurance.

 I welcome the statement, as the pathways to work project in my constituency, organised largely through the Shaw Trust, has been incredibly successful. How will the changes to housing benefit affect young people who have had difficult relationships and family breakdown and have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ended up in voluntary housing settings such as Ty&nbsp;Cornel in the Porthcawl area, and those in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), in the Yellow project in Maesteg? They need to get back into education so that they can move forward, but they cannot then access housing benefit, because they are past the statutory breakdown age. Will we allow young people to stay in education and still be able to access housing benefit?
</p>








<p><a name="st_28"><a name="60124-10_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The education maintenance allowance has, I hope, been an important contribution to securing what my hon. Friend is concerned about. The chapter in the Green Paper dealing with the reform of housing benefit makes it clear that the local housing allowance that we propose to replace housing benefit in the private rented sector will be available for new claimants. People who are currently claiming housing benefit will stay under the existing rules.

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60124-10_spnew5"><b> Peter Law  (Blaenau Gwent) (Ind):</b> 
 Coming from south Wales, from a very depressed constituency, as I do, I ask the Secretary of State how he can justify these&nbsp;proposals. How can a Labour Government justify proposals that will put poor people further down in the poverty trap? That is a disgrace, and something that the Labour party will feel very ashamed of.
</p>








<p><a name="st_30"><a name="60124-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I can only assume that the hon. Gentleman has not read the Green Paper, because we are not cutting incapacity benefit for existing claimants. We will introduce a more generous employment and support allowance in 2008, and we are providing more help and support for his constituents. I am utterly astonished that he has not had the good grace to recognise that today.
</p>








<p><a name="st_31"><a name="60124-10_spnew7"><b> Roger Berry  (Kingswood) (Lab):</b> 
 Obviously, we shall all want to look at the details in the Green Paper, but in view of previous debates on incapacity benefits in this House and elsewhere, I warmly welcome my right hon. Friend&#039;s very positive statement, particularly the speedy national roll-out of pathways to work, which is about recognising the barriers that disabled people face and taking the actions necessary to remove those barriers. Does my right hon. Friend agree that one of the key essentials is to ensure that those responsible for giving support and advice to benefit claimants have the skills and the resources to do their job properly? Without that, there is a great danger that this magnificent way of dealing with the problem might not be as effective as would otherwise be the case.
</p>








<p><a name="st_32"><a name="60124-10_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is exactly right and I pay tribute to his work in this area. It is very important that we invest in our disability employment advisers to make sure that they have the skills and expertise and, yes, the resources to do the jobs that we want them to do. As he knows, as part of the changes that we are making to Jobcentre Plus, we are trying to shift more people from

<br>&nbsp;<br>the back office into the front office, in order that they can do the front-of-house work that needs to be done with benefit claimants directly. I hope that that will make a difference and ensure that the quality of advice that people receive is as good as it should be.

 This Green Paper has the very general title of &quot;A new deal for welfare&quot;, so why does it not tackle the main feature of the Government&#039;s welfare policies in the past eight years, which is the vast extension of means-testing? Does the Secretary of State agree that the means-tested society that we have created is not only incredibly bureaucratic, but creates severe disincentives to long-term saving and self-reliance? When is he going to reform that aspect of his policies?
</p>








<p><a name="st_34"><a name="60124-10_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 In any welfare system, it is important&#151;the right hon. Gentleman will not want to argue against this&#151;to target specific and additional help on the poorest people in society. I make no apology for the fact that, through tax credits, the pension credit and other initiatives that we have introduced, we have lifted literally millions of our fellow citizens out of poverty altogether. That is a record of solid achievement that all Labour Members are proud of. These reforms are about incapacity benefit, older people and lone parents; that is the focus of the Green Paper, and I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will benefit from a thoroughly good read of it.

 There will perhaps be a collective sigh of relief following the Green Paper&#039;s publication today. At long last, we have something to discuss, and I am sure that disabled organisations will engage with the Secretary of State and his Department and debate these proposals. There will also be a sigh of relief at the fact that many of the scare stories running in the press about how punitive the Government were going to be seem not to have been fulfilled; that said, we shall have to look at the detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_57">Will the Secretary of State assure me that any new benefit that he puts in place will not contain the structural barriers associated with incapacity benefit, which puts obstacles in the way of disabled people and makes it very difficult for them to get work?

</p>








<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60124-10_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Yes, I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. The reforms that we are making are designed to take out the perverse incentives in the current system, and to provide more help and support. We want to develop these proposals over the next few months in dialogue and consultation with the widest possible cross-section of organisations with an interest in these matters, in order to ensure that we can design out, at the beginning of this process, any change that might have the consequences referred to by my hon.

 The one thing that worries me is the position of older people&#151;particularly those who have worked all their life in heavy industry&#151;who, when they reach the age of 62&nbsp;or 63, go on to incapacity benefit. The last time that such a change was introduced, officers of the then Department of Health and Social Security were given targets, which they had to meet. Of course, the first people whom they went for were those who had worked all their life in heavy industry, who sustained many injuries in doing so. Will there be targets this time?

 No, there will be no targets. We are not going to follow that approach. It would be disreputable to go about reforming incapacity benefit in that way, but we are not going to write off people who happen to be of a certain age. We must look carefully at the support that we provide for older people. In many parts of the country, although perhaps not in my hon. Friend&#039;s area, people are choosing to work longer, if possible. A modern, proper welfare state must provide employment support for people, irrespective of their age.

<a name="stpa_60">The numbers are staggering. According to the most recent figures revealed by the Government, pensioners miss out each year on a cut to their council tax bill worth an average &#163;426. Four pensioners out of 10&nbsp;miss out on the total of &#163;750&nbsp;million in council tax benefit that goes unclaimed each year, and fewer than half of all home-owning pensioners claim the money that they should get. The money is like a lottery ticket that has fallen behind the sofa.

Yet council tax benefit worth 750&nbsp;times the value of the winning lottery ticket is unclaimed every week, every month, every year. Why? The money goes unclaimed because the onus is on pensioners to claim it. Yet most do not know they are owed it. The Government say that pensioners can call up the Department for Work and Pensions or visit it or go online. But why would they, if they do not know that they are owed almost &#163;500&nbsp;a year?

The Government should be obliged to make claiming as straightforward as possible to enable pensioners to claim the missing &#163;750&nbsp;million. If one owns one&#039;s own home, one qualifies, but there is no box on the council tax bill that one can tick. There should be. If one receives pension credit, one qualifies, but there is no box to tick on that paperwork for council tax relief. There should be. It is a scandal that some of the people who most need the Government&#039;s help are being left to second-guess the system. What makes it a scandal is not that the money is not there or that Ministers do not want to give it away, but simply that no one seems to agree on how it should be given back.

<p><a name="st_91"><a name="60124-12_spnew1"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Indeed it does. We were discussing the group of amendments beginning with No. 180, and I was talking about the proposal in the amendment that would require a two-thirds majority before any Order in Council process could begin. I was saying that the Order in Council process is one that is completely different from the Order in Council that would introduce a referendum on primary powers for the Assembly. It is a completely and utterly different order. An Order in Council, for example, that would have brought in the legislation that would have enabled the Assembly to consider the legislation on the public administration ombudsman or transport in Wales would be very different.

<a name="time_4">

</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_79">I wish to remind the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) of the situation when parties present their manifestos at election time. If the Welsh Assembly Government that is formed in 2007&nbsp;is elected on the basis of a manifesto commitment and if that commitment needs new legislation to be delivered, it would be a clear basis for a proposed Order in Council to enable the Assembly to legislate on that matter. With the electoral arrangements that we have for the National Assembly for Wales, it is unlikely that the ruling group or party would have a two-thirds majority. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s proposal would mean that a party or group of parties, having fought an election on a proposal, would not be able to legislate for that proposal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_80">Even when no specific manifesto commitment is involved, such a request will not come out of the blue. To take the transport example that I mentioned earlier, I placed in the Library the Order in Council example with its explanatory memorandum. Before the draft Bill came before the House, we had a full report by the relevant Assembly subject Committee, which led to the conclusion that the Assembly needed further powers to enable it to play a more effective strategic role in transport in Wales. Opposition Members should recognise the fact that the Assembly, as a democratic institution, has an open process for debating and developing policy, as does the Welsh Assembly Government. The requirement for a two-thirds majority before an Order in Council could be introduced is wholly disproportionate.
</p>

<a name="60124-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_81">Amendments Nos. 187&nbsp;and 212&nbsp;address an important issue that has been mentioned by right hon. and hon. Members, especially my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). On Second Reading and on several other occasions, he raised the issue of pre-legislative scrutiny and how it will be carried out. I recognise the importance of pre-legislative scrutiny in the proposal for Orders in Council. Several interventions have been made on that point and I am 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1329</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>grateful for the many suggestions that have been made as to how that process could be conducted, including the proposals in amendment No. 187.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_82">I should say immediately that I do not think that it is right that the Government should prescribe in the Bill how such scrutiny must be conducted, but that is what amendment No. 187&nbsp;suggests. That would not allow parliamentarians the proper discretion to determine the most appropriate arrangements. However, in my letter to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) of 17&nbsp;January, which was circulated and placed in the Library, and which covered the illustrative examples of Orders in Council, I outlined the normal procedure that I envisaged for scrutiny of such proposals. It may be helpful if I run through them again for the benefit of the Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_83">When the Assembly has a proposal, it will discuss it with the UK Government. If broad agreement were reached, the Assembly would produce a proposed draft Order in Council&#151;this is the difference between what is set out in amendment No. 187&nbsp;and what I propose in my letter. The proposed draft Order in Council would be accompanied by an explanatory memorandum, as is shown in the examples attached to the letter. It is worth pointing out that the proposed draft Order in Council could be amended, which would mean that more weight would be given to pre-legislative scrutiny than would be the case if the process of scrutiny did not allow amendments to be made, which I understand is what is set out in amendment No. 187.

<p><a name="st_93"><a name="60124-13_spnew1"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Let me continue to go through the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_84">The Secretary of State would forward the proposed Order in Council to the appropriate parliamentary body&#151;for example, the Welsh Affairs Committee&#151;in the same way as is the case when draft Bills receive pre-legislative scrutiny. It would be open for any other Select Committee to scrutinise the proposal. When draft Bills receive pre-legislative scrutiny, the Wales Office announces that the public may give their views and, if they wish, contact their Member of Parliament, who may wish to contribute to the process. Pre-legislative scrutiny would thus not be restricted to Members of the House because members of the public could contribute their views.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_85">The practice of joint scrutiny between the Welsh Affairs Committee and Assembly Committees has worked well in the past. Depending on the type of Order in Council, the Welsh Affairs Committee could choose to continue with that arrangement, or decide to examine the proposal separately. That would be a matter for the Committee, but such a process would assist in gathering the widest possible input into the consideration of the proposal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_86">I did not mention this in my letter, but as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of draft Bills, reports of the Welsh Affairs Committee have regularly been debated in the Welsh Grand Committee. I have noted the thoughts of my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen about that. We would encourage such debates on proposed Orders in Council. If it were felt that such 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1330</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a debate in the Welsh Grand Committee would help the process, we certainly would not put any obstacles in the way of that. I also agree that it is important that all hon. Members have the opportunity to comment on a proposed draft Order in Council, to ask questions about its scope and to propose ways in which amendments could be made.
</p>








<p><a name="st_94"><a name="60124-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. Roger Williams  (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD):</b> 
 Has the Minister made any assessment of how many Orders in Council might have been brought forward in any specific year, such as during the previous year? We must consider not only Wales-only legislation, but the Welsh elements of England and Wales Bills. The Childcare Bill is going through the House at the moment. Would that require a separate Order in Council? If so, how many times would the Welsh Grand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee need to meet to consider all the Orders in Council?
</p>








<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60124-13_spnew3"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 It is difficult to give a totally accurate prediction of how many Orders in Council will come through. Orders in Council would not be required for primary legislation because the arrangements under which primary legislation gives secondary legislative powers to the Assembly would continue. It would be for Parliament to decide whether it was happy for such powers to be passed on, as is the case at the moment. I do not envisage that the number of proposals for Assembly Measures would be much greater than the number of requests for primary legislation that come through at present. However, the First Minister said that he would be surprised if there were more than five or six a year. I hope that that is helpful.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_87">On the scrutiny and involvement of all hon. Members, my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen asked whether it was possible for those who are not members of the Welsh Grand Committee to attend its debates. Again, we cannot dictate to the House what should happen. That is for the House to decide under its Standing Orders. However, I am sure that if a good case were made for an amendment to the Standing Orders&#151;perhaps to consider a particular Order in Council or Orders in Council in general&#151;the House could change its Standing Orders to widen the membership.
</p>








<p><a name="st_96"><a name="60124-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Alan Williams  (Swansea, West) (Lab):</b> 
 Would the Minister support such an application?
</p>








<p><a name="st_97"><a name="60124-13_spnew5"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 I would have no problem with that. In addition, there is nothing to prevent a report by the Welsh Affairs Committee on a particular Order in Council from being debated in Westminster Hall. Again, hon. Members could make a contribution in that way, which would be open to everyone. That is an alternative to the Welsh Grand Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_88">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield asked how Orders in Council would be amended. Once pre-legislative scrutiny is complete, reports will have been produced by the Welsh Affairs Committee. The Welsh Assembly might also have produced a report, and there may well be minutes of the Welsh Affairs Committee or, perhaps, the debate in Westminster Hall. Those will be taken into account, along with changes or problems highlighted in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1331</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the pre-legislative scrutiny. Once that has been put together, the Secretary of State will liaise with the Welsh Assembly Government to produce a finalised draft Order in Council. Then, and only then, would the Secretary of State lay the draft Order in Council in an unamendable form for the 90-minute debates in both Houses of Parliament, inviting their approval. I would expect those debates to take place on the Floor of the House, certainly in the early days of the process. That process follows the successful model, developed over a number of years, for the pre-legislative scrutiny of draft Bills, which has helped to improve those Bills and ease their passage through the House. It represents a good model to apply to the Orders in Council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_89">The Government welcome and encourage pre-legislative scrutiny of proposals for enhanced legislative competence. At the same time, there should be flexibility in the system. I would not wish either the Welsh Affairs Committee or the Welsh Grand Committee to have their business dictated by statute, which is the implication of amendments Nos. 187&nbsp;and 212.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_90">Amendment No. 187&nbsp;would also set fixed time scales for the draft Orders in Council. I am not talking about proposed draft Orders in Council; it clearly refers to draft Orders in Council that have been finalised by the Assembly after pre-legislative scrutiny. The amendment would require those to be laid before Parliament for 60&nbsp;days&#151;the so-called super-affirmative procedure. As I said, there will have been ample opportunity for hon. Members to have taken part in the pre-legislative scrutiny, so there is no need for a fixed period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_91">The hon. Gentleman did not put much emphasis on draft Measures that are attached to the draft Order in Council. I remind Members that, by their nature, the Orders in Council do not change the substance of the&nbsp;law. Substantive changes of law would be made by the Assembly Measures themselves. Assembly Measures will be subject to detailed scrutiny by the Assembly. That is what we term the enhanced legislative process, which part 3&nbsp;is all about.

<a name="stpa_92">Amendments Nos. 122, 123, 181, 53&nbsp;and 54&nbsp;relate to the role of the Secretary of State. Much has been made of the fact that the Secretary of State has discretion whether to lay a draft legislative competence order&#151;or an Order in Council&#151;before both Houses, but that position is perfectly reasonable and rational. As I explained earlier, these proposals will not come out of the blue. Normally, the preliminary draft Orders in Council and the explanatory material that will accompany the draft would reflect the outcome of discussions between the Welsh Assembly Government and the UK Government, so that issues of scope, clarity and vires would have been thoroughly thought through before even the preliminary draft was laid before Parliament for pre-legislative scrutiny.

The provisions will ensure not only that the proposals that are put before Parliament are properly prepared but that the Government&#039;s view on them is clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_94">In new clause 4, the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) proposes that the Assembly or Counsel General should be able to refer to the Supreme Court any decision by the Secretary of State to refuse to lay a draft Order in Council before each House of Parliament, so that the Supreme Court could decide whether such a decision was reasonable and intra vires. I do not believe that such a provision is necessary. The Bill already provides for the Secretary of State to give notice of his reasons for refusing to lay the draft Order in Council. That, in itself, is a powerful incentive to any Secretary of State to ensure that he or she has good reasons for any refusal to lay such a draft. The Assembly and the public at large would know the Secretary of State&#039;s reasons for refusing.

<p><a name="st_100"><a name="60124-14_spnew0"><b> Mr. Elfyn Llwyd  (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC):</b> 
 I hear what the Under-Secretary says, but the only reference in the White Paper to the Secretary of State&#039;s duty to provide reasons is a statement that the reasons he gives should not be trivial. That does not take us very far. Can the Under-Secretary provide examples of why the Secretary of State should refuse to lay a draft Order in Council?
</p>








<p><a name="st_101"><a name="60124-14_spnew1"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Pre-legislative scrutiny might have failed to tease out an issue relating to whether the Measure fits correctly within one of the fields. The Secretary of State would therefore query whether the proposal is workable and firmly grounded. In such a case, he would say, &quot;There is something wrong with this proposal&#151;I cannot support it. The Assembly should consider the matter again.&quot; That is the type of case that we have in mind. Understandably, some have argued that the Secretary of State might block an Order in Council for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1333</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>purely political reasons&#151;because he did not like the contents of the Measure&#151;but we do not expect the process to work in that way. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied with that answer.
</p>








<p><a name="st_102"><a name="60124-14_spnew2"><b> David T.C. Davies  (Monmouth) (Con):</b> 
 I appreciate that the Minister is attempting to reassure us that the Secretary of State would never turn down an application for political reasons, but although that might be the present intention, the Bill as drafted allows the Secretary of State for Wales, now or in future, to turn down a Measure for political reasons, if he or she wishes to. I cast no aspersions on the present Secretary of State when I say that, although that might be the present intention, if the wording of the Bill is not amended, it might not necessarily be what happens in future.
</p>








<p><a name="st_103"><a name="60124-14_spnew3"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 The political reality is that if the Secretary of State&#039;s reasons were weak or unconvincing, he would come under considerable public pressure. In addition, the Bill provides powers for the Counsel General to refer questions to the Supreme Court&#151;for example, whether a matter relates to a field listed in part 1&nbsp;of schedule 5. However, careful thought must be given to when those powers are required. In general, we have provided such powers where the question is clearly one of legal interpretation and requires a decision of the senior judiciary, given the constitutional significance of the matter in question. In such a case, judicial review is available to anyone who thinks that the Secretary of State&#039;s decision is unreasonable. An additional power for the Assembly or the Counsel General to refer the Secretary of State&#039;s decision to the Supreme Court is not necessary. Furthermore, the Secretary of State&#039;s decision is an Executive decision and is therefore qualitatively different from matters in respect of which the Bill provides a power for the Counsel General and the Attorney-General to refer questions to the Supreme Court.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_95">I have taken some time to respond to an important debate, which started last night. I hope that what I have said persuades Opposition Members that our proposal is reasonable and that we expect to have rigorous and effective pre-legislative scrutiny. I urge the hon. Member for Beaconsfield to withdraw the amendment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_104"><a name="60124-14_spnew4"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for the way in which he has presented the Government&#039;s case, both yesterday and today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_96">I said at the outset that amendment No. 180&nbsp;was probing in nature. It was designed to highlight the difference of approach in the part 4&nbsp;and part 3&nbsp;procedures. The Minister is right, and I accept that if the amendment were to be accepted, it would have a sclerotic effect on the way in which the Assembly functions. Although I may have serious reservations about the operation of part 3&nbsp;in principle, as the Minister no doubt realises, it is not my purpose to scupper it by making it ineffective if Parliament decides it wants part 3&nbsp;in place. For those reasons, I shall not press amendment No. 180&nbsp;to a Division.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_97">I hope that in due course it will be possible to press amendment No. 187. I continue to have serious reservations about the scrutiny procedure. I am grateful to the Minister for the letter that he wrote to my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1334</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Gillan) on 17&nbsp;January and the two memorandums attached to it, which I had an opportunity to read before they were put in the Library. They make interesting reading. I can see how the Government seek to involve the House and the Welsh Grand Committee in the formulation of policy in Wales and in taking a decision whether the Welsh Assembly should be allowed to pass an Assembly Measure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_98">However, as I am sure the Minister recognises, the word &quot;amendable&quot; in the context of what goes on in this House usually suggests that it is possible to table an amendment and carry it by some vote or other or with the agreement of all concerned, so that the text can be varied. That, of course, is not possible under the proposed procedure, which envisages a consultation mechanism by which a draft order can be scrutinised. If individuals in the House or elsewhere&#151;the various public bodies that the Government intend to consult&#151;succeed in raising sufficient objection to make the Government consider that there may be a mistake in the drafting of the scope of the order, or that they may have difficulty getting the order in its present form through the House, they can redraft it and present a new order. That, as I am sure the Minister acknowledges, is not the same as an amendable order. It is an entirely different creature.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_99">In those circumstances, the House faces a possible difficulty. I shall not revisit the debate that we had yesterday on my first amendment, No. 161. That suggested to the Government that one possible way of proceeding was to hold a further vote after the Assembly Measure was drawn up and before it was submitted to Her Majesty in Council for ratification. In terms of the House having scrutiny of what is passed in Wales, that to my mind remains a better mechanism, but if that is not to be the course of action, we need to set out formally a procedure that will allow the House to undertake pre-scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_100">The Minister worried me a little in the course of his comments, because he made it clear, rightly, that the system could be short-circuited. We will be relying on the Standing Orders of the House. No formal mechanism will be prescribed. That is not adequate. The Government need to consider what mechanism they want for the proper scrutiny process to take place. If amendment No. 187&nbsp;is not a suitable vehicle for that, I look forward to a Government alternative being tabled on Report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_101">As we are dealing with a novel area&#151;I cannot think of previous legislation of this kind&#151;I am not persuaded that the existing informal systems, which are enshrined only in convention and Standing Orders, are adequate. If the House is to have a proper role in deciding whether the Welsh Assembly should legislate, there is no reason why the scrutiny procedure should not be laid down in primary legislation. For those reasons, I seek to put amendment No. 187&nbsp;to the vote. Even if it is not carried, it may be an inducement to the Government to consider the matter further. Subject to that, I seek leave to withdraw amendment No. 180, and to press amendment No. 187&nbsp;to the vote.

<br>&nbsp;<br>disputes about whether the Assembly has acted within its powers. It seems entirely reasonable for the elected Assembly to have that power, and unreasonable that it should not. The Bill proposes a separation of the Assembly from the Government, which is very welcome, of course. But the two are being treated differently, with the elected body coming off worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_106">The Counsel-General, as I understand it, is deemed to be a Minister. While the power of referral to the Supreme Court is appropriate as a ministerial power, why is it not so for the elected body? However much the Assembly might wish to do so, as things are it cannot appeal to the Supreme Court. In certain circumstances, it might be appropriate to confer on an elected body, because of its standing as an elected body, powers that it would be inappropriate to confer on an individual appointed Minister. However, in spite of that excellent principle, the elected body is coming off worse here. Furthermore, what recourse would there be for the&nbsp;Assembly if the Counsel-General refused to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for reasons that the Assembly might not accept? What recourse would there be for the Assembly and the Counsel-General if the Attorney-General refused to refer a matter to the Supreme Court for reasons that they might not accept?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_107">We can speculate about disagreements on referral to the Supreme Court between the Counsel-General and the Attorney-General, but that probably goes beyond the scope of the amendment. Given the Assembly&#039;s status as the elected body and as something separate from the Executive, and given those potential problems, we think that there is reason for the Assembly to have direct recourse to the Supreme Court.

<p><a name="st_117"><a name="60124-17_spnew0"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I am not minded to support the amendment, but it raises a pertinent issue. It might be helpful if the Minister took the opportunity to explain the nature of the relationship that will exist between the Counsel-General and the Assembly. There is some lack of clarity in the Bill&#039;s text about whether the Counsel-General is the servant of the Executive and the Ministers or of the Assembly, or of both.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_108">Of course, in this House, the Attorney-General fulfils a function both as the Government&#039;s adviser and, in theory, an adviser to the House, although because he is not a Member of the House, it is difficult for him to discharge that responsibility. I have not seen the Solicitor-General fulfil that function since he was appointed. It is an issue on which there needs to be some clarity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_109">On the face of it, I can see why the Government have restricted the right to make a reference to the Counsel-General or the Attorney-General, but it raises the question of what the Counsel-General&#039;s duties will be and how he should discharge them. I assume that by virtue of his office he has to cast a wholly impartial eye over legislation and, if he thinks that there is an issue of controversy or difficulty, to make the reference. However, that raises a question about the extent to which he should be seen to act and will act independently and the extent to which he will be seen as a creature of the Executive.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_110">The standard problem that could arise, I suppose, is an issue on which there is disagreement between the Assembly and Ministers. We should like some reassurance from the Government as to how they see this working in practice.
</p>








<p><a name="st_118"><a name="60124-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. John Gummer  (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> 
 Could we have a clear explanation of this, for another reason? I am rather minded to support the amendment, which seems merely to point out the nonsense of so much of the interior tergiversations that are going on in this clause. The thing that concerns me is the role of the Counsel-General. If he can be shown to be an independent figure able to take a proper legal view of what the Assembly wants, there may be an argument for saying that the Assembly, separate from the Counsel-General, should not have an application to the Supreme Court. The Minister must convince us that the Counsel-General will not be a creature of the Government but a proper servant of the Assembly. If he can so convince us, it would be perfectly proper to leave the Counsel-General that access, because of his legal position, but the Minister would have to be significantly more convincing than either the explanatory notes or what we have heard so far from him. I hope that he will help me.

<p><a name="st_119"><a name="60124-17_spnew2"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Clause 95&nbsp;gives a specific power to the Counsel-General and the Attorney-General to make a reference to the Supreme Court, where they would like a decision on whether a particular matter specified in a proposed Order in Council actually relates to a field listed in part 1&nbsp;of schedule 5.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_111">We think that this should be a power for the Counsel-General or Attorney-General to exercise, because it is all about legal interpretation. Does the matter, as described in the proposed Order in Council, actually relate to a field as set out in part 1&nbsp;of schedule 5? In most cases, it should be clear whether a matter relates to a specified field or not, so in most cases it will not be necessary to use this power. However, in the less clear-cut cases, the Counsel-General or Attorney-General will need to make a judgment as to whether a decision is required from the Supreme Court so that there is clarity on whether a matter is relevant or not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_112">On a technical point, the Assembly will be an unincorporated association of 60&nbsp;members. As such the Assembly itself could not institute proceedings in court, but it is possible that the Assembly Commission could act on its behalf. However, that is just a technical point. On the principle that I think the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) is proposing, I still believe that it is inappropriate and unnecessary for a legal representative of the Assembly, as a legislature, to have such a role. The Counsel-General would be acting to represent Welsh devolution interests in proceedings involving devolution issues. It would seem odd to have two people able to carry out this role.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_113">The position of Counsel-General means that there is someone with status similar to that of Attorney-General&#151;this touches on the points that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) and the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) made&#151;to represent devolution interests in proceedings. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1347</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Opposition Members should welcome the fact that the Bill creates a post that can represent Welsh devolution interests in proceedings. But the provisions in the Bill correspond with provisions made with respect to Scotland and Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_114">The Counsel-General&#039;s appointment will have to meet with the approval of the Assembly, which should also enable the Assembly to signal that it has confidence in that person&#039;s ability to represent Welsh interests.
</p>








<p><a name="st_120"><a name="60124-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 Would the Counsel-General be required to give advice to the Assembly? In other words, if the Assembly were to say to the Counsel-General, &quot;We think this is a matter you ought to look at,&quot; will he be required to give the reasons for his decision not to refer it to the Supreme Court or would he be like the Attorney-General, who never gives the reasons for his advice?
</p>








<p><a name="st_121"><a name="60124-17_spnew4"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 I assume, bearing it in mind that the Counsel-General is a member of the Welsh Assembly Government, that when he is approached&#151;we are talking about whether an Order in Council fits in with part 1&nbsp;of schedule 5&#151;he will be open in giving his opinion as to whether he thought that it did or did not fit in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_115">I hope that I have answered the point that the hon. Member raised in his amendment. I hope that I have been able to reassure him that the amendments are not necessary, that the Counsel-General will be able to ensure that advice is given to the Assembly and that if there is a question as to whether the issue relates to part 1&nbsp;of schedule 5, he will refer the matter to the Supreme Court.
</p>








<p><a name="st_122"><a name="60124-17_spnew5"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The Counsel-General may be a Member of the Assembly, but then again he may not. The option is open. We know from clause 49&nbsp;that his appointment has to be ratified by the Assembly, but it is not clear how the Assembly would apply pressure, for instance, for his removal. Indeed, this applies to all the Welsh Ministers. I do not know whether it would be possible for the Welsh Assembly to move a motion for someone&#039;s salary to be reduced or, indeed, extinguished, which is the way we in this House normally go around these things if we wish to register our displeasure with a Minister&#039;s conduct.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_116">There are some issues of procedure. I accept that, ultimately, if the First Minister stands by a Counsel-General who is not performing adequately, that will lead to a crisis in which the Executive might be overturned by the Assembly. Nevertheless, that is a bit of a nuclear button option. In this House, we have other ways of showing clearly that someone has lost our confidence.

<p><a name="st_139">Committees fulfil an important function in the Assembly. They are potentially a resource of great expertise and, in fulfilling their scrutiny function, they will be familiar with the detail of issues and in a good position to be innovative in their thinking. Any Measure proposed by a Committee would still be subject to all the scrutiny procedures that would apply to Measures proposed by Ministers or Back Benchers, but such a Measure would have all the advantages of having been scrutinised in detail beforehand by Members from all parties who would have reached a consensus. The Measure would be all the better for it. I hardly need remind the Committee that cross-party consensus is a prized commodity when promoting legislation. If, for some reason, a consensus had not been reached, the Assembly and, I dare say, this place and the other place could draw their own conclusions when giving the Measure further consideration.</p>













<p><a name="st_140">It may be argued that the role of Committees is to hold the Government to account, but it is also their role to contribute to policy development. Committees will need to be reactive to the Government&#039;s legislative priorities, but it has been said that it is necessary

There have been several Scottish examples of Committees being successful in generating legislation, as was shown in the report. That was also the case in respect of the Northern Ireland Assembly in the past. The process works and has proven useful. That is one reason why the National Assembly Committee recommended that Committees should be able to propose Measures. We endorse that view and invite other hon. Members to support us.</p>

 I offer my support for the amendment. It would appear to be anomalous that Assembly Committees cannot bring forward Measures. However, I wish to add a word of warning.

I am not certain what the problem is, but it is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1350</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>probably to do with the number of Assembly Members and the fact that everyone knows everyone else so well. Also, most of the Committees are chaired by members of the governing party. Whatever the reason, the culture in this place is that Committees act independently and impartially and that, to some extent, people leave behind their political allegiances. That is certainly not the case in Assembly Committees, and I would therefore be cautious about suggestions that they function as well and as impartially as Committees in this place.

 It may assist Opposition Members if I say that I agree that it may in some circumstances be appropriate for an Assembly Committee to propose an Assembly Measure. For that reason, the Bill does not prevent Committees from doing so. Clause 96&nbsp;ensures that Ministers and individual Members have the right to propose Measures, subject to the provision of standing orders. However, there is nothing to prevent standing orders from providing that Committees may also propose Measures. It is appropriate for the Assembly&#039;s Standing Orders to make any provision relating to the proposal of Measures that is additional to the minimum provision in clause 96.

 Clause 97&nbsp;will regulate proceedings on proposed Assembly Measures. Subsection (1) provides that there should be a threefold procedure in the Assembly: a vote on general principles, an opportunity for the Assembly to consider Assembly Measures in detail&#151;I take that to be a Committee or Report stage, adapted, obviously, due to the number of Members of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1351</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Assembly&#151;and a final stage at which a proposed Assembly Measure can be passed or rejected. However, I am worried about subsection (2), which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;Subsection (1) does not prevent the standing orders making provision to enable the Assembly to expedite proceedings in relation to a particular proposed Assembly Measure.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_123">There is a meeting of minds to the extent that part 3&nbsp;of the Bill is not the same as part 4. Part 4&nbsp;would, after a referendum, give the Assembly the legislative power to get on with it, for better or worse, but part 3&nbsp;allows the Assembly to undertake detailed scrutiny of legislation in a procedure under which we retain, by virtue of the Order in Council, overall responsibility for the process. If that is indeed what we are doing, I have considerable anxiety about whether subsection (2) is appropriate because it provides a mechanism whereby the Assembly, having been given power by the Order in Council that we had enacted, could enact the Assembly Measure without giving it the consideration that is the very justification for granting the power in the first place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_124">The situation is quite different from that under part 4. I have tabled an amendment that is similar to amendment No. 170&nbsp;to part 4, but that is a probing amendment because my attitude to part 4&nbsp;is rather different. I understand that, if we are transferring legislative functions to an independent body, it is not for us to start telling it how to carry out its business. However, the Government are announcing to the people of Wales that part 3&nbsp;offers a hybrid procedure under which the House retains control, but detailed scrutiny is carried out by the Assembly so that the minutiae can be thrashed out in a way that provides better legislation for the Welsh people. It is thus astonishing that subsection (2) provides a loophole under which the Assembly could decide not to carry out adequate scrutiny.

 Can my hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_156"><a name="60124-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I agree with my right hon. Friend and cannot imagine such a circumstance. The process under part 3&nbsp;that must be followed to get the Order in Council, including the delay periods, shows that Assembly Measures are hardly the material of urgent business, so it is difficult to understand why subsection (2) is needed at all.
</p>

<a name="60124-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_125">I hope that the Minister will accept that I say sincerely that subsection (2) is an invitation to possible conflict.

<br>&nbsp;<br>for including it in part 3. If I understand the Government&#039;s position correctly&#151;let me leave aside the&nbsp;question of whether I agree with the principle of the&nbsp;process&#151;they are offering the reassurance that the people of Wales will get better governance because the&nbsp;Welsh Assembly will have more time to flesh out the details of a principle that has been approved by the House.

<a name="60124-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_128">Amendments Nos. 171&nbsp;to 173&nbsp;are probing amendments that relate largely to the same point: the Standing Orders for private proposed Assembly Measures. The House has different procedures and Standing Orders for its consideration of private measures, so I understand that the Welsh Assembly would need different procedures, too. However, private proposed Assembly Measures would still need to be considered fully. We must not have a situation in which that process can be short-circuited. Although I accept that there must be a mechanism for a separate system, the amendments reinforce the point that I am making about subsection (2).
</p>








<p><a name="st_157"><a name="60124-19_spnew2"><b> Mr. Llwyd: </b> 
 I support amendment No. 174. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) is on to a good point. I cannot imagine any circumstances in which an Assembly Measure should not be produced bilingually. It would be frankly unreasonable to expect all the paperwork generated by the Assembly to be bilingual, but an Assembly Measure, which will be akin to a parliamentary Bill, should be published in both languages. I fully support the hon. Gentleman and add my voice to his call for an explanation of the circumstances that would justify such an exemption.
</p>








<p><a name="st_158"><a name="60124-19_spnew3"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I regret that I failed to speak to amendment No. 174, but the hon. Gentleman gives me the opportunity to set out the precise explanation that I want from the Minister. Bilingualism appears to be absolutely embedded in the Assembly, so surely the idea of an Assembly Measure that is not bilingual is very odd indeed.


</p>








<p><a name="st_159"><a name="60124-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 I owe a filial duty to my Welsh-speaking father to support amendment No. 174&nbsp;and the need for bilingual provision. I have always held it against him that we did not learn Welsh in the household, and I am pleased that the Welsh language is now much more widely spoken. I support the general idea that the Welsh Assembly should be bilingual in its entirety, although I understand that complex legal tomes or scientific articles could be excluded. There should be no possibility of the two languages being thought of as anything other than equal.
</p>








<p><a name="st_160"><a name="60124-19_spnew5"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 I am happy to agree entirely with my right hon. Friend, but sometimes things can go too far. For example, the emergency signs for lifts in the Welsh Assembly were written in English and Welsh and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1353</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>also set out in both English and Welsh Braille. I am given to understand that during the first six months that the Assembly was in place, the Welsh Braille sign was upside down, so the only way in which people would have been able to use it would have been if they had stood on their heads.
</p>








<p><a name="st_161"><a name="60124-19_spnew6"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 We can find the absurd in many such situations. It is the very nature of a law, although I do not know what to call it because one word that can be used is impolite in the House and the use of the phrase Murphy&#039;s law is now illegal because it is racist. Whatever the law is called, these things just happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_129">The matter is crucial. It is crucial the other way round, too, because it is also important that English-speaking Assembly Members are not put in a position in which an important document is not available in English. Wales has done remarkably well in returning to a choice of languages. The fact that a great language was not lost is a rare and encouraging example. It would be odd if the Committee decided not to do everything it could to encourage that further.

<p><a name="st_162"><a name="60124-19_spnew7"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 This has been an interesting and, hopefully, brief debate. Clause 97(2) enables the Assembly, in its Standing Orders, to provide for the circumstances in which a particular proposed Measure can come before the Assembly and be taken through a procedure that is different from that set out in clause 97(1). As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr Grieve) said, there is an equivalent provision in clause 110(2), as regards Bills in the Assembly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_130">I am sympathetic to the concern that we ensure that all Assembly Measures receive proper scrutiny, but clause 97(2) does not circumvent that. Instead, it recognises that there may be circumstances in which the Assembly&#039;s standard scrutiny procedures would not be appropriate because the Measure concerned deals with a matter that requires urgent attention. Animal health, such as foot and mouth, is an example of that. The circumstances would arise when the Assembly has already been given powers to legislate by this place. If a foot and mouth outbreak, or another animal health issue, required it to legislate quickly, clause 97(2) would allow it to truncate the process, as we have done on occasion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_131">I imagine that the Assembly&#039;s standing orders set out the time between its equivalent of our Second Reading, Committee stage, and Report and Third Reading&#151;the same stages as we go through. The standing orders could be amended to allow the scrutiny process to take place over one or two days. That is sensible. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that we have included the provision for those purposes. It will be used on rare occasions, but it would be wrong for the standing orders not to set out proceedings in which the Assembly can address urgent issues.
</p>








<p><a name="st_163"><a name="60124-19_spnew8"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I understand the force of what the Minister says, but the difficulty is that the expression &quot;Assembly Measure&quot; will cover the enactment of what we consider to be statutory instruments and secondary legislation, and the enactment of a form of primary legislation, for which we have given permission. The two 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1354</b>

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="60124-19_spnew9"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 I understand the hon.

I would be surprised&#151;it would be illogical and, possibly, irresponsible&#151;if those standing orders did not allow for emergency legislation to be enacted by the Assembly.
</p>








<p><a name="st_165"><a name="60124-19_spnew10"><b> Mr. Llwyd: </b> 
 Given that the Minister is unable to give an example, apart from animal health, why not leave it to the Assembly to create its own standing orders? Why do we need to tell it what to do? The clause says &quot;must include&quot; so and so. It is prescriptive and tells the Assembly what to do. <i>[Interruption.]</i> On any reading, that is what it says.

This debate has highlighted the odd situation that we are creating: defining as an Assembly Measure that which in this House we would consider to be either primary legislation or statutory instruments. The Minister makes a persuasive case for urgency if the Assembly is enacting what we would normally call a statutory instrument. After all, we

<br>&nbsp;<br>sometimes have to enact them urgently, and by their very nature a statutory instrument can in this House be passed rapidly. By virtue of the way in which the Welsh Assembly operates, however, statutory instruments are normally mulled over at considerably greater length, which was one argument for the original devolution proposals given to the Welsh.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_139">Of course, if urgency is required, something can always be enacted by a statutory instrument in this place. It is clear that it is unacceptable that there should be short-circuiting of the primary legislative functions which could be transferred under the Order in Council procedure, as I think the Minister has acknowledged, but, as the Bill stands, there is a risk that that is exactly what could happen, which would defeat the entire object of the exercise of going through and enacting part 3.

<a name="stpa_140">Therefore, given the difficulty with the way in which we define Assembly Measures, I propose to consider the matter further, but I cannot rule out on Report our suggesting that some distinction must be drawn between different sorts of Assembly Measures. I urge the Government to consider that, because within the term &quot;Assembly Measure&quot; we are lumping together forms of legislation which in this House we treat very differently, both in their significance and in the way in which we proceed.

Every single Member of Parliament from Wales was against the drowning of the valley, but it went ahead. I hope that we will never see such an event again, because I do not know what would happen, but this clause would enable it, and that is my concern.

<a name="stpa_150">The provision has touched a raw nerve, not just among people such as myself who support Plaid Cymru but among others, because once more they can see potential for conflict. The paragraph clearly refers to water resources in England, and I can easily envisage that in some years from now somebody might consider that there is a need to drown another valley in Wales. As that would be such a large planning operation, it would come under the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and then bypass the planning procedures in the Assembly. The Government could rely on that paragraph, among others, to ensure that the plan went ahead, whatever the view of the Welsh Assembly, which would be expressing the view of the Welsh people.

<p><a name="st_188"><a name="60124-21_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) has understated his case. The three amendments are most important. Paragraphs (a) and (c) in subsection (1) differ from paragraph (b) because paragraph (b) contains the word &quot;serious&quot;. I find that peculiar, because it means that the provisions that are the least precise may be activated when the consequence or effect of the Measure is not serious, but merely adverse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_157">It is extremely difficult to envisage how paragraphs (a) or (c) would be used. They can be used even in circumstances where the Minister would not have to show that the &quot;adverse effect&quot; was serious. Even the word &quot;effect&quot;, used in paragraphs (a) and (c), is less powerful than &quot;impact&quot;, which is used in paragraph (b); an effect is a passing matter. I imagine that the phrase &quot;adverse effect&quot; refers to a range of issues&#151;the list of fields specified in part 1&nbsp;of schedule 5&nbsp;is considerable, encompassing a huge number of areas. Under the clause, a Secretary of State, by diktat, would be able to say that a Measure that has a passing or glancing effect on some matter of importance&#151;sufficiently important for the Assembly to feel that a Measure is needed&#151;should be stopped because he has &quot;reasonable grounds to believe&quot; that it would have an &quot;adverse effect&quot;. It is difficult to imagine that a Secretary of State would not be able to stop anything that he did not like. The condition of having &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; does not help, so vague is the wording used in the following paragraphs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_158">In my opinion, paragraphs (a) and (c) are entirely otiose. Their presence suggests that the Bill will not do what it is supposed to. I have all sorts of doubts about the processes set out in the Bill&#151;they are far too opaque. However, if we are to proceed, we must not pretend that the Bill is a means of enhancing the powers of the Assembly, when, just in case the Assembly does something of which we do not approve, we have put in a few get-out clauses to keep power in the hands, not of Parliament, but of the Secretary of State. That is the second reason why I feel so strongly about this matter: I do not like Ministers having such powers without reference back to Parliament. Through the Bill, in effect, Parliament is delegating further legislative powers to the Assembly, but the Government are ensuring that Ministers will still have power, even though Parliament has delegated it. Both paragraphs (a) and (c) are unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_159">On subsection (1)(b), I agree with the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. Either we trust the Welsh people or we do not. It is extremely difficult for me to accept that the Welsh people have to be singled out and measures taken to ensure that, where water is concerned, they should not in any way or in any circumstances be able to do anything that might upset the plans of English Ministers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_160">I have another reason to object. These days, when even some of our less educated newspapers are beginning to understand the importance of climate change, the issues relating to water have become more important, not less. I do not want to give the impression to the Welsh people&#151;or to the English people&#151;that if we are short of water, our first response will be to extend the resource, rather than to improve retention and reduce use. The clause is very old fashioned. It suggests that Wales is a provider of water for England. It does 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Better remind them that it&#039;s not their water. It is, in effect, our water and we&#039;re going to decide what is done with it. Better not, Minister.

We have a large body of law that may well be affected by an Assembly Measure not only in England, but in Wales. It is extraordinary that the Secretary of State has no power of intervention if an Assembly Measure has an adverse effect on the operation of the law as it applies in Wales also.

 May I take the Minister back to clause 100(1)(b), which deals with water resources? What would happen if the National Assembly wanted to pass a measure to outlaw any further drownings of valleys because it believed that water needed to be conserved and that a certain percentage of water was being wasted through leaking pipes every day of the year? Could the Secretary of State say, &quot;No, we are not having that, because we might need compulsorily to acquire land to drown in the future.&quot; I believe that Parliament would prevail in those circumstances and that the voice of the Assembly would be drowned.
</p>








<p><a name="st_197"><a name="60124-22_spnew5"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Let us examine the hypothetical case that the hon. Gentleman has raised, in which the Assembly said that there would be no increase in the amount of water available. As I read clause 100(1)(b), such a proposal would have a serious adverse impact on water resources, water supply or the quality of water in England. The proposal does not specify an increase; it describes the current situation and states that it should not be made any worse. Hon. Members were seeking an example of an Assembly Measure that would have such an impact, but I cannot think of one. However, there might be a measure affecting a major forestry issue, for example, that would have an impact on the water resources that are supplied to England. The provision might apply in that kind of area.

 I ask the Minister to look again at his explanation of clause 100(1)(b). It seems clear to me that the provision could be used by a Minister against an Assembly Measure that related to the increase of water resources. If England thought that there was a need for such an increase, any such Measure could have a serious adverse impact on water resources. The provision does not mention present or previous water resources; it simply mentions water resources. The Minister is giving that opportunity; he might want to. I think that we ought to know.

<p><a name="st_199"><a name="60124-22_spnew7"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 We are starting to get into the realms of fantasy now. This provision has been on the statute book since 1998, and there has never been a problem with it.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Minister explain why the word &quot;impact&quot; is used in paragraph (b), and the word &quot;effect&quot; in paragraphs (a) and (c)?
</p>

 No, I cannot. We are trying to scrutinise a very large Bill, and I think that we are now moving into an area in which our proceedings might fall into disrepute. We really need to move on.

 I will give way to the hon. Gentleman, but I hope that he is going to make a sensible intervention.
</p>








<p><a name="st_204"><a name="60124-22_spnew12"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 I only make sensible interventions. I have been listening very closely to the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and to the Minister&#039;s response to them, and I must take issue with what the Minister has just said. As the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) has just pointed out, the wording of these provisions is very important, and it is our duty to get this right. If different terminology is used in paragraph (b) from that in paragraphs (a) and (c), one has to assume that there is some logic behind that. I know that this argument is taking a bit of time, but I hope that the Minister is about to receive some clarification on this, because for me at least, his answer will be salient to what we should do if there were a vote on the amendment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_205"><a name="60124-22_spnew13"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 This will really enlighten the Committee. The reason that the word &quot;effect&quot; is used is because it relates to the legislative environment. The reason that the word &quot;impact&quot; is used is because it relates to the physical environment. I hope that everyone is happy with that explanation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_171">As I was saying, the intervention powers are extremely limited, but they are important. It is absolutely right that the Secretary of State should be able to prevent proposed Assembly legislation from having adverse consequences of the kind set out in clause 100(1). It is unlikely that that would be necessary, but it is important that that power should exist.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_172">Amendment No. 175&nbsp;would give the Secretary of State the power to override proposed Assembly legislation just because he or she thought that it would have a bad effect. That would be completely unacceptable. We must strictly constrain the powers of the Secretary of State, and I would urge hon. Members not to support that amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_173">Amendment No. 176&nbsp;would provide that an order preventing an Assembly Measure from being submitted for approval by Her Majesty should be subject to the affirmative rather than the negative resolution procedure. I suspect that it has been tabled in this way because the previous amendment, amendment No. 175, is so powerful. The reason that we have proposed to use the negative procedure, which could be implemented by either House of Parliament, is that the Secretary of State must make an order within four weeks. It would not be possible to do that, or to be properly accountable, if we were to use the affirmative order procedure.

<a name="stpa_174">In conclusion, the Conservative amendments and the Plaid Cymru amendments are poles apart, in that they seek to do completely opposite things. Any of them would unbalance devolution in one direction or another. The position that we have outlined in the Bill strikes a perfect balance, and I would therefore ask the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy not to press his amendment to a vote.

 Perhaps unsurprisingly, I am far from satisfied. The Minister has not assisted us very much on amendment No. 158. We have had a discussion, and he has said certain things about it, but I am still unclear. From my reading of paragraph (b), I still believe that, were the Assembly to decide to introduce a measure to prevent the creation of any more dams or the drowning of any more valleys in Wales for any purpose, Parliament could lawfully override that measure via the Secretary of State. That is quite plain, because the provision does not use words such as &quot;current&quot; or &quot;historical&quot;. It does not relate to the here and now; it is for the future. Let us be straight about this; all legislation is about the present and the future, not the present alone. We do not legislate for tomorrow alone; we legislate for 10&nbsp;years from tomorrow, and for 20&nbsp;and 30&nbsp;years from tomorrow if the Bill is reasonable.

 We move on to part 4&nbsp;of the Bill. In the spirit of the welcome that I accord to this section of the Bill, we thoroughly approve of the provision for a referendum. As we have argued previously, we believe in asking the people of Wales for their views. Although the provision comes late in relation to the legislative devices encompassed in the Bill, certainly in part 3, we would not be so curmudgeonly as to fail to welcome the referendum should the Assembly receive full law-making powers.

<a name="60124-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_177">I want to express an element of scepticism, however, on behalf of many who read that the Secretary of State does not envisage the provision being enacted before 2011&#151;which, I understand, he has said on many occasions&#151;and who believe that offering a referendum in such circumstances is merely a diversionary tactic. Certainly, by ostensibly offering a referendum in the Bill, the Secretary of State can point out that the Bill contains a provision that arranges to consult the people of Wales on a future occasion. In truth, however, it is so far into the future that it seems strange that we should be discussing it now. Therefore, while many continue to believe that the Secretary of Sate can achieve virtually full law-making powers through the convoluted Order in Council process contained in part 3, they remain to be convinced that the Secretary of State has any intention of ever holding this referendum.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman.

If it is put into operation, however, it would be inequitable to allow what is contained in the provisions&#151;the ability for referendums to be repeated over and over again.

On Second Reading he made a great deal of sense, and he was particularly concerned that the Secretary of State had not even taken into account the First Minister&#039;s views, or, indeed, his own views, that a no vote would take the matter off the agenda for a long time.

I refer in particular to the &quot;Better Governance for Wales&quot; scrutiny by that Committee, and to paragraph 135. I am sure that the Secretary of State is pretty intimate with its wording, because he must have examined it carefully to respond to the conclusion. It is worth repeating:

A week ago, I welcomed the referendum because I thought that a referendum meant that the people of Wales would make a choice.

 The right hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. Cannot one argue that there is a presumption in favour of devolution on the basis that we had a referendum on the principle of devolution? Therefore, the Assembly having been set up, one can assume that there is a progression. As Ron Davies used to say, devolution is a process, not an outcome. I think that he had a lot of wise words to say about devolution. Does not the right hon. Gentleman accept that the principle of devolution was established in 1997&nbsp;in the referendum and now we are discussing the pace at which it progresses?

Despite his own declaration that it would be a very long time before there was a second referendum, he has not even been willing to incorporate a very long time in the Bill. Why? I have not seen the quotation that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham read out, but a time limit is not included in the Bill because he is waiting for a moment of political opportunism. That is what it is about. He will not put a time limit in. He will just wait for the opportunity, if there is one. If that opportunity arises, he will jump while he can to get the vote that he wants. Meanwhile, we shall still have the drip, drip, drip of the order-making process. For that reason, I welcome the amendment that was tabled by my hon. Friends; I apologise for jumping in before them.

 I have considerable issues with amendment No. 189, and I suspect that, on reflection, those on the Conservative Front Bench ought to feel the same. That is because there is a simple precedent for mechanisms with regard to holding referendums on constitutional issues affecting nations within the United Kingdom.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_197">I am, of course, referring to Northern Ireland, where we have a clear structure that determines when and how often referendums can be held on the reunification of the north and south of Ireland. As far as I know, when that legislation was framed, the Conservatives did not object to the framework allowing a referendum to be held more than once. I certainly do not recall any Conservative spokesperson on the referendum provisions for Northern Ireland saying at any point that they thought that there should be only one referendum, and that if the idea were defeated, the question of reunifying the north and the south of Ireland would have to be shelved forever.

 As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, I was not in the House at that time, but surely he recognises that the situation in Northern Ireland is unique, and that Governments, particularly the last Conservative Government and the present Labour Government, had been trying to overcome a very difficult situation to bring peace there. It is unfair for the hon. Gentleman to use that as an example of a referendum framework that could be repeated elsewhere. A better example would be something like entry into the European Union, where there is scope for a further referendum that might change the direction of our European policy at some point in the future.

 The only reason why my example may seem unfair to the hon. Gentleman is that it utterly contradicts his party&#039;s position. The principle is the same: significant constitutional change to a nation state of the United Kingdom. The question is whether a referendum of this type can be held more than once, or whether one single referendum is binding. I am in no doubt that the comparison is entirely valid, so for the Conservatives to say, as they do in amendment No. 189, that we have the referendum once, and if the idea is

 To equate Northern Ireland with Wales or Scotland is to misunderstand the situation entirely. I have a question for the hon.

 The hon. Lady says that I am making a false equation between the two situations, and that I do not fully understand them.

In fairness, I must recognise that the hon.

More to the point, it is exactly what the leader of his party, the Prime Minister, has said; he said that he had no reverse gear.

However, the Liberal Democrats are not very keen on having a referendum on this matter at all, because we think that it is acceptable and appropriate for us to assume that the Welsh Assembly should have the same kind of powers as Scotland. I do not need to dwell on that, because we had a fairly significant debate on that subject yesterday in the context of changing the name from the Welsh Assembly to the Welsh Senedd.

<br>&nbsp;<br>recommendations made by the Welsh Affairs Committee, which I chair, and they enjoy broad cross-party support. The amendments deal with the possibility of subsequent referendums on the granting of primary legislative powers to the National Assembly. The Bill allows for a final stage of devolution, whereby the Assembly would become a fully functioning Parliament with primary legislative powers. I agree with the Government that a referendum of the people of Wales is necessary before that stage is reached, in order to achieve proper democratic legitimacy.

<br>&nbsp;<br>fast or slow. This amazing and unusual proposal should have appeared in the Liberal Democrat manifesto. It took some doing, but I read that document. As far as I understand, it was never likely to contain such a proposal.

 The right hon. Gentleman has described my feelings about being in the Liberal Democrats over the past two weeks. His general point is correct, but it is not right to say that we would allow no further reference to the public. Manifestos for elections to the Welsh Assembly and to this House offer an authoritative way to consult the public.

<p><a name="st_242"><a name="60124-26_spnew11"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s use of words allows me to explain my deep opposition to all referendums. When Parliament makes a decision such as this, it does so on behalf of the whole nation. People who are affected by it can vote on it, whether or not they are in Wales or Scotland. That would not happen with a referendum, even though UK citizens who live in England also have a part to play. A parliamentary democracy offers a much more sensible way to proceed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_211">The unfortunate thing for the hon. Gentleman is that we chose to proceed by referendum. When people are asked in a referendum to accept one form of devolution, it is very peculiar then to ask them to move to a different form of devolution that has been decided on in an entirely different manner. Indeed, that decision would be neither parliamentary nor derived from a referendum.

<a name="60124-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_212">The Bill proposes a mechanism for devolution by salami slices. As the Father of the House pointed out, at the end of the process a referendum will be proposed, even though by that stage all the matters that could be decided by referendum will have been devolved. That is a unique and dangerous parliamentary concept&#151;although no more so than the Liberal Democrat proposition that people are never asked at all.

 The right hon. Gentleman will accept that the Liberal Democrats, and various other parties, have always favoured devolution as a way of giving the Welsh Assembly primary legislative powers. As he said, a referendum would consult only the Welsh people and not the English, even though the outcome affects them as much as the Welsh. That is why we believe that there should not be a referendum.
</p>








<p><a name="st_244"><a name="60124-27_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 I have various problems with that observation. First, it is not true that the Liberal Democrats have always been in favour of devolution. When they managed to win an election in Britain as a whole, they were against it. They were happy not to have devolution when they thought that they could have power in the country as a whole. They became keen on devolution when they lost power, as devolution offered a different opportunity.

<a name="stpa_213">We have decided that decisions on these matters will be made at a referendum. I oppose referendums, which I consider to be inimical to the British system. However, if the referendum mechanism is to be used, it is vital to ensure that major decisions are arrived at as a result. The affair in question must be settled, at least for a reasonable period of time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_214">We can argue about how long is reasonable, and I agree that a referendum cannot be held whose result is that no other referendum can ever be held. On the other hand, it cannot be desirable to have a system under which referendums are held so often that people become so fed up with voting that only a few zealots turn out. If those zealots should win by two votes, they would call it a remarkable victory. That is what the Father of the House is worried about, and any democrat should share his concern. The Select Committee was of the same opinion, even though its Chairman holds a view about devolution that is the complete opposite of the one held by the Father of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_215">That shows that serious people with different views can come to the same conclusion on the question of referendums. They agree that a proper timetable is needed to prevent referendums from being used for what may be called &quot;partial&quot; purposes.

<a name="60124-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_216">The Secretary of State may say that we should not worry about what he and his Ministers do, as they will behave perfectly properly, but that is not my experience of the referendum process in England. The Government wanted to hold three referendums about the governance of the English regions, but when it became clear that they would lose at least two of them, they were not held.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_217">The parallel that I am making is related to the amendment under discussion, as a referendum was held in the north-east. The Government thought that they would win it, but they lost so heavily that the result looked like a vote in an African dictatorship, only in reverse. The Government lost appallingly badly in an area where Ministers were very active and indeed represented parliamentary seats.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_218">My point is that, although the Government failed to win the planned referendums, they nevertheless carried on implementing their regional policy, come what may. That is what could happen in Wales: a referendum is not held because it cannot be won, but the policy that would have followed a victory is implemented anyway.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_219">I should point out that, under this Government, &quot;regionalism&quot; means taking away powers from local government and giving them to a regional assembly. The Government&#039;s failure in the first referendum of the proposed three was so bad that the other two were never held but, even so, they were determined to go ahead with the process that they had decided on. That is the problem with this Bill, and it is emphasised in this clause.

 It is a pleasure for me to say that the observations of the Father of the House contain a very important truth&#151;that the Bill, if it is not dishonest, is deeply flawed. The Bill pretends to have two parts. One part gives some additional powers to the Welsh Assembly, in accordance with the Labour party&#039;s manifesto. The other part gives full devolution to Wales, after a referendum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_221">Unlike many Conservative Members, I am not especially opposed to a devolved structure. However, I do oppose a devolved structure that disfranchises my constituents and renders English Members of Parliament second rate, at least in terms of the powers available to them. I am not opposed to the nature and principle of devolution. I do not stand on the same side as the Father of the House on that. I do think, however, that we ought to face all the issues at once instead of having the system we have, which is a dog&#039;s breakfast that fails to recognise the problems of the West Lothian question.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_222">We are being asked to have a referendum on a new basis&#151;that the referendum will be part of normal governmental activity until the Government have managed to achieve devolution. That is what the Bill means. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) made that very clear, and I believe her to be right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_223">The parallel with Northern Ireland is manifest nonsense. In the north of Ireland, we have had a continuing situation of violence and disorder. The six counties are constantly upset by two powerful tribal issues: unity and independence from the south. Those battles are unique to that part of the United Kingdom, and, happily, pretty unusual in the world as a whole. The House has always accepted that dealing with the six counties is a matter of total difference from what we do elsewhere because its history is totally different. It would be ridiculous to say that because we have to do X, Y or Z in the north of Ireland, we have to do the same elsewhere, or, indeed, to say that because we want to do something different elsewhere we have for some reason or other to do it in Northern Ireland.

<a name="stpa_224">If the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire does not remember what an 8th century pope said, it would be a good idea for him to do so now. In the 8th century, a pope very properly said that Ireland is different and has to be treated differently. It would have been wise of the House to have thought that in the 19th century and to have followed the views of Cardinal Manning instead of those of Lord Salisbury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_225">The referendum is being presented as a continuous part of governmental life. We shall have it again and again until the people of Wales make the choice that the Secretary of State wants them to make. That seems to me to be the opposite of democracy. It is an example, again, from the Government of Louis Napoleon&#151;Napoleon III. It is how he used referendums. Whenever he found the Government a little difficult or whenever the structure that he had invented produced a result that he did not like, he had a referendum. He even had a particularly nasty and unpleasant one that he called &quot;crowning the edifice&quot;. It was held to make sure that what he wanted was voted for, because he arranged for it to work like that. That is one of the reasons why I so deeply object to referendums.

It is often an answer that has nothing to do with the question, being about what people feel about the Government or whoever asked it. It is a load of nonsense and we should never have joined up to it. I am sorry that my party has agreed to referendums on a whole range of situations in which they are wholly unsuitable.

 I have a particular view on referendums. I have some sympathy with the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) on them. I do not really like them as a basic idea, but we are in the historical situation that, since Harold Wilson&#039;s day, on constitutional issues we have devised the mechanism of referendums. Sometimes we have done so for reasons of political expediency, but they have become part of the fabric.

I say that it is important that the Bill contains a measure that institutionalises the fact that if we are to have primary powers, we will have to have a referendum. There are those who would not want to have one even at that stage. That was part of the discussion that surrounded the Richard commission and so on.

I do not think that the issue will arise until at least the following Assembly term. We can all agree that the additional procedures provided under part 3&nbsp;will need to establish themselves. We will then be able to determine whether that process has provided the streamlined process of decision making for which the Assembly has asked, whether there is a need to call a referendum, or whether a period of conflict has existed between Westminster and Wales that has provoked conditions such as those in the late 1990s that resulted in a turnaround of opinion from that in 1979&nbsp;and produced the yes vote in 1997.

History teaches us the political reality. When the referendum was lost in 1979, it took until 1997&nbsp;to create the conditions in which it was felt that there was consensus to move again. We do not need legislation on the matter because it would put rigid barriers in the way of the politics.

I do not think that Parliament would stand for continuous referendums to bully people into voting yes, even if the Assembly repeatedly requested them. There is no support for that in the House and I, as the Secretary of State responsible for introducing the Bill, would have no truck with it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_260"><a name="60124-29_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 We have had an interesting debate, which has gone on longer than I anticipated because of the significant contributions by some hon. Members. To defer to the Father of the House, the right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) summed up the situation well. The Secretary of State is a man in a hurry. He does not want to wait. In a devastating critique, the right hon. Member for Swansea, West outlined that there is an element of political opportunism. What came through was that the Secretary of State is not showing any duty of care to the people of Wales by allowing the Bill to stand in the form that is before us. What I derived from the Father of the House&#039;s contribution is that this is an experiment with the constitutional position of Wales, which is not advisable and will do no good.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_245">The fact that the Secretary of State was invited to place papers in the Library and papers were there none is also fairly significant. The consultation appeared to be only within the party and not with the public. That also goes some way to revealing the mindset behind the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_246">I shall touch only briefly on the comments by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), because his contribution was not one of his best. However, I want to defend him. The Secretary of State was 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1384</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>unnecessarily cruel in his taunting. It is understandable that his arguments were not as comprehensive as usual in the circumstances.
</p>








<p><a name="st_261"><a name="60124-29_spnew3"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Lady for her support. I have had a lot on my mind recently, and I give her my unequivocal backing in her career.
</p>








<p><a name="st_262"><a name="60124-29_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I am happy to receive it because fortunately I am not running for the leadership of the Liberal Democrats, although I might make a better job of it than some other people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_247">As Chairman of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis) has done a sterling job in difficult circumstances. I do not think that his Committee was fully consulted by the Secretary of State. I certainly do not think that it has been taken along in the process. He approaches the problem from a different dimension. Whereas the right hon. Member for Swansea, West may not be a great enthusiast for devolution, the hon. Gentleman is, but even he has problems with the way in which the Bill stands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_248">My right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), in the bravura performance that we have come to expect, made the points in his inimitable fashion. It was interesting that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Havard) was tempted to participate in the debate. He said that we must not run too far ahead of the people. I agree entirely. I was delighted that he participated because we have not been treated to many contributions by the Labour Members who represent Welsh constituencies. It was good to see the hon. Gentleman making a contribution. My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) said that the proposals would make Wales a political football, and he was quite right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_249">I have listened carefully to the Secretary of State. He says that nothing will happen until 2011&#151;it might be some time after that&#151;but he is trying to legislate today. He also said that there might be a period when Westminster was in conflict with Cardiff; I am not entirely sure that Westminster is not in conflict with Cardiff at the moment, but I do not want to intrude on the private agonies of the Labour party. But that is no excuse for bringing forward this legislation. I do not accept his arguments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_250">I see, rather, a strange consensus. He said that he wanted consensus, and he has it; from Swansea, West, from Suffolk, Coastal, from Aberavon, from, I think, Merthyr Tydfil, and from Chesham and Amersham. Therefore, I have no choice but to put my amendment to the vote in order to place on record our belief that the Bill should not provide the opportunity for repeat referendums and for turning Wales into a political football. By not acceding to any of the amendments that I or the hon. Member for Aberavon have tabled, the Secretary of State has brought this vote on himself.

 Amendment No. 31&nbsp;seeks to give the National Assembly for Wales the right and responsibility of setting the wording on any future referendum under the provisions of clause 102. As the Library has pointed out, it is unusual for the wording of a referendum question not to be set out in a Bill. Indeed, there is only one other example of this not happening. We had a lengthy discussion recently on the uniqueness of Wales vis-&#224;-vis Northern Ireland. Only in the Northern Ireland Act 1998&nbsp;is there another example of the wording not being set out in the legislation.

<a name="stpa_253">The Conservative amendment, which we do not support, would provide the opposite solution to ours, namely that the wording should be set out by Parliament. We believe that the people of Wales should decide on these matters, and that their representatives should decide on the wording of the question in a referendum on the extension of the principle of democratic sovereignty. As we know, timing is a key parameter of success when it comes to calling a referendum. We had a lengthy discussion on such issues in our debate on the last few amendments.

<a name="stpa_254">The other key parameter is the wording on the referendum ballot paper, which can influence the likelihood of success. As opinion pollsters know, the wording of a question can affect the level of support that a proposal attracts. We have seen that in relation to questions of devolution over the years.

<a name="60124-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_255">The referendum in question, as with every other referendum, will be subject to the provisions of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which will mean that the Electoral Commission will pronounce on the intelligibility of the question and produce a report, according to its guidelines, to ensure that the question is clear, concise and impartial. Nevertheless, the power to set the wording of the referendum question is an important one, and it should properly reside with the elected representatives in the national representative institution of the people of Wales&#151;the National Assembly&#151;which is what our amendment seeks to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_256">The Welsh Affairs Committee&#039;s report suggested that the wording should be set out in the Bill in the interests of clarity. However, the Government&#039;s response rejected that proposal, saying, rather mysteriously, that the wording should reflect the circumstances and the timing of the question&#039;s being put. That almost suggests that the referendum might happen in some future century, when the English and Welsh languages might have evolved in some way. The Government&#039;s response proves my point that subtle differences can be introduced into the wording of a question. The power to set the wording is therefore an important one.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_257">The other issue that the Welsh Affairs Committee was trying to resolve in its way, and that we are trying to resolve in ours, is that of the lack of clarity as to how the wording will be decided. This could become a major political issue. As we have seen, the issue of where the power to decide the wording lies became a major issue in Quebec following the 1995&nbsp;referendum there. Even now, we can see the jostling between Ottawa and Quebec for the proper constitutional authority over that issue. Ottawa has passed the Clarity Act to give itself the constitutional authority over the wording of any future referendum question, but the Quebec Government insist that they still have that power. We, too, need clarity, because we do not have it at present in this regard.

 My hon. Friend is making a powerful point, and I fully agree with him.

As the draft Order in Council will have to be approved by at least two thirds of Assembly Members, I put it to the hon.

It would be entirely wrong for an unelected institution to frustrate the will of the Welsh people, as expressed through their directly elected National Assembly, to hold a referendum on the matters contained in the Bill.

It is important to remember that the other place has used its power to reject statutory instruments on a number of occasions. The Secretary of State will remember the famous case involving sanctions against southern Rhodesia in 1968. The House of Lords struck down that order because it supported the white minority Administration in southern Rhodesia. That caused something of a constitutional crisis at the time. However, it has used the power more recently too, during the passage of the Greater London Authority (Election Expenses) Order 2000, on the issue of freepost. The other place has shown that it is willing to use its power to strike down statutory instruments in the case of elections. Our fear is that, unless the amendment is accepted, the other place, which is not representative of anything in particular&#151;it is certainly not representative of Wales&#151;will use its power in the Bill to frustrate the aspirations of the Welsh people and their representatives to move on to the next phase of democratic devolution.

That provides us with no crumb of comfort as we face the possibility that, having achieved the two thirds bar in the National Assembly that has been set down in the Bill, having achieved the political consensus that the Secretary of State refers to constantly, and having achieved an affirmative vote in this House of directly elected Members, we will be frustrated by the unelected Chamber down the corridor.

That is why we have made the order a requirement: it is not a delaying tactic, but will mean that proper answers must be given to proper questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_280">In any case, the Secretary of State will have to consult the Electoral Commission about the referendum question contained in the draft Order in Council. The commission&#039;s report on that question&#039;s intelligibility will have to be laid, together with any preceding statement, with that draft order, according to the procedure established by section 104&nbsp;of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.

<a name="stpa_282">If the Assembly did not have the ability to amend an Order in Council, but was required by the legislation to pass it, we would get it into great difficulties. I hope that the hon.

<a name="amdt_43">
<br>
&#039;a majority of Assembly Members present and voting vote in favour&#039;.
<br>







<p><a name="st_302">I suspect that the debate may be rather short as it is likely that there will not be much meeting of minds between Plaid Cymru and the Government and other parts of the House. Clause 103&nbsp;is concerned with the Assembly&#039;s power to pass a resolution that a recommendation should be made that a referendum be held on whether the provisions of Assembly Acts should come into force. The clause requires a two-thirds majority of Assembly Members to vote in favour. Our amendment would replace that with a simple majority.</p>













<p><a name="st_303">A simple majority has been deemed quite enough in this place to pass even the most contentious of matters. Hon. Members will recall just such a matter squeaking through last autumn by a single vote. I refer to the Terrorism Bill, which was of the utmost importance and to do with the freedom of citizens and a great many other matters. It was hugely contentious and split the Labour party, but it was carried by a single vote. I well recall Labour Members&#151;at least, some of them&#151;cheering and waving their papers as that happened.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060124/debtext/60124-33.htm"/>












<p><a name="st_304">If a one-vote majority is sufficient here on such contentious and important matters, why is it not good enough for the Assembly? The vote concerned will not be a vote to change the law; we will not be bringing in some huge innovation. It will be a question as to whether the people of Wales should be asked their opinion. In that circumstance, it would be quite proper to put the question to the people if a majority of the Assembly Members voted in favour. That is particularly so given the other checks on action that the Government have insisted on. When the Assembly holds a vote, there are the checks of the Secretary of State, of this place and of the place down the Corridor, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) said. All we are looking for is a vote on whether the people of Wales should be asked their opinion. I think it is a matter of common sense to do that by a majority vote.</p>













<p><a name="st_305">The research paper prepared by the Library notes that a two-thirds threshold is quite &quot;unusual&quot;. It also notes that the nearest precedent for this unusual move was the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1398</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>40&nbsp;per cent. threshold required for the referendums of 1979&nbsp;on devolution for Scotland and Wales. That is an unfortunate precedent, to say the least. I have no desire to replay the fierce arguments of 1979&nbsp;as that would not be appropriate here.</p>











<p><a name="st_306"><a name="60124-33_spnew0"><b> Adam Price: </b> 
 Go on.
</p>








<p><a name="st_307"><a name="60124-33_spnew1"><b> Hywel Williams: </b> 
 I shall resist the temptation and note only that the 40&nbsp;per cent. threshold then imposed was widely seen in Wales and in Scotland as being a wrecking move. There is a great danger that the higher threshold in the clause&#151;not 40&nbsp;per cent. but 66&nbsp;per cent. before even an application could be made for a referendum&#151;will be seen, too, as a wrecking move. It will be seen in a similar light.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_288">Of course, in 1979&nbsp;the referendum in Wales was lost disastrously, and it took us many years to recover from that. However, if I may allude briefly to the situation in Scotland, it is significant that the vote was carried in Scotland, but the 40&nbsp;per cent. threshold was not achieved. That gave rise to a great deal of conflict and argument&#151;the very controversy that the Secretary of State said only a few minutes ago that he was mindful to avoid in Wales. However, the Government are in danger of sowing further seeds of controversy, not about whether part 4&nbsp;powers should come into effect but about whether the people of Wales should even be asked their opinion on the matter. The Secretary of State has an aversion to controversy around this issue, as he noted in speaking to amendment No. 31. In that respect, he should take the opportunity now to avoid further conflict on the two-thirds majority issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_289">The Government will contend, I suppose, that the two-thirds majority would indicate a consensus. We have heard the Secretary of State and the Minister say that a number of times and that we should not proceed without such a majority. It is for the Minister to answer the points that I and perhaps other hon. Members will make.

<a name="stpa_291">The hon. Gentleman referred to the 1979&nbsp;referendum and the circumstances of it. I am haunted by that, although I did not take part in the campaign. From a distance I supported the yes campaign. I am also haunted by the narrowness of the vote in 1997. Unlike 1979, the Labour party was not bitterly divided on the question in 1997. In 1979, there was a minority saying yes and a majority probably no. The referendum was lost four to one. I do not think that we should go anywhere near a referendum that could produce those circumstances. That is why I built in carefully a two-thirds vote in the Assembly, which would require at least, in the current political configuration and that for the foreseeable future, Welsh Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats to be united, as we were in 1997. Even then, the referendum was only narrowly won.

<a name="stpa_292">If we put in place a mechanism that could result in an opportunistic vote in the Assembly with the current political arithmetic, the Opposition, even for the sake of embarrassing the Government&#151;it is difficult to foresee, but one could imagine it&#151;could force on the ruling Welsh Assembly Labour Government and on the Government here a referendum that could not be won by any objective assessment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami) pointed out, that would do terrible damage to the cause of devolution and to the cause in which the hon. Member for Caernarfon believes&#151;that of an Assembly with primary powers. This is not a roadblock; it is a sensible precaution.

<p><a name="st_326">The amendment relates to the period after the Assembly has voted in favour of moving forward on the proposal to this place for an Order for primary legislative powers. This is an unusual section of the Bill because it addresses a period that most parties agree is some time distant from today. It is not within the contemplation&#151;I hope&#151;of the Government to bring forward proposals at this stage for a referendum to introduce the part 4&nbsp;process. We are therefore talking about a period that is some years hence&#151;my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State mentioned 2011-plus.</p>













<p><a name="st_327">In those circumstances, it is appropriate that if we are to consider the position politically at that time, there should be some provision in the process for a broader reflection on the Assembly to take place. The amendment proposes that after the Assembly asks for primary legislative powers there should be a consultation process, so that the people of Wales can be asked two questions relating to the Assembly.</p>













<p><a name="st_328">The first question relates to the voting system for the Assembly. We should not assume that the system that was put in place by the Government of Wales Act 1998&nbsp;should be set in stone for ever. If we are to have an Assembly with primary legislative powers, we shall have a different creature to the body created by the 1998&nbsp;Act. It would thus be entirely appropriate at that stage at 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1401</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>least to consult the people of Wales on the voting system that should be used to elect the new Assembly&#151;if I may call it that.</p>













<p><a name="st_329">People have extremely different views on the appropriate voting system for the Assembly at present. I am satisfied that the legislative powers for the Assembly that are proposed by the Bill are not so different from the existing powers that they require the system to be reconsidered at the moment. A referendum was held in 1998&nbsp;and an additional member system was introduced. When a further referendum is held, there should be at least consultation so that the people of Wales can consider whether it is appropriate to continue with the additional member system. I have strong views on the matter. The Richard commission put forward several views, and the parties have different views on the system that should used. It would thus be right and proper to ask the question at the time of the referendum.</p>











<p><a name="st_330"><a name="60124-34_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. Will he tell the Committee which voting system he prefers? He says that he has strong views on the matter, but has not explained the voting system that he would like to see at that stage.

<p><a name="st_331"><a name="60124-34_spnew1"><b> Ian Lucas: </b>

 That is very clear. Why has the hon. Gentleman restricted his amendment so that it allows consideration of the number of Assembly Members, but not commensurate consideration of the number of Members of Parliament at the same time?
</p>








<p><a name="st_333"><a name="60124-34_spnew3"><b> Ian Lucas: </b> 
 The amendment proposes consultation. If primary powers are allocated to the Assembly following a referendum, the Labour Government are likely to reduce the number of Welsh Members of Parliament, just as they did with Scottish Members, because the Labour party is a generous party. When the Labour party considered voting systems, it even assisted the official Opposition by ensuring that they had additional Assembly Members in Wales although they could not win a first-past-the-post seat.

 Indeed. My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. It is for that reason that I suggested a consultation. The issues are controversial. The importance of raising the subject at this stage is that unless the Bill is amended, the issues cannot be considered within the context of the referendum debate that will take place so far in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_295">The second aspect of the consultation relates to the size of the Assembly in terms of the number of Members. Clearly, an Assembly that has primary legislative powers will have a scrutiny role that goes far beyond the existing scrutiny role of the National Assembly for Wales. It is not often that politicians call for more politicians. I am afraid that I will do so, because one of the most important aspects of any legislator&#039;s job is to scrutinise legislation. My personal sense is that it would be essential to increase the number of Assembly Members if primary legislative powers were to be granted to the National Assembly for Wales. Any sensible discussion in the lead-up to a referendum on primary legislative powers would inevitably touch on that issue. Again, with the Bill as it stands, it is difficult to envisage how that could be sensibly raised and how more Members could be introduced.

 I did consider the length of time, because the amendment stipulates a length of time. However, it is optimistic. I am not wedded to it. I was conscious that I did not want an extended period of consultation because I did not want to delay the process if the decision had been made by the Assembly. On the other hand, it would be necessary for a consultation to take place over a period of time, and for that reason I included the 120&nbsp;days.

I am not underestimating the significance of those issues, but we have to understand that, at the end of the day, the Welsh people want to consider how devolution affects their lives.

<p><a name="st_350"><a name="60124-35_spnew0"><b> Mr. Tim Yeo  (South Suffolk) (Con):</b> 
 I am delighted to have this chance to raise in Parliament the crisis in the health service in my constituency and in particular the threatened closure of Walnuttree hospital in Sudbury, a highly valued community hospital. The closure of Walnuttree, the loss of its in-patient beds and the ending of many out-patient services that are at present provided at the hospital, will be devastating for the town and the surrounding neighbourhood. The proposal has been brought forward by the Suffolk West primary care trust&#151;which I will refer to simply as the trust&#151;at a time when the population of both Sudbury and Cornard is planned to grow significantly and when the trust itself has confirmed that Sudbury has the highest level of mortality in the county. The proposal runs directly counter to Government policy, and the way in which the trust has handled it has destroyed the faith of my constituents in the integrity of the consultation process and the decisions that are likely to follow it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_301">Walnuttree serves 20,000&nbsp;people in Sudbury and Cornard and thousands more in the nearby villages. It enjoys very high respect because of the quality of care provided by the dedicated and outstanding staff, many of whom have worked at the hospital for years. However, the hospital building&#151;a former Victorian workhouse&#151;has long been regarded as unsuitable, and it is greatly to the credit of the staff that the patients who have occupied its 68&nbsp;beds and the people who use the&nbsp;out-patient services rarely if ever complain about the service that they receive. That is in contrast to the experience of some of my constituents in West Suffolk hospital at Bury St. Edmunds, where complaints are, regrettably, not infrequent. Unfortunately, patients who in the past have used Walnuttree will, if it is closed, be forced to go to West Suffolk hospital instead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_302">Proposals for a new hospital in Sudbury to replace Walnuttree have been around for 20&nbsp;years, and recently hopes were high that final approval for its replacement was imminent. It was a shock, therefore, in 2004&nbsp;when local officials produced an apparently damning fire safety report and used it as a pretext to recommend the hospital&#039;s closure. A big local campaign was mounted, with all-party support, to fight that threat. In November 2004, my former Labour opponent, Kevin Craig, and I jointly delivered a 10,000-signature petition to Downing street.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_303">Great was the relief when that campaign persuaded local officials to see sense and a programme of fire safety work was announced. The then chief executive of Suffolk West primary care trust promised that Walnuttree would remain open until a replacement was built. In February 2005, the outline business plan for that replacement was approved by the strategic health authority. The then Secretary of State for Health wrote to Kevin Craig before the general election and said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;Kevin .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you have ensured that the voices of local people have been heard at the highest levels of Government.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_304">The Chancellor of the Exchequer, no less, was quoted in Kevin Craig&#039;s election literature congratulating him on his role in that successful campaign. By April 2005, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1405</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>plans for the replacement hospital were well advanced and had been endorsed by a Department of Health gateway review report on the outline business case. Days before the general election, another meeting in Sudbury was assured that the new in-patient hospital would be built prior to the closure of the old site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_305">Alas, with the election out of the way and a new chief executive in place at the trust, all those promises were suddenly cast aside. In June, the trust dropped its bombshell: Walnuttree was to be closed after all. No replacement in-patient beds were to be provided, just a glorified GP surgery. Even the in-patient services provided at Walnuttree were to be transferred to West Suffolk hospital 20&nbsp;miles away.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_306">The reaction in the town was outrage. Days after the news broke, I chaired one of the biggest public meetings ever held in Sudbury, and the Walnuttree hospital action committee was formed. In July, with other Suffolk Members of Parliament and Lord Phillips of Sudbury, I met the Secretary of State, who assured us that the consultation process would be taken seriously. However, the trust&#039;s consultation paper, &quot;Modernising Healthcare in West Suffolk&quot; was a seriously flawed document, which stressed the need for financial savings but suggested only one way of achieving them&#151;through savage cuts in local services and the closure of Walnuttree.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_307">Throughout summer and autumn, the community mounted the biggest protest campaign in my constituency in the past 23&nbsp;years. I pay tribute to the action committee, including its chair, Colin Spence; Michael Mitchell, a porter at the hospital; Michael Mandelstam; the mayor of Sudbury, Lesley Ford-Platt; Richard Titford of Sudbury Churches Together; Sylvia Byham, and Peter Clifford. Those are just a few of the people who have done outstanding work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_308">The committee adopted a highly professional approach, raising money to commission an expert study of the proposal and its likely effects, and offering to work with the trust to achieve an outcome that was acceptable to the local community and more consistent with stated Government policy. Regrettably, the trust rebuffed that approach. I much regret that the trust&#039;s new chief executive, Mike Stonard, has obstructed the action committee&#039;s attempts to find a solution to the problem, to the extent of resorting on occasion to untrue statements and evasions when asked straightforward questions, and casting wholly unjustified aspersions on the integrity of people who are campaigning to protect our health service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_309">Truth has, on occasion, flown out of the window during the course of the argument. During Health questions on 22&nbsp;November last year, I was told by the Secretary of State:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;Walnuttree .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has already had &#163;300,000&nbsp;invested in it to bring it up to the standard required by fire safety regulations&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 22&nbsp;November 2005; Vol. 439, c. 1358.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_310">When I challenged that assertion, the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), wrote to me on 24&nbsp;December saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;I have noted your comments about the advice given by officials being misleading in relation to the &#163;300,000&nbsp;spent at the Walnuttree Hospital to bring it up to fire safety regulations. I should point out that I have been assured that this advice is accurate.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1406</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_311">Last week, inquiries made under the Freedom of Information Act 2000&nbsp;revealed that expenditure on fire safety works during 2005&nbsp;actually amounted to &#163;100,000, not &#163;300,000. The Under-Secretary may like to apologise on behalf of both the Secretary of State and the Minister of State for their inadvertent misleading of the House. I hope that the Department will now examine the sources of the incorrect information that it was given.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_312">The trust&#039;s consultation document refers to increased provision of intermediate care&#151;something that everyone in Suffolk welcomes&#151;but it utterly fails to make even a remotely convincing case for its claim that all those who in the past have received in-patient treatment at Walnuttree can be catered for in the community. Even the trust&#039;s own rules define a set of patients as ineligible for care in the community, which includes those without a carer at home, those whose home is unsuitable, those whose needs are too great, and those who do not have the potential for rehabilitation within six weeks. Nor has the trust explained how the cost of all that extra treatment in the community will be met.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_313">Those proposals will also place a heavy burden on both Suffolk county council social services and on West Suffolk hospital. Unfortunately, in the current year&#151;before the trust&#039;s proposals come into operation&#151;the social services department already faces an overspend of &#163;2.7&nbsp;million. Far from being unable to cope with any extra burden, the department is looking for ways to make savings. West Suffolk hospital also faces a cash crisis and is planning to close beds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_314">The driver of the trust&#039;s proposals is not, as Mike Stonard claims, its desire to introduce an improved model of care. It is all about saving money. So desperate is the crisis that management is breaking all its previous promises and introducing measures that will clearly damage patients. Since it is only about money, why did the trust not consider whether it would be cheaper to keep open the in-patient beds at Walnuttree, as community beds are generally understood to be cost effective?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_315">The truth is that if the trust wanted to improve services in Sudbury, it would revert to the previous evidence-based successful model of care, which included some in-patient beds at Walnuttree, alongside improved services in the community. Ramming through bed closures by alleging that none of the patients who has used them in the past will in future ever need to be treated anywhere other than at home is absurd. Some patients will be inappropriately left at home to suffer or even die without proper community support. Others, as the trust admits, will have to be accommodated within West Suffolk hospital, aggravating the problem of bed blocking and causing longer waiting lists, in direct contradiction of Government policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_316">As the Audit Commission said in its report, &quot;The Way to Go Home&#151;Rehabilitation and Remedial Services for Older People&quot;,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">&quot;there is a danger that in the general confusion around the term &#039;intermediate care&#039;, older people will not receive the care they need&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para16">
<a name="stpa_317">Bear it in mind that less than a year ago the outline business case proposed, after months of consultation and with widespread local support, a model of care that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1407</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>included 32&nbsp;new in-patient beds in the new hospital that would replace Walnuttree. What changed between February and June last year to render this model suddenly irrelevant? Not the evidence about patient need. Not the needs of the community. Not the number of people requiring care at Walnuttree. All that changed was the decision of the trust to put the demands of the accountants ahead of the interests of patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para17">
<a name="stpa_318">Ironically, the letter in which the Minister of State made her inaccurate claim about what had been spent on fire safety included a statement of policy on community hospitals. She stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;Our commitment to community hospitals is to support a new generation of community hospitals that can meet the needs of local people&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para18">
<a name="stpa_319">I invite the Minister to tell the House this evening that he will instruct the trust to honour that commitment. Or was it, like so many statements from Ministers now, just words, which the Minister never intended should have any real meaning?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para19">
<a name="stpa_320">Community hospitals are, after all, not just cheaper and more cost effective for in-patients than acute hospitals; they are closer to home, patient friendly and offer more continuity of care provision. What is more, the Minister of State has boasted of &#163;100&nbsp;million being available to develop them. What about a fraction of that for Sudbury?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para20">
<a name="stpa_321">It is not only in-patients who will suffer. Last year the outline business case included consultant clinics at the replacement hospital. These, too, have disappeared from the trust&#039;s plans for Sudbury and will instead be moved to West Suffolk hospital in order to save &#163;40,000&nbsp;a year. At least in this regard the trust admits that decentralised services can sometimes be more expensive, a factor that it conveniently overlooks when costing the extra intermediate care which it claims will be provided in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para21">
<a name="stpa_322">Centralising the clinics in West Suffolk hospital will greatly burden the patients who use them. The car journey to West Suffolk hospital from Sudbury takes half an hour at best, costs a significant amount and adds to pollution, including CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. Many elderly patients have no access to a car and will have to make the bus journey of more than an hour, which culminates in a five-minute uphill walk from the bus stop to the hospital&#151;something that no one at the hospital was even aware of until I pointed it out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para22">
<a name="stpa_323">I tried the bus journey myself last August and invited the directors of the trust to join me. None did, possibly fearing that first-hand knowledge of what they were planning to inflict on vulnerable patients, who until now have enjoyed a local service, might force them to admit their mistake. Incidentally, patients report that the hospital&#039;s own transport service is even worse and can take up to six hours door to door because of the need to collect patients from all over a dispersed rural area.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para23">
<a name="stpa_324">Ministers have stressed the Government&#039;s commitment to patient choice, but patient choice is not what the trust will provide. Ministers have spoken about care closer to home, but the trust is taking care for many patients further away from home. Not surprisingly, nobody affected by these proposals supports them. The three main GP practices in Sudbury, including one that could benefit if the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="stpa_328">Five thousand letters have been sent to the Secretary of State, and 3,500&nbsp;submissions have been made to the trust. There is not a shred of justification for the proposals. They will harm the population that they are supposed to serve, and they contradict Government policy. Understandably, residents now have little faith in the integrity of the consultation process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para28">
<a name="stpa_329">In East Suffolk, where 90&nbsp;per cent. of the responses to the consultation, &quot;Changing for the better: next steps&quot;, criticised the proposals, the agency interpreting the data on behalf of the various trusts commented:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">&quot;The consultation questionnaire was assessed to have poorly drafted questions that tended to lead respondents towards an apparently &quot;obvious&quot; (and negative) answer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What little evidence there is suggests the response sample was not representative .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the health community would be unwise to place excessive weight upon the quantitative views expressed during this consultation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para29">
<a name="stpa_330">Would that have been the reaction if the public had backed the proposals? I fear that when the responses to the Suffolk West primary care trust consultation are analysed, a similar charade will occur. If the questions do not produce the answers that the trust wants, someone will say that they were the wrong questions, and the people who replied to them will not be considered representative. To make matters worse, the Suffolk West primary care trust will soon be abolished, before its bosses have to answer for the damage and suffering that their proposals will be inflicting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-35_para30">
<a name="stpa_331">One final point must be emphasised. Although the trust must bear a big share of the responsibility for what has gone wrong, it is also true that Suffolk West has been disgracefully treated in cash terms by the Department of Health. Serious underfunding from the centre has compounded the problems with which the trust has had to grapple. The tragedy is that, against that background, the solution that the trust proposes will not solve the problem.

He takes a keen interest in health matters in Suffolk, and he has recently raised the matter of health services in his constituency in parliamentary questions and correspondence, to which ministerial colleagues have recently replied. Indeed, the Secretary of State and other ministerial colleagues have also been fortunate enough to meet several of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s colleagues and fellow local MPs in Suffolk and the wider strategic health authority area to discuss local health services.

<a name="stpa_333">Before I turn to the vital local matters that the hon. Gentleman has raised, I hope that the House will permit me to sketch a little of the background to this debate. The national health service is now in receipt of record resources. Funding of the NHS has increased from &#163;35&nbsp;billion to nearly &#163;70&nbsp;billion, and by 2007&#150;08, that will rise again to &#163;92&nbsp;billion. That is a huge increase.

<a name="stpa_335">Those new staff up and down the country have done an enormous amount of work in shortening waiting lists. The number of people receiving treatment in hospital has increased by three quarters of a million to over 5.5&nbsp;million, up by 16&nbsp;per cent. since 1997. The total number of people waiting is down by more than 25&nbsp;per cent., and the number of people waiting for more than three months by more than 50&nbsp;per cent. The result, quite simply, is the saving of lives. Cancer mortality rates in England are down by 12&nbsp;per cent., and the mortality rate for circulatory disease in England has fallen by 27&nbsp;per cent.

Gentleman&#039;s constituency has received an extra &#163;49&nbsp;million between 2003&#150;04&nbsp;and 2005&#150;06. I am glad that he raised the issue of fair funding. Fair funding would not have been promoted by the patient&#039;s passport, on which he campaigned in his constituency during the election. I am glad that that policy has gone into the bin. The introduction of fair funding is important in Suffolk, because it will raise health funding to the necessary level. Between 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08, the total amount of extra money for Suffolk is set to rise by &#163;86&nbsp;million. There are deficits in some Suffolk trusts, but it is important to note that the level of increased funding for primary care trusts in Suffolk is nearly 2.5&nbsp;times that of current deficits.

<a name="60124-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_339">The pace of change with which funds have been increased is important. The hon. Gentleman said he did not feel that his area had been treated well in the past. In the future, the rate of funding will rise by nearly 21.5&nbsp;per cent. That is more than the national average, which is just 19.5&nbsp;per cent.

<a name="60124-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_340">At a time when the amount of money is rising, it is important for the local NHS to spend time on getting services right. There are no more important services than those that support older people and those with long-term conditions, not just because they have given their country and their community a lifetime&#039;s service but because they are the nation&#039;s biggest users of the NHS. Two thirds of NHS acute beds at any one time are occupied by someone over the age of 65, and we believe that about 80&nbsp;per cent. of NHS costs are spent on the

<br>&nbsp;<br>15&nbsp;million people with long-term conditions. Services for older people and those with long-term conditions need to be strengthened, in Suffolk as elsewhere. The principles that underpin the current consultation in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency must be in line with the&nbsp;policy of transforming emergency care to support the care of both older people and people with long-term conditions closer to home, which is where they want it to be. That means supporting people in their own homes with integrated health and social care teams, often co-ordinated by community matrons, in a model of care&nbsp;that has been successfully introduced elsewhere in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the NHS and already exists in many parts of Suffolk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intermediate care is needed that progresses rehabilitation much faster, enabling people to maintain their independence, so they do not become completely reliant on episodic hospital care.

 I have two or three more important points to make in the last five minutes. If I get a pause, I will give way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_341">The key point about modernisation of services in Suffolk is that 20th century models of services, which often trapped patients in hospitals, simply do not meet the needs of patients, families and, importantly, carers, and nor do they exploit advances in assistive technology. The public have told PCTs that they need to co-ordinate services better with social care so that people do not spend unnecessary time in hospital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_342">Rightly, there will always be popular affection for well-established local institutions such as the Walnuttree. That is surely no crime&#151;NHS professionals change people&#039;s lives. I will always remember the surgeon who struggled to save my mother&#039;s life and the midwives who delivered my children. Surely the 2,500&nbsp;responses in east Suffolk, the 3,500&nbsp;responses in West Suffolk and the 29,000&nbsp;people who signed nine separate petitions across the county to show their support for the Walnuttree reflect that instinct. Such views must be balanced against the need for the NHS to modernise and provide the most appropriate care for patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_343">The hon. Gentleman made an important point about statements made to the House about spending on the Walnuttree. The chief executive of the primary care trust will now write back to him explaining exactly how the &#163;300,000, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State gave as information to the House, was spent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-36_para12">
<a name="stpa_344">Over the years to come, important changes will be needed to the way in which money is spent. Surely it is good that the local community in Suffolk has to consider how to spend another &#163;86.5&nbsp;million over the next two years in delivering 21st century care. The White Paper on health and social care, which will shortly be presented to the House, will have a great deal to say about how care needs to be shifted much closer to the community, how we need to shift the balance of spending from acute hospitals into preventive services, and importantly, how health and social care must work more closely together.

<p><a name="st_358"><a name="60124-37_spnew0"><b> Mr. Yeo: </b> 
 In the four or five minutes that the Minister has left, can he explain why what was such a good idea&#151;backed by the Department of Health, the strategic health authority and the local trust&#151;the day before the election, turned out to be such a bad idea a month later?
</p>








<p><a name="st_359"><a name="60124-37_spnew1"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 Unfortunately, I was not party to the plans developed before the election, but the important point raised by the hon. Gentleman is how the proposals currently on the table, which I understand will be decided on and published after the board meeting at the end of February, match up to Government policy. When the primary care trust reaches its decision and publishes it to the local community, it is important that it explains how the proposals that it has considered line up against the White Paper to be published shortly. As I said, that White Paper will contain a number of important principles. It will talk about how we shift money into preventive services, how we give people far more control of their own care, and how we ensure that health and social care work much more closely together.
</p>








<p><a name="st_360"><a name="60124-37_spnew2"><b> Mr. Spring: </b> 
 The Minister is replying with great courtesy but, with respect, he is living in complete fantasy. The idea that there are integrated care teams and that people can exist to be part of those teams is nonsense because there is already a shortage of people in the county of Suffolk who could undertake that job. Although he is talking about increases, already, pre-emptively, at the main hospital in West Suffolk, 260&nbsp;people have had their jobs removed in the past few months, and 55&nbsp;beds have been removed. The crisis is deepening. With respect, his words are not linked to the reality on the ground. I am sorry to have the tell him that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_361"><a name="60124-37_spnew3"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention but services will often need to be changed as there are advances in the way people in social care and primary care work together. Of course, we would expect services to be reconfigured. We would also expect, for example, more services that are currently located in acute trusts to move closer to the community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60124-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_345">If we look at the way in which outpatient services are managed in every other modern health care system on the continent and the amount that is concentrated in primary care systems, there is a great contrast with our own system. We need to learn important lessons from that. We need to look at how, in certain disciplines such as ear, nose and throat, dermatology and a range of others, outpatient services can be moved into services that are closer to home. That will sometimes require reconfiguration of services that are centred on acute trusts. That agenda is based on strengthening services and that is why I want to underline&#151;
