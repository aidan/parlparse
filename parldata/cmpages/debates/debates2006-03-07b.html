<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60307-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Mr. Liam Byrne): </b> 
 Local authorities and the NHS are responsible for providing rehabilitation services for the visually impaired that are based on need. We have increased investment in both to ensure that commissioners have more money over the next two years with which to develop services.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60307-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Amess: </b> 
 In a written answer to me on 28&nbsp;November last year the Minister said that it was the responsibility of local health and social care bodies to commission facilities according to local needs. As he will know, Guide Dogs for the Blind conducted a survey which showed that 20&nbsp;per cent. of such bodies did not provide rehabilitation services because of lack of funds and lack of qualified staff. Will he please do all that he can to deal with that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60307-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is the secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on eye health and visual impairment, and has done a great deal to draw attention to the issues. I think there is consensus in all parts of the House that local communities are best placed to design the shape of services, but we made it clear in a recent White Paper that the director of adult social services will need to undertake a strategic assessment of local needs. Given that more than 300,000&nbsp;people in the country are blind or visually impaired, we expect their needs to be given prominence in the plans.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60307-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. John Baron  (Billericay)</b> 
 (Con): Despite what the Minister says, the fact remains that, as we have heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), some local authorities are simply not providing essential services. Given that Guide Dogs for

</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60307-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 We set out clearly the standards that we expect to operate in the national service framework that was published last year. It is incumbent on us to specify the right pathways of care, and we have done that, along with Guide Dogs for the Blind. It is also incumbent on us to ensure that the right level of resources is there, which is why local government is entering its ninth successive year of real-terms increases.

<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60307-01_spmin1"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Jane Kennedy): </b> 
 The home oxygen service has seen little change since 1948. Patients and health professionals have been pressing for a modernised service for some time. Of the approximately 60,000&nbsp;patients who use the service, 30,000&#151;the majority of the highly dependent patients&#151;transferred to the new service before 1&nbsp;February following an agreement between the suppliers.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o0">&quot;was always planned to be phased in over a six-month transition period and not &#039;suddenly switched&#039;.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">Will the Minister confirm that if the new oxygen regulations had been in force as planned, doctors would not have been allowed to write prescriptions after 1&nbsp;February and pharmacists would not have been able to supply according to those prescriptions? They would not have been able to bail the system out as they have, in effect saving lives. Will the Minister acknowledge that an administrative blunder has actually eased the situation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60307-01_spnew5"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 It is a shame that the hon. Lady added that last point. I very much appreciate the way in which community pharmacists, in particular, have worked with primary care trusts to deal with the problems that occurred during the first few weeks of the new service. As for the first part of the hon. Lady&#039;s question, if we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 705</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>phased in the service we clearly had to phase in the way in which we managed patients&#151;exactly the way in which we have managed the 30,000&nbsp;patients who are the most dependent of all. Obviously we must ensure that the oxygen service gives each patient the service that he or she requires, and that is why, when it is operating fully, the new service will prove very effective indeed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60307-01_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Linda Riordan  (Halifax)</b> 
 (Lab): Is the Minister aware that, in west Yorkshire, Air Products, which was contracted to supply home oxygen from 1&nbsp;February, has failed to do so, leaving patients high and dry? Local pharmacists who have lost their contracts with Air Products are kindly supplying the much-needed oxygen and keeping hospital admissions down. Will the Minister explain why the system has been changed, given that it was working so well before?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60307-01_spnew7"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The system was not working well. Only 55&nbsp;per cent. of pharmacies supplied oxygen cylinders. Supplies were delivered to the most dependent patients by other suppliers. This is not a process of privatisation; it will deliver a better service to patients&#151;precisely the service that patients and health care providers have been asking us to deliver.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60307-01_spnew8"><b> Andrew Rosindell  (Romford)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister not accept that the system that her Government have imposed simply is not working? Many of my constituents are suffering as a result, as are constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire). Many of the patients of Mr. Tariq Mahood, a pharmacist in the Mims pharmacy in North street, Romford, have not had the oxygen that they desperately need. Will the Government please review this policy as a matter of urgency?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60307-01_spnew9"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 We have been doing that, and I followed the operation of the new service not only from 1&nbsp;February but during the weeks beforehand. We have seen a surge in the number of general practitioner orders for patients with continuous or long-term needs, and it is not yet clear precisely why that has happened. There could be a number of reasons, including GPs reviewing the number of patients using high volumes of cylinder oxygen, or people beginning to exercise choice across the wider range of services now available. We are working closely with primary care trusts, GPs and patients to ensure that patients receive precisely the service that they need. As I have said, I am grateful for the way in which pharmacies and PCTs have co-operated with suppliers to ensure that these early problems with the service are ironed out very quickly.

 (Lab): One of my constituents has experienced the problem of oxygen cylinders that delivered the previously prescribed speed of oxygen no longer being available. That has prevented him from going to a day care centre, which is not willing to cope with the potential medical crisis. Might not such problems have been avoided if the scheme had been piloted? That way, they could have been identified in just one area and the lessons learned before the scheme was rolled out across the country.

<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60307-01_spnew11"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the case of her constituent; I will look into the detail of it. Clearly, the intention is to improve the service on offer, not to diminish it. The new service was consulted on extensively and it is a response that we have been planning since 2003. My hon. Friend suggests that we could have piloted it, but as I have said, 30,000&nbsp;patients went on to it before 1&nbsp;February and the suppliers have co-operated to ensure delivery. Once we have ironed out the early problems that some patients are experiencing, the new service will prove very popular indeed.

 (LD): Back in the middle of January, I challenged the Minister in a written question on the changes to the home oxygen service, making specific reference to the impact on patient safety. Her reply was blandness itself. Does she now accept that the change-over has been botched and that, potentially, lives have been lost? Will she take responsibility?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60307-01_spnew13"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his re-appointment to the Front Bench as health spokesman. His question was posed in characteristically robust terms, but no, I do not accept that patients&#039; lives are at risk in the way that he describes. As I explained in my earlier answers, I am aware that there have been problems, and we are working very hard to address them. As I have also said, it is important that the new service delivers oxygen to those who need it when they need it. These early problems have come about for a range of reasons, and I anticipate that we will get over them very rapidly.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60307-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Andrew Lansley  (South Cambridgeshire)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister not understand that this has been a shambles? The position is very simple. She says that there are many reasons for the problems, and no doubt she will find many people to blame for the shambles, but the reality is that pharmacists were de-stocking on oxygen cylinders because they expected the contractors to provide them, and GPs believed that they could send orders through to the contractors and did not seem to realise that they should do so only for repeat prescriptions. The net result is that the contractors ended up with thousands of orders that they had no means of prioritising or responding to. The Minister says that she examined the new service beforehand, but as I say, it is a shambles. She should have thanked the pharmacists for bailing the Department out in her first answer to the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley), not in her second. She should also say sorry to the patients, pharmacists and GPs who have had to cope with the Department&#039;s failed administration.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60307-01_spnew15"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 I have not blamed anyone for the shambles&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Opposition Members should wait for my answer. I have said that there were problems, and that we are working hard to overcome them. As perhaps we should have anticipated, one of the problems was that some patients would ring up to inquire about the new services on offer. We did not have the number of telephone lines that we could have made available had we anticipated those inquiries, and we can learn lessons from that. The suppliers have experienced difficulties in responding to telephone orders, and have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 707</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>increased the number of lines available for dealing with queries. Equally, there have been variations in the amount of details being given as we have changed from using prescriptions to using proper order forms for arranging supplies. The order form requires GPs to give more details than was the case in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">We are learning from all those factors, and we are working with suppliers and the health service to ensure that the service that we deliver is precisely the one that we intend to deliver, and the one that suppliers are committed to delivering in the future.

<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60307-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Jane Kennedy): </b> 
 The addition of small levels of colorants to medicines can often be justified as a way of identifying and distinguishing the different types and strengths of a medicine. That can be very important to patients taking several medicines, for example. However, the use of any substance in a medicine, as well as the drug itself, must be justified under EU legislation before it is granted a marketing authorisation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60307-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Leech: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that answer. I became interested in this matter when a constituent told me about the difficulty of finding a medicine that did not have a particular colorant. My constituent needed the colorant-free version because of an allergy. However, I was surprised to be told by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency that one reason for the use of colorants was to improve appearance. Given the obvious danger that young children will consume medicines and pills because they think that they are sweets and drinks, and the recent tragic case&#151;

</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60307-02_spnew3"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 I do not accept that that is necessary. The MHRA will investigate any reports of an adverse reaction to a medicine, whether that is due to the colorants or any other additive, or to the medicine&#039;s basic ingredients. It will also investigate any reports suggesting that there is a wider problem related to a particular colouring additive that may alter the benefit from the use of that medicine. Any company that wants to use an additive in a medicine has to receive approval for its use. I believe that the system is working pretty well. I shall look at the point raised by the hon. Gentleman, but I do not think that there is any need for a review at the moment.

 I should like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to Sir Nigel Crisp, who announced today that he will retire at the end of this month, after more than five years as chief executive of the NHS and permanent secretary at the Department of Health.

<a name="stpa_o3">To turn to the question, in February 2006&nbsp;the Derbyshire Dales and South Derbyshire primary care trust and the Greater Derby PCT reported that all primary care practices in their areas were able to make an appointment with a GP within two working days, and with a primary care professional within one working day.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60307-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Todd: </b> 
 The preface to that answer made me think that Sir Nigel was taking a personal interest in South Derbyshire, and I was saddened by the announcement. How adequate does my right hon. Friend think are the tools to deal with rapid population growth, such as the Swadlincote area has experienced over the past 10&nbsp;years? There has been a predictable increase in demand for primary care, and many of my roughly 10,000&nbsp;extra constituents concentrated around Swadlincote often struggle to get registered with a GP. Relying on a local improvement finance trust scheme to deliver that service means that they face a very long wait.

 I understand my hon.

He refers to the new health and social care facilities at Swadlincote, and they will be an enormous improvement in the facilities that are offered to his constituents. I am sure that the local primary care trust, with the additional funding that it will continue to receive over the next few years, will do everything possible to go on improving services for his constituents, as we have been doing.

 Our priority is front-line care, where patients are served, and we are increasing resources at such a rate in the NHS that there is an obligation on us to use the money well.

 The most recent assessment of dentists&#039; numbers was the 2004 &quot;Report of the Primary Care Dental Workforce Review&quot;. Since April 2004, we have recruited the equivalent of an extra 1,100&nbsp;dentists in the NHS. Last year, we announced that we would 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 711</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>increase dental training places by 170&nbsp;each year, and in January we announced the opening of a new dental school at the Peninsula medical school.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o41"><a name="60307-03_spnew2"><b> Linda Gilroy: </b> 
 I welcome the resources that my hon. Friend and her Department have found for the new dental school in Plymouth, especially as it will bring 150&nbsp;jobs and capacity equivalent to about 20&nbsp;dentists even in the early years. However, does she agree that preventive health care will make the biggest difference to dental treatment and the availability of dental health care to our constituents? Will she urge the new dental school to consider what it can do to drive that agenda forward?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o42"><a name="60307-03_spnew3"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on her assiduousness in pressing for the dental school in her constituency. She is absolutely right to say that that preventive care is extremely important. Not only do we have a public health strategy for oral health, but an important part of the new contract is that it allows dentists to spend time on preventive health care, as well as other treatments.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o43"><a name="60307-03_spnew4"><b> Sir Paul Beresford  (Mole Valley)</b> 
 (Con): I declare an interest&#151;it is becoming a habit. I am fascinated by the Minister&#039;s reply. She will be aware that dental students need academic clinical teachers. Does she agree that the 6&nbsp;per cent. reduction in the number of academic clinical teachers over the past year could present a problem? Some 20&nbsp;per cent. of those teachers are over 55, and 33&nbsp;per cent. of them are aged 45&nbsp;to 55. Does she agree that we must face the fact that there is a possible problem with a new school, more places and more students, but fewer teachers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o44"><a name="60307-03_spnew5"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises an important point, which we have been looking at in relation to the way that we deliver dental training. As well as training to recruit more academics, we can consider other things, such as outreach schools, where students spend more time perfecting their skills in the community, as well as in the school. He is absolutely right to suggest that this issue is important, and I can assure him that we are looking at it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o45"><a name="60307-03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Paul Truswell  (Pudsey)</b> 
 (Lab): Is not one of the immediate problems about the supply of NHS dentists the fact that those who opt out of the service are writing to patients inviting them to opt into a Denplan contract on a first-come, first-served basis, before those patients know whether there will be any NHS re-provision in the area? Would that not have been prevented if the cut-off date for agreeing the contract had been somewhat earlier?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o46"><a name="60307-03_spnew7"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 We had the cut-off date for the contract fit in with the financial year, which also gave the NHS time to prepare for it. My hon. Friend is absolutely right, however, to say that some patients have found the position misleading, which has angered many people in the primary care trusts. The impression has been given that NHS dentistry is not going to continue if a dentist withdraws, but the fact is that the PCT will, under the new system, have money locally. Whether a dentist decides to take up a new contract is up to the dentist, but 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 712</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the primary care trust will re-provide dentistry from elsewhere, and many NHS dentists are coming forward to say that they want to do that where others do not.

 (Con): Given that NHS dentistry is largely unavailable in Lincolnshire, and given further that there is a precedent for the national health service paying for operations that cannot be performed within it within a stated time, why is the same principle not applied to private dental fees incurred by patients who cannot get NHS dentistry because it is not available? Why, in those circumstances, does not the NHS pay those private dental fees?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o48"><a name="60307-03_spnew9"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 Most NHS dentists are, in fact, independent contractors. The NHS contracts with them, and in future that will be done in an improved way. We have had no control: if a dentist left the NHS, there was no way in which the local primary care trust had the money to recommission local dentistry. The reforms that we are introducing change all that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_o4">I am aware that there are particular problems in Lincolnshire, which has received substantial access money to increase availability.

<p><a name="st_o49"><a name="60307-03_spmin2"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Ms Rosie Winterton): </b> 
 Under the new contract, a highly committed NHS dentist can expect to earn, on average, around &#163;80,000&nbsp;per year, with additional money for practice expenses. That will be guaranteed for three years, along with a 5&nbsp;per cent. reduction in work load.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o50"><a name="60307-03_spnew10"><b> Steve McCabe  (Birmingham, Hall Green)</b> 
 (Lab): Eighty thousand plus! Given that figure, is it right for dentists in Birmingham to claim that they are being ripped off by the Government? In some cases, like doorstep cowboys, they have been attempting to blackmail elderly people into purchasing private insurance that they do not need and cannot afford. Surely that is no way for professional people to conduct what is essentially a trade dispute.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o51"><a name="60307-03_spnew11"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to point out that we are offering &#163;80,000, plus practice expenses, guaranteed for three years, and a 5&nbsp;per cent. reduction in work load&#151;which seems to me to be a fair offer to dentists&#151;as well as introducing a system that will greatly benefit patients. He is quite right, too, to say that many primary care trusts have been worried by some of the information disseminated to patients, which quite frankly has been unnecessarily alarmist. Patients should not feel that they must be driven into private insurance. If a dentist decides not to come with us but to leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NHS, the money will be available locally to recommission dentistry from other dentists.

</p>

 I am not sure whether I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. Is he saying that patients have to use a different number to make an appointment? That is not current practice. Most people contact their dentist by ringing an ordinary number.

 (Lab): Does my hon.

They do not need their teeth cleaned or examined; all they need is access to a dentist when their false teeth need repairing or upgrading.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="60307-03_spnew15"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to say that that practice is unacceptable. We are making changes to the registration of denturists, who can undertake some of the work that he has mentioned; with appropriate training, they can undertake some of those tasks separately, too.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o56"><a name="60307-03_spnew16"><b> Tim Loughton  (East Worthing and Shoreham)</b> 
 (Con): Given that the Government are making an offer that dentists apparently cannot refuse, and that the deadline passed at the end of last month, will the Minister tell us whether more NHS dentists will be providing services after 1&nbsp;April? Has there not been a distinct lack of dentists signing up to the new contract in the Minister&#039;s Doncaster constituency? As a result, more patients will pay more for treatment, if they can get it, while dentists who do sign up will be paid less for performing the same work.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o57"><a name="60307-03_spnew17"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 All the indications suggest that the vast majority of dentists will sign up to the new contract. As I have said, if dentists do not want to sign up, local primary care trusts now have the money to recommission dentistry.

 Where from?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o59"><a name="60307-03_spnew19"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 Some NHS dentists say that they will expand their lists if other local dentists do not want to sign up. Over and above that, international recruitment has taken place, and 1,000&nbsp;recruits are going through the international qualifying examination. In addition, there are corporate bodies that want to undertake NHS dentistry. An extra &#163;315&nbsp;million is going into NHS dentistry compared with two years ago, so we can increase capacity and access for patients. The deal is good for dentists, but, importantly, it is good for patients, too.

 Is the Secretary of State aware that PCTs in Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire now face a combined shortfall of almost &#163;100&nbsp;million? Is it true that hospitals in Norfolk have been told to halt additional sessions, peg operating capacity at current levels and put a brake on making further inroads into waiting lists?

 What I have said on several occasions, both to the House and to the hon.

 I would like to take the opportunity offered by my hon. Friend&#039;s question to pay tribute to the excellent managers whom we are fortunate to have across the national health service. They are helping to ensure that one of the largest and most complex organisations in the world is treating more patients better and faster than ever before.

 The hon. Gentleman raises an important issue.

A tab of some &#163;2&nbsp;million has been picked up this year because of overspend in the health service.

 I will be happy to look at the two specific cases that the hon. Gentleman has raised; perhaps I could write to him on that point.

 Most organisations that at month six predicted an overspend for the end of this financial year have a relatively small problem.

There are, however, other organisations, including particularly the 15&nbsp;or so where we have appointed additional financial management support&#151;the turnaround directors&#151;where the problems will take longer to resolve.

 The hon. Gentleman is right. Where PCTs merge there will be fewer PPI forums in future, but that does not necessarily mean that there will be fewer people involved in them. The work of the consumer council, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, is a good example of the different ways in which it is possible to involve patients and users of services in decisions about how those services are improved in future. Harry Cayton, from within the Department, is leading an expert panel to examine the different ways in which we can promote exactly this sort of user involvement.

The United Kingdom needs a world-class migration system to attract the brightest and best from across the world, while being robust against attempted abuse. The new system will give employers and educational institutions a stronger role in the managed migration system, and will introduce a more transparent and objective method of points-based structured decision making, which will significantly improve the quality of decision making and reduce the opportunities for abuse.

 I thank my right hon. Friend for his statement and welcome the Government&#039;s attempts to simplify a complicated system. However, I remain gravely concerned that the new scheme will not address certain skills shortages in some areas&#151;for example, chefs in south Asian restaurants. There are 10,000&nbsp;south Asian restaurants in Britain, contributing &#163;3.2&nbsp;billion to the British economy, and there are 20,000&nbsp;vacancies. The scheme will not address their problems. Today, the Home Secretary has also abolished the sector-based scheme for certain quotas. I welcome his commitment to EU labour markets, but the people coming to the UK under the EU enlargement process take employment in those areas for only a short period and then move on quickly, creating even longer periods for vacancies in the sector. Will my right hon. Friend give the House an assurance that there will be the longest possible transition time, that the scheme will be monitored carefully and that if there are any problems with it he will report them to the House immediately so that a new scheme can be instituted?

 As the House knows, I very much respect my hon.

<p>
<a name="60307-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">On a more serious level, there is an important issue to address&#151;skills development for catering. Centres for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vocational excellence, including those in my constituency, are doing some strong work on that. The correct route, if there are skills shortages in south Asian catering, is to invest in skills development in that sector. I said so in Leicester some time ago to develop that precise area. We will of course monitor the situation closely, as my hon. Friend suggests, and we will do our best to make sure that if problems arise they are dealt with, which is why the skills base panel will assess the need for skills throughout the sector.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60307-06_spnew9"><b> Damian Green  (Ashford) (Con):</b> 
 As I live next door to a south Asian restaurant in my constituency, I am tempted to stick to the fairly narrow point made by the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), but we should widen the discussion. We welcome the principle of a points-based system for economic migration. We have been calling for one for some time because we believe that a firm, fair, controlled immigration system is best for people who want to come here and best for people who already live here.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The introduction of the new system is an implicit admission that the current system has failed. The Government have no control over our borders and no proper information about the most basic facts and figures. For instance, they thought that about 13,000&nbsp;people would come here from the new EU member states, but in fact 200,000&nbsp;come here every year. They also have a history of grand announcements on immigration, such as the plan to remove 30,000&nbsp;failed asylum seekers a year, which win a day&#039;s headlines but are then quietly dropped. I hope that the new system will be an improvement, but I wish to ask the Secretary of State a few helpful questions. First, what is the cost of setting up and running the system&#151;or at least the current Home Office estimate? Does he agree with his predecessor, who said that there was &quot;no obvious upper limit&quot; to immigration into this country? If not, is the new system designed to increase or reduce the numbers coming here to work? Under tier 3&nbsp;of the system, which applies to low-skilled migration, the document says that there have been concerns that employers should be required to recruit from the domestic labour force first. Do the Government intend to enforce that requirement?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">At the heart of the system is the skills advisory board, which decides how many people can come in under tiers 2&nbsp;and 3. Why are the Government only considering the skills aspect, which means that other vital factors, such as the increased need for new houses and extra pressures on public services, will not be taken into account? There is no discussion of those absolutely central issues in the document. Why not? We may know the answer to that question. There is much common ground on the principles. We all want a civilised and credible immigration system, but there are serious questions about the plan. We wish it well, and we hope it does not go the way of previous failed Government immigration policies. This country needs a properly controlled immigration system and we will support measures that genuinely bring that about.

Friend the Member for Witney (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cameron) in the Conservative manifesto at the last election. As for the points made by the hon.

As for whether the measure will increase or reduce the number of people, it is important to acknowledge&#151;I think that the hon. Gentleman does so in his article in <i>The Observer&#151;</i>that migration to work and migration to study are important to our economy and society, so we should welcome and encourage them. Illegal migration, however, is not acceptable, which is why the system is in place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_4">On the proposal that employers should be required to recruit from the domestic work force first, our straightforward position is that we encourage people to work, both from this country and from the European Union. If people come from outside that area to work, they should do so on the basis of this country&#039;s national priorities. It is therefore right to set skills as the top issue. It is because skills are absent in this country that we need to say that we should draw in people with the skills to fill the gaps. That is why the skills advisory board plays an important role. It does not decide what happens in tiers 2&nbsp;and 3&nbsp;but, none the less, it is an important advisory board.
</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60307-07_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Smith  (Oxford, East) (Lab):</b> 
 Can my right hon. Friend say more about the basis and procedure for determining what counts as a skills shortage?

</p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60307-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I can give my right hon. Friend that assurance, and I agree with him completely. We should look at skills in the round, and if there are particular sectors where there are skills shortages, for example, south Asian chefs&#151;I cite that example because our hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) raised it&#151;that is the area where we need to develop the skills capacity to deal with it. In his role in developing skills in the economy over recent years, my right hon. Friend made a major contribution in that regard. It is precisely because that work has been done that we can, in the document published today, talk about a skills advisory body based on that knowledge, which enables us to take it forward. That is the central issue that we must address, as we will do. It is important that we monitor it throughout because the way in which the skills advisory bodies will work is based on the sector skills councils, each of which has an analysis for its sector of the strengths and weaknesses of labour supply in its part of the economy. That will inform the judgments that are made about migration into the UK and points to be allocated on that basis.

<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 726</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>welcome to the announcement. Anything that takes the politics out of the immigration system and introduces a degree of objectivity to a system that has too long been plagued by subjectivity and arbitrary criteria is welcome. However, I have questions about two aspects. If I had been longer in my present position, I would probably have a longer list of question, but as I have not been, my questions are blissfully short. [hon. members: &quot;Oh.&quot;] I thought that might elicit a positive response in all parts of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_5">First, the credibility of the system will necessarily hinge on the operation of the skills advisory board. Could the Home Secretary provide more detail on the composition of the board? An assumption has been made in the past that employers&#039; organisations, trade unions, the public sector and the private sector would all be represented. The composition of the board is essential to ensure the right balance in an assessment of skills. Is it the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s expectation that the skills advisory board would try to pin down quotas&#151;a specific quantification&#151;for the skills in each sector? If so, that would have a great effect on the operation of the new system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_6">The second aspect on which I seek clarification is the effect that the system will have on the immigration of unskilled labour. If the purpose is to make the immigration of skilled labour more organised, we hope that that will not have an unduly restrictive and punitive effect on sectors that still need unskilled labour. In certain parts of the country fruit pickers are short of unskilled labour and, as we saw in Morecambe Bay last year, excessive amounts of unskilled labour going under the radar would lead to exploitative behaviour by employers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60307-07_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 First, I welcome the hon. Gentleman to his role. The longer he is in the role, the shorter his questions will be, in contrast to the way some parties operate. I look forward to working with him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_7">On politics and subjectivity, we will never remove politics from this area of national life, but I agree that objectivity and transparency in the system are exceptionally important. The system is intended to raise the quality of decisions. I hope that we can work together to ensure that the national debate on these matters is conducted in constructive and positive terms, rather than in the terms in which it has sometimes been conducted in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_8">On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s particular questions, the skills advisory board will be directly related to the sector skills councils and therefore the Sector Skills Development Agency, which organises and develops those councils. It will also directly involve trade unions and business in a wide variety of sectors that will report directly to the board. I think that many hon. Members are still not fully aware of the developing role of the sector skills councils and the way in which they are drawing in employers, vocational trainers and employees in each area. As they develop their work, they will be able to give detailed assessments of the skills shortages in their sectors. That is unlikely to lead to quotas in the sense of specific numbers, but it is likely to lead to information that will help the system to decide how many points should be allocated to people with particular skills in certain areas.

<a name="stpa_9">That, too, will be the principle on the unskilled labour side, which will particularly inform tier 3&nbsp;of our five-tier system. It will address the lack of skills in those sectors just as in all the others.

 The whole House welcomes the Government&#039;s efforts to improve the system and to bear down on abuse. However, I return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East. The south Asian restaurant sector, which is only tiny, has the particular problem that even top-quality chefs on the sub-continent are unlikely to have paper qualifications the like of which this scheme turns on. Equally, they are less likely to be in large sector-based organisations to make their case. All that we asking is that the Government pay particular attention to that sector so that our Indian, Thai and Chinese restaurateurs may be assured that the Government understand the significance of their sector and the contribution that they make to the quality of life in our big cities.
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="60307-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I can give two assurances. First, the Government understand the importance of the sector. My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East gave some important figures about the economic contribution of its members to the economy. It is fair to say that that contribution is not only to our economy, but to the breadth of our society and culture. I therefore give the assurance that my hon. Friend seeks and stress that we will continue to monitor the position closely. The real answer is investment in people in this country to develop their skills. The Government are committed to making that happen.

 The House, I am sure, applauded the Home Secretary&#039;s comment about the need, in the first case, to train people locally. In the light of the quadrupling of the number of work permits since the Government took office, from approximately 40,000&nbsp;a year to about 160,000, will he answer the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Damian Green) about what that means for overall numbers?
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60307-08_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am delighted to have eye contact with the hon. Gentleman. I cannot and will not answer the question because it derives from a proposition that, somehow, migration to work and study here is undesirable. I do not accept that. If one were to talk to people from many sectors of the economy, they would say that they welcome and need migration. I accept that it is necessary to tackle illegal migration and people who try to evade the system in various ways. The new system is designed to address that. It does not signpost a specific number&#151;up or down&#151;of people who migrate here to work or study. One of the reasons for the country&#039;s opposition to Conservative party policy at the general

<a name="stpa_11">How will that system of approving sponsors work? One could envisage many small organisations and companies, such as the restaurants that have already been mentioned, wanting to bring in a skilled employee. I hope that the system will be neither bureaucratic nor without an appeal mechanism for someone who is refused inclusion on the list of approved sponsors.
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60307-08_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I can strongly assure my hon. Friend that the proposal is not intended to be bureaucratic. Indeed, the reverse is true. We want to work in partnership&#151;perhaps a new word for the Home Office in the context that we are considering&#151;with large and small employers and universities, who ask people to come here to study and get much of their business from it, to administer and run the system in a non-bureaucratic way, thus resolving many of the problems of people needing to extend or change matters, sometimes using 80&nbsp;different lists of migration routes into the country. I give my hon. Friend an absolute assurance that we will guard against a bureaucratic approach and work with large and small employers to make the system work effectively.
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="60307-08_spnew8"><b> Mr. John Redwood  (Wokingham) (Con):</b> 
 Does the Home Secretary accept that there must be some limit on the overall number of economic migrants every year because of the pressure on water resources, transport capacity, housing and land, or will he tell us how those problems can be solved so that we can have unlimited economic migration?
</p>








<p><a name="st_27"><a name="60307-08_spnew9"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 A similar argument could be made for limiting by state diktat the number of people born every year. The country will operate on the basis of the number of economically active people who are in this country. Migrants fall into that category and they should and will contribute to the country&#039;s economic development, rather than the opposite. I know that the right hon. Gentleman acknowledges that that is the case in general. I hope that he agrees that our focus should be to stamp out abuse of the system rather than simply stopping people migrating here.

We envisage a time scale of between 18&nbsp;months and two years for implementing the whole process.

 The House will be shocked to hear that I agree that the activities of gangmasters and snakeheads are antisocial and should be driven out. The answer to the hon.

Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), measures to deal with people trafficking are a central priority in the system, and we shall carry that proposal through.

 The Governor of the Bank of England, among others, has stated that immigrant labour has been essential to maintaining the buoyancy of our economy.

Will he also take the opportunity to work with vice-chancellors to ensure that people from China and India who can provide graduate skills can stay here, perhaps using a similar system to the American green card, to make a contribution to our economy?

 Yes, I can give my right hon. Friend that assurance, provided that the contribution continues to be made.

 As the Home Secretary knows, the Council of Europe Migration Committee, on which I am happy to serve, is looking at these issues in considerable detail.

I particularly agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunwoody). Sadly, there is a great deal of evidence of abuse of migrant workers, not only irregular migrants but those who are here legally. Will the Home Secretary give the House an assurance that, across

I had a press briefing earlier today with the TUC and the CBI, both of which are utterly committed, with the Government, to maintaining precisely the civilised standards of employment that are a requirement that should operate for everyone in this country. I acknowledge, as I did to my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs Dunwoody), the fact that there remains a great deal of work to be done in this area.

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60307-09_spnew2"><b> Gwyn Prosser  (Dover) (Lab):</b> 
 I want to add my welcome to the new proposals, not least because they will enable us to crack down on the abuse of the immigration system in this country, just as past and present measures have enabled us to crack down on the abuse of our asylum system. The new proposals will involve the reintroduction of embarkation controls, which the Tories abandoned in 1994. How does my right hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_37"><a name="60307-09_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 There are two things to say about this. The first is that one of the effects of the scheme will be that it will be much easier to make applications internationally, so that many people seeking to enter the country who might previously have arrived at Dover will not need to go anywhere near it, because they will already know where they stand, the decision having been properly made in the country from which they come. The second, more substantive, answer to my hon. Friend&#039;s question is that our e-borders proposals, which we have already published, and the development of biometric documentation will enable us to address these questions at ports such as Dover much more effectively.

 If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting, as I think he is, that we should change the law to devolve migration issues to Scotland, I am afraid that I cannot agree.

<p><a name="st_40"><a name="60307-09_spnew6"><b> Dr. Phyllis Starkey  (Milton Keynes, South-West) (Lab):</b> 
 I share many of the concerns raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), among others, about the effect of the scheme on south Asian restaurants. The Home Secretary seems to be suggesting that the problem will be solved by the provision of more training, but Milton Keynes has a dynamic local economy in which plenty of other jobs are available, providing much more attractive hours and conditions than those in the catering trade. I fear that if the supply of labour from the sub-continent is not allowed to continue many restaurants in my city will close, to the detriment of those in my constituency, including me, who enjoy them as part of a range of restaurants there.

As I have said, however, what we want in all our productive industry&#151;including the service industry, which involves catering&#151;are high skills, high wages and high productivity. That is what we should seek to achieve, in those sectors as well as others. Individual businesses and shops that keep going on a basis of low skills, low productivity and low pay do not represent the future of this country in the most effective way. That is why I have returned consistently to a central theme of the points-based system, namely, the skills basis for assessment of skills shortages.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_15">Small business makes an immense contribution to the economy. Small enterprises&#151;those with fewer than 50&nbsp;employees&#151;make up over 99&nbsp;per cent. of all businesses and half all employment. As the economy moves toward higher, value-added activity, the share of it taken by small firms will only grow, so the weight of regulation now pressing on small businesses and hindering their wealth creation is an issue for us all. The Better Regulation Commission has estimated that the total cost of regulation facing the economy is now some &#163;150&nbsp;billion. The Hampton review found that national regulators alone send out 2.6&nbsp;million forms a year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_16">Inevitably, this burden falls disproportionately on small businesses. Large companies are able to employ people to deal with regulation; small businesses simply do not have that option. Academics from the London School of Economics have found that regulatory costs per employee are five times higher for small firms than for larger ones, that small employers spend five times as many hours per employee dealing with regulation, and that they spend almost 5&nbsp;per cent. of their annual turnover on compliance. Equally, the Federation of Small Businesses has shown that the administration of pay-as-you-earn costs a business with fewer than five employees &#163;288&nbsp;per employee per year, yet for a firm with 5,000&nbsp;employees, the cost is just &#163;5&nbsp;per employee. The Government&#039;s Carter review concluded that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;there is no doubt that the weight of payroll obligations falls disproportionately on small businesses&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-09_para5">
<a name="stpa_17">Other regulations of particular concern to small businesses include the quarterly VAT return, the very frequent inquiry forms from Government Departments and the Office for National Statistics, and the new employment regulations, of which there have been 17&nbsp;since 1997. The growing weight of regulation strongly suggests that the deregulation efforts of successive Governments have not been sufficient. Over the last two decades, the Enterprise and Deregulation Unit has been replaced by the Better Regulation Task Force, which, in turn, has been replaced by the Better Regulation Commission, but still the red tape has grown. The Regulatory Reform Act 2001&nbsp;has had less than half the predicted impact; the total cost of regulation has increased by 50&nbsp;per cent. in less than nine years. The Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill now before the House does not actually refer to deregulation. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) tabled an amendment to it proposing


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;specific provision to reduce the regulatory impact on small businesses where appropriate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_18">I regret that his amendment did not pass, which helped to persuade me that an entirely new approach is needed.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_19">My Bill would confront the problem of regulation in three ways. First, it would give Ministers a duty to consider alternatives to, and exemptions from, existing regulations affecting small and medium-sized firms, and a power 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 734</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to create those exemptions. Secondly, because the impact of regulation on microbusinesses&#151;those with nine employees or fewer and an average annual turnover of just &#163;130,000&#151;is particularly disproportionate, the Bill would create a presumption that microbusinesses are exempted from any future regulation. That would protect over 4&nbsp;million businesses from future regulation. Thirdly, in respect of all future regulations the Bill would impose a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statutory requirement to carry out a regulatory impact&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assessment&#151;surprisingly, that is not a current requirement&#151;and to consider alternatives to regulation in doing so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_20">Many precedents already exist in terms of exempting small businesses from legislation. There are small business exemptions of one kind or another relating to tax and VAT returns, statutory audit requirements, trade union and employee representation, stakeholder pensions and Sunday opening hours. Other developed countries have also adopted the practice of exempting small businesses from regulation. Last year, France deregulated firms with fewer than 20&nbsp;employees in order to encourage higher youth employment. In Italy and Germany, there are small business exemptions relating to statutory audit requirements, and trade union and employee representation. There are also numerous examples of small business exemptions in many states of the United States of America.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-09_para9">
<a name="stpa_21">This idea would be popular with businesses themselves. Last year, a Federation of Small Businesses survey found that 80&nbsp;per cent. of small businesses support regulatory exemptions for the sector. The federation is in favour of the principle of exempting small businesses from regulation wherever possible, and it is particularly supportive of the idea of placing a duty on Ministers to consider alternatives to regulation. However, it is not just commercial enterprises that would benefit. Small charities, which often rely on voluntary help, find coping with regulation particularly difficult. My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has proposed social enterprise zones with lower regulation, in order to assist in the development of the voluntary bodies that can play such an important part in delivering support to our most deprived communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-09_para10">
<a name="stpa_22">The Bill is a balanced measure that would not automatically abolish existing regulations for small and medium-sized businesses such as those affecting the rights of disabled people in the workplace, or, indeed, other employment rights. It would simply give Ministers a duty to consider alternatives to regulation, and suitable exemptions. They would then have a power to create such exemptions, subject to proper parliamentary approval. Similarly, in relation to microbusinesses, Ministers and Parliament would still be able to override the presumption of exemption from regulation if they so wished.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-09_para11">
<a name="stpa_23">The idea of exploring alternatives to regulation is simply to ask whether its benign objectives could be achieved by other means. For example, we should be anxious to maintain strong standards of health and safety, but we should be ready to examine whether they could be achieved through insurance mechanisms for the smallest firms, where the risk to employees is low.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-09_para12">
<a name="stpa_24">It might be argued that the Bill would create a disincentive for businesses to expand. The Better Regulation Commission considered that question and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 735</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>concluded that there was little evidence to support it. I believe that we should be looking to reduce the regulatory burden on all businesses, but the disproportionate impact on small businesses justifies special measures to help them.

 Annex VI of the MARPOL convention extends pollution control of shipping to include air pollution for the first time. Although it is admitted that pollution from ships is small compared with other sources&#151;with 4&nbsp;per cent. of sulphur dioxide emissions and 7&nbsp;per cent. of nitrogen oxide emissions&#151;it nevertheless has a significant effect on our environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_32">Aside from the Malacca straits, the waters around the UK are the busiest in the world. It is predicted that by 2020, the size of the merchant fleet will have doubled and the size of ships is steadily increasing. It is also estimated that the provisions contained in the annex will save &#163;3&nbsp;million a year in damage to buildings and structures from SO <sub>2</sub>  emissions, and the reduction in ozone emissions will result in 20&nbsp;fewer deaths and savings of &#163;26&nbsp;million a year.

<a name="60307-10_time3"><h5>4.15&nbsp;pm</h5>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_33">I am pleased, therefore, to see in the draft copies of the secondary legislation that have been placed in the Library the adoption of the North sea as an SO <sub>2</sub>  emission control area. That will involve more stringent controls on sulphur emissions, with a reduction to 1.5&nbsp;per cent., compared to 4.5&nbsp;per cent. in other areas. Those controls were discussed and agreed by the Marine Environment Protection Committee at its 53rd session in July 2005. Given past concerns on pollution in the North sea, and the fact that air pollution knows no boundaries, I am pleased to see those limits adopted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_34">Some 23&nbsp;states have already adopted the annex and I hope that more will do so. All UK ships have to have an international air pollution prevention certificate and other ships in UK waters that have adopted the annex must also have one. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there is an annual reporting mechanism for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 738</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>breaches of the convention and action is taken. I know that concerns have been expressed in previous debates about flagships that have not adopted the annex, and while I appreciate that we cannot control those breaches, we need to ensure that appropriate action is taken against all ships that have signed up to the agreement but do not meet its controls. The new clause seeks to introduce a regular reporting mechanism so that Members can see what progress is being made in what is a first for shipping&#151;the introduction of controls on air pollution.
</p>








<p><a name="st_54"><a name="60307-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. Julian Brazier  (Canterbury) (Con):</b> 
 The official Opposition have little problem with new clause 1. The MARPOL convention is a cornerstone of international maritime regulations and we welcome being provided with more information on it. We should remember that shipping is arguably the greenest method of transport. In ball-park terms, goods going by sea in a typical bulk carrier cause one tenth the emissions of CO <sub>2</sub>  of an equivalent crate of goods going by land. Abiding by the MARPOL convention will make that difference even greater.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_35">The publication of the report will add an incentive to ensure inspections are carried out regularly and will essentially name and shame any offenders. I hope that the convention will also encourage shipping companies to follow the example I gave on Second Reading of P&O&#039;s The Pride of Kent&#151;I approve of the name, as I am sure does the Minister, given that he represents South Thanet&#151;which has seen its sulphur emissions slashed to zero and its nitrogen oxide emissions down by four fifths since the introduction of a newly invented water scrubber. The more technology is encouraged in this area, the faster we will see our emissions fall.

<a name="60307-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_36">As far as I can tell, the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) has got into a bit of a muddle with amendment No. 5. The intention is to ensure that revisions to the treaty cannot be incorporated without an Order in Council following a debate in the House. That is not, in fact, what the amendment would do.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_37">The advice that I have been given is that the amendment would allow the Government to amend the treaty without recourse to a full Bill. I see the Minister nods in agreement. When even the Government who proposed the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, which is designed to bypass parliamentary scrutiny on a range of issues, do not require further extra parliamentary powers on this issue, I am strongly disinclined to give such a power. I cannot believe that that is what the hon. Gentleman intended, and I am certain that he will not want to press the amendment to a vote.
</p>








<p><a name="st_55"><a name="60307-10_spmin2"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_38">We take any breach of the MARPOL convention very seriously. Of course, when we find that someone has breached the convention, we prosecute them, and information on all successful prosecutions are put on the Maritime and Coastguard Agency&#039;s website. What the

It would be much more efficient if those people who were interested in such information simply referred to the MCA website, where successful prosecution are always listed. Of course, unsuccessful prosecutions, where they do occur, would not be listed there. However, since 1997, no such prosecution has been unsuccessful. With the reassurance that the information is put in the public domain, that we take all breaches seriously and that we will ensure that they continue to be put in the public domain, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that making another report to Parliament would not be a good use of resources and therefore that he will be happy to withdraw the motion.

<p>
<a name="60307-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_39">The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), who is my parliamentary constituency neighbour, was absolutely right about amendment No. 5. I obviously do not know what was in the mind of the hon. Member for Rochdale when he proposed the amendment, but it would make it unnecessary for us to introduce primary legislation to implement any future revision of annex VI of the MARPOL convention. I certainly do not want to quarrel with his aim in any way at all&#151;I certainly would not want that to be done by primary legislation&#151;but he is probably not aware that, by virtue of clause 2, an entry for the protocol that adds annex VI to MARPOL is inserted in the list of agreements covered by section 128(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. Consequently, the amendment is redundant, because the Bill&#151;in combination with the 1995&nbsp;Act&#151;will achieve the required effect. I hope therefore that the hon. Gentleman will be happy not to press the amendment to a vote.

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="60307-11_spnew0"><b> Paul Rowen: </b> 
 I should like to respond to a couple of the points that have been made. The Minister rightly says that successful cases are published. My noble Friend Lord Bradshaw quoted some statistics when speaking in the other place to show that there were about 500&nbsp;instances of pollution from ships in UK waters last year, yet only 10&nbsp;of them went to court. Obviously, we are dealing with a new issue&#151;airborne emissions, which have not been subject to controls previously. I will happily withdraw the motion, following the Minister&#039;s assurance, but in proposing the new clause, I was seeking to ensure that there would be some measurement of the extent of pollution and the number of pollution cases that were successfully brought to a conclusion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_40">With regard to amendment No. 5, the National Environment Protection Council at its 53rd session in July last year agreed that there would be a review of the nitrogen oxide technical code of annex VI, with a view to taking account of revisions and improvements in technology, further to reduce emissions from ships, including particulate matter, and to look at extending emission controls to ships adopting fuels alternative to diesel. That will result in a report in 2007, and as the Minister says that he already has the enabling legislation to let a revision be adopted after that report, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_42">The amendments are intended to prevent the use of the wide powers delegated to the Minister by Orders in Council under the Bill to incorporate EU directive 2005/35/EC into British law, or indeed to prevent future Governments from having the ability to incorporate into law by secondary legislation any international treaty that does not enjoy the blessing of the International Maritime Organisation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_43">There are two issues. First, the directive is highly dangerous to our maritime interests. Secondly, the Conservatives, and much of the shipping industry, from the British Chamber of Shipping to the unions, are strongly opposed to the development of regional agreements instead of proper, IMO-approved international ones. I am aware that the Government are themselves suspicious of the directive, and I am sure that I will receive reassurances in a moment from the Minister that the Government have no intention of adopting it. The amendments are intended to ensure, however, that no future Government&#151;we may have a less maritime-friendly Minister in post at some point&#151;can misuse the term &quot;international agreement&quot; to apply to an agreement between member states of the EU alone.

 I am glad my hon. Friend has tabled these amendments. Is not the danger of the EU directive that it introduces the concept of serious negligence? Conservatives believe that people should not be prosecuted for something that they did not intend to do.
</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60307-11_spnew4"><b> Mr. Brazier: </b> 
 Indeed. My hon. Friend is exactly right and echoes the lengthy debate we had on that matter in Committee. We are not allowed to cover exactly the same ground on Report, and Mr. Deputy Speaker would rightly restrain me from doing so, but my hon. Friend is right to say that one of the problems with the directive is that it suggests that criminal sanctions should be brought against people guilty neither of intentional discharge nor of reckless disregard in that matter.

<p>
<a name="60307-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_44">For the benefit of Members unaware of issues behind the amendments, I may say that the European Commission passed the directive last year, and it seeks to criminalise the accidental discharge of oil in the way mentioned by my hon. Friend in cases of &quot;serious negligence&quot;. That term is so far undefined in law but major shipping companies fear it will be interpreted strictly, as has already started to happen in France, where it has already been incorporated into law. The consequences of including it in UK law would be grave. Hans van Rooij, president of the International Salvage Union, representing the salvage boats that act as the last line of defence against the kind of catastrophic pollution for which the Bill seeks to compensate, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;If a directive introduces the &#039;serious negligence&#039; concept, salvers will have no choice but to seek immunity before intervening in the waters of EU states with a reputation for aggressive behaviour in maritime accident situations.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_45">That is surely an unintended consequence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_46">The directive would have a serious negative effect on rescue efforts when ships sink in EU waters and create considerably more pollution in the event of an accident than the Bill will ever prevent. It would also undermine the Government&#039;s effort to recruit and retain merchant seamen. Indeed, a joint press release from a coalition of interested parties, which includes the largest cargo and tanker firms, Lloyd&#039;s of London and the International Salvage Union, declared:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;The Directive already has had a detrimental effect on the morale of seamen, and this will have adverse implications for the retention and recruitment of high quality crews.&quot;</p>

<a name="60307-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_47">The directive is particularly worrying because it involves one region unilaterally making maritime law without reference to the rest of the world, which is our second objection. One of the most impressive changes to the international shipping regime in the past 50&nbsp;years has been the international nature of the laws and treaties implemented by flag states around the world. There is broad agreement that, if we want to criminalise or discourage certain activities, the correct forum in which to do so is the International Maritime Organisation and that the correct method is a genuinely international treaty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_48">The directive affects only the European Union, and consultation has taken place only within the European Union. Both the UK and the European Union are lobbying hard to persuade the United States to stop acting unilaterally and to join major international treaties, but I fear that we would have no credibility in such lobbying if we were to act unilaterally, which is why we support the amendment. We would like reassurance that the Bill cannot be used to slip that unpopular directive or some part of it through the back door.

I have found absolute unanimity on that point&#151;complete agreement that we should not impose restrictions on our European fleet that would make it uncompetitive, that we should seek

<a name="stpa_53">To put our view on the record, the powers in clause 1&nbsp;are restricted to the implementation of the supplementary fund protocol and the implementation of instruments that revise or replace the civil liability convention, the international oil pollution compensation fund convention, or the supplementary fund protocol. Each of those instruments was adopted through the IMO and it is inconceivable that they would be amended other than through the IMO.

It was deliberately made a short and focused Bill to speed its passage through Parliament. The whole House agrees that we urgently need the protection of the legislation. Once it is on the statute book, it will improve greatly the compensation available for oil pollution and give us powers to introduce measures to reduce air pollution from ships.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_57">The international oil pollution compensation fund currently provides up to &#163;168&nbsp;million of compensation, but, unfortunately, in the case of major incidents such as the Prestige, that amount is not always sufficient. During our consideration of the Bill, the hon. Members for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill), for example, noted that compensation payments in respect of the Prestige were for a long time limited to just 15&nbsp;per cent. of the amount claimed.

<a name="stpa_59">In Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright) drew our attention to an incident that occurred some years ago. The Eleni V ran aground in May 1978, spilling 5,000&nbsp;tonnes of persistent oil, which affected shellfish areas and recreational beaches. I understand that the local authorities incurred considerable costs in responding to the incident and payment of compensation was delayed for three or four years. The IOPC fund entered into force five months after the incident. Had it been in force, I suspect that those claims would have been settled much more quickly. That incident demonstrates the importance of implementing such instruments as quickly as practicable. A delay of months, or just weeks, can have serious consequences, so I am grateful for the support and co-operation that we have received from both sides of the House as the Bill has progressed.

We have drafted the Order in Council that will be used to implement the supplementary fund protocol under clause 1. An advanced draft of the Order in Council was sent to all Members who attended Second Reading. Copies were also placed in the Library. The draft order is now undergoing final checks, which will be completed in the very near future so that the order is ready by the time that the Bill receives Royal Assent. I repeat my grateful thanks to the House for its co-operation and commend the Bill&#039;s Third Reading to the House.

That said, it is important that the Bill is passed into law as soon as possible, and I am delighted to hear that that will happen. The crash in the Suez canal just last week involving a Liberian tanker&#151;it was a relatively small affair compared with the incident that the Minister mentioned, but, nevertheless, involved the spillage of 3,000&nbsp;tonnes of crude oil&#151;emphasises the urgency of the matter.

It is one thing to use supplementary funds to provide compensation after an oil spill, but it is much better to prevent a spill in the first place, especially in sensitive areas. Redirecting ships away from areas of outstanding beauty or environmental significance is a sensible way of achieving that.

Although major oil spills are thankfully very rare, when they do happen they cause untold and often irreversible damage to the environment, wildlife and economy of an affected area. The supplementary fund will of course be used very rarely, but when it is used, it will be needed precisely because the scale of the disaster will be so big.

<a name="stpa_69">The catalyst for the first aspect of the Bill was the Prestige disaster, and we heard in Committee about its catastrophic effect. Some 64,000&nbsp;tonnes of oil were spilled and there was a bill of more than $1&nbsp;billion. Our one worry about the supplementary allowance is that it would not have paid 100&nbsp;per cent. of the cost of the Prestige disaster, but nevertheless we realise that we have come a long way since the Torrey Canyon disaster in 1967. Remarkable improvements have been made on both the amount of oil spilled each year in international waters and the way in which we have dealt with it. I remember my geology professor, Lord Energlyn, who advised Harold Wilson on how to deal with the Torrey Canyon disaster, talking about the technology used at the time, which included the use of Buccaneer bombers to disperse the oil. The way in which we deal with such disasters and the compensation arrangements available have come a long way since then. We support the provisions of the Bill that will help people much more than was the case in the past.

<a name="60307-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_70">There are still legitimate worries about flags of convenience and the state of such fleets. It is estimated that at least one in 12&nbsp;vessels that visit British ports are unseaworthy and that the figures for other ports are much higher. Nevertheless, with continuing pressure, more states will ratify the agreement. It is to be hoped that that will reduce some of the consequences that we had with the Prestige disaster.

<a name="60307-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_71">I move on to the MARPOL index. It is a start in dealing for the first time with air pollution. It is limited, and the number of signatures to the convention is low. Like the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), we look forward to hearing what the Government will do with regard to the ports Bill. We would have liked to see an opportunity to tackle air pollution of ships while in port. That is called cold ironing, and it already operates in Los Angeles and Vancouver. When the Bill is introduced, we hope to have an opportunity to consider that process as going one stage further in dealing with pollution, not only on the high seas but within UK ports.

<a name="stpa_79">The first part of that statement of assurance has always been positive. The ECA has observed every year that, despite some qualifications, the accounts faithfully reflect the revenue and expenditure for the communities for the year and their financial position at the year end.

 To put this report in the context of a public limited company, were a plc to announce its annual results and have its accounts qualified, there would be a huge impact on its share price. Yet, the European Union carries on from year to year with no effect, and with no real concern from Her Majesty&#039;s Government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_85"><a name="60307-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lewis: </b> 
 It is a shame that the consensus has broken down. To say that there is no real concern from Her Majesty&#039;s Government is unfair nonsense. During the course of our presidency, I, together with others, made this a priority. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that, if he is talking about the credibility of the European Union and the relationship between it and taxpayers in the nation states, the issue is incredibly important. As long as the accounts continue to be qualified, they undermine and damage the credibility of the European Union as an institution. Perhaps the difference between us is that I am unhappy that the credibility and integrity of the European Union are undermined whereas I suspect that Conservative Members and, perhaps, one or two of my hon. Friends, are delighted for this continual undermining of the European Union as an institution to continue. The difference is that I want an improvement in the situation so that we cease to qualify the accounts with the consequence that the relationship between the European Union and taxpayers is improved. We should all share that objective. It is also true that the qualification is not, as it is often explained, largely to do with fraud; it is largely to do with inappropriate accounting methods and the difficulty of monitoring expenditure. I do not make any excuses, but sometimes 100&nbsp;per cent. of the problem is defined as fraud, which is misleading and inaccurate. I share the reservations of the hon. Gentleman, and as long as the European Union&#039;s accounts are qualified, any democratic politician should be concerned. Indeed, anybody who believes in the EU as an institution should be concerned and want the situation changed.

 In respect of proportionality and in terms of whether a discharge is given, does the Minister agree that the amount of money involved is highly relevant?

<p>
<a name="60307-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_83">I acknowledged earlier that we had found most problems in respect of payments. In most years, the ECA has been able to give a positive statement of assurance only for administrative payments that were a small part of the budget&#151;about 6&nbsp;per cent. I am pleased to note that, in the 2004&nbsp;report, the ECA considers that a substantial part of the agriculture budget&#151;59&nbsp;per cent.&#151;merits a positive statement of assurance. That is the part managed under the integrated administration and control scheme&#151;IACS&#151;and it amounts to &#8364;26&nbsp;billion from a total agricultural payments budget of &#8364;44.3&nbsp;billion in 2004.

 It must be true that none of the funds has been deployed wrongly by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs this year, because no farmers have received their cheques. No fraud is taking place this year because so far no money has been given to our hard-pressed farmers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_91"><a name="60307-14_spnew9"><b> Mr. Lewis: </b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_84">The ECA considers that IACS, where it is properly applied, is effective in limiting the risk of irregularities to an acceptable level. In addition, the 2004&nbsp;report concludes that pre-accession aid also merits a positive statement of assurance. Taking the large share of agriculture spending, and all pre-accession aid and administration costs, about 35&nbsp;per cent. of the 2004&nbsp;budget has been assured by the ECA. As I am sure Members will be at pains to point out, that still leaves a long way to go, but it is an improvement over previous years.

 The Minister has a difficult task and I am grateful to him for giving way.

<a name="60307-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_85">There have been relative improvements in the 2004&nbsp;audit, but two thirds of the EU budget does not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meet acceptable standards. The sum involved is about &#8364;68&nbsp;billion, or &#163;46&nbsp;billion, but honesty and transparency are required, as the true extent of the problem must be defined. Fraud has taken place&#151;I shall comment on that&#151;but there are also errors or irregularities. If the ECA&#039;s audit leads it to believe that amounts calculated by member states differ in value by more than 2&nbsp;per cent. from what it assesses to be the correct figure, it cannot give a positive assurance on that part of the budget. That does not mean that the whole budget sector is subject to error&#151;it is still only a relatively small part. We must be careful, too, to distinguish between irregularities, where payments have been made in contravention of the rules, or where it was not possible to show that the correct procedures have been followed, and fraud, where money has clearly been stolen or used for entirely inappropriate purposes.

<a name="60307-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_86">Those issues are examined in detail in the &quot;Fight against Fraud&quot; report that was published by the Commission and which incorporates data from the European anti-fraud office&#151;OLAF&#151;to which the right hon. Member for Wokingham referred. For the first time, in the 2004&nbsp;report, OLAF has succeeded in identifying the amount of suspected fraud reported in agriculture and the structural funds.

<p><a name="st_97"><a name="60307-15_spnew2"><b> Mr. Lewis: </b> 
 I agree with much of what my hon. Friend said, but there is also a history of employees in various organisations&#151;not just the European Union&#151; justifying behaviour that represents an unacceptable employment practice by saying that they are fulfilling their wider public duty. That does not always prove to be the case, because people have an axe to grind, a problem with management or their own agenda. All I am saying is that we must be careful not to generalise, without referring to people&#039;s responsibility to abide by their contracts of employment. If we do not acknowledge their importance, we may as well not have contracts of employment. However, if people choose to disclose evidence that the European Union is seeking to cover up information that should be in the public domain or be available to democratically elected politicians, that has historically been an important part of getting organisations to face up to the difficulties and challenges confronting them. Ideally, as my hon. Friend suggested, the belief that it was management&#039;s responsibility to take these matters seriously would be built into the culture of the Commission and other elements of the European Union. We will be able to improve the credibility of the EU only if we tackle these issues head on&#151;if we are honest about them, rather than pretending that they do not exist or trying to hide them. Ultimately, that will do nothing to enhance the reputation of the EU or the relationship between the EU and the taxpayers of Europe.

 I thank the Economic Secretary for his courtesy in giving way. He was making an argument a few moments ago that, in order to help restore credibility, it is important that the European Union and its institutions should be as transparent as possible about their financial circumstances. No doubt we would all agree with that sentiment.

In the context of a debate such as this, it is important to state that, in this country, in the political process and the government&#151;not this Government, but the government of the country&#151;we are remarkably free of corruption, compared with many other countries.

 I appreciate the Minister&#039;s comments. I should perhaps declare an interest as a chartered accountant.

<a name="stpa_89">The EU is sometimes presented as &quot;Brussels&quot;&#151;an homogenous institution that spends and accounts for all this money as one entity. That is not true. Much of the expenditure is ultimately filtered through nation states, and much of the difficulty as regards the ongoing qualification of accounts is connected to their inability always to account properly and appropriately for the way in which the money is spent. Frankly, it suits some Conservative Members, and perhaps one or two of my hon. Friends, constantly to use that as a stick with which to beat the concept of the European Union. Many elements of this issue play into that view in the context of the broad debate about the integrity and reputation of the European Union and the fact that a massive gap has opened up between the people of Europe and the EU as an institution.

They sometimes want to create ever-increasing budgets to build an empire within the European Union even when, to achieve effective outcomes, it would be better if the money were filtered through nation states.

To avoid a sense of sharing sanctimonious pleasure, will he confirm that the UK Government distribute approximately &#163;2&nbsp;billion in benefit fraud per annum, which far exceeds fraud in the whole EU? That puts the matter in context, not least because the National Audit Office has qualified the accounts of the Department for Work and Pensions on more than one occasion.

Of course he is right to say that such issues must always be put in context&#151;unless one is deliberately setting out to prove an argument that portrays the EU as a negative and corrupt institution. Some people want to present the EU in that light because they believe that the country should leave the EU.

 On the subject of the auditors&#039; inability to give a statement of assurance, they and independent reports by respected European parliamentarians have identified one of the problems at the heart of the matter as individual nation states&#039; inability or unwillingness to account for money that they end up spending. There is no point in denying that. The Court of Auditors has identified it as a major reason why the qualification of accounts is to continue. There has to be co-operation between the nation states and the Commission if we are going to crack this nut and eventually arrive at a point at which the accounts do not have the qualification attached to them.

 I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. I want to be constructive and helpful to him. That marvellous organisation called OLAF, which deals with anti-corruption measures, was set up with a great fanfare as an improvement on the previous arrangements. I have been reading the documents, and surely one of the problems is that it has not had much impact at all. What are we going to do with these cases of fraud?

 I think that my hon. Friend is being a little unfair. OLAF has made a difference. We are debating the year 2004, and obviously, quite a bit has happened since then. The overall judgment on OLAF is that it has been a good thing. It has begun to address some of the cultural issues, and to get them taken more seriously. Has it been the solution in itself? Until now, certainly not&#151;but I do not think that that was ever the intention. However, to say that it has not made a difference is unfair, given some of the improvements that are now under way.

<br>&nbsp;<br>about &#8364;11&nbsp;million in agriculture and &#8364;118&nbsp;million in the structural funds.

Of course, that is nothing to be complacent about; it is not acceptable.

In 2004, 9,463&nbsp;cases were reported, involving a total amount of &#8364;982&nbsp;million. That is an increase over 2003&nbsp;levels, although the increase was mainly in the structural funds sector. Indeed, irregularities in own resources and agriculture decreased. The overall increase is, of course, bad news, but, as I have said throughout, it must be seen in proportion. On the expenditure side, reported irregularities accounted for 0.19&nbsp;per cent. of the agriculture budget and 2&nbsp;per cent. of the structural funds budget.

Does the Minister agree, however, that it is misleading to say that those very small figures represent the limits of waste, in particular? The number of value-for-money studies that the European Commission undertakes is minimal, unlike the number undertaken by the National Audit Office here. We have no comparable examination of waste in the European Union; all that we have is an examination relating to theft and misappropriation. The questions of waste and efficiency of spending are not adequately measured and never have been, and that is not proposed even under the Barroso plan.

<a name="stpa_98">On the institutional side, there has been considerable debate about how to optimise effectiveness and efficiency.

How good a job does it do? Is it effective in the fight against fraud? Does it have the right management and organisation to make a difference?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_99">That latter question was considered by the ECA in its special report on OLAF. Its main conclusion, with which we agree, is that it is not appropriate to change the status of OLAF, which currently operates as a service within the Commission. It has a hybrid structure and its director has operational independence so far as investigations are concerned, but it supports the Commission in other duties such as policy development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_100">From time to time, there have been calls for OLAF to become totally independent of the Commission, but the ECA believes that OLAF&#039;s hybrid structure has not adversely affected the independence of its investigative function, and indeed brings with it some advantages. For example, it shares the Commission&#039;s power to carry out on-the-spot checks in member states under existing sectoral legislation. The ECA considers that OLAF&#039;s resources are sufficient and that it has made considerable improvements in its procedures, but of course it is only fair to say&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West will be interested to hear this&#151;that the report was not without its criticisms. The ECA criticised OLAF&#039;s relations with its supervisory committee and its performance in respect of human rights. OLAF acknowledges that its relationship 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 759</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with the committee could be better, and I hope that it will take the opportunity to review that and to make a new start with the new committee that has recently been appointed. OLAF has already addressed the human rights issue through its proposed amendments to its governing regulation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_101">Last year, we considered the complementary evaluation report, which showed that OLAF had handled a total of 1,688&nbsp;cases up to 30&nbsp;June 2004, in addition to inheriting 1,408&nbsp;cases from its predecessor, UCLAF. Since 1999, OLAF has reduced the average duration of an investigation from 29&nbsp;months to 22&nbsp;months, and the total financial impact of cases closed by OLAF was around &#8364;4&nbsp;billion. The supplementary activity report&#151;produced to cover the six months from July to December 2004, because OLAF intends in future to report on a calendar year basis&#151;updates and expands those performance figures. OLAF has handled a further 720&nbsp;cases, and the total financial impact of cases that it has closed now stands at &#8364;5.8&nbsp;billion. A total of &#8364;198&nbsp;million was recovered from 2002&nbsp;to 2004. So the figures are improving and show that the fight against fraud is beginning to succeed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_102">What will happen next with OLAF? We expect a revised proposal to amend its governing regulation later this year and we will ensure that that takes account of the ECA&#039;s findings. I hope that OLAF will continue to analyse the true extent of fraud, for only when we have a reliable understanding of frequency of occurrence and identification of high-risk areas can we target effective preventive action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_103">That brings me to the third area that I wanted to cover: the key next steps. The action plan has been established by the Commission and was agreed by Ministers in ECOFIN on 8&nbsp;November last year. It covers the steps to be taken by the Commission, member states and the ECA. It bears repeating that the management of agriculture spending and structural funds is shared between the member states and the Commission. Those headings account for about 80&nbsp;per cent. of the total EU budget, which is one reason why the ECA has frequently highlighted problems in its past reports. As we have discussed today, member states have vastly differing systems and organisations for managing these funds, and the Commission is often unable to obtain the degree of assurance that it seeks in order to satisfy the ECA.

<a name="60307-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_104">In response to calls from the European Council and the European Parliament to take action following the ECA report of 2003, the Commission issued a &quot;Roadmap to an Integrated Internal Control Framework&quot;&#151;a snappy title if ever there was one&#151;in June last year. That road map provided a real opportunity to deliver results&#151;to deliver more concrete trust and visible belief in EU financial management and control systems. During its presidency, the UK was very willing to play an active role in taking that forward. The road map was proposed by the ECA itself and in its view, the answer to the problems that it uncovers every year is a system with a number of characteristics. Controls should be applied to a common standard in an open and transparent way, so that the results can be relied on by all parts of the system.

I agree with my hon. Friend, but the cultural change in the new Commission will be judged by actions, not words. We are discussing one very tangible area where the Commission can demonstrate that it is serious about reform that is directly related to its own credibility and relationship with EU taxpayers.

 I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz). We have led the argument for reform in all sorts of EU policy areas, including the Lisbon agenda covering productivity, competitiveness, our response to the challenges of globalisation and the EU&#039;s relationship with the US. We have been a constructive player at the heart of the EU, and we have begun to move the EU in the direction that we think that it should take to meet the challenges that we all face at the beginning of the 21st century. Other matters on which the UK has taken a lead include international security and terrorism. The UK is seen as a credible player that wants to make Europe work, and not as a nation that constantly wants to debate whether we should be in Europe at all. Our approach has gained us significantly more influence and a greater capacity to achieve change than was the case before 1997, when Britain had no credibility in the EU.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 761</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>should be a chain of control procedures, with each level having specific defined objectives that take into account the work of others. The ECA also believed that the cost of these controls should be in proportion to the overall benefits that they bring.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_106">In the road map, the Commission undertook to make a gap assessment, based on comparing its current control systems with the system proposed by the ECA, but it also proposed a way of gaining the assurance from member states that they currently lack. Building on the ECA&#039;s integrated internal control framework, the Commission suggested that each member state should produce an annual declaration of assurance in respect of its systems for managing Community funds and how they had performed&#151;in much the same way that Government Departments in this country produce an annual statement on internal control, signed by the relevant accounting officer. The European Parliament wanted those member state declarations to be signed by the Finance Ministers, in order to demonstrate accountability and responsibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_107">Although I have no difficulty with demonstrating accountability and responsibility, there are legal and organisational problems with the European Parliament&#039;s idea. Moreover, the ECA did not say that national declarations were the answer. Without such an indication from the Court, there was little or no chance that member states would be persuaded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_108">What was important was our joint ability to reach a practical and unanimous consensus. For the UK presidency, it was vital that the road map should provide an acceptable path for all member states, in the full spirit of co-operative action. ECOFIN on 8&nbsp;November agreed conclusions that committed both the Commission and member states to take action to improve financial management and the level of assurance that we can give the ECA on the management of the Community budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_109">Those actions included an assessment by the Commission of the present controls at sector and regional level, and the value of existing statements and declarations. That will force improvement and allow a realistic evaluation of how the information currently provided can be made more effective and useful. They also included an examination and report by the ECA on how the integrated internal control framework would affect its audit approach, taking account of current international auditing standards. That will help to drive further the changes that the Court has already introduced into its methodology. It will also bring it closer into line with the methods used by the United Kingdom&#039;s National Audit Offices, similar bodies in other member stated and the private sector. Another action will be a professional assessment of the level of risks that can be tolerated for different kinds of transactions. At present the ECA applies a blanket 2&nbsp;per cent. materiality rate for all policy areas, without taking account of complexities. The Commission intends to launch an inter-institutional process this month.

The Commission now has a very different culture and I am optimistic that the 2009&nbsp;objective can be achieved.

 It is a pleasure to be called to speak on behalf of the Opposition in this debate, which encompasses several European institutions, their related spending programmes, and the process by which those are examined by the European Court of Auditors. I am pleased to debate these issues with the Economic Secretary, who was temporarily under the weather after Christmas. I am genuinely pleased to see him back in his place on the Treasury Bench this evening, in his usual humorous good form. He will recall that he and I have debated these topics on several occasions in recent months, including in European Standing Committee A on 1&nbsp;November, when we focused on the Government&#039;s then draft proposals for the EU budget and combating fraud, and subsequently in a Statutory Instruments Committee on 14&nbsp;December when we looked in some detail at the UK&#039;s economic performance relative to our European neighbours in the aftermath of the pre-Budget report. I give the Minister notice that a few questions remain outstanding from those sessions, which fortunately also touch on our business this evening. I hope that he can provide me with answers this evening, as he was not always able to do so then.

<a name="stpa_115">We are here partly at the behest of the European Scrutiny Committee, which recommended this topic for debate on the Floor of the House&#151;and quite rightly, too. The package that the Committee provided us with includes some 30&nbsp;documents, which we have collectively before us tonight&#151;all 1,158&nbsp;pages of them&#151;for which we must thank the Committee profusely.

<a name="60307-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_116">The issue of fraud and the reliability of the EU&#039;s accounts, which lies at the centre of the debate, has continued to rear its head repeatedly ever since the entire Santer Commission resigned over EU fraud in 1999. We were subsequently told that a reform process would be put in place under Commissioner Neil&#151;now Lord&#151;Kinnock and that those issues would be seriously addressed at last and put to rest once and for all. However, despite that so-called reform programme, the European Court of Auditors has refused to sign off the EU&#039;s accounts for 11&nbsp;years running, because of continuing irregularities. That process was well summarised by the European Scrutiny Committee in its 19th report of the 2005&#150;06&nbsp;Session, which appears at page 1,089&nbsp;of our bundle tonight and states:

: Did my hon. Friend notice that when the Economic Secretary remarked on how things could be improved, he gave us verbiage and very vague bureaucratic processes? Does my hon. Friend agree that if we really want to clean up an organisation, from the top, we must say that people who preside over fraud or commit fraud are fired and action is taken against them and that the people who spot it&#151;whistleblowers&#151;are rewarded and promoted? Until we get to that point, are we not going to face this situation year after year, because those at the top of the Commission and the other European organisations do not send a clear message that fraud is the most important thing to root out?

 As usual, my right hon. Friend makes a powerful point. Part of the situation that we are in now follows on from the fact that an entire Commission resigned on the issue of fraud some seven years ago, and the House, the British people and others across the EU were assured that such issues would be tackled head on as a result of that failure. We are now seven years on from then, and the Economic Secretary attempts to argue that, at last, such things are being taken seriously and that the problems will be laid to rest in about three years. I want to test some of the arguments that he put to the House this evening and press him specifically on some of the details of the road map and how it is supposed to work in principle and how it is likely to work in practice.

<a name="stpa_117">The road map is now used by the Government, the Council and the Commission as their answer to the challenge of how the problem will be dealt with. It is designed to facilitate the European Court of Auditors being able to sign off the accounts satisfactorily in the not-too-distant future, and I shall come to the timing shortly. In our debate Upstairs on 1&nbsp;November, the Economic Secretary laid out the concept of the road map, which was initiated by the European Council and then taken up by the Commission as a result. He explained that the Government has sought to press that initiative as part of their presidency of the EU in the second half of last year. I want to press him tonight on how he sees that operating in detail and on what the European Scrutiny Committee in its 15th report of the 2005&#150;06&nbsp;Session&#151;at page 12&nbsp;of our bundle tonight&#151;described as his

<a name="stpa_118">Let us get on to the detail. Will the Economic Secretary give us further information on the timings by which he envisages the process working? Given the history of all this, it seems clear that the problem will hardly be put right overnight. Can he provide some realistic idea of the year in which he expects the objective to be ultimately achieved and the accounts satisfactorily signed off, given that the EU firmly committed itself seven years ago to eradicating the problem? The Minister mentioned 2009, but will he be clear on whether the Government&#039;s stated position is that the accounts should be 100&nbsp;per cent. signed off in 2009, or do they hope that the percentage signed off will be higher, if not necessarily 100&nbsp;per cent.? Getting to 100&nbsp;per cent. only three years from now seems ambitious, so will he be crystal clear about whether he expects to achieve 100&nbsp;per cent. DAS by 2009?

Does he also agree that it is essential that the Minister tells us what will happen if the 2009&nbsp;date is not met? May I also suggest that the Minister sticks with his adage, &quot;Do less, better&quot;? That way, if the target was not met by 2009, the budget would be cut, and that would concentrate minds.

May I press the Minister, however, on progress towards full accruals-based accounting, which I understand, from page 6&nbsp;of the bundle and from his remarks, was due to be introduced in the financial year 2005? That should, in theory, improve the quality of the audit process, but there are several references in the bundle to the fact that it has not yet been brought fully into operation. I know the point is technical, but it is important, and I wonder whether the Minister can update us on progress on the introduction of accruals-based accounting.

Last month, however, <i>Accountancy Age</i> revealed that fraudsters have sent out fake letters from OLAF to innocent victims in an organised scam. Those letters accused the victims of making irregular bank transfers and thus violating money laundering regulations, and they demanded a payment to make amends for the alleged transgression.

By way of comparison, has there ever been a similar scam in the United Kingdom by fraudsters purporting to represent the National Audit Office? Hon.

Gentleman about the dubious nature of some of the off-balance-sheet accounting in which most Governments are involved, so I hope that he will join my all-party group&#151;which will have written to him recently&#151;and promote financial transparency.

The Government would be understandably reluctant to continue to pay rate support grant, or its modern equivalent under formula spending share, to any local authority in this country that had only one third of its accounts cleared as satisfactory by the district auditor, so why give away so much more of our taxpayers&#039; money to the EU?

We are talking about deliberate mischief, not things that happen because people are not doing their jobs properly. People are deliberately defrauding the European Union budget by one means or another, which is a serious matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_137">The problem is inherent in the European Union in that people are spending other people&#039;s money and it is always easier to spend someone else&#039;s money than one&#039;s own. If one is accountable to one&#039;s family for the money that one spends, one will be much more careful. If one is accountable to the House of Commons, one will be much more careful. If one is accountable to an electorate who have a direct concern and interest in how their money is being spent, one will much more careful. The problem with the European Union budget is that it is remote and complex and there are myriad people who benefit from it in far-flung corners of the European Union. It would be difficult even for a very efficient organisation such as the National Audit Office to deal with a vast amount of money that is spread so widely.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_138">We have to consider the whole concept of the European Union budget. That is why I have said on many occasions, and say again today, that we should seek the abolition of the common agricultural policy, because that is where the principal problems lie. If agriculture policy was simply repatriated, each member state could decide its own level of subsidy for its own unique agriculture systems. Every country has a different pattern of agriculture. I do not think that there are any Welsh Members in the Chamber, but I have mentioned several times that we might choose to preserve the way of life of Welsh hill farmers. That is fine. It would not cost very much and it might be a good thing to do. <i>[Interruption.]</i> We do have a Welsh Member present, but I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami) has any Welsh hill farmers in his constituency&#151;possibly not. Nevertheless, there are sectors of agriculture that have to be subsidised. That is appropriate, but other agricultural sectors do not fall into that category. I understand that the vast proportion of CAP funds go to agribusiness sugar producers, to the disadvantage of poorer producers in other parts of the world such as the Caribbean, Africa and elsewhere. I would like us to buy

 The hon. Gentleman speaks with a great deal of expertise on this subject. Does he agree that the sugar regime is important to many farmers in East Anglia? Britain is about 60&nbsp;per cent. self-sufficient while France is about 180&nbsp;per cent. self-sufficient. The low countries and Germany are all more than 100&nbsp;per cent. self-sufficient. In the case of the UK, the hon. Gentleman&#039;s suggestion means that applying our own rules would be much more sensible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_163"><a name="60307-21_spnew1"><b> Kelvin Hopkins: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has made a helpful intervention. In the previous debate on this subject it was suggested that we might produce sugar as a biofuel, which would be a much more environmentally friendly form of fuel production, producing alcohol for fuel. That is one possibility. Whatever the arrangements, we could choose nationally how we subsidised our agriculture. I am sure that we could do that while taking account of all the needs of the rural population, including farmers, as appropriate. I am sure that we would do a much better job of it than the CAP and the EU. Indeed, every country would do better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_139">We should have a proper and thorough study of the precise fiscal distributional effects of abolishing the CAP. What would happen to France? I have made a rough calculation that shows that abolition would not make that much difference. There might be a small cost equivalent to less then 1&nbsp;per cent. of GDP if France were to subsidise its farmers directly rather than through the CAP. Indeed, the CAP is so inefficient and so corrupt that France might do a better job of it directly rather than through the CAP. Getting rid of the CAP would solve many of the problems.
</p>








<p><a name="st_164"><a name="60307-21_spnew2"><b> Mr. Drew </b> 
: I concur with my hon. Friend&#039;s view on the CAP. Does he agree that one of the problems with the recent budget was the many warm words that were spoken about moving towards rural development in place of targeted support based on production? When push came to shove, all the countries involved fell down on the obligation towards rural development and, again, sucked money back into direct support. That might have happened because of the French, but the British also fell into line. Surely that is shocking.

 My hon. Friend speaks with great expertise on agricultural matters, and I am pleased to receive his assistance. We should consider rural policies in terms of agricultural subsidies. Perhaps we should regenerate some of our livestock farming, which is so healthy for the countryside, and also good for wildlife and for the environment. That could be done if we had a national agricultural policy rather than having a system that is based on the CAP and the EU.

<p><a name="st_169"><a name="60307-21_spnew7"><b> Kelvin Hopkins: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I agree about the commons fisheries policy. The European Union would be much more attractive to existing members, as well as to potential new members, if it worked better and was seen to be more just, fair and effective. I can think of a number of ways in which it should be reformed. However, I wish to stick to the topic of the budget and how the money is spent.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_141">The other matter about which I am concerned, as is the Department for International Development, is the aid budget. That budget is spent ineffectively, is subject to some corruption and goes to the wrong places. It has been heavily criticised by DFID Ministers, both privately and publicly. I have suggested two possibilities for that budget. The first is that it should be repatriated and member states should be required to contribute a proportion of their GDP to aid. Perhaps the proportion might be higher for the richest nations. There should be a formulaic approach to aid so that we make sure we pay enough, but it should be distributed through national Governments or national Governments in collaboration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_142">The second suggestion involves DFID, because it is recognised as doing a good job with aid and as not being corrupt. I have not supported some of its policies regarding privatisation, but it is highly regarded. I have the greatest regard for our present Secretary of State for International Development, whom I have heard speak on many occasions, who does an extremely good job. If the aid budget for the European Union were handed over to Britain to manage on a franchise basis, I am sure that we would do a much better job than the European Union and that the aid would go to the right places. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 772</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Some of the problems with that budget relate to the fact that national interests dictate that some aid goes to slightly richer countries around the rim of the Mediterranean rather than to sub-Saharan Africa where the need is greatest. We have to repatriate the aid budget or introduce fundamental reforms, perhaps even hand it over to DFID to manage. With our present Secretary of State, we would do a good job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_143">Other aspects of the European Union budget will cause problems. It irritates me when I walk through my town centre and see a large notice, with a big, blue flag with yellow stars on it, saying that the town is to be modernised with money from the European Union. We are massive net contributors to that budget. It is our money, not the European Union&#039;s money, that is paying for the modernisation, but the EU gives the impression that it is a benign Father Christmas delivering money to Britain, when actually we are Father Christmas giving money to the European Union. I am not suggesting that we should not give fairly to the budget. Indeed, I have suggested on many occasions that if we had a budget in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which contributions and receipts were exactly proportional to living standards in member states, so that richest give most and the poorest receive most, that could be seen to be fair. One could just look at a sliding scale and see a graph of how it worked. Everybody would say that that system was fine and they would sign up to it. But the current budget does not work like that; the CAP distorts it and makes it look unfair.
</p>








<p><a name="st_170"><a name="60307-21_spnew8"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman refers to structural funds and suggests that we should give as much as we reasonably can and be fair in giving money to other countries. Does not that belie the fundamental point that structural funds are at the heart of regionalisation, which has a severely adverse impact on the United Kingdom&#151;on hospitals, ambulance services, the police, fire authorities and so on? The whole process is disintegrating under the guise of the creation of a more centralised system, which is of course what the EU really is.
</p>








<p><a name="st_171"><a name="60307-21_spnew9"><b> Kelvin Hopkins: </b> 
 I was about to say that national Governments should distribute funding according to their needs; they should make the judgment about which of their regions needs money. Indeed, the Chancellor has suggested that as and when our regional fund benefits disappear, as poorer member states join, extra funds will be substituted by the Treasury, which is right. However, we in the House are the best judges of which regions need more or less money. We should make those decisions and the situation is the same for other countries. Distribution should be proportionate to relative GDP per head in member states and they should make their own decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_144">I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about regionalisation. I am seriously concerned that building up the regions is an attempt to play down the Governments of member nation states. I cannot accept that.

I do not suggest that nation states should be nationalistic, but national Governments should have the final responsibility for the welfare of their citizens. The central Governments of member states should have that

We have to deal with the fundamental problem that people and institutions in the member states&#151;farmers and so on&#151;are spending other people&#039;s money and that that is somehow all right. It has even been suggested that the glue holding the EU together is the fact that money is sloshing about and everybody gets a bit of the action. That is not the way to approach democratic politics. We should know what we are spending our money on and vote to spend it as appropriate, collectively in democratic member states and, where necessary, at minimal level, through the EU.

<a name="stpa_147">I shall set out our position and suggest some directions that we should like reform to take.

<p>
<a name="60307-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_148">I am conscious, however, that we need to be careful about throwing stones&#151;as other Members have remarked. As the House knows, the EU presents its accounts for audit in a global fashion, whereas in the UK we present them Department by Department. As others have pointed out, the National Audit Office has qualified the accounts of the Department for Work and Pensions on more than one occasion, so if there was a global set of UK accounts, they would all be qualified. The uncertainty and mistrust that flow from unsatisfactory sets of accounts undermine the whole purpose and image of the EU, so we want to tackle the problem as aggressively as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_149">May I propose three ways in which we could tackle the issue? First, as the House is well aware, 80&nbsp;per cent. of the EU budget or approximately &#8364;65&nbsp;billion is spent by the nation states. Policy is set at EU level, but the responsibility for spending and payment, primarily of the common agricultural policy subsidies and the structural funds, is delegated to national level. The European Parliament, in its discharge report on the last annual budget, called for national Finance Ministers to sign off a national statement of assurance for each member country, with the goal of making sure that each member state takes full and proper responsibility for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 774</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>spending and payments inside its national boundaries. Ministers rejected that at the last European Council&#151;they are not anxious to be accountable to the European Parliament. At a minimum, however, a key national body, whether the NAO in this country or an equivalent body in other countries, ought to take on that responsibility, as we need a detailed audit trail from the bottom to the top. It could be constructed as a pyramid, with each audit built on a sound audit at the level below. We could then begin to force each nation to face up to its responsibilities as a member of the EU.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_150">Once national statements are made, as my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) suggested, we can begin to consider the issue of penalties. It is not acceptable for people to recognise that information is not properly controlled or monitored year after year and that there is a potential for error or fraud but to fail to take reasonable action. The total elimination of payments may not be required but a penalty could be imposed. As the EU grows and more countries join as a result of accession, there is a danger that those countries will not put in place the proper auditing structures, controls and monitoring. By starting on the wrong foot, we will compound the problem and the issue will escape us in its complexity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_151">Secondly, the Commission&#039;s internal system of controls is a concern. We cannot place the whole problem on the shoulders of the nation states. It is unacceptable that parliamentary recommendations have not been followed, as they require key members of the Commission to sign off essential reports such as the annual activity reports and declarations on which the synthesis report is based. Whether it is a director general, the secretary general or the internal auditor who is accountable, there must be a structure so that the Commission takes internal responsibility far more aggressively and positively for the accounts that it presents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_152">Thirdly, we have often talked about tolerance of the risk of error. The NAO has a tolerance rate of about 1&nbsp;per cent., as it accepts that there is a point at which chasing error is far more costly than the error itself. There is therefore an acceptable benchmark, but as discussions proceed in the EU it is critical that the error tolerance rate should be very low. It could be 1&nbsp;per cent., as it is in the NAO. We must treat the EU as a sophisticated, developed organisation and, if we are to have confidence in it, we should not apply the standards that we would attach to overseas aid to developing countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_153">Finally, when the EU talks to the developing world and tells the United Nations that it must be careful about the way in which it offers aid to new and emerging economies it should make certain that it is purer than Caesar&#039;s wife. We take a proactive stand over and over again, telling developing countries that they must clean up their auditing act, but for us to do so from a position where we can be criticised strikes me as unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_154">I speak as a pro-European. There is nothing less acceptable to a pro-European than to sit by and look at an unreformed EU that permits a relatively low standard of auditing to continue year after year. For the credibility of the European Union, which I consider to be an important part of our future, we must pursue the kind of reforms suggested in the road map, and we probably have to go beyond that.

Some of us would go much further, but I hope we will recognise that we owe a duty to the EU to make sure that its auditing and financial control are hundreds of per cent. better than they have been so far. They have been lamentable, resulting in the divorce between the peoples and the governance of the EU, reflected more recently in the divorce between national Governments and their electorates. That is why we will never revisit the European constitution because, if anything, the votes would be even more overwhelmingly against. That is why we could not hold a vote in the UK.

However, we are now seven years into the operation of OLAF. It may have a long way to go, but if it has not got very far in seven years, I hate to think how long it will take before it really cracks the whip and begins to bear down on the corruption and anti-fraud measures that it needs to bring in.

That institution was set up by the last Conservative Government, precisely because we were concerned about the lack of transparency in budgetary procedures. More recently the organisation known as OLAF was set up. Those organisations have begun to take on some of the problems, but they have not made sufficient progress.

 My hon. Friend asks me that question from a sedentary position. Perhaps he is getting tired of standing up to make his interventions. The Court of Justice provides an important way of enforcing the measures that are agreed to by the Ministers in Council. Indeed, a previous speaker referred to the importance of the Commission taking note, but, in many cases, it is the Ministers who give the Commission instructions to take note. An example is ECOFIN&#151;of which our Chancellor is a member&#151;which is very much involved in attempting to ensure that there is reform and improvement in the institutions of the European Union. The point that I am making is that those of us who believe that it is in Britain&#039;s national interest to be in the European Union also believe that the European Union should be reformed and that it should make every effort to overcome the inadequacies that exist, most notably in regard to the issue that we are discussing this evening.

<a name="60307-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_172">Of course we must have a sense of context. It has always been said that the number of people employed by the European Union institutions is roughly equivalent to the number employed by the county of Staffordshire. I have long since forgotten how many people are employed by the country of Staffordshire, but we should appreciate that we are talking about a comparatively small number of people. That does not exonerate them from a failure to have their accounts properly audited and approved, but it puts the position in context. Sometimes the House, along with some of the British media, greatly exaggerate the apparent problems in the European Union.

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the parallel he drew with Staffordshire is deliberately misleading and one of the myths that the European Union has long peddled? Many of Staffordshire&#039;s employees deliver services directly to the public, unlike members of the European Commission. A much more appropriate parallel could be drawn with a military general staff, who send out orders that will control thousands, if not millions, of people. That is a significant comparison, rather than a false comparison with an organisation that actually does some good.

That does not reduce the importance of the accusation levelled against European Union institutions that fail to secure auditing of their accounts. I am talking about the context, which is sometimes blown out of proportion. The House rarely engages in three-hour debates&#151;even debates attended by the number of people who are present this evening&#151;on the way in which the Department of Health spends its budget, or on the fact that, as I mentioned earlier in an intervention, the budget of the Department for Work and Pensions has been unapproved by the National Audit Office on more than one occasion. I am trying to establish the context rather than evaluating the effectiveness.

I am sure that the hearings on that question will be very interesting. Are the suggestions for improving management of the budget appropriate, will those improvements lead to a positive statement of assurance by the end of the tenure of the Barroso Commission, and can lessons be learned from accounting procedures in other countries? I look forward to all those deliberations, but the last point is particularly important.

<a name="60307-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_175">It is in no way an exoneration of the Commission, in terms of its responsibility, to say that although national Governments contribute to the totality of the budget, 85&nbsp;per cent. of the funds are then administered by member states. It is extremely important for member states to take responsibility for the proper administration of those funds. As they are predominantly funds to deal with agricultural problems, and structural funds, it is frustrating for the Commission that it gets all the flak while national Governments get very little.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_176">It was suggested earlier that an independent investigation, the equivalent of a National Audit Office investigation, should be carried out to assess the performance of the Government of each member state. That is a good suggestion. The fact that it might amount to a supranational intervention does not deter me, although it might pose problems for some Members who have spoken today. However, it is very important that national Governments face up to their responsibilities, because in a sense, when they act on them badly they set a bad example not just to the Commission but to the new member countries. If Poland, which is a very considerable country itself, sees other countries not observing the rules, it might be tempted to go astray. So we must all set an example that will set the tone for how the budget and the Commission develop.

<a name="stpa_177">Whether we can improve matters by activity based budgeting or by accruals is a complex and difficult question, but the Government need to put much more pressure on the Commission than they have done to date.

One significant element of the most recent report was the attempt to simplify the rules governing the EU and all its operations.

For example, on page 234&nbsp;of the papers issued to hon. Members for this debate it is stated that the Court of Auditors budget remained at &#8364;84&nbsp;million in 2003&#150;04. It seemed to me that there was an opportunity in that period to &quot;spend to save&quot;&#151;that is, to spend additional money in the Court of Auditors to make sure that money was spent more effectively elsewhere. In contrast, in the same period the budget for the European Parliament rose by 18&nbsp;per cent., from &#8364;986&nbsp;million to &#8364;1,166.

<p><a name="st_190"><a name="60307-25_spnew0"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone) (Con):</b> 
 Important as this debate is, it also demonstrates the cultural inadequacy of the way in which the European Union conducts itself. On the issue of how taxpayers&#039; money is spent, we can look back with some pride on the fact that the Public Accounts Committee was set up under Gladstone. Nor does anyone have any serious doubt that the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee do a thorough job in identifying inadequacies and, where necessary, maladministration or fraud in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_189">However, the report by the Court of Auditors on OLAF makes the following comments:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;The Office&#039;s investigations policy is still uncertain . . . With regard to preliminary work . . . analyses are still rudimentary . . . Supervision of investigations by the Office&#039;s management has generally proved inadequate . . . The duration of investigations has not been brought under control . . . There is no system in place to measure investigators&#039; actual workload or the time they spend on investigations . . . The obligation to report investigations that are more than nine months old to the Supervisory Committee has had no notable effect . . . It is still difficult to determine the actual results of investigations. In the area of internal investigations, little progress has been achieved since 1988&nbsp;with regard to sanctions imposed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_190">As I mentioned in an earlier intervention, the report also stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;There is no independent control of the legality of investigative actions.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_191">That is an average catalogue of condemnation of the so-called efficiency of a body that was, as the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) said, set up some seven years ago. That is what the Court of Auditors is still saying about it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_192">The importance of that criticism is that OLAF is at the hard end of the so-called investigations of malfeasance in respect of taxpayers&#039; money. We have heard reference before to the question of irregularities, and I gave some figures earlier, which I shall briefly rehearse again. In 2004, for the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund there were irregularities of &#8364;82,064,000. On the structural measures, irregularities for that year totalled &#8364;531,744,438. The sum to be recovered was &#8364;357&nbsp;million. The amount declared irrecoverable, pending a formal decision, was &#8364;15&nbsp;million. Those are facts, and I take them from the official documents.

 Will my hon.

The court went on to say that it had inadequate confidence in the way that member states were administering the budget for the common agricultural policy and structural funds. One needs to put in context what is causing the problem and what is not.

<p><a name="st_194"><a name="60307-25_spnew4"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 I hear what my hon. Friend says, but I must mention again what I have said on a number of occasions. Indeed, I made a specific point in respect of the European Communities (Finance) Act 1995, when six of my colleagues lost the Whip, not over Maastricht but over European finance. I tabled an amendment to deal with the relationship between member states and the EU&#039;s financial management. In summary, I worked things out, spoke to the Comptroller and Auditor General and came to the conclusion that it was possible for the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office to have much more direct control of the money administered in the United Kingdom as a member state.

<a name="stpa_193">In other words, the accountancy principles applied in the UK by the PAC and NAO would then have been applied to EU finances in the member states.

I will not go into all the detail, but I had 45&nbsp;Members, or thereabouts, ready to vote with me on that question, and it can be fairly said that I was given assurances that those matters would be fully considered. However, to this day, some 10&nbsp;years and more later, I am still waiting to hear either from the Government or from Conservative Front Benchers that we will adopt those principles to get proper control over the money that is spent in member states.

Furthermore&#151;to refer to other contributions&#151;it relates to the European aid budget for Africa, in which I have an interest, as the chairman of the all-party Uganda group and the vice-chairman of the all-party Kenya and Tanzania groups. I am deeply worried about corruption in Africa and the relationship between that and the manner in which the EU is failing to provide the kind of effective control and delivery in relation to financial management and the budget that we ought to expect.

It is not operating even according to the terms that the Court of Auditors, or, indeed, the Government, present to us.

<p>
<a name="60307-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_196">The Minister referred to the question of nation states, and said that some rogue states might in future fail to carry themselves properly on these important questions. We already have the example of the stability and growth pact, whose rules it is perfectly obvious that people did not comply with. My hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) rightly pointed out that it is essential in matters of this kind that the rule of law be complied with. It is equally clear that there is no intention to do that, and several hon.

<a name="stpa_197">That calls into question the whole fabric, the whole system, the whole framework of the current European Union, which has led me to believe that the best way to act would be to have a form of associate status. I do not need to enlarge on that, having spoken about it on a number of occasions. At least, however, it would get us away from what I regard as a largely fraudulent approach to the European Union, which is to say that we want things to improve, while seeing almost no serious change taking place in spite of the fact that reforms are proposed in documents such as those before us that clearly have not been carried through. There are also the reforms of the Lisbon agenda, which again have been proposed but not carried through.

<a name="stpa_199">The context of the fraud should not be overlooked. A series of senior officials involved in audit and financial management have suffered personally&#151;a point I made to the Minister earlier in an intervention. Those are people who brought maladministration and financial mismanagement to light, and they cannot all be publicity seeking cranks. There are serious questions about the governance of OLAF, which was, as hon. Members will recall, instrumental in bringing about the arrest and detention of one Mr. Hans-Martin Tillack, a <i>Stern</i> journalist who had published articles critical of financial management in the Commission. According to evidence given to our sister Committee in the Lords in 2004&nbsp;by the chairman of the OLAF supervisory committee, that raid was triggered by hearsay evidence from one informant in the public relations office of the Commission, and a witness thought that any normal person would have to say that OLAF was

The programme is for environmental projects outside the EU and the Committee was especially concerned about financial probity in relation to money deployed in the west bank and Gaza strip. I did not look to see whether it was referred to in the documents because I know that the Commission had difficulty finding an inspector who was prepared to go and look at those projects, but it is a concern.

Attention was drawn to the UK&#039;s sheep annual premium scheme, for example. There was no suggestion that farmers misappropriated every single penny in the scheme, but the system in place before sheep were individually tagged meant that sheep could be counted twice by inspectors on different days. Such infringements were few and far between, but the system was not sufficiently robust to rule out the possibility of fraud. My hon.

Commissioner Kallas felt that the UK presidency was crucial in making the road map proposal work. Beyond the UK presidency, we now have to take a lead role in maintaining the pressure on these issues if we are not to come back here year after year and hear the same old story. I will give my hon.

I have already explained what I believe the achievements of our presidency were on these issues. I do not think the road map would have been taken forward if we had not prioritised it in our presidency. However, it is the beginning of a process; the delivery of it will make all the difference. My hon. Friend also expressed concern about the culture of the European Union. We have to find it encouraging that there are signs within the new Commission of a different culture that takes these issues seriously and understands the great challenges that lie ahead, whether they are globalisation or the gap that has grown in recent times in the relationship between the European Union and the citizens of Europe. I believe that there is some encouragement in the attitude of the new Commission in understanding that there has to be cultural change.

<p><a name="st_211"><a name="60307-27_spnew2"><b> Helen Jones  (Warrington, North) (Lab):</b> 
 Last autumn, I visited a group in my constituency called WASPS. It was one of the most enlightening and humbling visits I have ever made. WASPS stands for the Warrington Asperger&#039;s syndrome parents support group and when I listened to what those parents told me I was sometimes close to tears. I hasten to add that that was not because they were moaning about their lot, or complaining about the hand that life had dealt them; they were simply telling me about the day to day realities of living with a child with Asperger&#039;s syndrome and about their struggle to access even the most basic services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_240">Those parents cope every day with things that would bring most of us to our knees. They deal with stresses and strains that those of us fortunate enough to have healthy children who do not have major problems can hardly imagine, yet in my area they receive little support. I think that is because much of what they do is hidden, and helping them and their children does not seem high on anyone&#039;s list of priorities. I hope that this debate will at least help to give the problem higher priority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_241">Asperger&#039;s syndrome is a complex condition and I admit that since last autumn I have been on a steep learning curve. It has many traits in common with autism, including difficulties in communicating and in dealing with social relationships and sometimes a lack of imagination, although Asperger&#039;s syndrome children often do not experience the same difficulties in communication as many children suffering from autism&#151;for example, they may speak fluently although they can often sound stilted or formal. Nor do children with Asperger&#039;s syndrome necessarily have the learning difficulties experienced by children with autism; in fact, they are often of average or even above-average intelligence. One of the ladies in the group told me that her son had recently gone to university. There is vast potential in such children, which can be brought out if they have the right support, especially at an early age.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_242">Unfortunately, however, because Asperger&#039;s syndrome covers a wide spectrum and the disability may not be as obvious as autism, it is often a long time before the condition is recognised and diagnosed. I am told that parents often feel a sense of relief when they finally receive a diagnosis, because at least they know what the problem is. Unfortunately, however, they have to do a great deal to learn to cope with their child&#039;s complex needs and access services, often with very little support. I was astonished to find, for instance, that in my constituency parents are often given a diagnosis, then simply told to go away and read a book or join a support group. They are not told which services could help them or how they could obtain them. That is appalling, especially as those families are under a great deal of strain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-27_para14">
<a name="stpa_243">My local group carried out a survey of its members, and it found that 73&nbsp;per cent. of parents had suffered depression since the birth of their child. More than 90&nbsp;per cent. thought that they needed counselling or 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 795</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>psychological support at some stage, but very few of them received it. Only 50&nbsp;per cent. obtained any support at all, often in the form of a one-off intervention or for a very short time. The survey revealed that 65&nbsp;per cent. of parents suffer regular sleep deprivation. We know what we are like after missing a night&#039;s sleep, so we can only imagine what it is like to endure that week after week. That, however, is the reality for many of those parents. A total of 85&nbsp;per cent. thought that their career choice or their ability to work had been restricted because of their child&#039;s needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-27_para15">
<a name="stpa_244">There is a strain on relationships, and siblings in the family can be affected. The Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) takes a great interest in these matters, and I am sure that she would find the comments of parents in that group as distressing as I do. One mother, for instance, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;My daughter has started to copy behavioural tantrums and arguing because that is what she sees.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-27_para16">
<a name="stpa_245">That mother has not been offered any counselling. Another mother talked about the relationship between her son and her other children:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;They are upset by what he does, he hits them quite badly at time; their behaviour is a lot worse when he is being difficult.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-27_para17">
<a name="stpa_246">There is very little help available for those families but, in my experience, they are exactly the sort of people whom the Government say they want to support. We say that we want to support hard-working families, and I can think of few families who work as hard or who are as deserving of support. We would not dream of telling someone with a physical problem to go away and read a book or join a support group. We would not leave them in that position, and it is not acceptable for those children either. That is not what the Government intended when they drew up &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; and the national service framework for children. In those initiatives we talked about integrated children&#039;s services and clear care pathways for children, but they do not exist for those children in my constituency. Their parents have lobbied patiently and with commendable courtesy to try to improve things.

 Will my hon. Friend give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_213"><a name="60307-28_spnew1"><b> Helen Jones: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has great expertise in these matters, so I am happy to give way.
</p>








<p><a name="st_214"><a name="60307-28_spnew2"><b> Liz Blackman: </b> 
 It is no coincidence that Asperger&#039;s syndrome and high-functioning autism are labelled hidden disabilities. There is good practice, but it is patchy. The Government face an enormous challenge in making sure that the culture of every organisation that could make a contribution to support both families and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; children develops and changes so that those organisations become far more effective and responsive to all families who face that particular disability.
</p>








<p><a name="st_215"><a name="60307-28_spnew3"><b> Helen Jones: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. It is sad that good practice is not spread as widely as it should be. Before Christmas, I held a meeting with parents&#039; representatives and representatives of the primary care trust and of the local council to discuss the problems. It emerged from that meeting that educational practice is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 796</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>different in different schools. It is often a question of training, yet the local authority representative pointed out that while she could offer training courses, it was for head teachers to decide whether their special educational needs co-ordinators should attend them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_247">In its current inquiry into special needs, the Select Committee has found that a great deal more training is required, both in initial teacher training and in continuous professional development. I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will take that message back to the Department for Education and Skills.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_248">Although some parents were full of praise for the help that they had received from their child&#039;s school, others had had to struggle to get every bit of support that was given. Again, that raises questions not only about the monstrous waste of potential that is occurring, but about the implementation of Government policy on the ground. When we dealt with admissions in the report, I remember the Select Committee stating that fairness in public policy ought to be not a matter of luck, but a matter of course. The same applies to special needs.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_249">Parents also highlighted the problems they have in accessing the health service. I know that the Government have done a great deal to try and improve services for children suffering from autistic spectrum disorders, but what they wish to achieve is not always carried out in practice. Even when parents in my constituency can get assessments for their children, they often have to wait up to 12&nbsp;months for some intervention, such as speech and language therapy or occupational therapy. It is even more difficult for them to access the child and adolescent mental health services. In my area those are provided by the Five Boroughs Partnership NHS Trust, but the PCT is commissioning only the tier 3&nbsp;services, partly for historical reasons, at 25&nbsp;per cent. of what is recommended in the national service framework. That means that CAMHS tend to intervene only when a child reaches crisis point&#151;for example, when the child is self-harming. If we had earlier intervention and proper care pathways, it is my firm belief that not as many children would reach that crisis, and the strain on families would be much reduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_250">What the parents are seeking, and I agree with them, is to ensure that when a child is diagnosed with Asperger&#039;s syndrome, they are allocated a key worker or a lead nurse who can help the family access the services that they need, whether in health or in education. We should ensure as well that when that diagnosis takes place, there is a proper assessment of the child&#039;s needs and what therapies they will require. Each child is different and requires different interventions. That may be speech and language therapy or occupational therapy. They may need some input from CAMHS, not because the child is suffering a mental illness, but because they need cognitive behavioural therapy, for example, or some other psychological support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_251">That support needs to be sustained over time. Short-term interventions are often of very little help to children with Asperger&#039;s syndrome. They need sustained intervention, yet not only can people in my area find it difficult to access the higher level of services, but it is difficult for them to get even tier 2&nbsp;services. The primary care trust tells me that there is a multi-agency group looking at services for children with personal, emotional and behavioural problems. We have a lot of groups 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Mar 2006 : Column 797</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>looking into things, but what we do not have is a service. Part of the reason is that the PCT does not treat the matter seriously enough.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_252">I referred earlier to the meeting that I held. At that time the chief executive of the PCT was unable to attend because she was ill, but getting somebody else there was like drawing teeth. Although I wrote to the PCT following that meeting and it told me what it is doing with tier 2&nbsp;services, nearly three months later the PCT still has not answered my question about key workers. It still has not answered the question about linking up our education and health services more closely. If we could get such services in place, we would make it much easier for children to achieve, we would reduce the stress on their family and siblings, and in the end we might even save money. We could do it in education as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_253">Why is it often the case that when a child is given a diagnosis their parents still have to go through the whole statementing process to get them the support that they need in school? They do not want to do that. They have had a diagnosis, and that should trigger the educational interventions automatically. We are wasting money on the vast bureaucracy of statementing that should be spent on assisting these children.
</p>








<p><a name="st_216"><a name="60307-28_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Betty Williams  (Conwy) (Lab):</b> 
 I apologise for not forewarning my hon. Friend that I hoped to intervene and thank her for allowing me to do so. She says that services are patchy across the country. Does she agree that the key to any success that will help parents and their children is to have joint partnerships between education, social services and health? Has she met parents who have been called into a case conference to discuss the future of their child or, in some cases, children? They find that a very traumatic experience; I speak as someone who has been in that position. Somebody somewhere needs to take that on board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_254">Does my hon. Friend agree that local education authorities sometimes deliberately hold back on statementing a child because they know full well that once that happens the parents are able to demand the proper services for them?
</p>








<p><a name="st_217"><a name="60307-28_spnew5"><b> Helen Jones: </b> 
 I agree that we need much more co-ordination of services. The real problem for parents is that they are having to deal with so many different people. That is why a key worker and a proper care pathway are crucial in getting the services that children need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_255">I know that my hon. Friend the Minister is sympathetic to what I am saying and takes these issues seriously because she has had to deal with them in her own constituency. I believe that there is a real need to support these families and to ensure that their children get what for our children is a basic entitlement&#151;the right to develop their full potential. We should ask ourselves, &quot;Would this service be good enough for my son or daughter.&quot; I have to say that in my area, it is not. I hope that my hon. Friend will at least be able to signal that we will soon see some improvement and these children will get what others regard as a basic right.

<a name="stpa_259">In the past decade, we have all experienced a change in how we think about the delivery of services. Indeed, children and young people with autistic spectrum disorders&#151;ASD&#151;including Asperger&#039;s syndrome, provide a test case for whether services are working together. Clearly, my hon. Friend feels that they are not working as well as they could in her part of the country. Those children&#039;s difficulties require input from health, social services and the education service. As my hon. Friend the Member for Conwy said, it is important that the different organisations work together. We are encouraging that discussion across Government, but, as hon. Members have asked, what are the practical results of those discussions?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_260">The large increase in the number of children identified with ASD, including Asperger&#039;s syndrome, presents considerable challenges for local providers. For many generations, the difficulties and problems that those children and their families face were not even acknowledged. We recognise the challenge and, in 2002, the Department and the Department for Education and Skills published good practice guidance on ASD.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_261">For such specialist provision, the ASD good practice guidance recommends a regional approach. The north-west special educational needs regional partnership, which includes Warrington, is one of the England-wide partnerships that have focused on provision for children&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with ASD. A partnership is helpful in such circumstances because it means that one can not only 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>examine the cash and specialist resources and ascertain what one can deliver, but discuss and share good practice. The latter is one of the main aims of such partnerships. I welcome that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para15">
<a name="stpa_262">A key to good provision, which the guidance highlighted, is co-operative working between services. We have shown how that can happen through the autism exemplar, which we published in the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services. It sets national outcome standards for health and social services and, importantly, their links to education. The exemplar shows the pathway for one young boy, starting at the age of three, as he moves through to post-16&nbsp;provision. It begins with initial concern and identification through multi-agency assessment and diagnosis and moves to the various forms of support, whether social services support or specialist education provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para16">
<a name="stpa_263">All local services should aim for such provision for children with ASD. I shall ensure that all comments about education are passed on to the appropriate Minister in the Department for Education and Skills. The exemplar focuses on a child with autism, but children and young people with ASD, including Asperger&#039;s, should benefit from the improvements that the Government are bringing about through their general policies for children and young people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para17">
<a name="stpa_264">Through the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; change programme, we are bringing together education and social services locally under one director of children&#039;s services. Again, I stress that such joined-up thinking can occur and I hope that, when we provide training and support for special educational needs co-ordinators, head teachers understand that that can help their school&#039;s management, their relationships with parents and the children&#039;s achievement, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North said, can reach university level. If families feel that the children are getting a chance to fulfil their potential, that brings hope.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para18">
<a name="stpa_265">&quot;Every Child Matters&quot; promotes common commissioning and funding through children&#039;s trust arrangements and integrates services for children and families in children&#039;s centres and full-service extended schools. In our White Paper, &quot;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&quot;, we set out that, for disabled children, children with complex health needs and those in need of palliative care, we want primary care trusts to ensure that the right models of service are developed by undertaking a review of their capacity and the delivery of integrated care pathways to meet the children&#039;s national service framework standards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-28_para19">
<a name="stpa_266">Primary care trusts must also agree service models, funding and commissioning arrangements with their strategic health authorities. Of course, the needs of every different child with Asperger&#039;s syndrome may be different. However, I take on board my hon. Friend&#039;s point about examples of where the position has reached crisis point. That prompts the question of whether better understanding of the child&#039;s needs and an appropriate care pathway would have been not only more effective but, in the long run, more cost effective for the support for that child and his or her family.

<a name="stpa_267">We intend to follow this matter up in the autumn, in the refreshment of the NHS priorities and planning guide, which sets out the &quot;must do&quot; requirements for inclusion in local delivery plans. The Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne) is meeting PCTs, health service providers and national bodies on 15&nbsp;March to look at how we can ensure that the complex pathway of care for disabled children and those with complex health needs is translated into the reality of purchasing better services. I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North that I shall ensure that my colleague has full sight of the report of this debate.

<p><a name="st_219"><a name="60307-29_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Betty Williams: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend acknowledge that the important step that a child takes when leaving school and going into further education, or wherever the path might lead, is crucial? At the moment, that is where the weakness is. Education, social services and prospective employers do not seem to be working together for the benefit of those children and young people.
</p>








<p><a name="st_220"><a name="60307-29_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 There has long been a problem for children with special needs, in relation to their transition from children&#039;s services to adult services and the adult world. We are attempting to improve that position, certainly in mental health services, and considerable work has also been done in social services. I agree with my hon. Friend, however, that more needs to be done. Young people with degrees will be valuable members of whichever work force they enter, and it is important to ensure that people, whatever their disabilities, can have a crack at having as independent and fulfilling a life as possible. I shall pass on the point that my hon. Friend has raised about the transition from childhood to adulthood. We identified earlier the support that we wanted to give to children and young people. We do not want to see all that investment lost if, in adulthood, they are unable to use that support to good effect as they grow older.

<a name="60307-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_268">I am aware that Cheshire and Merseyside strategic health authority has proposed the retention of a single PCT for Warrington. I am advised by the SHA that the PCT has well-established joint working with Warrington council through the health and well-being partnership. I understand that Warrington council sees provision for children with ASD, including those with Asperger&#039;s syndrome, as an area of development. It recognises that this is an area that has more potential in regard to delivery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60307-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_269">I know that the local authority is also exploring developing its specialist provision in its schools for those with ASD. The development of a range of educational provision for children with ASD is encouraged by the ASD good practice guidance. However, the PCT recognises the need to work more closely with Warrington council, and it intends to strengthen joint commissioning for mental health, learning disabilities, children, older people and child and adolescent mental health services, with a view to improving them.

I understand that, following that meeting, the PCT wrote to her about the development of a new tier 2&nbsp;service, which will provide a service for children and young people whose symptoms and/or behaviours are indicative of an emotional or behavioural problem. That would include children with Asperger&#039;s syndrome. The service will be delivered in line with standard 7&nbsp;of the children&#039;s national service framework and &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; by a multidisciplinary team.

 I am sorry to hear that, as I have obviously been authorised to announce that in this public forum. I hope that there will be a constructive relationship between the PCT and the parents of children with Asperger&#039;s syndrome. This is part of recognising the partnership that I mentioned earlier.
