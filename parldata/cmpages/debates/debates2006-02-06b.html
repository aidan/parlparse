 (Con): In how many cases where the independent case examiner found in favour of the applicant the decision was subsequently not implemented by the Child Support Agency, in the last year for which figures are available. [48319]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60206-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr. James Plaskitt): </b> 
 The agency makes special payments both on the basis of decisions made by its chief executive and on the basis of recommendations by the independent case examiner. The CSA accepts the findings of the examiner in all cases except when it believes that the examiner&#039;s findings were based on erroneous information. It estimates that that has applied to only a handful of cases in the last two years.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60206-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 I wish to draw attention to a case of which I gave the Minister prior notice&#151;that of Mrs. Sonia Poulton, who lives in Cirencester. The case dates back as far as June 2001. I finally referred it to the independent case examiner in August 2004&nbsp;after protracted correspondence. A year later, in August 2005, the examiner ruled that there were serious shortcomings in the way in which the CSA had handled the case, that compensation was to be paid for the &#163;5,100&nbsp;arrears, and that an apology should be given. Since then, the CSA has prevaricated. It has changed its mind about what the compensation should be with a stroke of the pen on numerous occasions, sometimes to the tune of many thousands of pounds.

<p>
<a name="60206-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">I re-referred the case to the independent case examiner, and heard from her on 31&nbsp;January 2006. Her letter stated:

<a name="60206-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">This case is dreadful. It needs to be resolved. The CSA is out of control, with no effective right of appeal. Will the Minister look into the matter personally, so that my constituent can receive the proper justice that she deserves?

<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 580</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60206-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 I can tell the hon. Gentleman that I have already done so. I have studied the case file, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for drawing it to my attention before Question Time. As he says, the delay in implementation of the independent case examiner&#039;s recommendations is essentially due to a dispute over the true level of arrears. I understand that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituent has now accepted an advance payment of arrears. I am assured that an attachment of earnings is in operation, that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituent is receiving maintenance payments, and that the agency is writing to her today. I hope that it will be able to clarify all the outstanding points.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60206-01_spnew2"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Can the Minister confirm that the number of cases being referred to the independent case examiner is still on a steeply rising curve? Does that not demonstrate that any option for the agency&#039;s future other than its replacement by part of Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs would be doomed to failure?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60206-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 In fact, the number of complaints referred to the independent case examiner is fairly steady. Last year, 2,973&nbsp;cases were referred to her. She rejected 1,700&nbsp;and took out 1,257. She issued orders for financial redress in 1,604&nbsp;cases. Given that the rate of complaints is fairly steady and that the agency also receives complaints directly, amounting to 3&nbsp;per cent. of the case load, the situation is not deteriorating. I do not agree with my hon. Friend that the fact that complaints are made necessarily suggests that the agency should be scrapped completely.
</p>





<p><a name="qn_o1">2. <a name="60206-01_wqn1"><b> Peter Luff  (Mid-Worcestershire)</b> 
 (Con): What his most recent assessment is of the effectiveness of the Child Support Agency in securing maintenance from absent parents. [48320]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60206-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr. John Hutton): </b> 
 Although there has been recent improvement in some areas, the overall performance of the agency is unacceptable. We are currently looking at ways of improving the discharge of its core functions so that more families receive the right maintenance at the right time. I hope to make a statement shortly.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60206-01_spnew4"><b> Peter Luff: </b> 
 I am partly encouraged by that answer, obviously, but I am increasingly sceptical about whether a rule-bound bureaucracy like the CSA is capable of dealing with the malicious ingenuity of men who avoid responsibility for children whom they have fathered. Will the Secretary of State look personally at two cases that have caused me particular concern? One involves a woman, a victim of domestic violence who cannot recover the arrears that she is owed by her ex-husband and is bizarrely having to pay him maintenance now. The other involves a woman who is struggling with debt as her ex-husband uses every trick in the book to avoid responsibility for his child. Will the Secretary of State review those cases personally, and assure me that the new CSA that he seems to be offering will really deal with such cases better?

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60206-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 As I said, I shall wish to make a statement to the House shortly, setting out what we need to do to resolve a situation that is clearly unacceptable. I will certainly look into the cases that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. I hope that all Members on both sides of the House agree at least on this: while relationships all too often come to an end, responsibilities for children never do. That must be the bottom line in all cases.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60206-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Frank Field  (Birkenhead)</b> 
 (Lab): I assure the Secretary of State that many Labour Members look forward to his statement and, hopefully, will support it. Will he be able to stress in that statement that while he will look for more effective ways of collecting maintenance in the future, we still need to make the CSA more effective for those who are currently trying to depend on it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60206-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I agree with my right hon. Friend and I am sure that many people are looking forward to the statement that I plan to make. It is certainly true that there are no simple solutions to the situation that we now face in respect of the CSA, and I am grateful to him for his comments in that regard. I further agree that we must do all that we possibly can to ensure that the CSA discharges its functions&#151;functions that, after all, we in this House gave to it&#151;cost-effectively and efficiently. Our number one priority at all times must be to secure the maximum maintenance due to children.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60206-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. David Laws  (Yeovil)</b> 
 (LD): The last time that the House considered reform of the CSA, Ministers told us that threatening non-compliant parents with the loss of their driving licences would make them pay their dues. It is clear that that has not worked&#151;only 11&nbsp;driving licences have been withdrawn in the past five years. Will the Secretary of State undertake that when he makes his statement later on this week, there will be no more gimmicks or reviews, and that there will be a fundamental reform of this failing agency?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60206-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 No, there will not be any gimmicks. We need to see a significant improvement in the CSA&#039;s performance on enforcement. On driving licences, it is worth bearing it in mind that, sometimes, the threat of such a sanction can have the desired effect, so if I were the hon. Gentleman I would not place too much emphasis on the instances in which that threat has been carried out.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60206-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham)</b> 
 (Lab): Like the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), I have a number of cases in my constituency of men using the system to avoid making payments to former partners. In his forthcoming statement, will my right hon. Friend tackle the problem of self-employed people who use ingenious methods to avoid their liabilities?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60206-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Yes, we certainly will address that issue. It is common knowledge in all parts of the House that the current legal framework does not lend itself to efficient and effective enforcement. It is far too easy for far too many non-resident parents to evade their financial responsibilities to their children, and that must not be allowed to continue.

 (Con): Will the right hon. Gentleman tell the House what the arguments of principle or practice are against allowing the Revenue to collect maintenance at the same time as collecting tax?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60206-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 As the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows, Ministers have addressed this issue from time to time&#151;not least Ministers of his own Government, who decided not to proceed down that route, but instead to set up the CSA as a stand-alone agency. With great respect to him, I do not want to get into a detailed debate today about the various alternatives and options. I intend to make a statement to the House in the very near future, in which we will set out clearly how we want to address this issue. It is a very important one, and it is right and proper that Members have the opportunity to put their various points of view to me. We will then consider the best, most intelligent and sensible way in which we can take matters forward.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60206-01_spnew14"><b> Rob Marris  (Wolverhampton, South-West)</b> 
 (Lab): My constituent, Mrs. X, is owed approximately &#163;35,000&nbsp;in maintenance going back some 12&nbsp;years. When I took up her case last autumn, I discovered that no enforcement had ever taken place. The CSA is now saying that because some of that debt was accumulated more than seven years ago, it will not seek enforcement. Does my right hon. Friend think that is an acceptable state of affairs, and will he assure me that in his statement and in ensuing legislation&#151;should it come along&#151;that issue will be addressed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60206-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I am not familiar with the details of the case to which my hon. Friend refers, but as he knows, there is of course a general bar on civil action against debt owed beyond a certain period. I made it clear in responding to the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) that the CSA&#039;s current performance against a range of measures is simply inadequate and unacceptable, and that is particularly true of enforcement. I spoke to the CSA&#039;s chief executive and urged him to improve its enforcement record, and I am very glad to say that there has been a significant increase in the number of cases that the CSA is proceeding to enforcement. That is right and proper, and we must keep this issue at the forefront of our minds as we consider the right way forward.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60206-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Philip Hammond  (Runnymede and Weybridge)</b> 
 (Con): We look forward to the statement that the Secretary of State said he will make shortly. Will he take the opportunity during today&#039;s exchange to say something directly to the 900,000&nbsp;or so families still trapped by the CSA&#039;s old assessment rules, the 330,000&nbsp;families whose applications for child support payments are sitting unprocessed in CSA offices and the some 30&nbsp;per cent. of parents with care who are not getting the child maintenance payments for which they have been assessed and to which they are entitled?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60206-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The conversion of old cases to the new scheme has been a sad and sorry saga. It has not been possible to find a sensible way to migrate those cases and I intend to speak about that shortly in this House. The backlog of cases that have not yet been properly 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 583</b>

</p>





<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60206-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Hammond: </b> 
 Indeed that is totally unacceptable, but it was not clear from the Secretary of State&#039;s response whether he accepts the Government&#039;s responsibility for this epic tale of managerial failure. Does he accept that the Government are responsible for what has happened in the CSA and the suffering caused to so many families by it? If he cannot assure the House of any early migration of the old rules cases to the new system, would he at least act&#151;in the interests of fairness&#151;to extend the &#163;10&nbsp;per week child maintenance premium to parents in receipt of those old rules payments?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60206-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Again, with great respect to the hon. Gentleman, I shall not make a series of announcements about those matters this afternoon. I intend to come to the House in the near future to make a statement about all of them. It is self-evident that the problem of conversion is well documented and it has proved to be immensely difficult to make the journey from the old scheme to the new one. Again, I am sorry not to be able to help the hon. Gentleman very much this afternoon, but I intend to come to the House and deal with that matter in the near future.

</p>


<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60206-01_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr. James Plaskitt): </b> 
 We have no plans to change the existing rules. Employees&#039; earnings include monetary allowances, such as those provided to aid the purchase of private vehicles. However, earnings taken into account for child support purposes do not include benefits in kind, such as the provision of a car by a company to an employee.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60206-01_spnew20"><b> Bob Russell: </b> 
 Will the Minister explain the principal reason why the two categories cannot be considered on equal merit?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60206-01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 Yes. The rules are currently drawn in such a way that they are aligned with other income-related benefits and the taxation system. There would be only two ways of achieving the goal that the hon. Gentleman suggested. The first would be to include the company car in the assessment, which would require the CSA to become an asset valuation agency&#151;not a function we want to load on to it in addition to its existing tasks&#151;and the second would be to exclude the car purchase payment. That would take the arrangement out of line with the benefit and tax system and, in any case, the trend nowadays is towards payment for car purchase. If we exempted that, many parents with care would have fairly robust views about it.

 (Lab): What his plans are to reduce fraud in the benefit system. [48322]

<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 584</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>


<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60206-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Hutton): </b> 
 Fraud in income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance has fallen by two thirds since 1997. Housing benefit fraud has fallen by a third. The amount of fraud is now at the lowest recorded level and we will continue to take steps to reduce these levels further in future. We are also taking more enforcement action. In 2004&#150;05, in partnership with local authorities, 43,000&nbsp;prosecutions and sanctions were imposed: a fourfold increase since 1998.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60206-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Wright: </b> 
 I appreciate what my right hon. Friend is doing, but in its report of last year on dealing with complexities in the benefit system, the National Audit Office stated that

<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="60206-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that important point. It is worth bearing in mind that the Public Accounts Committee has acknowledged the good progress that the Government have been making in recent years to tackle the serious problem of benefit fraud. Those who cheat and defraud the taxpayer must be prosecuted, because not only are they self-evidently breaking the law, they also undermine the legitimate claims of people on benefit, and we shall not tolerate that for a second either. In relation to my hon. Friend&#039;s specific point, chapter 7&nbsp;of the recently published Green Paper on welfare reform set out a series of measures that will deal with the problem of complexity and benefit fraud. We are awaiting the response to the consultation, which will finish by the end of April.

<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="60206-02_spnew2"><b> Miss Julie Kirkbride  (Bromsgrove)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Secretary of State accept that the recently organised scam of the tax credit system, which involved a loss of many millions of pounds to the taxpayer, was in large part due to the fact that the Government have made it too easy to claim tax credit? Bearing in mind that it is a duty of the Government to ensure that people who receive benefits should be entitled to them, will the Secretary of State promise the House to make it somewhat more difficult to claim tax credits so that the taxpayer can have confidence that the system pays people who deserve it rather than those who do not?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="60206-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 All the arrangements for claiming tax credit, which is not a benefit, as the hon. Lady will know, have to be robust, because they involve public money and resources. She has offered her own interpretation of the events that led to that issue, and it is probably better for me as the Secretary of State to wait until the formal criminal proceedings and investigations are over before I add my ha&#039;p&#039;orth to the argument about how easy it is to claim benefits or about what the cause of that fraudulent series of applications might have been.

 I do not want to pass the buck, but I am tempted to say that those are matters for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.

Is not that yet another reason why the card account should be kept beyond 2010?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o33"><a name="60206-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 We have a clear understanding with the Post Office about the use of Post Office card accounts. It was always clear from the beginning that the contract&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Oh yes it was. It was absolutely explicit that the contract was to last until 2010. If the hon. Gentleman would like to see a copy of the contract, I should be happy to supply him with the details. I do not believe that he is right to draw a parallel between the use of the Post Office card account and BACS&#151;the bankers automated clearing service&#151;for benefit payments. With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, I do not think that he would say that BACS was inherently more susceptible to fraud; it processes hundreds of millions of transactions successfully for the DWP every year. It is a sign of the progress and modernisation of our benefits system that we are prepared to use BACS more widely and I am surprised that the Liberal Democrats seem not to recognise the progress and the efficiencies that the system represents for taxpayers.

 No, I do not agree. We are seeing pressures on defined benefit schemes in the UK, as elsewhere, arising mainly from rising life expectancy and volatility in the stock market, but also from increased transparency in accounting standards.

 Yes, I have seen those concerns. Under the new arrangements, firms and trustees will be required to have a plan for closing the deficit on each scheme.

<p><a name="st_o70"><a name="60206-04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for his answer, but he will know of the growing concern that changes to the regulatory environment have driven the UK&#039;s defined benefit pension schemes to shift into bonds, especially long-dated index-linked bonds, driving their yields down to incredibly low levels. He will also know that that has caused companies to invest less in their own businesses. Does he share my concern that those changes will only increase pension deficits and damage the economy as a whole?

<p><a name="st_o71"><a name="60206-04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s analysis. The type of investments held by schemes does not have any bearing on the calculation of the Pension Protection Fund levy next year.

 The Minister will be aware of the immense problems caused, particularly in Skegness, by the unannounced recent implementation of regulation 91, which relates to the jobseeker&#039;s allowance. That is causing significant hardship to seasonal workers, all of whom anticipated being able to claim benefit in the winter months, as they have done in previous years. That change in Government policy has led to people being evicted from their homes, people having to pawn their possessions, and people fainting through hunger in the Skegness benefits office. This matter requires the Minister&#039;s urgent attention. Will he assure me and my suffering constituents that he and his civil servants will look into it with the utmost urgency?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="60206-05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 I have looked into the particular circumstances. In Lincolnshire, the remunerative work rules for seasonal workers were incorrectly applied prior to June 2005. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there has been no policy change. The problem has been in deciding a condition of entitlement&#151;namely, whether the customers in question are in remunerative work. Decision makers are now applying the legislation correctly. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that no action has been taken against customers who received JSA when the rules for seasonal workers were applied incorrectly and that no one has been asked to repay any benefit paid.

 (Con): Is the Minister aware that seasonal workers in my constituency who work at the sugar beet factory at Wissington, in the fishing industry, or in food processing, and who have tried to find jobs out of season but have been unable to do so, have in the past always been able to claim benefit? They are most concerned about the fact that they have had no warning whatsoever and have therefore been unable to plan their lives and make other arrangements. What does the Minister say to those constituents of mine, who are in a real dilemma?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o95"><a name="60206-05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 There has been no change. The rules were set down in clause 1(2)(e) of the 1995&nbsp;Act, if the hon. Gentleman would like to take a look. The rules laid down for seasonal work are clear. The Act states that where there is a cycle of work consisting of one year or more that qualifies as seasonal work, and if the weekly average of hours worked over the cycle is 16&nbsp;or more, there is no entitlement to JSA. Those have been the rules since 1995, and those are the rules still enacted.

However, the Post Office card account contract was run until 2010, and it was stated explicitly in that contract that the arrangement was a transitional one. As I said, 25&nbsp;other bank accounts are currently accessible across a post office counter, and by the time the contract runs out in 2010&nbsp;there are likely to be more. In the meantime, we will assist any pensioner or other benefit recipient who wants to make a transfer from card account to those accounts.

It would be entirely proper for those offended by the cartoons to mount a peaceful demonstration against their publication. The right to demonstrate is an extremely important part of the rights of British citizens. It is, however, a right with clear limits. That does not include a right to incite violence, which is outside the law.

One of the strengths of our society is the fact that most people, in general, weigh up the consequences of what they do before they act. However, beyond those matters, the House has consistently acknowledged that, in certain circumstances, it is appropriate to place legal restrictions on absolute freedom of expression. That is the case for incitement to violence, as has been said, and for certain aspects of incitement to hatred. I think that it is also the case for the incitement or glorification of terrorism.

<br>&nbsp;<br>in this country, in what has been a great multicultural society? There has been a great achievement by the Asian community, with Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims working with the rest of the community. What these extremists are doing is destroying the fundamental fabric of what has been achieved. Will the Home Secretary call in moderate Muslims and ask them to demonstrate publicly in the same spirit as those other people were demonstrating, to show that they have nothing to do with what those people were doing on Friday? The grotesque, inflammatory language that they used was not part and parcel of this society.
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60206-07_spnew6"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I agree. Perhaps I should reinforce the point that I made earlier: the leadership of all parts of the Muslim community has expressed exactly the sentiments set out by my hon. Friend. I do not need to call in the leaders of the Muslim community to make that point because they have been doing so, and I am confident that they will continue to do so very strongly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_18">Perhaps I can make one other point in response to the question. My hon. Friend is right to identify the fact that there are forces in this country, including within the Muslim community, who seek to weaken and damage the democratic fabric of our society. That is why the Terrorism Bill that is now before Parliament contains proposals on proscription of certain organisations that set out to do that. We are widening the criteria for proscription precisely to address the point that my hon. Friend makes, and I hope that those considerations, too, will have the support of the House when we come to look at the Terrorism Bill in the round.

 The behaviour of the police in the next few weeks will help us to define whether our tolerance has slipped to become licence for a small minority, and we will watch very carefully to see how they proceed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_19">Has the Home Secretary had any conversations with his colleagues in the Foreign Office? It is absolutely clear from all events that the behaviour of some middle eastern Governments in fomenting, stirring up and creating even worse elements of hatred over the last three or four days should be approached and dealt with publicly. After all, those Governments have been the sponsors of some of the worst cartoons, showing Israelis in absolutely the worst light, with Jewish flags flying from concentration camp photographs. That was quite outrageous, but nothing was ever done. Will the Home Secretary please now urge his colleagues to make very strong representations, and public ones at that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60206-07_spnew8"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 It is for that reason that I made remarks in my initial statement supporting the Danish Government against the attacks that they are experiencing from a number of countries. Yes, I have talked about the matter with colleagues in the Foreign Office, and yes, I can give the House the assurance that strong representations are being made in the direction to which the right hon. Gentleman referred.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 604</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>some of us in the House would have supported them, and the entire House would accept that they had an absolute right to do it? But to stage a demonstration that is a clear incitement to violence in an attempt to impose censorship on others is quite a different thing. Difficult as it may be, the test of a society&#039;s commitment to freedom of speech, which I think is particularly important in the multicultural society that we have today, is not just our willingness to defend people who say things that we agree with, but our willingness to defend those who say things with which we profoundly disagree.

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="60206-08_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I agree with that statement. That is an important aspect of everything that we have said on these matters. But I say again that incitement to violence, to hatred and to terrorism is, in my opinion, a step beyond the absolute freedom of speech and needs legislation if it is to be addressed properly.
</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="60206-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Roger Gale  (North Thanet) (Con):</b> 
 In the past, the Home Office has extolled the virtues of the stop forms that now have to be completed when officers stop people in the street. On Friday, however, on the one recent occasion when the information collated from such forms might just have been of value, it would appear that they were not being issued. Why? If the answer is that it would have been unsafe to do so, will the Home Secretary now consider abandoning them?
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="60206-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 As I said earlier, these are operational matters for the police to consider, and that was the judgment that they made. I will look at the matter in the round when the whole situation is analysed, but it would be a mistake for any Home Secretary to cut across the operational decisions made by the police in these circumstances.

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="60206-08_spnew3"><b> Jeremy Corbyn  (Islington, North) (Lab):</b> 
 Does the Home Secretary accept that, in the multi-faith, multicultural society of modern Britain, we should obviously condemn the ludicrous and obscene language that was used last week? Does he also accept that we should ask those with power in the media and elsewhere not to turn this into a condemnation of Islam as a whole, thus further damaging community relations in this country? Should they not instead extol the virtues of a free society in which everyone is free to practise whatever religion they choose?
</p>





<p><a name="st_19"><a name="60206-08_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend. However, I shall now say something that is very rare for me: a word of defence for the media in these circumstances. Their coverage of these matters has generally not been a critique of Islam or the Muslim world as a whole. In fact, even some of the most vociferous newspapers have quoted prominently the position of Muslim leaders who oppose these actions. I agree with my hon. Friend, but I am not sure that the media have gone out of line with his views on this occasion.
</p>





<p><a name="st_20"><a name="60206-08_spnew5"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis  (New Forest, East) (Con):</b> 
 Is it not significant that the very people who were behaving in the way that has so outraged the House are also the very people who would have supported the original atrocities that led to the ill-considered cartoons in the first place? Is not the one good thing to come out of all this the fact that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 605</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the leaders of the moderate Muslim majority have passed with flying colours the test that so many people set when they asked them to come out and condemn the extremists? Let us hope that they will continue to do that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="60206-08_spnew6"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am not going to make judgments about what the individuals at those demonstrations would or would not have done on any particular occasion. I have never doubted&#151;and I do not think that most hon. Members have doubted&#151;that the leadership of the Muslim community across the whole country would deplore acts of this kind, and that they would come out and state that. That is indeed what they have done.
</p>





<p><a name="st_22"><a name="60206-08_spnew7"><b> Mr. Dennis Skinner  (Bolsover) (Lab):</b> 
 The Home Secretary keeps referring to the fact that the police have certain duties and that he has certain duties, and that ne&#039;er the twain shall meet. Why is there one set of rules for those who engage in a holy war, while there is quite another for those who engage in a class war, such as the miners&#039; strike of 1984&#150;85? That highly volatile situation lasted for a whole year and 7,000&nbsp;miners were arrested, some only for shouting, &quot;Scab!&quot; Why do the police have one set of rules for them, and another set for others? During that period, not one Tory Minister condemned the police for their actions.
</p>





<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60206-08_spnew8"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I hope that policing has moved on since those days, when, as I know my hon. Friend recalls, a Conservative Government were in place. It is important to emphasise that my hon. Friend is right to say that it is appropriate for policing decisions to be taken on policing grounds, and for politics to be done on political grounds. The question of what happened during the miners&#039; strike remains a matter of debate.

 Does the Home Secretary agree that the restraint and objectivity that the media have shown in dealing with the publication of the cartoons, and with the events that have followed, have greatly assisted the police in their tasks over the past few days? Would it not be a good idea if that restraint continued? Does not this also show that the British media are not institutionally racist?
</p>





<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60206-08_spnew10"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the British media in this case, which is why I said &quot;the response in Britain to publication of the Danish cartoons has, in general, been respectful and restrained&quot;.

 Did not this weekend&#039;s events show not so much the real face of Islam but a hideous distortion of Islam, effectively undermined by the fundamentalism that can affect any religion in the world and is not by any means the sole prerogative of Islam? Does my right hon. Friend accept that Sir Iqbal Sacranie had every right to say whatever he wanted about homosexuality on the &quot;Today&quot; programme, without the police having to visit him afterwards?

 The conduct of most, of many, of the demonstrators was pretty atrocious, but should we not be very careful about invoking criminal law? After all, most of the relevant offences, particularly incitement, require specific intent. That is different in kind from hot-headed and unpleasant rhetoric. The truth is, surely, that in a democracy we have to put up with a great deal that we dislike and of which we disapprove, and in general we should not invoke the criminal law. Failed prosecutions, after all, tend to be extremely counter-productive.

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60206-08_spnew14"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 It is because I agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman that we must be very careful when dealing with the criminal law in these areas that I believe the best people to make those judgments are the police and the prosecuting authorities.

 Does the Secretary of State agree that if we are to build a just and tolerant society we must also have a better understanding of the hurt that was caused in the Islamic world by the original cartoons? Had that incident not already shown, before the demonstration took place, that we should all recognise the need to engage in a much better and deeper dialogue with the world of Islam? Do not all of us, as Members of Parliament, have a responsibility to work out how we can better understand the world of Islam if we are to live peacefully in the 21st century?

 I agree, which is why I supported what was said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee. He said that we should view integration in that way.

<a name="60206-08_head0"><h3 align=center>Coroners System (Reform)</h3>
<a name="time_1">
<a name="60206-08_time0"><h5>3.58&nbsp;pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_34"><a name="60206-08_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Ms Harriet Harman): </b> 
 With permission, I shall make a statement on reform of the coroner service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_20">The coroners system is of great importance. When someone dies a violent or sudden death, when the cause of death is not certain or when the identity of a body is not known, there must, in the public interest, be a proper inquiry, and the bereaved relatives need to know what happened and why.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_21">Coroners, and the officers who support them, deal with cases that are always sad and often tragic. That was exemplified most recently in the work of the three coroners and their staff who dealt so sensitively and expeditiously with co-ordination of the identification process in the tragic aftermath of the 7&nbsp;July London bombings. I pay tribute to coroners and their staff, and acknowledge the difficult and important work that they do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_22">The service contains many coroners and staff who are dedicated and committed, but I think we all believe that the system within which they do their work could be much, much better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_23">There has been long-standing interest in and concern about the coroner service in this House, because all Members have constituents who involved them in cases that ended up in the coroner&#039;s court. I am sure that we all want a coroner service that enables committed coroners and their officers to ensure that the public interest is served in all inquests in every part of the country, and which enables bereaved relatives to have their answers; that is not the case at the moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_24">Under the current coroner service, families frequently get overlooked during the inquest process. There is nowhere for them to turn when they think that something is going wrong; there is no complaints system. The system is fragmented, with no national leadership, and it is not accountable. We have no overview of the system as a whole, or of individual cases. Moreover, the system is not properly accountable to this House, which it should be. Standards are not uniformly good; everything rests too much on the personal qualities and abilities of individuals within the system. The legal framework is downright archaic. For most coroners, this is not even their principal occupation; it is a secondary one, added on to their main work as solicitors in private practice. Most coroner&#039;s officers have to learn on the job as they handle the most technically complex and personally difficult cases, with no systematic training. That is not fair on relatives or on the coroner&#039;s officers themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_25">The coroner service must serve the public interest and meet bereaved families&#039; concerns in a way that, frankly, it currently does not. That is what these proposals aim to achieve and through them, we will do three things. First, we will put a proper focus on bereaved families and give them a clear legal standing in the system. We will set out the way in which the system should deal with families. We will give them the right to ask the coroner for a second opinion on a death, and to challenge coroners&#039; rulings on how the investigation and inquest is run, and we will establish a complaints system.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 608</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_26">Secondly, we will strengthen coroners&#039; work. There will be a proper system for appointing coroners, and all will have to be legally qualified. Moreover, the role of coroner will have to be their only job. They will have a clear power to investigate a death, even where a certificate has been issued, and they will have additional powers to obtain evidence for their investigations. Dedicated medical advice will be available to them, and there will be an end to archaic boundary restrictions, which cause unnecessary difficulties when major incidents occur or when specialised examinations need carrying out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_27">Thirdly, we will establish a national framework for coroners&#039; work. For the first time, there will be a chief coroner, who will give leadership to coroners in the same way as the Lord Chief Justice does to judges. There will be a coronial advisory council, a system of inspection and a national training system for coroners and their officers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-08_para8">
<a name="stpa_28">The question of a second certification of a death was a key issue in the third report of Dame Janet Smith into the Shipman murders. The Government have continued to examine the proposal that every death in England and Wales&#151;some 500,000&nbsp;a year&#151;should have additional medical scrutiny by the coroner service. The coroner reforms that I am announcing to the House today do not stand alone. They will be complemented by further work being taken forward in the Department of Health, which is aimed at improving patient safety and promoting quality in the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-08_para9">
<a name="stpa_29">We need a system that can identify and investigate suspicious deaths, but which allows families to proceed quickly with funeral arrangements where there is no cause for concern. We are not sure that the proposal to have all deaths referred to coroners achieves that, but we will continue to look at this issue and we are not ruling out the possibility of further reform.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-08_para10">
<a name="stpa_30">I should like to thank both Dame Janet Smith and Tom Luce for their work, and to thank the voluntary organisations that have advised me from the viewpoint of bereaved families. I have placed a background note in the House of Commons Vote Office and in the Libraries of both Houses. It gives more detail on the measures that I have announced today and it shows how we have built on the work of Dame Janet and Mr. Luce. We intend to proceed by way of a draft coroners Bill this spring to enable pre-legislative scrutiny, probably by the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee. In parallel with such scrutiny, I intend to arrange a separate strand of pre-legislative scrutiny that will greatly help to inform the House. This will consist of pre-legislative scrutiny by families who have recent experience of the coroner service. I commend these proposals to the House.

<p><a name="st_35"><a name="60206-09_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jonathan Djanogly  (Huntingdon) (Con):</b> 
 Coroners&#039; courts are, as the Minister said, undoubtedly a very important issue. In the context of Harold Shipman, the Hatfield rail crash and the more recent example, which she mentioned, of the July bombings, effective coroners&#039; courts and the investigation of death are highly sensitive issues. Alongside the registration of deaths, coroners&#039; courts should provide a reliable system for collecting data on deaths and monitoring trends in deaths. They should provide appropriate investigation into suspicious deaths in order to uncover 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 609</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>wrongdoing and offer a thorough and sensitive service for relatives of those who die suddenly and unexpectedly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_31">However, they also need to provide for large cases, in relation to which capacity has been an issue. Will the Minister explain how the proposed system would have helped the investigation of the deaths of Harold Shipman&#039;s patients and those who suffered in Hatfield, the types of inquest where picking up patterns of behaviour is needed and capacity has been a problem?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_32">Reform of the coroner and death certification service has been under consideration for some time and it is about time that an effective system was put in place by the Government. The Luce report concluded that the system was not fit for purpose in modern society. The Government&#039;s position paper, published in March 2004&nbsp;following the review by Tom Luce and the Shipman inquiry in the summer of 2003, has left us waiting for some form of Government action for nearly two years. The Government have acknowledged the need to avoid long delays to inquests into deaths in custody and the need for reform in general. Although today&#039;s statement is welcome, what, may I ask, has been happening all this time when the Government have been saying for years that legislation is on its way, if not imminent?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_33">I make no judgment, as the Minister did not, on the 120&nbsp;or so coroners, their support staff and investigators. I would point out, however, that the statutory powers and procedures under which they work were established in a different era. The Shipman inquiry described a situation in which coroners work from home, where there is virtually no training, and any training that is available is not compulsory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_34">The Government&#039;s position paper published in March last year made some good recommendations, which were reflected in the Minister&#039;s statement; a system based on full-time coroners with legal qualifications, closely supported by appropriate medical expertise, together with tighter rules for death certification, notification of all deaths to coroners and stronger support for scrutinising cases and investigation where necessary. However, will the proposed new system allow for judges to sit as coroners when required, as recommended by the Hatfield inquest?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_35">Dealing with death will always be, and should always be, a sensitive issue that requires and deserves efficiency, speed of process and accuracy. The reform of the coroner&#039;s court system to deliver those objectives is long outstanding. To that extent, the Government&#039;s proposals are generally welcome, although there is a clear need for careful review of the proposals, which are light on detail so far. We welcome the Government&#039;s offer and suggestion of pre-legislative scrutiny. Will that take place in the spring? I think that is what the Minister implied.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-09_para5">
<a name="stpa_36">Finally, I note that parallel scrutiny is proposed by families who are experienced in the process. That is welcome, but will it take place before parliamentary scrutiny so that the House can have the benefit of its findings?
</p>





<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60206-09_spnew1"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his response and I agree with much of what he said. I agree 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 610</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with his critique of the system and we share the view that he put forward. I also agree that it has taken too long for us to reform the coroners system. Indeed, when I was legal officer at the National Council for Civil Liberties, working alongside its general secretary&#151;now my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health&#151;we argued that these changes should happen, and that was some 30&nbsp;years ago. Of course, as people will be well aware, the Broderick report of the 1970s has yet to be implemented. We have a system that still looks pretty much as it did in the 18th century.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_37">I can assure the hon. Gentleman that instructions have gone to parliamentary counsel. The Bill is just about drafted and it will be with the House in draft form in April to May. We expect to have the Bill proper in November or December, so that we will have enough time for parliamentary scrutiny. We shall actually get on with it this time; it is long overdue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_38">Secondly, the hon. Gentleman made a point about capacity, which is very important. We want a local system of coroners because most inquests can be dealt with best at local level by qualified legal coroners who are professionally supported. However, there will be some cases where that is not the right approach. Instead of making relatives and everybody involved go through a local coroner first before, inevitably, ending up in the High Court, we envisage a situation in which coroners themselves can say, &quot;I would like a High Court judge to take this case in the first instance&quot;, or the chief coroner can say, &quot;I shall take the case in the first instance&quot; or &quot;I shall appoint a High Court judge to take the case in the first instance&quot;, or the relatives can say, &quot;We think this will end up in the High Court so why don&#039;t we start with a High Court judge?&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_39">Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman asked about investigation. As well as the 200,000-plus families involved in the coroners system every year, we have special thoughts about how to be absolutely sure that we avoid the situation that befell so many of Harold Shipman&#039;s patients. That is about investigation. People are well aware that if a doctor recommends a serious operation or radical treatment, it is not a hostile act against the doctor to ask for a second opinion; it is normal. But there has been no possibility for people to challenge a death certificate without the implicit accusation that the GP has been responsible for murder or malpractice. It is important that there is a light-touch ability so that relatives can say, &quot;Can we have a second look at that?&quot; That will be an important contributor towards ensuring that we do not have situations where people have concerns but there is no way in which they can call in a coroner to take a second look at the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-09_para9">
<a name="stpa_40">The Lord Chancellor is strongly concerned that we get a move on and reform the system. It is well overdue for modernisation, which is what our proposals will achieve.

<a name="stpa_43">My hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Chris McCafferty) made a proposal about cremation forms. I see no reason at all why relatives, or anybody with a justified interest, should not see cremation forms. That is a practical proposal. A simple leaflet, which could be a summary of the family charter, would be extremely worthwhile, and we shall ensure that every family involved has not only the benefit of the rights of the new charter for families, but a summary of it.

<a name="stpa_44">My hon. Friend talked about empowerment for bereaved relatives. One of the problems has been that there is nothing that relatives can do when the system goes wrong except wait until the end of the process and go to the High Court to ask for the inquest to be overturned. They cannot challenge whether an inquest should be held, whether a jury should be empanelled or which witnesses should be called. In the Bill, we will put in place the opportunity for relatives to ask the chief coroner to review the case so that it can be remitted back to the coroner with an instruction from the chief coroner. We do not want to leave it until the end of the process, when things might have gone wrong, to require people to go to the High Court. Early intervention is needed to make it possible for relatives to have their say at an earlier stage.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_46">First, will the right hon. and learned Lady retain the local jurisdiction of coroners? I think that she implied that she would do so in answer to an earlier question, but it is important that coroners&#039; courts be accessible to people, particularly in the circumstances of the death of a loved one. If that is the case, will there be a special arrangement&#151;again, she implied this&#151;for national disasters, such as the sort of thing that we saw on 7&nbsp;July or previously with the Marchioness disaster, which allows not only a specialist coroner but the ancillary technical and scientific support to enable those matters to be investigated with expedition?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_47">The right hon. and learned Lady mentioned archaic boundary restrictions. Can anything be done to stop difficulties when crossing national boundaries, both in the United Kingdom and in our relations with overseas jurisdictions? The proposal that all coroners should now have legal training is welcome, but does she recognise that they need to have at least an understanding of the vocabulary of science and to understand some quite technical matters? It is not good enough simply to be a lawyer nowadays; to an extent one must be a polymath.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_48">Is there still a dearth of pathologists, particularly paediatric pathologists, in forensic work? If so, what is being done to address that? Will coroners&#039; juries be retained? Will coroners&#039; guidance be binding on public authorities? At the moment, coroners often make statements to public authorities, but there is no requirement for them to consider those recommendations. Will there be such a requirement in future?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_49">Lastly&#151;this is perhaps a minor matter&#151;but what used to be known as treasure trove is an historical remnant of coroners&#039; jurisdictions. Would it not be better to place that&#151;though perhaps within a judicial process&#151;in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport? I look forward to swift progress on the proposals, and the right hon. and learned Lady will have every support from Liberal Democrat Members in making swift progress.

<p><a name="st_40"><a name="60206-10_spnew1"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for making a number of important points. First, treasure trove is an ancient jurisdiction of coroners. Sometimes, such cases can take two to three years to resolve, because treasure trove is always put at the back of the queue and dealt with locally. That does not make sense. We will make one coroner nationally responsible for treasure trove and get that dealt with effectively.

<p>
<a name="60206-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_50">The hon. Gentleman asks whether public authorities will take notice of coroners when they make a statement about what lessons they think should be learned after a death. The higher public profile and higher national standing of the coroner service that Dame Janet Smith thought so important&#151;we certainly agree&#151;will ensure that public authorities are not able perhaps to leave on one side proposals made by a much better respected coroners system. Yes, there will still be coroners&#039; juries. In addition to the mandatory cases where coroners&#039; juries are required, coroners will have the discretion to use juries.

All of them will have training, including medical training. In addition, they will have their own dedicated health advice, which they do not have at the moment. That will be part of a central budget which will be given to each and every coroner so that they have dedicated health support for medical issues. There is a dearth of pathologists, which also concerns colleagues in the Department of Health and the Home Office.

 And travel further. One thing that has made families wait longer is that solicitors in private practice who are also coroners sometimes adjourn an inquest to deal with something in their private practice. There is no reason why coroners should not travel to the families. We will ensure that Her Majesty&#039;s Court Service buildings, county courts and magistrates courts are available for the coroners to exercise their jurisdiction locally, so that they can work around the families and circumstances, rather than expect the families to work around them or their private practice as solicitors.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments about the Surrey coroner and his deputy. He has described the problems of a service that has been affected by blight. Everyone has been so expecting something to change that it has been very difficult for coroners and officers to have any certainty for the future. I hope that, as from this statement, there will be an end to the blight and that we can support much better the work of the many dedicated coroners officers. I pay tribute to the Coroners Officers Association, which throughout the years of blight has tried to improve professionalism with precious little support.

 I warmly welcome my right hon. and learned Friend&#039;s statement. For seven of my eight years in this House I have asked for reform of the coroner&#039;s office, because on Teesside we have waited years and years for a coroner&#039;s report. When a 12-year-old girl dies in an accident while playing with a swing, that is a tragedy; when her mother has to wait two years and three months to find out the cause, that is desperately bad for all of us. I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend&#039;s reforms will change it.

Surely, it is not enough just to say that qualified solicitors should be employed and to give coroners a pot of money so that they can seek training themselves.

 In framing her proposals, will the right hon. and learned Lady look at the Potter&#039;s Bar rail crash, as it is expected that the inquiry will take the form of a coroner&#039;s inquest, even though the families wanted a full public inquest and the Hertfordshire coroner had concerns about the holding of an inquest? Almost three years after the crash, it has just been announced that a judge is to be released to hold the inquiry. Three years is too long to wait for an inquiry into such a major incident involving many families.

 As the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, what we lack is the capacity for leadership and certainty, which would enable the right inquiries to be made at the earliest possible opportunity.

 We expect that there will be more than one coroner in cities. There will be at least one coroner in every county, and usually more than one, depending on the population. I cannot give a specific answer, but I accept the point that the hon. Gentleman has made. Coroners have mediaeval jurisdictions, which they control&#151;no one else is allowed to sit there, and they are not allowed to sit in anyone else&#039;s jurisdiction&#151;so it is impossible to do something simple and straightforward such as reallocating a coroner to another jurisdiction to deal with a backlog.

 The family charter does not have to wait. I have had meetings with family organisations of the bereaved, which have been incredibly helpful and are very clear about what they want. The problem is that it is not enforceable, so we cannot ensure that it is given to relatives or that coroners abide by it. We will certainly give the family charter extra momentum, but it is not until we legislate that we will be certain that we can apply those standards. There will also be an inspection system, and one of the things the inspectors will do is look at whether each coroner is properly implementing the family charter. I endorse my hon.

 I thank my hon. Friend for raising the case. It was a tragic case of a woman and her son being killed and then the husband, who had killed them both, committing suicide. One of the most tragic aspects was that the family, whom I had the opportunity to meet because Refuge, the organisation, brought them to see me, said, &quot;We know this is supposed to be an inquisitorial system, but we felt it was an adversarial system, and we felt that it was against us.&quot; Any system that makes bereaved relatives feel that the whole system is weighted against them is totally unsatisfactory. I thank my hon. Friend for bringing that case to my attention and also for the support that she is giving the relatives in such unacceptable circumstances. In the House we have recently legislated for homicide reviews in domestic violence cases, but, arguably, if the coroners system were working properly, we would not need homicide reviews, as all the relevant information would be brought to the coroner and proper lessons would be learned. The reviews have sprung up because the coroner system has not been dealing appropriately with these cases.

Have you had any notification from the Home Secretary that, instead of slipping a two-page written statement into the Library, he will come to the House and make himself accountable so that we can question him on this extraordinary national reorganisation?
</p>





<p><a name="st_74"><a name="60206-12_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Michael Lord): </b> 
 I have had no notice of such a statement. Written statements are of course a matter for Ministers in terms of the way in which they make them available to the House and put them in the Library.

I regret that the three police grant reports fell foul of that scrutiny in that they were dated incorrectly. I am grateful to the Committee and to the Committee Chairman for agreeing to give them retrospective consideration, thereby not delaying today&#039;s debate.

<a name="stpa_57">The Government have a solid record of investment in policing in England and Wales. The funding settlement for the coming two years will build on substantial and sustained growth since 2000&#150;01. Government grant and central spending on services for the police will have increased by nearly 50&nbsp;per cent., or more than &#163;3.5&nbsp;billion, between 2000&#150;01&nbsp;and 2006&#150;07.

 In delivering his litany of good news, will the Minister confirm that Home Office funding per head of population for Surrey police authority has fallen in cash terms since 1997, resulting in a 22.7&nbsp;per cent. real decrease in funding for Surrey police?

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="60206-12_spnew9"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I am sure that we can go into detail about Surrey and other parts of England and Wales as the debate ensues. I look forward to the hon. Gentleman trying to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to make a contribution later. The point that I am making, in setting the context for the debate, is that there has been a huge and sustained increase in investment in policing over several years. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents are reaping the benefits, as indeed are mine and those of all hon. Members.
</p>





<p><a name="st_80"><a name="60206-12_spnew10"><b> Mr. Nicholas Soames  (Mid-Sussex) (Con):</b> 
 I understand the point that the Minister is making. Overall, the sum of money has increased, but he made a very sweeping statement at the beginning of his speech. Does he realise that the settlement for Sussex police this year will place in jeopardy the significant improvements that they have undertaken?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-12_para1">

</p>





<p><a name="st_81"><a name="60206-12_spnew11"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 We will get the opportunity to discuss some of these details. The dedicated security post to which the hon.

That will now be provided through central funding, which obviously involves an adjustment. I acknowledge the improvements in Sussex and in many other parts of the country. I believe that this settlement will enable forces to sustain the improvements and changes that they have made. If we look, for example, at the number of staff that the police service has today, we find that more than 234,000&nbsp;people are engaged in delivering policing&#151;an increase of nearly 15&nbsp;per cent. since 1997. Police numbers are historically high, at 141,270&nbsp;on 30&nbsp;September 2005. We are committed to maintaining a well-staffed police service.

 Currently, I am spending time on the parliamentary police scheme and have been out on patrol with the Kettering police, who operate a shift system. Is the Minister aware that although it is true that police numbers, certainly in Northamptonshire, are at record levels, only one officer out of nine on a shift in Kettering was capable of driving a police car with the sirens and lights flashing? He was the only grade-one qualified police officer on that shift. Police numbers might be at record levels, but sadly, due to budget shortfalls, not all the officers are trained to the standards that the public would expect.
</p>





<p><a name="st_83"><a name="60206-13_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for taking part in the parliamentary police scheme. Hon. Members of all parties engage with it, and that is a very effective way of showing support for the police service as well as of learning about some of the challenges that it faces.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_59">Clearly, I cannot comment on the particular circumstances that the hon. Gentleman described. However, the important thing is that those who manage our front-line police services should be able to bring together an appropriate mix of qualifications, professional experience and so on, so that we get the best policing possible in our local communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_60">In addition to increasing the numbers, we are actively reducing bureaucracy through a programme that we expect will yield the equivalent of an extra 12,000&nbsp;police officers by 2008. Again, that will free up more police officers for the front line. Police officers are now supported by more than 6,300&nbsp;community support officers, whose numbers are expected to increase by about 5,600&nbsp;next year. That will take us to nearly 12,000&#151;about half the total number of community support officers that we have pledged to deliver by 2008.

Superintendents and senior police officers are concerned that at the end of the two years, they will have to make invidious decisions about whether to keep on the community support officers or get rid of regular, uniformed police constables. Will the Minister give an undertaking that the funding for community support officers will not be time limited and that it will carry on as part of the settlement, year on year?

 I am sure that the hon.

He will understand from the explanation that I offer now that funding police services is, in essence, a balance between central funding and local funding&#151;through specific grants, general grants and so on.
</p>

 I cannot give my hon. Friend a precise figure at this stage.

 In Leicestershire, the population of almost 1&nbsp;million people has benefited greatly from police investment over the past nine years or so. Of that, there is little doubt.

Is he happy that the way in which central support is calculated for police authorities is adequate, and should it not be rising at a greater level to reduce the impact of the precept, particularly on older people and those with lower means?

 There is a balance to be struck between central and local funding, but last year&#039;s settlement meant that no police authority had to go beyond a 5&nbsp;per cent. increase in precept.

 I am grateful. While the Minister is dealing with police precepts, he must recognise that compulsory reorganisation, as announced by the Home Secretary today, could lead council tax payers in Northumberland to have their precept increased by as much as 30&nbsp;per cent. because of the process of levelling with the other forces involved. Given that that force meets all the Government&#039;s criteria, can the Minister give some assurance that precept equalisation will not take place in the reorganisation of forces?
</p>





<p><a name="st_94"><a name="60206-13_spnew12"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I shall come on to those issues. Funding of the restructuring announced by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary today will involve a number of angles. Central Government will invest, and I shall today outline &#163;125&nbsp;million of that over the next two years, an investment which will clearly be important. Secondly, police authorities have existing investment plans, which they will be able to reshape to reflect the new force structure.

<a name="stpa_63">Yes, some cost will fall on the local police authorities, but they will reap the benefit in efficiencies and savings.

Sussex police has already planned to deliver &#163;6.8&nbsp;million in efficiency savings, but the final settlement will require further savings of &#163;1.9&nbsp;million in order to constrain any precept increase to below 5&nbsp;per cent. I know that the Minister understands that that will almost certainly mean a real threat to service delivery and to the greatly improved performance of Sussex police. It really is not a decent or proper way to deal with Sussex police authority.

Friend the Home Secretary has established a working group of all the key partners&#151;the Association of Police Authorities, ACPO, other Departments and other professional experts&#151;to look very carefully at the figures. My hon. Friend is correct, however, to say that as forces come together, clearly there will have to be some process for equalising the precept over different authorities, and that will need to be done in a careful, thoughtful and planned way. The announcement that the Home Secretary has made today about the north-west and other areas is a basis for further discussion throughout those areas. Discussions will continue in the search for a way ahead on which everybody can agree. As with all things, consensus would be the best way forward.

<a name="stpa_74">I intend, in the limited time that we have for debate, to make some progress and allow time for other hon. Members to contribute. I say in response to the comments by my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) that authorities that have had their grants scaled back from what the formula alone would have offered may feel that they are not getting their full share of the pot. However, we have had to take full account of pressures right across the board to ensure that all authorities can keep police precepts at sustainable levels next year, and that policing services are maintained. We have done everything possible for next year to maximise the increase in general grant and to increase the scope for police authorities to determine their own spending.

Although some authorities, such as the one that serves my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, are losers from this, there are in fact more gainers than losers because we are trying to provide stability. Indeed, three of the Welsh authorities will benefit to the tune of &#163;9.3&nbsp;million in special Home Office grant.

<a name="stpa_77">Increasing the proportion of time that police officers spend on front-line policing is, of course, one of the ways forces can demonstrate efficiency gains so that skilled trained police officers are free to make the most effective use of their time. Reducing bureaucracy, exploiting new technology, more effective deployment of officers and more effective use of support staff will all help to increase the amount of front-line policing. We expect other efficiency gains to be delivered through more efficient working and commercial practices&#151;for example, through collaborative procurement and shared services for human resources and finance.

<br>&nbsp;<br>has just set out, and of having to make reductions or raise the precept beyond the rate that he has suggested? The Association of Police Authorities is suggesting 6&nbsp;per cent. as a minimum, which would mean a projected council tax rise of 12&nbsp;per cent.
</p>





<p><a name="st_112"><a name="60206-15_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 We had this discussion last year when the Association of Police Authorities was predicting that the gap would be even bigger than it is predicting this year. The reality is that police authorities have been able to fund services in such a way that the number of staff, including front-line staff, has increased, and no authority has had to exceed an increase of 5&nbsp;per cent. It was therefore possible to ensure that services were sustainable and fundable this year, and I expect no less for next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_78">Police authorities have seen a huge increase in Government provision in recent years, and this has been matched by a significant increase in the amount of revenue raised locally for policing through council tax. The extra funding has not only paid for inescapable pressures but greatly expanded the service. For next year, we have again done everything possible to maximise the increase in general grant. With the delivery of efficiency gains and prudent budgeting, there is no reason for police authorities to set excessive increases in police precepts for council tax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_79">The clear message that the Government were prepared to cap budgets this year has helped to drive down prospective precept increases. In the event, no police authority faced any capping action. The capping criteria for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;have not yet been set. The Government will decide them after authorities have set their budgets for next year. Meanwhile, we have made it clear that we expect average council tax increases of less than 5&nbsp;per cent. across England. We will not allow authorities to impose excessive increases, and we are prepared to use our capping powers if necessary. Council tax in Wales is a matter for the Welsh Assembly Government.

<p><a name="st_113"><a name="60206-15_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mark Francois  (Rayleigh) (Con):</b> 
 I notice that Essex and the other counties in East Anglia were not mentioned in the statement today. The standard precept in Essex is approximately &#163;105&nbsp;for a band D property, and in Norfolk it is &#163;145. In the event of a merger, with averaging up, the increase in the policing precept for Essex residents will be approximately 14&nbsp;per cent. How can it be right for the Government to tell everyone that they have to keep to an increase of 5&nbsp;per cent. or thereabouts, while at the same time arguing for a merger that would result in a council tax increase of 14&nbsp;per cent.? Where is the logic or the justice in that?

 The hon. Gentleman is running two issues together. I shall try to separate them for him, as I tried to do for my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) a moment ago. In relation to what the Home Secretary has said today about the police force in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s area, he will be writing to that police force&#151;as he will to all five regions in which the picture is a little less clear&#151;to set out a process and a timetable for discussions to try to reach consensus on those matters. As new force structures emerge, the precept for the different component parts will have to be merged, and that will need to be done very carefully.

<p>
<a name="60206-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_80">As part of the consultation exercise on this funding settlement, we received 47&nbsp;written representations covering 36&nbsp;police authority areas. All representations have been taken into account in reaching decisions on the funding proposals before the House today. I have already dealt with some of the main points raised, but I will now turn to some other concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_81">A new system of financing for the police pension scheme will come in effect on 1&nbsp;April. Police authorities will no longer have to meet the cost of paying pensions to retired officers from their operating account. Instead, spending on pensions will be accounted for separately. Each authority will pay both the employer&#039;s and the officers&#039; pension contributions into&#151;and pay pensions from&#151;a new pensions account. If there is a shortfall in the authority&#039;s account, central Government will meet that shortfall. If the account is in surplus, that will be recouped so that no authority is subsidised at the expense of others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_82">Under the old system, an increase in the number of retirements in a year could put pressure on operational funds and create volatility in the amount of funding available for operational policing. The new system will ensure that any rise in the cost of pensions brought about by a rise in the number of officers in retirement will not be paid for at the expense of operational policing. In making these changes, we did not want to place any cost burden on the local or national taxpayer. Police grant is therefore being adjusted to take into account the pension deficits or surpluses in 2005&#150;06&nbsp;and 2006&#150;07, based on forces&#039; own projections and estimates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_83">A number of forces were unable to provide accurate projections for the provisional grant settlement in December. We are satisfied that those data errors would have been corrected earlier had time permitted a fuller scrutiny. I have therefore responded to representations by taking the amended data into account. In making the changes, I have increased by &#163;14&nbsp;million the notional grant base on which grant for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;is established. Without any additional grant, the cost would be spread across all authorities, and would effectively reduce the floor increase from 3.2&nbsp;per cent. at the provisional settlement to some 3&nbsp;per cent. now. I have, however, been able to add &#163;7&nbsp;million to general grant and Welsh support, allowing a final floor increase of 3.1&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_84">Several authorities are concerned because their police grant reduction was based on a notional pension deficit in 2005&#150;06, a year of historically high retirements and net pension costs. However, I am not persuaded that any reasonable alternative approach would have been fairer overall, so I have not altered the method for calculating the change between the old and new systems. I am confident that when pension pressures rise towards the end of the decade, police authorities will benefit from the changes that we are introducing now.
</p>





<p><a name="st_115"><a name="60206-15_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> 
 Can the Minister tell us how he will deal with additional pension requirements resulting from restructuring, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 630</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the redundancy costs involved? Will they be dealt with by central Government or by the relevant police authorities?
</p>





<p><a name="st_116"><a name="60206-15_spnew5"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The new pension arrangement will take account of the circumstances of restructuring. As I have said, the local police force, or authority, will pay the pensions and collect the contributions. If the authority is in deficit because of that, the deficit will be made good by central Government, and if it is in surplus we shall take the money. Under the new system the central contribution to pensions this year is some &#163;300&nbsp;million: that is coming from the centre to make the system work. I should have thought there would be common cause throughout the House that that was a good move. The fact that a large number of officers retire in one year should not affect front-line policing. I hope that that is acceptable; it is the new system, and it will serve us well in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_85">I have made some observations about the initial costs of force restructuring, but it might be helpful if I emphasised a couple of points. Considerable thought has been given to the handling of the initial costs of amalgamations. We expect force business cases to be robust, and to show how force amalgamations can lead to significant economies that can be reinvested in neighbourhood policing and protective services.
</p>

<p>

We are also meeting chief officers and police authority chairs to discuss outstanding issues.

<p>
<a name="60206-15_para9">
<a name="stpa_87">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made a statement to the House today setting out the initial findings of the police restructuring review in relation to areas where the assessment of protective services has indicated a clear case for restructuring. In other areas, the Home Secretary will continue to review the proposals for restructuring that have been submitted, on the basis of the protective service assessments and the financial and organisation analysis that has been developed. We will continue to work with police forces and authorities in each area over the coming weeks to establish the best way in which to proceed.

 I cannot confirm the precise figure, but we are involving a range of experts so that we can get the assessments absolutely right. We have already been presented with an array of different estimates and figures this afternoon. It is important for the figures to be robust, and we need the best minds to help us analyse them. It would be sensible to invest in that at this stage in order to produce the best possible outcome. However, I should emphasise that such matters have not simply been put out to external consultants.

 I thank the Minister for his patience in giving way so readily, which I know is his custom. To what extent do the figures on force amalgamations involve the British Transport police? I recognise that the British Transport police are resourced from a different funding stream, but the savings and amalgamations that the Minister refers to could take into account their amalgamation into existing forces. To what extent are they included in the figures and the financing?
</p>





<p><a name="st_120"><a name="60206-16_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Nothing that I have said today, or that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has said in his written statement to the House today, takes account of the British Transport police and their funding. However, in operational terms it is clearly important that they be part of the wider police family&#151;which they of course are, as indeed are many others. We are trying to place great emphasis in our policing policy on the fact that, in a sense, everybody is part of that family and has a role to play. But nothing that I am announcing this afternoon bears on the funding or financing of the British Transport police.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_88">As I have pointed out, we have set aside some &#163;125&nbsp;million of police capital grant over the next two years to support forces committing to early amalgamation. This will be allocated in the light of emerging pressures, as authorities coalesce into new structures. As I have emphasised, we will also look to authorities to reshape their existing investments so that they reflect the new structure, and to reap the benefit of future efficiency savings in making their own investments.
</p>





<p><a name="st_121"><a name="60206-16_spnew3"><b> Mr. Beith: </b> 
 The Minister has not clarified the position on precept equalisation, and the question is: why should council tax payers in Northumbria, who have a police force that meets the Government&#039;s criteria, have their precept raised to a level similar to that applying to forces that are being compulsorily amalgamated because they do not meet those criteria?
</p>





<p><a name="st_122"><a name="60206-16_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 What matters is that the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents, my constituents and all our constituents have effective policing. What does that mean? It means policing that can cope with the threats of terrorism and organised crime&#151;as well, of course, as providing neighbourhood policing. As I have acknowledged, as we bring authorities together there will be different levels of precept. There needs to be a process by which those precept levels are merged into one level, but over a period of time. I can reassure the right hon. Gentleman that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has established a working group to look at the fine detail of that process, to ensure that it is used fairly and not as a blunt instrument, which would clearly be unfair. Officials are working on the details, which will be shared with him and other Members as and when such information becomes available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_89">The significant development in the threat from international terrorism and the consequent increase in the funding of counter-terrorism in recent years has led 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 632</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>us to focus on the best way of ensuring effective funding for this vital work. Following consultation, we decided to consolidate existing funding streams for countering terrorism and domestic extremism, which were a mix of specific grants and general grant. Following consultation with key stakeholders, including ACPO, we have created a new specific grant for counter-terrorism and other national security priorities. The counter-terrorism fund comprises &#163;213&nbsp;million for dedicated security posts, which is transferred from police grant; existing specific grants for counter-terrorism, totalling &#163;96&nbsp;million in resource and &#163;8&nbsp;million in capital each year; and the transfer of &#163;50&nbsp;million from formula grant to specific grant for the relevant part of the special funding for the Metropolitan Police Authority. In addition, on 25&nbsp;January the Home Secretary announced substantial additional police service funding specifically for counter-terrorism and dealing with domestic extremism. This comes to some &#163;63&nbsp;million in revenue and &#163;30&nbsp;million in capital in 2006&#150;07, rising to &#163;110&nbsp;million in revenue and &#163;35&nbsp;million in capital in 2007&#150;08.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_90">In drawing my remarks to a conclusion, I would like to mention a number of additional points about the overall police funding settlement for 2006&#150;07. For several years, the Home Secretary has provided additional funding to ensure that Welsh police authorities receive at least a minimum grant increase in line with English authorities. For the coming two years, we have adjusted the Home Office police grant for Welsh police authorities to maintain consistency with the English. That additional support will total &#163;9.3&nbsp;million next year for Dyfed-Powys, Gwent and North Wales police authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_91">Police authorities will continue to receive funding for specific programmes on top of the general grant. We have tried to minimise the specific grant, thereby maximising the general grant so that police authorities can direct funds at their discretion, but there are still a number of areas in which we want to highlight particular funds. The crime fighting fund was mentioned earlier, and &#163;277&nbsp;million will be made available to forces in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;to continue to support the costs of officers recruited through the CFF. A number of forces have asked for greater flexibility, and that fund has been extremely successful in reversing the previous decline in the number of police officers. Strength has grown to historically high levels, we have invested heavily over the past few years to support that growth, and we remain committed to maintaining high numbers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_92">Neighbourhood policing teams will be rolled out across the country over the next two years and uniformed police officers will play an increasingly key role in those teams. Through the front-line policing measure, we expect to see more of them released from back-office duties into front-line operation as we reduce levels of bureaucracy and put the freed up resource on to the front line. Forces should, of course, determine the right mix of personnel for their own work force. Decisions on police officer strength should be taken by authorities, not by the Government. There will be greater flexibility for most forces during 2005&#150;06&nbsp;and we look forward to seeing what further flexibility can be offered in 2006&#150;07.

In the year of recruitment it will meet 100&nbsp;per cent. of salary and direct costs, subject to a cap, and a fixed sum of &#163;2,500&nbsp;per recruit will also be payable towards start-up costs.

 I welcome the Minister&#039;s announcement that the grants will be made over a two-year period, which will help police authorities to plan, something for which my predecessor, my hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_98">The Minister says that the settlement is generous, but the truth is that the Home Office is giving police forces less money than at the 2001&nbsp;general election. In this financial year, 2005&#150;06, the Home Office general grant for police expenditure is &#163;4,574&nbsp;million, which, adjusted for inflation, is less than the &#163;5,094&nbsp;million given to police forces in 2001&#150;02. I am happy to concede that there will be an increase in the grant over the next two years, but funding will still be lower in 2007&#150;08&nbsp;than at the 2001&nbsp;election, when the Government promised that police funding would rise.

 My hon. Friend is right. The burden has actually been met by local tax payers. As my hon.

It is being met by council tax payers.

Today, that figure is &#163;2,335&nbsp;million&#151;two and a half times as much. In 1997, nearly 85&nbsp;per cent. of police forces&#039; gross revenue expenditure was financed by the Government. In 2004&#150;05, the latest year for which figures are available, central Government&#039;s contribution has fallen to significantly less than 70&nbsp;per cent. Meanwhile, the amount of police expenditure financed through council tax has almost doubled in real terms since the Government came to power. Council tax now pays for more than a fifth of police force spending, compared with just a ninth in 1996&#150;97.

<p>
<a name="60206-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_102">Today, the Home Secretary announced in a written answer, not a statement to the House, that he intended to proceed with police force amalgamations. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) pointed out on a point of order, that is an extraordinary way to announce something that has major constitutional implications, as Her Majesty&#039;s inspector of constabulary conceded in his report. The allocations for capital results proposed in the December statement already show a fall in real terms in the second year. Moreover, the Home Secretary has announced that &#163;125&nbsp;million of that funding will be used to meet the costs of police amalgamations, so resources that should be spent on improvements to policing will be used to pay for management consultants, merged IT systems and new headquarters.
</p>





<p><a name="st_130"><a name="60206-17_spnew5"><b> Andrew Selous  (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend share the analysis put to Bedfordshire MPs last night, by those members of Bedfordshire police authority who are responsible for finance, that if significant merger costs are imposed on Bedfordshire police but not picked up by the Government, if the police precept is capped, and because the savings will be made some years ahead, it will mean in practice that that will affect the number of police officers on the ground over the next few years?
</p>





<p><a name="st_131"><a name="60206-17_spnew6"><b> Nick Herbert: </b> 
 That analysis is absolutely correct. In the absence of the Government funding the costs of amalgamation, only two things are possible: either the police precept must increase or services must be cut. As the Government are saying that the precept cannot be increased&#151;it will be capped&#151;the result is that front-line services will be cut, unless new funding is provided to meet those costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_103">As we pointed out last week, the Association of Police Authorities has quantified the cost of amalgamations at &#163;525&nbsp;million, based on the detailed calculations of each police authority. After the Home Secretary&#039;s provision of &#163;125&nbsp;million, that leaves a gap of &#163;400&nbsp;million, as was made clear by my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield. The Home Secretary is providing less than a quarter of the amount needed to fund amalgamation. How will that be financed? Either more than two thirds of the entire capital provision for police forces, which the Minister has just announced, will be spent on amalgamations or, once again, local taxpayers must foot the bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_104">The Minister has said that police authorities can finance amalgamations with prudent borrowing. We might have expected that suggestion. The Government are not exactly averse to borrowing, however imprudent 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 636</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>doing so might be, but whether or not authorities borrow the cost will be met ultimately by local tax payers. Assuming that police authorities do not cut services, the average police precept would rise by 21&nbsp;per cent. to fund the amalgamations. That would involve rises of between &#163;15&nbsp;and &#163;37&nbsp;on the average council tax bill on a band D property. That comes on top of already planned increases, which we will no doubt hear about later.

However, of the 11&nbsp;Members of Parliament present&#151;in Staffordshire nine are Labour, only three are Conservative&#151;

 My hon. Friend is right about the scale of opposition to the merger in the west midlands, not just from hon. Members on both sides of the House, but from local people as well. In opinion poll after opinion poll across the country, local people have emphatically rejected amalgamations.

Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) referred. On the one hand, the Government are landing police authorities with a huge bill for a restructuring that most of them do not want, but for which the Government refuse to pay; on the other, they are threatening capping if police authorities try to finance the costs themselves. Police authorities cannot win except by cutting services.

 The chief constable of Gloucestershire has estimated that the south-west amalgamations will cost an estimated &#163;56&nbsp;million. My hon. Friend can add that to his figure, so we are beginning to get some large sums. Gloucestershire has, I think, the highest police precept, which went up by two thirds&#151;66&nbsp;per cent.&#151;in the past three years. Does he agree that it would be unacceptable if the people of Gloucestershire, who have made good progress on the Government&#039;s &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, are clobbered yet again with a much higher police precept because of the forced amalgamations that no one wants? Indeed, the chief constable and five out of the six Members of Parliament who represent the region are adamant that they do not want it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_137"><a name="60206-18_spnew1"><b> Nick Herbert: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. The proposed amalgamations are unpopular in the south-west, as they are in the rest of the country. The cost of &#163;175&nbsp;million was solely for the four regions affected by the Government&#039;s announcement today. The total cost will be &#163;525&nbsp;million. That will have to be met in part by council tax payers in the south-west, including Gloucestershire. It does not deal with the problem raised in interventions on the Minister, to which he did not respond, of the need for precept equalisation, resulting in much higher council tax increases in some police force areas or additional costs if those differences are to be ironed out.
</p>





<p><a name="st_138"><a name="60206-18_spnew2"><b> Mr. Andrew Pelling  (Croydon, Central) (Con):</b> 
 Would it not add insult to injury for many of the larger regions to find themselves paying extra tax, following the Metropolitan police&#039;s example of pulling resources towards the more urban, metropolitan areas and away from places such as Gloucestershire and Staffordshire?
</p>





<p><a name="st_139"><a name="60206-18_spnew3"><b> Nick Herbert: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. One of the great concerns about amalgamations is their impact on policing, particularly in rural areas. There is potential for funds and police officers to be drawn away from the community policing that the public want. If &#163;525&nbsp;million is to be spent on policing in England and Wales, I believe that the public would want it to go towards ensuring proper policing of our streets to prevent crime.

 I want to give my hon. Friend and the House a stark example of what he has just been saying. On a Friday night, one patrol car patrols 500&nbsp;square miles of the north Cotswolds.

That is based on detailed research carried out by police authority treasurers, which shows that the service needs annual funding increases of at least 6&nbsp;per cent. in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08, excluding any new costs of dealing with counter-terrorism, which the whole House would support, and police force amalgamations. The Association of Police Authorities and ACPO identified the cost pressures in a joint statement as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;The need to maintain the high number of police officers; pay inflation; burdens imposed by new legislation and Government initiatives; anti-terrorism costs; new statutory and policy responsibilities for the police; and delivering police reform, including the neighbourhood policing initiative, which will bring with it very significant costs&quot;.</p>

Derbyshire police reported that their central Government grant is to be increased by only 3.4&nbsp;per cent., falling short of the &#163;9.6&nbsp;million extra that the authority believes is needed to meet current service pressures. Mr. Nigel Thomas, the treasurer of the North Wales police authority, compared its 3.7&nbsp;per cent. funding increase with the 6.4&nbsp;per cent. that it needed &quot;just to stand still&quot;.

A major contributor to those additional costs is the ever- increasing central direction imposed by the Government.

There is a national policing plan and a police performance assessment framework, as well as public service agreements. Police forces are statutorily required to produce strategic plans and they are overseen by Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary, the Audit Commission and the Government&#039;s police standards unit.

As there are hardly any police available in Lichfield anyway on a Friday or Saturday night, that effectively means that we have virtually no policing for that period.

 That is a serious issue, particularly in rural areas where the distances to be travelled can be significant.

 I agree, and I shall come on to the issue of accountability, which is particularly problematic in London for reasons that the House will understand. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner has national policing duties and is appointed by the Home Secretary. He is accountable locally, however, to the Metropolitan Police Authority and the Mayor. As a result of being accountable to so many bodies, his true accountability to local people is considerably weakened, and that issue must be addressed as it is a problem not just for the system but for the commissioner.

In London, half of street crimes last year involved the theft of mobile phones. Recorded gun crime rose nationally by 1&nbsp;per cent. to 11,000&nbsp;incidents, and the number of serious injuries from gun crimes rose by 18&nbsp;per cent. to 470.

 My hon. Friend is correct. One of the problems that the Metropolitan police face is a relatively low detection rate.

The problem, as he conceded, is that after the first year following their recruitment, the police must fund 25&nbsp;per cent. of the cost. As a consequence, police forces and authorities have to turn to external agencies&#151;in particular, local authorities&#151;to ask for help. The Minister seemed to suggest that was a good thing. The assistant chief constable of Sussex has written to local authorities, pointing out that Sussex police employs more police community support officers than another shire force, which I welcome.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;The full annual cost of employing a PCSO is &#163;27,000&#151;towns and some larger parishes may wish to enter into an agreement with the police in their own right to fund 50&nbsp;per cent. of a PCSO or negotiate for dedicated additional cover for their area. It is recognised that this is not a realistic option for very small councils and one solution could be clustering, where a number of councils in close proximity arrange to share the cost using an equitable formula.&quot;</p>

: Does my hon. Friend agree that there are parallels with the neighbourhood warden scheme that was part-funded by the Home Office and later withdrawn? I am reminded of my area, where a neighbourhood warden scheme was established in conjunction with the local authority and provided important support in the community. As soon as it was grounded, funding was removed and the wardens were withdrawn. Is there a risk that that could happen to community support officers too?
</p>





<p><a name="st_151"><a name="60206-19_spnew9"><b> Nick Herbert: </b> 
 There is plainly a risk that that could happen. We welcome the extension of the police family. The presence of uniformed officers who are not full-time police officers&#151;community support officers or neighbourhood wardens&#151;has been welcomed in many parts of the country. However, against a background of tight financial settlements, will police authorities and local authorities continue to be able to hire the uniformed officers whom the public value?

: Can that be seen on a larger scale in the context of the debate in London on the council tax precept? It is difficult to argue against an increase in PCSO and police numbers, and I would support such an increase, but the problem arises when it comes in combination with other increases, such as the Olympic precept, making a 16.5&nbsp;per cent. increase. Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a need for close scrutiny of the value for money that will be secured from those PCSO teams?

<p><a name="st_153"><a name="60206-20_spnew0"><b> Nick Herbert: </b> 
 I will not be drawn into commenting on the precept to fund the Olympics, but it is true that the public will need to be reassured that PCSOs provide value for money. In that respect, the latest Home Office-sponsored official assessment of PCSOs, which indicated that there was no evidence that they reduced antisocial behaviour in the areas where they operate, by comparison with areas where they did not operate, is, I expect, a source of concern in all parts of the House. We 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 643</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>do not wish the deployment of PCSOs to be undermined, but it is important to demonstrate that they provide value for money for local communities and are doing the job that they are employed to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_127">The third way in which increasing central direction will be problematic for police forces is that it undermines the freedom of chief constables to innovate. The existing structure does not allow chief constables to manage their forces flexibly. There are many police authorities and chief constables who would prefer to take different decisions about whether or not to hire PCSOs or police officers, but they are told by the Government that money is available only for certain purposes, and the substantial sums that have been made available for PCSOs are ring-fenced for that purpose. For chief constables who might decide instead to take on fully-fledged police officers, it is not possible to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_128">If we are to ask police authorities and police forces to continue to make efficiency savings as they have done in recent years, and to improve on those savings, we will have to give chief constables more flexibility in managing their work forces. That is not an issue that the Government have been willing to address.
</p>





<p><a name="st_154"><a name="60206-20_spnew1"><b> Michael Fabricant: </b> 
 My hon. Friend supports the introduction of PCSOs, and I agree that we would rather have them than have no police presence at all. However, what would he say to my constituent who is a serving police officer in Staffordshire police&#151;I had better not reveal his name&#151;and who says that PCSOs are not real police officers because they have no powers of arrest, and besides if they were any good they would be policemen instead?
</p>





<p><a name="st_155"><a name="60206-20_spnew2"><b> Nick Herbert: </b> 
 I would say to my hon. Friend and to the person who made that comment that PCSOs can perform a valuable role in the community in augmenting a uniformed presence and in helping to prevent crime. The absence of their power of arrest, which is controversial, can help them to remain on the streets in their neighbourhoods, which is what is wanted of them, without being detained in police stations for prolonged periods processing arrests. PCSOs also provide a recruiting ground for people who may wish to move on to become fully fledged police officers; and they have succeeded in recruiting from a much broader spectrum of the community, particularly among ethnic minorities, than our regular police force.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_129">For all those reasons, we believe that PCSOs are a welcome development. Indeed, we would like to see an extension of the principle of the police family to provide more wardens and local authority guardians of the kind successfully pioneered by Westminster city council. However, that will depend on funding being available for such positions and, equally, on resources not being wasted on unnecessary amalgamations for no real gain.
</p>





<p><a name="st_156"><a name="60206-20_spnew3"><b> Mr. Pelling: </b> 
 Is not my hon. Friend&#039;s point about the good calibre of many PCSOs supported by the fact that in the Metropolitan police service 230&nbsp;of them have gone on to become police officers? Does he agree that there is concern about the speed with which PCSO teams are put together and about the recruitment of the best quality sergeants, who will have a difficult task in managing new members of staff as PCSO teams are put together over a two-year period?

<p><a name="st_157"><a name="60206-20_spnew4"><b> Nick Herbert: </b> 
 Those matters will need to be addressed in a proper assessment of the role of PCSOs. That should be conducted against the background of a general acceptance of the principle of having a more flexible policing structure, with a uniformed presence that does not just mean a regular police officer, but can also mean the extended police family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_130">Chief constables&#039; ability to innovate will be important if we are to see the efficiency gains necessary to ensure that police forces continue to deliver against difficult financial settlements, such as the one that the Government have announced. There are good examples of local forces showing such innovation and modernising their work forces in a way that drives up productivity substantially. In relation to offender management and custody, Northumbria police have introduced an integrated criminal justice process by developing a range of complementary police support officer roles. A 7&nbsp;per cent. increase in constable strength at the front line was achieved by releasing police officers from custody and associated duties. Performance has improved, with higher file quality and timeliness; custody-related complaints have fallen by half; and detection rates, which have been a source of concern nationally, have increased by up to 14&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_131">Similarly, in Surrey the police CID office has been transformed to improve investigation. It was reorganised in order properly to meet public expectations, and the mix of staff was altered to include 60&nbsp;per cent. of police support officers working with constables in teams led by advance detectives, which has delivered a better service. It has investigated 35&nbsp;per cent. more crime, halved investigative delays, and tripled follow-up with victims. Moreover, it has improved results. Twenty-five per cent. more offenders are caught, with greater efficiency&#151;in other words, at a quarter less cost. The use of support offices to perform roles that uniformed officers had undertaken can dramatically increase productivity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_132">Humberside police have reconfigured their major incident rooms by employing police support officers in key roles. That has improved quality, created increased capacity and almost halved costs, which have been reduced by 43&nbsp;per cent. West Yorkshire police have integrated their investigative support officers and investigation officers into their homicide and major incident teams, again increasing capacity and significantly reducing overall costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_133">Some senior police officers estimate that the savings achieved as a result of such work force modernisation could be as much as 20&nbsp;per cent. It would take a very substantial increase in resources to match that level of improvement. That demonstrates that the input-led approach to policing, which has often been taken, is no longer appropriate when considering their performance. The point, surely, is not that spending on the police has increased: what should matter to us is outcomes. The competing claims that are made for putting police officers on the streets mean nothing if they will not actually be on the streets because they are tied up doing unnecessary jobs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-20_para7">

<br>&nbsp;<br>depends substantially on significant continuing efficiency gains&#151;in fairness to them, and so that the public can judge the effectiveness of spending on the police and of additional spending, it will be necessary to have more robust measures of police performance and of crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_135">On the measure of recorded crime that the Government no longer like, one crime is committed for every 38&nbsp;people living in England and Wales and 10&nbsp;crimes are committed for every police officer. The Government prefer the British crime survey, but that still shows, comparing the levels of extra resources with the outputs of the service, that productivity has fallen. The survey showed falls in crime in the years before steep rises in police funding, which were of course partly borne by the local taxpayer. The rate of the fall in crime as measured by the survey has been unaffected by spending increases since 1999&#150;2000. The arrest rate has fallen slightly since those spending increases, as have detection rates. The number of undetected crimes has reached more than 4.1&nbsp;million&#151;about a quarter of all crimes committed.

 What I am about to say will not surprise my hon. Friend the Minister. Our previous debate on issues relating to West Yorkshire dwelt mainly on reorganisation. I make no apology for repeating some of the funding issues to drive the message home.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_142">As my hon. Friend knows, thanks to the Government&#039;s funding of record levels of police officers and the introduction of PCSOs in West Yorkshire, volume crime levels there have been driven down substantially. Pudsey and Weetwood division in my constituency has been at the forefront; in the last full year for which figures are available&#151;2004&#150;05&#151;8,383&nbsp;fewer crimes were committed there, a fall of 19&nbsp;per cent. Figures for burglary and robbery and for theft of and from motor vehicles fell by even more, and the latest figures for the current year are showing that same downward trend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_143">Despite those encouraging figures, we still need more resources to maintain the downward trend on volume crime and make a much greater impact on antisocial behaviour and violent crime. We need to sustain that sort of progress, but we also need to meet major challenges. As I have said before to my hon. Friend, in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; October 2005&nbsp;Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary reported improvements across the board for West Yorkshire police; there was an excellent score for investigating crime, and good ratings for reducing crime, promoting safety and the effective use of resources.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_144">More worryingly, the force&#039;s ratings for local policing and dealing with the public, although now improving, were still far short of what the people of west Yorkshire

<br>&nbsp;<br>rightly demand. For example, the handling of calls is a continuing source of concern to my constituents. I regret to tell my hon. Friend that this latest funding round will not enable the progress that I have described to be sustained or the challenges that I have mentioned to be met.

<a name="stpa_145">The force&#039;s latest estimate of the budget increase needed next year is &#163;17&nbsp;million higher than the funding available with a precept increase of 5&nbsp;per cent. Admittedly, that includes growth of funding for issues such as counter-terrorism, quality of service commitment and PCSO funding. However, even without that desirable growth, the funding gap is substantial, and that should not be the case. The funding formula has been revised in a way that reflects policing needs across west Yorkshire, and is much more generous than the funding formulae imposed by the Conservative party that benefited the south at the expense of the north.

Unfortunately, my hon. Friend and his colleagues have seen fit to set a floor of 3.2&nbsp;per cent. As he rightly said, that is a virtually flat-rate increase, as in 2005&#150;05, despite assurances&#151;of which I would remind him if he were listening&#151;that the Government would continue to move towards formula-driven allocations.

Figures for 2007&#150;08&nbsp;show an ongoing loss of &#163;14.7&nbsp;million. That is the third largest clawback of any force in the country and represents 10&nbsp;per cent. of the total amount needed to support forces below the floor. It is ironic that three of the forces most penalised by that approach contain, like west Yorkshire, concentrations of deprived populations with particular needs for protective services.

Meeting those costs would obviously go some way towards filling the funding gap. The force has also submitted a bid through ACPO&#039;s terrorism and allied matters group for funding for a local counter-terrorism unit, similar to the one that operates in the west midlands.

Also, the change that means all offences are now arrestable will, in itself, create more of a bureaucratic paper chain without, despite all the talk about technology, the on-street technology necessary for a modern police force, so that officers can spend more time on the streets. Even traffic wardens have gizmos that send messages back and forward.

<a name="stpa_158">Hon. Members will no doubt speak&#151;they already have, to an extent&#151;on behalf of their own police authorities, but it is clear that a significant number of authorities feel that the increase in funding is inadequate and will cause difficulties in fulfilling expectations and keeping up the standards that the public want. They will struggle to meet ongoing cost pressures.

<p>
<a name="60206-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_159">The Metropolitan Police Authority, on which I served for five years before I came here, is an example. My Liberal Democrat colleagues at the Greater London assembly have consistently asked for more money for London policing, not least because of the considerable extra burden on London caused by national and capital city functions, and so that it does not abstract officers from other areas. I was therefore disappointed to see that the MPA&#039;s total revenue grant entitlement had fallen by &#163;1.764&nbsp;million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_160">Under the new grant formula, the Met&#039;s entitlement increased by only 1.15&nbsp;per cent. That is why the Liberal Democrats and the Mayor of London have been arguing about the Mayor&#039;s failure to persuade the Government to adopt a distribution formula that would give London its fair share. To avoid extreme changes in one go, the Government have used floors and ceilings. At the time of the consultation, the floor was set with a minimum increase of 3.2&nbsp;per cent. for every police authority, with a formula entitlement of less than that. Hence, the MPA was due to receive a 3.2&nbsp;per cent. increase, although its entitlement was only 1.15&nbsp;per cent. As a result of the consultation, however, the Government adjusted the grant upward for some police authorities. Because the total available does not change, they have reduced the floor to 3.1&nbsp;per cent., resulting in a reduction for the MPA, which will also apply next year. Even if the allocation were to increase, the authority would not necessarily get more money as a result of the floor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_161">We have heard of other grants today, and the Metropolitan Police Service also bid for about &#163;140&nbsp;million extra but has got around &#163;30&nbsp;million. It will all go on extra work and staff, so the service will be no better off. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, who I understand has just arrived at the function that I was meant to be hosting, has said to the MPA that what is not funded will not be done. That is serious for London. Another part of the Met&#039;s work involves the security services, including MI5. Funding has been increased hugely, but that puts more pressure on the Metropolitan Police Service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_162">As for special payments, a report produced about two years ago showed that the MPS costs for the capital&#039;s royal and diplomatic protection were up to &#163;45&nbsp;million a year more than the special payments. Seemingly, despite Mayor Ken coming back into the Labour fold, he has been unable to persuade the Labour Government to recognise the importance of policing to Londoners. Does the Minister agree that the disappointing increase in the grant entitlement to the MPA, of slightly more than 1&nbsp;per cent., represents either a failure of the Mayor

<a name="stpa_163">I am concerned that the increase in police funding is increasingly being paid for by an increase in council tax. The 6&nbsp;per cent. increase that the Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers have termed necessary to meet costs will have to be made up by taking the money out of our pockets through the precept. It was said last year that council tax would have to rise to 12&nbsp;per cent., but police authorities say that they will have to increase reserves to maintain the capped level. That will not happen two years in a row. In addressing the issues of crime and antisocial behaviour in our communities, the Government have been able to push more and more of the costs on to council tax payers through the precept.
</p>

<a name="60206-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_164">Police forces now have to decide at what level to set their budget and to what level they want to raise council tax. Council tax is not a fair tax. It is not fair on the elderly, who have no chance of increasing their income to deal with council tax increases. That applies especially to women, whose pensions are a scandal. It cannot be right to fund ever-increasing police expenditure in this way. The amount of police expenditure that is funded through council tax has more than doubled. It now accounts for more than 21&nbsp;per cent. of force expenditure compared to 12&nbsp;per cent. in 2001&#150;02.
</p>

<a name="60206-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_165">We all agree across the parties that there is a need for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more police officers on the street and support for safer neighbourhoods. However, as I speak, the Government&#039;s proposals to merge police forces deliver a double whammy for local communities. People will be expected to fork out more council tax to pay for the funding gap. At the same time, they will have less of a say in how their police force is run. Indeed, there will be a triple whammy in that we do not know where the cost of the proposed merger will be lumped. Well, we can all guess.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_166">We are faced with a rushed and expensive merger programme that will cost millions of pounds for our police forces to put in place. We all realise and acknowledge that smaller forces can struggle with complex cases, but they should be provided with a national resource on which they can call, or another form of commissioning on which they agree. They should not be forced into a merger that will seriously undermine local accountability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_167">It seems that the Government, especially given the written statement today, are determined to push on and, effectively, financially to punish police forces that do not wish to merge. Moreover, the Government are obsessed with micro-managing policing throughout the country. The latest example is the Police and Justice Bill, which is coming down the track at us. I raise the matter because the police grant to police authorities will be controlled, if we are not careful, by the Minister. The Bill will give the Home Secretary power to intervene in the business of local authorities; for example, who sits on them, what qualifications they have and how many members there are. Even more seriously, their autonomy will be removed and their function constrained by suggesting what police authorities should be focusing on in their own communities. That is not only Big Brother, but a rather nasty and controlling influence.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise specific issues relating to the funding of the Durham constabulary. Will my hon.

It is said that the funding gap for the authority, given a 5&nbsp;per cent. increase in the council tax precept, will be &#163;6&nbsp;million in 2006&#150;07, rising to &#163;7&nbsp;million and then &#163;8&nbsp;million in 2007&#150;08&nbsp;and 2008&#150;09&nbsp;respectively. We can use some reserves in the short term to try to close that gap, but we are looking to reduce our base budget by &#163;8&nbsp;million over the next three years. That will impact on the performance of the force as it will require a reduction in the number of police officers and police community support officers. Overtime will also be reduced as well as the number of civilian staff, leading to de-civilianisation. In addition, there will be a scaling down of support services.

<a name="stpa_174">I could not help but reflect on the comments of the hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) about the people of west Yorkshire smelling the gravy. I have a pretty good idea of where the gravy train is coming from. Any examination of what has happened to the funding of the Surrey police since 1997&nbsp;makes the position extremely clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_175">I tabled a question to the Home Secretary a few days ago to try to establish exactly what had happened to the funding of the Surrey police per head of population since 1997. The answers were startling. In 1997&#150;98, the Home Office police grant per head of population was &#163;57.80. The council tax per head of population was &#163;19.51. Since then, in cash terms that are unadjusted for inflation, the Home Office grant has fallen to &#163;54.29&nbsp;per head of population, which has been mirrored by a fall in the national non-domestic rates per head of population from &#163;19.72&nbsp;to &#163;16.25. The revenue support grant has also fallen from &#163;20.01&nbsp;to &#163;15.39&nbsp;per head of population. As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) made clear, council tax has gone up by 192&nbsp;per cent. in real terms since 1997. It is supporting the funding of the county constabulary of Surrey, the grant for which is bouncing along the floor. Of course, the hon. Member for Pudsey wants the floor to be withdrawn so that West Yorkshire police can go through the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_176">We must examine why that has taken place. Surrey police has consistently faced the most stringent financial conditions over the past eight years. On two occasions during my time in the House, I took two delegations of Surrey Members, representatives of the police authority and the then chief constable to see the relevant Minister. I first took such a delegation to see the Home Secretary when he held down the position of Minister with responsibility for the police. I went with the then chief constable, Sir Ian Blair, and I had the pleasure of taking Mr. Denis O&#039;Connor at a later stage. Those two gentlemen have gone on to better and greater things, certainly in the case of Sir Ian Blair.

<br>&nbsp;<br>generally welcome changes regarding the provision of police pensions, which will give more certainty, although he has docked 0.1&nbsp;per cent. off the rise to the police to pay for it. He achieved that by making an adjustment to the floor, so there will be a loss to Surrey police and all other forces receiving floor-level funding. Police inflation remains at 5.7&nbsp;per cent., which is a different rate from the retail prices index inflation. The difference between the two for Surrey police represents about &#163;4.5&nbsp;million. Police pensions continue to contribute to police inflation, even with the new arrangements, as do police staff pay, police officer pay, meeting national requirements&#151;such as implementing the recommendations of the Bichard inquiry&#151;and the consequences of legislation such as the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The cost to Surrey police of removing the floor would be some &#163;15.7&nbsp;million, or about 600&nbsp;staff. Surrey is the lowest funded police authority in the country when measured by funding per head of population.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_178">The reason why that has happened since 1997&nbsp;is explained by the detail of the formulae in &quot;The Police Grant Report (England and Wales) 2006/07&quot;. The Minister said that he did not really have responsibility for formulae because they were local-government based. He said that they were not really anything to do with the Home Office because they were based on a general appreciation of need. However, sitting inside the formulae are the insidious changes that have been made across the piece to the public services of the United Kingdom, which have had a hugely deleterious effect on those services, especially in the south and south-east of England. A disaster has overtaken the Surrey police and the health service in Surrey. I have the hospital trust with the biggest debt in the United Kingdom, and the Surrey and Sussex strategic health authority is in the realms of financial disaster, too. All those problems are connected to the formulae that are applied to public sector funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_179">One or two little vignettes in the report deserve to be brought to the House&#039;s attention. I confess that I am no expert on the matter, but I have read the report and attempted to understand it. There appear to be seven separate police crime top-ups in the principal formula. I do not know whether that is because the formula has changed every year since the Government came into office because they decided to make new adjustments each year. One sees that indicators such as single parent households, student housing and a category called &quot;hard pressed&quot; appear more than once in the top-ups. My favourite factor applied to funding is in police crime top-up No. 6: the log of population sparsity. Population sparsity causes a reduction in the amount of money made available to the police, so the more sparse an area&#039;s population, the more money the Government remove from its police allocation. To make up for that, there is a police sparsity top-up in the formula to add back money.

<a name="stpa_180">The document is enormously difficult to understand.

<a name="stpa_181">There is another extraordinary multiplication factor in police crime top-up No. 7. It says that wealthy achievers are to be multiplied by 3.0493&#151;whatever that means&#151;and then subtracted from the funding formula. Having included adjustments in the formulae to take account of student housing, young male unemployment, overcrowded households and all the rest, why on earth is there a need to penalise people who are identified as wealthy achievers? I looked in the document to find out the definition of wealthy achievers. If one wishes to be able to afford to buy a property in Surrey these days, being a wealthy achiever is probably a basic necessity.

<p>
<a name="60206-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_184">My particular concern on behalf of the Surrey police authority is that it is caught in the Catch-22&nbsp;of management options. If it thought that reducing the number of officers was the best way to try to maximise the limited amount of money it has for dealing with crime in Surrey, it could not do that. If it did, it would lose the crime fighting fund of &#163;4&nbsp;million. If Surrey goes under 1,921&nbsp;officers, which is what it had on 1&nbsp;April 2004, it loses another &#163;4&nbsp;million, even if having fewer officers would be a better way of using its limited resources. The force must have a set number of community support officers by 2008&#151;326, I think&#151;but the funding for that appears to come to an end in that year.

<a name="60206-24_para3">

There appears to me to have been the most monumental typographical or arithmetical error. I draw the attention of the House to the ministerial statement on 5&nbsp;December 2005, in which the provisional police funding announcements were made, which indicated that the Home Office police grant would rise from &#163;4.574&nbsp;billion in 2005&#150;06. The very same number is presented to us at the foot of the table on page 3&nbsp;of &quot;The Police Grant Report (England and Wales) 2005/06&quot;. In the ministerial statement, the equivalent figure for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;was &#163;4.714&nbsp;billion, representing an increase of 3.1&nbsp;per cent. If you look, Mr. Deputy Speaker, at the table on page 3&nbsp;of &quot;The Police Grant Report (England and Wales) 2006/07&quot;, you will see that the figure at the bottom, which is the sum of all the allocations for the authorities, is &#163;4.335&nbsp;billion, some &#163;400&nbsp;million less than the figure identified&#151;

In Surrey, we have the busy Brighton main line, and a number of other important train services pass through the county, but of course none of the money would be passed on from the train operating companies to assist in taking on that policing responsibility.

 The main issue that Dyfed-Powys police authority has with the settlement is a &#163;2.7&nbsp;million shortfall. It pleaded with the Government to deal with that&#151;and to be fair, I must tell the House that they met the authority part of the way and, on 30&nbsp;January, announced a further &#163;1.1&nbsp;million. The authority still has a shortfall of &#163;1.3&nbsp;million. Unfortunately, that means a hefty increase in council tax, because that is now the authority&#039;s only option.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_189">Dyfed-Powys police force is opening up small police stations, not closing them down. It has an excellent track record, but it will probably be capped because it foresees an increase of 6. 8&nbsp;per cent. in council tax to fund the shortfall. Without that shortfall, the estimated council tax increase would have been about 1&nbsp;per cent. I understand that the authority is seeking legal advice. It is far from happy, so the Minister&#039;s rather upbeat introduction is not being echoed in Dyfed-Powys.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_190">North Wales has received a 3.2&nbsp;per cent. settlement, and major changes to the funding formula and pension payments have been protected by the floor grant of 3.2&nbsp;per cent. Unfortunately, council tax payers in north Wales already pay the highest police precept in Wales, and they face another inflation-busting increase this year. They could end up paying more than 10&nbsp;per cent. extra this year just to maintain the same level of service. That is one of the four options for the force. The other &quot;standstill&quot; proposal would involve a 6.58&nbsp;per cent. rise in the bill for policing, with the force having to find an additional &#163;1.8&nbsp;million. Last week, a police authority committee meeting at Colwyn Bay said that the authority would have to face very difficult choices.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_191">The performance figures for North Wales police are excellent, with the fourth lowest crime rate in England and Wales for recorded offences, at 56.1&nbsp;per thousand of population. Recorded offences have dropped by 3,688, with a sharp fall in vehicle crime and house burglaries, and the detection rate has reached 43&nbsp;per cent. This year&#039;s draft police authority newsletter boasts, &quot;We are winning&quot;&#151;and I am sure that it is. Serious violent crime has shown an increase slightly below the UK average.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 658</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_192">The forecast for the police services budget involves an increase of about 6&nbsp;per cent., for which the council tax increase is likely to be between 5&nbsp;and 7&nbsp;per cent. That is a serious position, and the North Wales police are concerned about it. As I have said, they have been performing very well. I made the point of comparing their performance to that of Dyfed-Powys, and I shall refer to that of Gwent in a moment, before briefly addressing the question of the rushed and ill-thought-out amalgamation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_193">A great deal of data have been produced comparing North Wales police with other forces, and the reports show that they are performing excellently and investing in the right areas. For example, the police officer to police staff ratio is higher than in most other UK forces. Even so, the &#163;1.5&nbsp;million cut will mean between 30&nbsp;and 50&nbsp;job cuts, although North Wales police already have fewer staff than other forces. This will inevitably put North Wales&#039;s good financial and performance records at risk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_194">Changes have been made to the way in which port security at Holyhead is funded. Obviously, this is a sensitive subject, but just as the Home Office identified a perceived gap in the capacity to deal with level 2&nbsp;crime in these areas, it has cut its financial investment for that purpose in the North Wales police. The budget for police community support officers&#151;PCSOs&#151;will also be cut in due course. The rate at which the North Wales force is now being funded does not allow it to pay PCSOs at the right grade, which is creating problems for morale, job satisfaction and retention. And all this is in advance of the tapering that will inevitably take effect, cutting off the money from the centre to finance these officers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_195">The chief constable of the Gwent police force has rightly said that the funding formula is too complex&#151;a point that was echoed just now by the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt). Gwent must find &#163;5&nbsp;million savings, and the suggested restructuring that we are now hearing about might have to be paid for by borrowing. That is another force&#151;albeit a small one&#151;that is doing excellently for its size. There are no problems at all there. Only a few months ago, Her Majesty&#039;s inspector of constabulary gave the Gwent, North Wales, Dyfed-Powys and South Wales forces a clean bill of health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_196">All those forces are doing well. However, the preliminary budget for Gwent for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;shows an increase over the budget for the current year of &#163;6.1&nbsp;million, or 6&nbsp;per cent. That increase, which is in line with those for other police requirements across England and Wales, will be needed to cover pay awards, price inflation, reducing specific grants on Government initiatives, pension costs and unavoidable operational items. Because of the gearing effect, an increase in expenditure of 6&nbsp;per cent. and an increase in central funding of only 3&nbsp;per cent. will produce an increase in council tax of 13.6&nbsp;per cent&#151;and, of course, we expect a cap of 5&nbsp;per cent., so huge savings will have to be made elsewhere, including job cuts and cuts in services. That is the last thing that Gwent police would want.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_197">I want to talk briefly about the statement that was sneaked out today. That was an abominable thing to do. The press and media in north Wales were briefed about this matter on Friday evening, because a member of the press told me personally that &quot;the game was over&quot;&#151;he used those words. As a Member of Parliament, I was

I find it abhorrent that the Government should brief the media on a Friday, and I should be told about it on an off-hand basis the night before the statement was sneaked out through the Library today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-24_para16">
<a name="stpa_198">That is an appalling way to do things, and it simply underlines the fact that the case for the amalgamation has not been made. I pressed the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety for weeks to give me the justification for the magical figure of 4,000&nbsp;officers. I finally received a stupid little graph showing me how it would work. It had nothing to do with policing, and it was absolute nonsense; the case for the amalgamation has not been made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-24_para17">
<a name="stpa_199">When the proposal was first announced in September, the Secretary of State for Wales said that the case for the amalgamation would have to be proven. It has not been proven in any shape or form. In Wales, we remain totally opposed to the proposals. Many senior officers and all the police authorities are against them. It would take a chief officer between four and a half and five hours to travel by car from Cardiff to Holyhead; that is absolutely ridiculous.

</p>





<p><a name="st_181"><a name="60206-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Llwyd: </b> 
 I hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying. I know that the Dyfed-Powys force is in daily contact with forces over the border, and that they have an excellent exchange of information. The North Wales police have hourly contact with the Cheshire and Merseyside forces, exchanging information and intelligence. A huge and dangerous drugs ring was busted by the police forces of South Wales, Gwent, and Avon and Somerset, working together on Operation Triban, giving the lie to the idea that the existing forces cannot handle organised crime. I presume that terrorism will stop this side of the Scottish border, because the Scottish forces, although the same size as the Welsh ones, are thought to be able to handle terrorism and organised crime. That is nonsense.

 Thank you very much for calling me to speak in this debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and may I repeat the apology that I made at the beginning? I was here for the opening remarks, but there was such anger locally that I was asked to make comments outside the House on the extraordinary statement that has been slipped through in the most skulking and underhand manner by the Home Secretary. I was rung up by my local radio station, BBC Radio Shropshire, at about 1.30&nbsp;pm. It had already had notification that there had been a statement and asked whether I knew anything about it, which I did not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_204">My secretary immediately looked on the Home Office website, but there was no mention whatever of such a statement. I then rang the chairman of the police authority, who knew nothing about it. Then I went down to the Library and got this copy, which brought the most unwelcome news that the West Mercia police force is going to be rammed into a monster regional force. Mr. Deputy Speaker, will you pass on to Mr. Speaker the fact that I find it scandalous that such a huge decision is being announced in a two-page written statement placed in the Library?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_205">I congratulate West Mercia on being judged the number one force in the country, according to the widest range of criteria established by the Home Office, although its geographical area is the fourth largest, and it is the largest landlocked force. It is dramatically less well funded by central Government than all the forces that surround it. It receives &#163;94.38&nbsp;per head, and as we have just heard, North Wales receives &#163;116, while Dyfed-Powys receives &#163;105.24&nbsp;and Gwent &#163;131.45. We are massively worse off than the Welsh forces.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_206">Let us compare the funding of forces in the north of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England. Cheshire is well in with &#163;112.36, Staffordshire receives &#163;107.96, West Midlands receives a massive &#163;167.25, Warwickshire receives &#163;99.69, and Gloucestershire receives &#163;107.52. That is because West Mercia was one of the first forces to&#151;if I may use a ghastly piece of jargon&#151;civilianise. It took police officers away from routine activities such as answering telephones, putting those duties into civilian hands. The force is thus being penalised for its historic efficiency. This is not just a whinge about money. I am trying to draw attention to the fact that West Mercia has still emerged as the number one force in the country&#151;although for reasons that I do not understand, the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety rubbishes it at every opportunity, and tries to run down its achievement.

<p>
<a name="60206-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_207">Only 10&nbsp;days ago, I took the chairman of the authority and the chief constable to meet the Minister. They have made a strong case for the view that no financial gains can result from the huge amalgamation of the west midlands forces. As they have said, West Mercia is already an extremely efficient force that has made prudent savings, which it intends to invest in strategic policing measures to deal with issues such as terrorism and serious crime, which were mentioned by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Llwyd). West Mercia proposes to spend &#163;2.9&nbsp;million of its own funds on an extra 95&nbsp;officers who will handle those issues; it has a record in that regard. I am pleased to see that my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) has just come into the Chamber, because I was about to say that when the IRA blew up Shrewsbury castle, West Mercia dealt with it. When the IRA blew up Tern Hill barracks in my constituency, West Mercia dealt with that as well. Bizarrely, when the IRA turned up at Weston Park for the summit, West Mercia police were actively involved in protecting the terrorist leaders. They were also involved at Weston Park when President Clinton was there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_208">West Mercia has been involved at the highest level in key strategic policing issues. For instance, Hereford contains the headquarters of the SAS, which must be a serious target for those who do not have the good will of this country in their sights. The force has handled all those duties most efficiently, and I cannot understand for the life of me why the Government are ignoring the fact that it is so efficient, and also so popular.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_209">West Mercia carried out a survey of public opinion, which is probably unprecedented among police forces. Not one of the Members of Parliament who were consulted&#151;including a Minister and a Parliamentary Private Secretary&#151;and not one county council, unitary council or district council has written in to approve what is going on, but 108&nbsp;parish councils have written in to support the idea of retaining West Mercia as a strategic force with its own boundaries. Following a telephone survey, 96&nbsp;per cent. of respondents said that they wanted the force&#039;s status to be maintained, because it spent its funds well. That is what the debate is about&#151;efficient policing, and local policing.

<p><a name="st_187"><a name="60206-25_spnew7"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is making an excellent case for West Mercia. The amalgamations were supposed to be based on a business case. Does he believe that the Government even constructed a business case, let alone examined and judged it, before making their decisions?

<p><a name="st_188"><a name="60206-25_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the extra police officers whom we have in West Mercia are a direct result of decisions by the police authority to increase council tax? Owing to monstrous underfunding, we could not pay for them from Government support for our local police service. Local people are prepared to spend extra money on a better police service, and have expressed complete contempt for the idea of a merger between police services.

The public value CSOs and regard them as more accessible; they also feel that they spend more time in the community.

The group looking at this issue&#151;it was set up by the Home Secretary and includes the Home Office, the police authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers&#151;has had estimates ranging from &#163;430&nbsp;million to &#163;600&nbsp;million. It is simply too early to say precisely what the figure will be, but as I said earlier, the financing will come from a variety of sources: the &#163;125&nbsp;million that, as I confirmed earlier, the Home Office will make available, the reshaping of some existing commitments, and further local investment, which will yield savings in the longer term. By the longer term I mean a three-year period, no more. It is clear that that combination of investment can cover the costs of restructuring.

<a name="stpa_221">As my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) told the House, he and I have discussed these issues before. His constituents need be in no doubt that when it comes to arguing for policing resources, he always makes an effective case. He celebrated, as I do, the extra 480&nbsp;police officers serving in his police force and the additional CSOs. We have seen the fall in volume crime as a result. I acknowledge, as I did during his earlier intervention, the gap between what the formula would have given his police force and the actual amount that it will receive. I say again that that is to the benefit of 24&nbsp;other police authorities; we have to achieve stability, as well as meeting need. I should also point out

The further announcements that the Home Secretary made at the end of January will be helpful in taking that issue forward. We continue to look at the costs associated with post-7&nbsp;July activity. Stephen Boys Smith is examining airport policing generally, and the question of designation will also be dealt with.

<a name="stpa_222">I apologise to the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) if I did not make the figures sufficiently clear, but in fact they are very clear: the total amount of central grant that we are providing is &#163;10.574&nbsp;billion. I am, of course, happy to explain how wider funding assists our policing effort. For example, the &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion that we are investing in the drugs programme in the coming year will help enormously in dealing with some of the criminality linked to drugs. On the &#163;125&nbsp;million available to help with the costs associated with restructuring, the Home Secretary has made it clear that he will consider applying some of that funding to stand-alone forces that meet the acceptable standard for protective services. I hope that the hon. Lady will take some encouragement from that. I disagree, however, with what she said about the Government&#039;s policing policy hitting the poorest hardest. The central thrust of that policy&#151;neighbourhood policing&#151;is about ensuring that the poorest people in the poorest communities, who are often those most affected by criminality, are given the policing service that they deserve. That goal is at the heart of all that we do.

 On 5&nbsp;December, I announced plans to the House for grant allocation to local authorities in England, and today I confirm that the Government will provide for a total grant of &#163;62.1&nbsp;billion in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and &#163;65.1&nbsp;billion in 2007&#150;08: increases of 4.5&nbsp;per cent. and 5&nbsp;per cent. respectively. On top of that, some &#163;24.8&nbsp;billion and &#163;25.6&nbsp;billion will be grant distributed by formula, which we are debating today, and those are increases of 3&nbsp;per cent. and 3.7&nbsp;per cent. respectively. By 2007&#150;08, that will provide 10&nbsp;years of above-inflation grant increase for councils. Specific grants will total &#163;37.3&nbsp;billion and &#163;39.5&nbsp;billion. They are a very important part of the picture because they include the funding for schools, the Government&#039;s top priority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_229">Before Opposition Members rush to contrast this year&#039;s formula grant for their education authorities with last year&#039;s, they should bear in mind that a fair comparison of figures must include schools funding. All of the figures I quoted are adjusted for changes in function and financing to give a like-for-like comparison. We have also provided a two-year settlement for the supporting people grant programme. Total allocation in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;will be &#163;1.685&nbsp;billion. Allocations of 95&nbsp;per cent. of grant have been announced for the second year, 2007&#150;08, so an authority&#039;s allocation will not go below that, and it may indeed be higher.

<p><a name="st_199"><a name="60206-27_spnew1"><b> Peter Luff  (Mid-Worcestershire) (Con):</b> 
 The figures that the Minister has boasted about of above-inflation increases refer to the aggregate of a county council settlement. While it is true that the settlement for education has indeed been significantly above inflation, the settlement for other areas has been below inflation, posing real problems, for example, for social services departments and highways maintenance.
</p>





<p><a name="st_200"><a name="60206-27_spnew2"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I am sure that we shall come on to the specifics during the debate. My point is that if one takes a like-for-like comparison of total allocation for all councils, they have all received an above-inflation grant increase. For the benefit of the House, I shall detail the floor damping levels to which his authority and representations referred.

<a name="60206-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_230">In allocating grants in advance to every local authority in England, we have put a premium on stability and predictability of funding. Those are vital to councils so that they can plan ahead for service delivery. We have now announced two-year individual allocations of formula grant for every authority, and more than 90&nbsp;per cent. of all specific grants that can be allocated in advance have been allocated for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08. With the next spending review period of 2008&nbsp;to 2011, we will move towards full three-year settlements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_231">Changes in grant distribution can be disruptive and I intend to minimise the extent to which that is so in the short term. In the interests of stability, we have made grant floors&#151;a minimum guaranteed increase from one year to the next&#151;a permanent part of the system. Further to that, for the next two years we have set grant floors&#151;minimum guaranteed percentage increases&#151;that are high in relation to the average increase available in formula grant. I shall list those floor figures for the benefit of the House. For 2006&#150;07, the floors will be 2&nbsp;per cent. for those authorities with education and social services responsibilities; 3.1&nbsp;per cent. for police authorities; and 1.5&nbsp;per cent. for fire and rescue authorities. As I have already explained to the House, that figure masks the help we are giving by phasing in recovery of the modernisation grant paid in 2004&#150;05.

That has caused great concern. Would the Minister be prepared to meet a delegation from the local authority?

<br>&nbsp;<br>a number of delegations I have met during the past few weeks have raised that point. I would argue that it arises from a misunderstanding resulting from the abolition of the notional spending amounts through the old formula spending share criteria.

<a name="stpa_233">Consultation on the settlement I proposed to the House on 5&nbsp;December ran until 11&nbsp;January, and in the course of that consultation the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister received 336&nbsp;written representations from councils, right hon. and hon.

 As my hon.

Despite the representations made by the 27&nbsp;authorities affected and the fact that, by my calculations, the sum needed to settle the problem was not large&#151;about &#163;6.4&nbsp;million&#151;I am disappointed that the ODPM did not see fit to provide that additional sum, as it would have given Derby city council about a third of a million pounds, which would be extremely helpful.

<p><a name="st_207"><a name="60206-27_spnew9"><b> Sir Paul Beresford  (Mole Valley) (Con):</b> 
 As the Minister knows, it was generally thought that the standard spending assessment and the formula spending share were equally complicated, but the new distribution system is really confusing and difficult. Could he help by writing to me on this point? In an inner-London council that I know well, the relative needs indicator in the formula for children to social care is 0.00051700040384. That means nothing to anybody expect perhaps a man with a computer, so will the Minister explain what it means and what would happen if he wanted to put more money into that needs sector? How does he know that it will be allocated there and not distributed elsewhere by the formula?

<p><a name="st_208"><a name="60206-28_spnew0"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 It seems that I have confused the hon. Gentleman with the simplicity of the formula. The abolition of the FSS, whose predecessor was the SSA, has caused some difficulties for local authority officers when advising Members on like-for-like comparisons, but as I said on 5&nbsp;December, our view was that the FSS no longer served the purpose for which it was designed, if indeed it ever did. That in itself caused great confusion and, as I shall say when I set out my four clear principles for the determination of grant distribution, we have the basis for a much greater understanding of local government finance as we move through the rest of this year and the important debate, in which the hon. Gentleman has a part, on future financing.

 Will the Minister give way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_210"><a name="60206-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 If I may, I shall go through the principles, after which the hon. Gentleman may be informed of the beauty and symmetry of the formula. Although beauty and symmetry are not words that come to mind that often when dealing with him, I hope that he will bear with me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_234">Given that we had proposed to phase in change quite slowly, it is not surprising that many local authorities commented on the impact of the damping. A number of authorities on the grant floor complained that they had gained no extra grant above the floor; for example, for capital projects. I reject that argument because the floor gives such authorities more grant than they would receive after the grant formula calculation. Other local authorities above the floor&#151;we have heard about some of them already this evening&#151;complained of the extent to which their grant increase was scaled back to pay for the floor applied to other authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_235">First, of course, the floor has to be paid for, and ultimately one has to strike a balance between the need for stability and allowing larger grant changes to come through. As I have explained, the overwhelming principle in the settlement is to favour stability. Secondly, it is important to note that the real-world pressures on local government exist irrespective of formula changes and are not new, although they may be more transparent&#151;as has been outlined.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_236">We have reformed the grant calculation system and some respondents found that difficult to understand. I readily concede that the system is still complex, but in the past we found that some local authorities were not happy with the idea of a simple system, as in their view it would reduce fairness. My policy is to make the system simpler. For the present, the new system has the advantage of removing the old assumptions about spending and tax levels&#151;the FSS&#151;thus devolving more accountability to local authorities, a policy that Opposition Members say they favour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_237">The new system is simpler in principle. Apart from the damping that I have already described, grant distribution is determined by three things: first, a relative needs formula; secondly, an amount relative to the tax that can be raised locally based on the property profile in the local authority area; and thirdly, a central allocation per head of population.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_238">The relative needs and resource elements should be broadly familiar to Members, as the system has long contained formulaic estimates of relative need and of relative ability to raise council tax. The central allocation makes explicit what was always implicit in the system&#151;after taking account of differences in relative needs and resources, some of the grant is allocated on a per capita basis. Fuller explanations are of course available to authorities, and to Members, in the supporting information we have provided.
</p>





<p><a name="st_211"><a name="60206-28_spnew3"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 Following the point made by the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford), can the Minister explain how the basic amounts for each block are calculated? Is it part of the needs index or, as it appears to be, a political judgment about the balance between different spending blocks?
</p>





<p><a name="st_212"><a name="60206-28_spnew4"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 The formula allocations of the seven funding blocks are based on an assessment of needs, but 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 671</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the overwhelming determinant is the amount of formula grant available for distribution, as the hon. Gentleman knows. That is inherent in the system; we can only slice the cake in so many ways. If I may, I will take this opportunity to lay to rest the accusation&#151;although I realise that the hon. Gentleman is not making it&#151;that the allocation, the calculations based on need in the funding blocks and the simpler system cause an unfair distribution, either due to the type of local authority or between regions in England.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_239">In the settlement, we use population projections and estimates supplied by the ONS, as those are the best figures consistently available. Several authorities are pursuing issues about the figures with the ONS, which is the correct course of action, but the change in the methodology for calculating population received majority support in the consultation and provides a better look ahead as well as an assessment of historical trends in population statistics.
</p>





<p><a name="st_213"><a name="60206-28_spnew5"><b> Mr. Mark Lancaster  (North-East Milton Keynes) (Con):</b> 
 Milton Keynes council benefits from a projected population figure, as we are expanding rapidly, but what the Minister gives with one hand he takes away with the other&#151;87.5&nbsp;per cent. of what we receive is lost through funding the floor settlement, which will amount to &#163;3.5&nbsp;million next year and &#163;6.5&nbsp;million the year after. Is not it the case that the floors policy is being funded at the expense of the sustainable communities policy?
</p>





<p><a name="st_214"><a name="60206-28_spnew6"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 My experience of these matters is that Opposition Members who benefit from the floors policy tend to remain mute, while those whose local authorities would gain more money, in addition to the extra money that they have been allocated&#151;let us not forget that point&#151;are scaled back by the need to pay for the floor, as he says, which is why the decision about stability in the system is so important.
</p>





<p><a name="st_215"><a name="60206-28_spnew7"><b> Mr. David Burrowes  (Enfield, Southgate) (Con):</b> 
 Does the Minister concede that there is great concern about the disparity in the ONS estimated population rates, which are not reflected in authorities such as Enfield, where numbers in all categories are increasing? The number of asylum seekers and refugees has risen, as has the number of properties. Traffic growth has risen. The number of housing benefit claimants has risen. School numbers are up. None of that is properly reflected in the ONS figures, which are based on what is now accepted to be flawed methodology&#151;for example, in relation to port of entry questions and the figures for GP registration, which are, as the ONS itself admits, inadequate. Is not a new approach needed, which would take on board the Local Government Association&#039;s suggestion that a commission for statistics should be set up? We need an approach whereby Ministers take responsibility rather than merely conceding that there is a problem.

However, I have not found that those proposals were particularly unfair to any type of authority, nor that the extra cost of free fares, in so far as they can be estimated at this stage, place a burden out of proportion to existing public transport spending on any authority. I have therefore concluded that the settlement reflects the fairest way available to share out the money. It takes account of factors that reflect support for the disabled and the needs of areas where take-up is likely to be highest.

 Discussions are still going on with the passenger transport executive and other authorities. My remarks relate to the funding formula distribution. My hon.

We have been able to find &#163;1.7&nbsp;million for the metro in Newcastle upon Tyne, but that is a separate subject.

<a name="stpa_242">I should just deal with a misconception promoted by several authorities controlled by the Conservative party. There is no political or geographical bias in the system, contrary to what has been said, and no taking from the south to give to the north, or vice versa.

<a name="stpa_243">Following consultation, I am broadly confirming the grant distribution proposals that I made on 5&nbsp;December for both 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08. I have made fairer the adjustments necessary to reflect a change in financing for certain capital projects from supported borrowing to capital grant. In particular, that will help authorities with large building schools for the future programmes. Similarly, where fire and rescue or police authorities have provided evidence that we should do so, we have amended the adjustments necessary to introduce the change in funding arrangements for fire and police pensions. As is usual, we have made corrections to the data used, where that was justified during the consultation.

<a name="stpa_245">I can assure hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_246">The joint work with the LGA identified some real pressures over the next two years, particularly in respect of waste management and social services.

I make it clear that that extra funding is in addition to the funding provided by Government to meet the net new burdens principle. It gives councils the funding to continue to provide the services that local people need, taking into account the pressures identified by the LGA. There is no need for councils to threaten cuts in service for vulnerable members of society.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_271">Let us look at what has happened to Northamptonshire because of the effect on borrowing. The council received an overall grant increase of &#163;2.5&nbsp;million, which is 2.1&nbsp;per cent., to fund all services, including financial capital investment. After taking into account the cost of capital investment, just &#163;750,000, or a 0.6&nbsp;per cent. increase, is left for all other services, which may explain why service charges are going up in Northamptonshire.

 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_249"><a name="60206-31_spnew7"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 Let me give the hon. Lady the other example, as she might feel that Northamptonshire has done reasonably well compared with Oxfordshire county council, which has also recently become Conservative controlled. The increase in grant for Oxfordshire county council is &#163;1.9&nbsp;million. If one strips out the supported borrowing, one is left with a decrease of &#163;1.4&nbsp;million or minus 2.2&nbsp;per cent.
</p>





<p><a name="st_250"><a name="60206-31_spnew8"><b> Ms Keeble </b> 
: The hon. Gentleman is confusing two councils&#151;Northamptonshire county council and Northampton borough council. The county council received &#163;115&nbsp;million extra from the Government for its

 As for the hon. Lady&#039;s point about Northamptonshire county council, if she is expecting us to be helpful in future she should show a little gratitude for our intervention, as we are here to help.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_272">Ring-fencing is necessary because the Government want to control everything but, sadly, can manage nothing. In &quot;Strong Local Leadership: Quality Public Services&quot;, the White Paper which was published in 2001&#151;not very not long ago&#151;they made a commitment to reduce the amount of ring-fenced grant to under 10&nbsp;per cent. of the total grant. That seems ambitious, as ring-fenced grant now accounts for more than 50&nbsp;per cent. of the total grant. That increase is a result of the dedicated schools budget, which was necessary because the Government got into a terrific mess. If I had another name, I would say that they were in a terrific pickle in 2003, when they made a promise to schools that, frankly, could not be met by the grant distribution. The dedicated schools grant is an important symbol, showing that the Government do not trust local government.

<a name="60206-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_273">In questions to the Deputy Prime Minister last week, I raised the issue of the supporting people scheme. I was sorry that it was dismissed out of hand, because it is a great crisis for local government. Expectations have been raised, but they cannot be met, exposing the most vulnerable to a reduction in their quality of life. To enable Ministers to understand their plight, may I cite a report by Derby city council on the supporting people programme that was published late last year? It predicts a funding shortfall of &#163;534,000&nbsp;in 2005&#150;06, which will rise to just over &#163;1&nbsp;million in 2006&#150;07, and to well over &#163;1.5&nbsp;million in 2007&#150;08. The council proposes to allocate &#163;500,000&nbsp;from corporate resources to fund the projected shortfall, but the continued use of reserves to fund such deficits is not viable. It says:

 Labour Members would have listened with growing incredulity to the speech of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), had he continued. I shall give him one reason for that incredulity. He mentioned Cambridge county council having to make cuts of &#163;1.6&nbsp;million. That council has a population of about 737,000. In the 1980s and 1990s, when I was a member of Wigan council, which has a population of 300,000, we were required to make cuts of &#163;10&nbsp;million by the Conservatives&#151;not just in one year. Year on year, we had to make such cuts. It would do Opposition Members some good&#151;those on the Front Bench as well as those who intervened earlier&#151;if we had a few choruses of &quot;mea culpa&quot; before they continue their comments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_279">There has been a remarkable growth in the amount of money given to local government by the Labour Government, and that is the case again this year. I have problems with this year&#039;s settlement&#151;not with its size, but with the way the cake is sliced up. The major problem is with the formula. The new formula recognises need, particularly for social service. I welcome that. A formula based on evidence that recognises need will lead to a fairer distribution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_280">However, a damping mechanism has been introduced, especially in relation to social services, so that all the gains that were made by many of the authorities in the organisation that I chair, the special interest group of municipal authorities, have been damped out. I am not opposed to damping in principle. It is right, for the reasons to which I alluded in my opening remarks. When I was on the council, I would have preferred damping to massive cuts year on year. We could have achieved much more. In this case, however, the damping is far too harsh. In SIGOMA authorities such as mine, about &#163;250&nbsp;million will be taken out of our social services. We have a floor of 2.7&nbsp;per cent. That protects councils that are currently over-resourced in social services at the expense of councils such as mine that are under-resourced, and will continue to be so for some considerable time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_281">I regret that during the consultation period the Minister did not take on board the case made by SIGOMA authorities and others for reducing that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 683</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>damping to some degree. Had he been able to reduce it even by a small amount, that would have led to about &#163;35&nbsp;million going back into SIGOMA and other authorities, including county councils. That would have significantly improved their ability to serve their people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_282">It is not just a question of damping in social services. On top of that, we have damping in the overall budget, with floors of 2&nbsp;per cent. and a reduction of about 85&nbsp;per cent. on the amount of money that authorities receiving more than the floor should get to pay for that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_283">I cannot understand why we have those two elements of damping. The local government settlement is about how the Government divvy up the amount of money that they have: it does not relate to the amount of money that each local authority will spend on any one element within it. Local authorities have the freedom to make those choices&#151;they do not have to spend the amount of money on social services that is allocated by the Government&#151;but a double damping effect places a tremendous imposition on them. It is imperative that the Minister considers this in great detail. It will not be an issue over the next year, because that is fixed, but when he comes to deal with the next settlement it is essential that that double damping is taken out; otherwise, we will have major problems with local government settlements in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_284">The result is that there will be quite severe cuts in the number of services provided. Those cuts are not likely to fall on particular individuals, because all good local authorities will ensure that they deal with the essentials. However, where individuals are supported by social services, the bar of access to services will start to be raised, and the charges levied by authorities will be increased. We will end up with a postcode lottery. Authorities that have a higher rate for historical reasons, and therefore benefit from the damping, will be able to provide services that authorities such as mine, which are suffering from the damping, will be unable to provide. One authority will be unable to provide the services that another authority next door is able to provide. I am sure that Members on both sides of the House, including the Minister, would agree that that situation is wholly unacceptable and must be dealt with.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_285">Another issue that affects local authorities in the SIGOMA areas is that most of us have primary care trusts that are seriously underfunded. The underfunding of PCTs in SIGOMA authorities amounts to &#163;215&nbsp;million. That is in addition to the &#163;250&nbsp;million that we have lost because of the damping. As a result, PCTs have no resources available to help local authorities with their social services budgets. People will not get the level of support that they need. Instead of being treated at home in dignity, close to their families, they will become more dependent and eventually have to go into acute hospitals, putting increasing pressure on the NHS. In many local authorities, it is not unusual, as Tom Jones might say, for social services and PCTs to pool resources in order to provide joint funding for those purposes. However, in SIGOMA authorities there is a single pot with two gaping holes that are pouring out &#163;250&nbsp;million and then another &#163;215&nbsp;million from those services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_286">It is essential that Ministers set a time scale to end such damping. Without that, the whole formula that we have set up&#151;I think it a good formula and agree with it&#151;will become worthless; Ministers might as well 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>throw straws in the wind to decide on the amount of money. The whole thing will become discredited and the whole point of it would be brought in to disrepute.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_287">The following two things are essential in the next round of local government settlement. First, we must have a single damping mechanism on the total amount of money that goes to local authorities. Secondly, we must have a definitive and transparent time scale, so that the damping that I mentioned can be eased out. I do not want authorities to have to make savage cuts. However, they need to understand that, because of their needs, they are over-resourced in comparison with other authorities and the Government need to take account of that.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<a name="stpa_289">Contrary to popular wisdom, the new year actually begins around October, as the Local Government Association and council leaders begin to set out their stall of doom about council service cuts and council tax rises. The Government then fight back with a macho swipe at wasteful councils and warn them that they must stay within their budget this year or face the wrath of the cap. Then there is a stand-off, a bit of a public argy-bargy, a spot of name-calling and a public falling-out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_290">At the last minute, the doughty Minister trawls around his colleagues with a begging bowl to find a few extra coppers to forestall the crisis. He announces his Christmas bonus to councils in December and tells them that they need to thank him for it. However, councils protest that it is still not enough and charge their MPs to explain the difficulties to the House in January. Then councils fix their budgets, cut some vital services, hike up the council tax and the voters protest; so Ministers cap them. Councils then cut a few more services and we begin the annual dance of the pantomime horse all over again. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I had to get the pantomime horse in; there was a race to get it in first.

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_292">In the meantime, the Government have introduced some reforms, but as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) said, the local government community was united in opposing them. The Government had a consultation about the change to the formula, but everybody said that it would be a bad idea; they introduced it anyway. The problem with the new formula is that, far from making things simpler or more transparent, it increases the potential for ministerial discretion in the allocation of funding.

<a name="60206-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_293">For example, why does Northumberland get nearly &#163;100&nbsp;per capita of grant more than Somerset? There may well be a perfectly legitimate reason, but the Government should be willing to make those reasons public and transparent and to debate them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para17">
<a name="stpa_294">Another side effect of this year&#039;s settlement is that, on the whole, districts have done better than expected. That may be a coincidence, but I cannot help wondering whether it has something to do with the Government being desperate to avoid last summer&#039;s capping embarrassment, when they employed the full machinery of legislation to make an example of a set of tiny district councils, an example that for the most part provided little more benefit to the average council tax payer than the cost of a pint of beer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para18">
<a name="stpa_295">However, some developments are to be welcomed and it is important that we do so. As the Minister said, the Government have done much work to identify spending pressures with the LGA, and that is to be welcomed. We also welcome the shift toward three-year settlements, with the two-year settlement in this instance being fitted in with the three-year spending reviews.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para19">
<a name="stpa_296">However, technical difficulties arise from a move to longer settlements. The Government will use projections from the 2004&#150;05&nbsp;mid-year population estimate to calculate funding through to 2007&#150;08&nbsp;and projections are, of course, based on historic trends, which poses problems for areas where population growth is speeding up, and for some northern cities, which have managed to stem population decline but where projections imply it is continuing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para20">
<a name="stpa_297">Fundamental questions also remain about the data source. The Office for National Statistics has finally admitted that, for many inner-London councils with high migration levels and very large ethnic minority communities, its population figures and methodology are fundamentally flawed. My own borough has battled with that. Brent council estimates that the ONS may underestimate its population by as many as 20,000&nbsp;people, when compared with Greater London assembly estimates. The implications are real, since for every 1,000&nbsp;fewer individuals in the calculation, the estimated lost revenue approaches &#163;500,000. Will the Government look at ways of ensuring that projections are informed by the most up-to-date data available?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para21">
<a name="stpa_298">There are some glaring omissions in the statement. The Government have included no amount for the cost of their latest policy wheeze&#151;council structural reorganisation&#151;and I wonder whether the House should assume that that will not be implemented until 2008&#150;09, or whether it is to go entirely unfunded? The Cambridge academic Michael Chisholm calculates that the cost will be up to &#163;3.5&nbsp;million. The Government may dispute the figure, but they surely do not claim that the process will be entirely free.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-32_para22">
<a name="stpa_299">The fundamental problem with the settlement, as with last year&#039;s and the year&#039;s before, is that it provides little freedom for councils to do their job properly. If we believe in local government, we have to give councils the freedom to raise and spend their own money. That means drastic local government financial reform, not a bit of tinkering with the formula.

 My constituents are extremely confused. They know that there was a 3.5&nbsp;per cent. increase in grant funding from the Government, which was one of the most generous for many a year. Yet our Conservative mayor proposes cuts of 10&nbsp;per cent. across the board. Who is telling the truth? Was there an above-inflation increase, or is there really a 10&nbsp;per cent. cut? If we can find out the answer, we shall know who is accountable for the cuts, or for unnecessary cuts.

<p><a name="st_265"><a name="60206-33_spnew1"><b> Sarah Teather: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises a number of points, notably about the opacity of the funding formula and the gearing effect and balance of funding, which I shall come on to discuss.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_300">This year, with the dedicated schools grant, which some hon. Members have described as the biggest symbol of the Government&#039;s lack of trust in local government, ring-fenced grants now total around 50&nbsp;per cent. of the whole grant. If budgets are tight, that pushes pressures on to other areas. The total grant may well be above inflation, but non-schools grant increases are below retail prices index inflation, and well below wage inflation, which pushes up the cost of delivering council services much more quickly than RPI inflation does. The pressure is greatest on social services, with some authorities already stating that they may have either to increase charges or increase the qualification criteria for care, a point alluded to by the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner). The latter policy led, of course, to the now infamous case in Gloucestershire, where Richard and Beryl Driscoll were separated. I know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) wants to catch your eye to speak about some of the specific effects of pressures on funding for social services and supporting people in his constituency, so I shall not speak about that in more detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_301">As councils struggle to balance their books and pay for programmes in non-ring-fenced areas, it is council tax payers who bear the brunt as their council tax goes up again. If it goes up by 5&nbsp;per cent. again this year, the average band D council tax payer will pay &#163;1,275&nbsp;a year, which is a total increase of 85&nbsp;per cent. since Labour came to power. If it goes up by 5&nbsp;per cent. again the following year, the figure will be &#163;1,339, which is up 95&nbsp;per cent. since 1997. In that time, inflation and the state pension have gone up by 29&nbsp;per cent. and wages by 53&nbsp;per cent. We can see the mismatch quite clearly.
</p>

<a name="stpa_302">Voters protest about council tax partly because it has risen so quickly, but also because it is fundamentally unfair. It does not relate to the ability to pay.

<a name="stpa_304">We need a new system of local government finance that is based on fair local taxes, localised business rates, local income tax and a simple grant mechanism, without ring-fencing, passporting or capping. We need a new system that will let local government do the job that it was elected to undertake. We need also a new system that will stop the nonsensical ritual of financial crisis. I live in hope.

<p><a name="st_266"><a name="60206-33_spnew2"><b> Mr. Eric Illsley  (Barnsley, Central) (Lab):</b> 
 I shall keep my remarks brief because many of the issues have been raised that I wanted to take up about metropolitan authorities. It has been a disappointing settlement for the metropolitan authorities, and that relates to damping. The met authorities are deeply disappointed by what appears to be the new settlement&#039;s lack of effective change. The authorities have received the lowest increase in grant&#151;2.4&nbsp;per cent. compared with the national 3.1&nbsp;per cent. For the metropolitan authorities, that equates to about &#163;250&nbsp;million. There are 17&nbsp;met authorities that will have a floor increase of 2&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_305">The metropolitan authorities represent about 24.5&nbsp;per cent. of national need. Their local tax base, unfortunately, allows them to deliver only about 22.2&nbsp;per cent. of assumed local funding. That equates to 26&nbsp;per cent. of total Government grant. That means that metropolitan authorities will receive only 27.3&nbsp;per cent. of resources. That is a difference of &#163;670&nbsp;million to all the met authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_306">The damping effect that will stem from the settlement is in addition to damping that has occurred in the past. In 2003&#150;04, there were the changes to the education funding formula. Damping was introduced and met authorities lost an estimated &#163;180&nbsp;million. Changes were made to the funding formula of primary care trusts; again, that was in 2003&#150;04, under the pace of change policy. That was &#163;200&nbsp;million less than the needs agreed by Government. As for joint funding issues, I was told on Friday that Barnsley PCT might now have to provide the funding to meet the debts of Sheffield PCT because of the political problems of our strategic health authorities. That would be a funding disaster for the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_307">Council tax revaluation, if delayed indefinitely, would have resulted in losses to metropolitan authorities. And so it goes on. The new social services formula builds on that. I shall give an example of how such damping has an effect on my area of Barnsley. There is the housing subsidy settlement of 2006&#150;07. My area has suffered from poor housing subsidy settlements in the past. The formula did not reflect our need to spend. In 2004&#150;05, the Government recognised this iniquity and introduced a new system of allowances. However, the pace of that change has been determined by the level of transitional protection to authorities, primarily in London, which were the losers following the 2004&#150;05&nbsp;changes. My local authority welcomed the 2006&#150;07&nbsp;draft settlement as it was proposed to move substantially towards our target allowances for housing subsidy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_308">However, following consultation, additional transitional protection has been given and the top 16&nbsp;gainers from that protection are all London authorities. As the national pot for management and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 688</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>maintenance allowances is fixed, money is being taken from authorities such as Barnsley to meet the cost of extra transitional protection for London authorities. My local authority is thus &#163;350,000&nbsp;worse off under the final settlement compared with the draft settlement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_309">As my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner) pointed out, it is difficult for areas such as ours to make up any shortfall or address damping under the grant. We do not have wealthy local authorities. They do not receive income from tourism or charges for provision. We thus face pressure when trying to address the situation, which results in cuts to services because we cannot find the extra funding that we need. The authority will not challenge the capping rules set out by the Government, or implement way-out council tax increases, so services will be cut. I can tell my hon. Friend the Minister that redundancy notices were issued in the education department in Barnsley on Friday. Redundancies will occur because Barnsley will have to lose about 200&nbsp;posts as a consequence of what the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) called an annual ritual. We face cuts and redundancies under our local government settlement, as we did in the bad old days of the previous Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_310">May I put forward a suggestion that has been made by the metropolitan authorities to try to resolve the damping situation in social services? It is proposed that an additional &#163;305&nbsp;million will be provided in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and &#163;508&nbsp;million in 2007&#150;08. Could &#163;100&nbsp;million of the 2007&#150;08&nbsp;settlement be brought forward to alleviate the effects of damping in the 2006&#150;07&nbsp;financial year? That would reduce the impact of the situation on social services and address the problems of four London authorities, 41&nbsp;metropolitan districts, 22&nbsp;county councils and 18&nbsp;unitary authorities? A total of 85&nbsp;authorities could benefit if &#163;100&nbsp;million were brought forward, and that would give them time to plan for the shortfall.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_311">As I pointed out, my local authority is once again facing cuts to services. We cannot find the funding to provide the services that are required of us with the grant that is being put forward, so we have to look at cuts, which is why redundancy notices are being served as I speak. In line with the representations that the Minister has received from the metropolitan authorities, will he remove the social services damping to some extent, fund the cost of the overall floors, implement a form of funding to take account of the effects of population decline and put in place a funding mechanism to compensate for the lack of revaluation?

<p><a name="st_267"><a name="60206-34_spnew0"><b> Mr. David Curry  (Skipton and Ripon) (Con):</b> 
 There is always a familiarity to these debates. The Minister stands up like the captain on the bridge scanning the horizon saying, &quot;Well, the weather&#039;s absolutely fine and the horizon&#039;s quite clear. There might be a very slight swell, but no one need feel the slightest bit seasick.&quot; At the same time, down in the engine room, the chief engineer is saying that a horrible clanking noise is coming from the engines, and soon smoke begins to appear. The two views of the settlement are totally dislocated. We have just heard the view from the engine room&#151;the northern metropolitan authorities&#151;from the hon. Members for Wigan (Mr. Turner) and for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley). They said that there are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 689</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>real difficulties with the settlement and they are the ones who have got it right. Despite the undoubted passion with which the Minister made his speech, he is simply looking at the horizon through opaque spectacles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_312">Three things are noteworthy about this settlement. First, education spending has now become totally divorced from the rest of local government expenditure. It is distributed by a different Department and according to an entirely different formula; indeed, in many ways it is the opposite formula to the one used by local government. The formula rejected by local government has now been adopted by the Department for Education and Skills, so we are back to the dear old happiness of joined-up government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_313">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has lost a huge chunk of its empire. I never cease to be amazed when I hear Labour Back Benchers chuntering about how the education White Paper has got it all wrong, and local authorities need a much greater, enhanced role supervising the way that education operates. At the same time, they have simply watched the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s authority in this matter draining away. They are rather late in closing that stable door.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_314">The second point about the settlement is that, in fact, schools do rather well, even though the Government have resorted to rather a crude method of buying off the argument because the events of 2003&#150;04&#151;you will remember, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that some local authorities were not given sufficient additional grant in total to fund the increases that they were supposed to give to education&#151;are burned into their consciousness.
</p>





<p><a name="st_268"><a name="60206-34_spnew1"><b> Michael Jabez Foster </b> 
: Has the right hon. Gentleman made any assessment of what the situation would be if the Conservatives had won and given local government a zero increase in real terms?
</p>





<p><a name="st_269"><a name="60206-34_spnew2"><b> Mr. Curry: </b> 
 I know that the hon. Gentleman is under pressure, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) pointed out from the Front Bench, we are quite a long way into a Labour Government. The formula has been changed about five times already. This is a Government who said that they were going to find a completely new way round local authority funding, and all they are doing at the moment is sitting there waiting for the Lyons report to come in, rather like Polynesian natives waiting for the cargo boat to arrive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_315">Because education has done quite well, the rest of local government has done quite badly&#151;we have to be honest about that. There are tough measures for social services, highways, waste and amenities, and that is accounting for the smoke and mirrors of the Gershon review. Curiously enough, the name &quot;Gershon&quot; did not pass the Minister&#039;s lips this evening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_316">The third point, which in many ways is the most important of all, is that, on any reading of the Chancellor&#039;s expenditure plans, the future looks pretty tough for all areas other than his three, or two and a half, chosen special areas of health, education and overseas development. After the public expenditure boom, we are now heading for the bust. That means, inevitably, council tax will become much more acute as an issue, rather than less important.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 690</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_317">What has been happening? We now have two settlements. In fact, if one counts the police settlement separately, we have three. There is the revenue support grant and the dedicated schools grant, which flows from that debacle in 2003&#150;04. The schools grant rises by 6.4&nbsp;per cent. in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;per cent. the following year, and the grant for other council services rises by about 3&nbsp;per cent. The schools money is based on existing expenditure&#151;just 5&nbsp;per cent. and a tiny bit more for London&#151;plus an allocation by formula.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_318">What is interesting is that the Deputy Prime Minister has derided notional spending assessments, such as the standard spending assessments, because they are misused and people dare to extrapolate the level of council tax. Heaven forbid that we should dare to extrapolate by how much the Government might require councils to increase their tax. All those have been dropped, but nobody has passed the message down the road to the Department for Education and Skills. Local authorities whose spending was below the schools&#039; formula spending share will now get extra grant to enable them to move towards it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_319">I suggest, if I may, that Ministers look back&#151;I know that they constantly do so; the Minister for Local Government is always looking back&#151;to see how their predecessors used to fulminate against need assessment. Lord Hattersley is a wonderful example of the fulmination against need assessment. Believe it or not, need assessment is now enthroned as the basic principle of local authority funding. But that has brought about what I regard as happy ironies. In 2003&#150;04, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar will remember, the Government were accused of manipulating the system to direct money towards their friends in the north. The fact is that because population has emerged as one of the few remaining quantitative elements in the determination of the grant, money is now moving back down from the friends in the north. The Minister, for once, is right for the wrong reasons: this is not manipulation in favour of Labour councils; in many ways, Labour councils will feel the pinch of this settlement rather more than other councils. All I can say is that that is ironic, and that it is nice to see the chickens coming home to roost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_320">We now have a system with so many floors, ceilings and damping mechanisms that the whole thing looks rather like the design for the house of horrors in Hitchcock&#039;s &quot;Psycho&quot;, and the Minister was rather like the corpse in the cellar, judging by the passion and enthusiasm that he put into his speech this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_321">Where are we heading in the long term? The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that the pre-Budget statement indicates a real increase in public expenditure between 2007&#150;08&nbsp;and 2010&#150;11&nbsp;of just 1.8&nbsp;per cent. Once the Chancellor has made provision for his favoured services&#151;health, education and international development&#151;all the other services will have to fight over an increase of about 0.8&nbsp;per cent. a year. That will include the bulk of the services that now fall under the revenue support grant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_322">That means that council tax bills will rise, to the extent that they are permitted to do so under the capping procedures, and that there will be cuts in services. It is no good the Minister simply asserting blandly that there is no reason for anyone to cut anything. We all know that the inflation that affects local government services 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 691</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is entirely different from the broad, RPI-type of inflation, because so many local government services are demand led. So this will hit the services which, by their very nature, find it hardest to marshal a lobby. Social services tend to be fragmented because they involve a host of relatively small-scale support services for families, carers, elderly people and children, for which demography and social change are fuelling increases in demand. They will feel the pain, together with the smaller services that bear crucially on people&#039;s quality of life in their immediate environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_323">Of course a two-year settlement is welcome, because if councils can have nothing else, at least they can have a certain amount of predictability of their own misery. That will give them some assistance. No doubt, in two years we shall have reached the Chancellor&#039;s next cycle of public expenditure, for whose review letters are now dropping into the postbags of the various Secretaries of State. Perhaps we shall also have received the long-delayed, much-deferred and much-hoped-for Lyons review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_324">The Government talk incessantly about joined-up thinking, yet it is amazing how dislocated the whole process of the grant has become across the public services. Their motto seems to be: &quot;Keep your heads down, chaps, and hope&quot;. The Minister made a speech today that put that into language, the poetry of which has entirely overwhelmed me. Local government is going to face some very difficult times.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_325">This is an inevitable settlement; there is no point in pretending that the Government are going to dish out a great deal more money. We all know that the chickens have come home to roost in regard to public expenditure. Local government had better batten down the hatches and prepare for some years of this, and council tax payers had better prepare themselves for council tax increases to go on rising steadily, because we are locked into this syndrome and there is no escape from it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_326">The Government must regret some of the wonderful promises that they made in their early years about how they were going to introduce an entirely new structure in local government funding. It was as though they were just waiting to discover the north-west passage. As I have said before, we shall discover, unless Lyons proves to be a remarkably efficient icebreaker, that there is no such thing as a north-west passage in local government finance and that, for the time being, we are stuck with this.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry). He has some knowledge of these issues, and I recall that he was one of the better Conservative Ministers for local government. However, what he has just said has demonstrated that, while Ministers and Governments may change, the civil service trundles on, and what he said about inflation was astounding in its audacity. I remember him and other Ministers standing at the Dispatch Box saying exactly what our Minister has said today, reading from exactly the same script. They said that local government had 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 692</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>had a bigger-than-inflation increase and that there should therefore be no problem. I have been hearing that speech for the past 20&nbsp;years, and it has not changed.

 I accept what my hon. Friend has said, and also what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner). At least local government settlements have gone the other way since 1997, and authorities have benefited from some improvements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_327">My hon. Friend the Member for Wigan also spoke of inequalities in the system, and those are what concern us in the north-east. The system is based on a flawed formula: we know that, because the Government commissioned the Lyons report in an attempt to come up with a different system and a new formula. The north-east continues to come out worst whenever a settlement is announced. This year the Minister has announced an average settlement of 3&nbsp;per cent.; the average settlement in the north-east is 2.7&nbsp;per cent. Along with that, we have to compete with our next-door neighbours in Scotland, who benefit from the Barnett formula. It is somewhat ironic that the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland produced a report today showing that the north-east of England is at the bottom of the league according to a series of key social indicators, while in most instances Scotland is above the average.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_328">The Minister has announced a 3&nbsp;to 3.5&nbsp;per cent. increase, but Gateshead in the north-east has ended up with 2.5&nbsp;per cent., even less than the north-east average&#151;although according to all the indicators it needs support from central Government, and although it is a beacon council that the Government constantly cite as an example of good local government. Westminster, with all its high-value properties and high incomes and all the advantages of the lucrative business that surrounds it, has received an increase of 2.9&nbsp;per cent., which is set to rise to 4.6&nbsp;per cent. next year. Gateshead&#039;s increase is set to rise to only 2.7&nbsp;per cent. How can that possibly be equitable or right?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_329">Ministers have tried to resolve some of the problems. They have made adjustments in an attempt to iron out some of the anomalies. As the settlement demonstrates, however, the inequities have not been removed. I believe that that is because Ministers have found the system to be so skewed that ironing out the unfairnesses in one fell swoop would require a huge shift of resources from authorities that were favoured under Tory Governments in the past, with all the political consequences that would ensue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_330">Ministers have therefore introduced what my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan describes as damping. The aim was to avoid the political fallout, but it also means that the full benefits of a fairer system, and of the changes that Governments have made, are not passed on to the local authorities that need them most. It is estimated that that has cost metropolitan authorities &#163;250&nbsp;million in social services funding alone, and a further &#163;180&nbsp;million has been lost to metropolitan education services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_331">Those inequalities have been further aggravated by a new factor in the formula: households with residents aged over 90. Unfortunately, the north-east is very low 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 693</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>down in the league when it comes to health inequalities, and few of our households contain residents over the age of 90. We therefore cannot benefit from that change in the grant, but our old people still need support. Indeed, they may need even more support because of the health equalities to which I have referred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_332">Young people are also affected. After all that the Government have said about &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;, how can it be right for councils in London to receive up to three times more for each child than those in the north-east? What possible justification can there be for that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_333">The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon mentioned the population issue. It is a key factor in grant distribution, but it too can work to the disadvantage of the areas in greatest need. If half the people move out of a street, we do not see half the paving stones being removed or half the street lights being turned off. The same services must be provided, even if the population has been halved. Falling populations are tied too closely to the allocation of resources, and too little consideration is given to the continuing need for services even when a population is in decline. Indeed, the need may be greater in such circumstances: it is often the economically active and the skilled workers who depart, leaving behind vulnerable people who require even more support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_334">The projected figures show that the population in the north-east is actually rising by 2,000&nbsp;a year, but according to figures from the Office for National Statistics&#151;as was acknowledged earlier, they are incorrect&#151;the population is falling. So as a result of the population factor, we are suffering yet again in terms of grant allocation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_335">The other issue, which I am afraid the Government have ducked, is revaluation. Revaluation is important in an area such as mine. Ministers often talk about the difficulties of being in government&#151;about how being in government is about making tough decisions and not being afraid to make unpopular decisions&#151;but they backed away from revaluation only too quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_336">The Minister mentioned the free bus travel scheme that is due to be introduced in April&#151;an issue that I have raised in the House several times. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a &#163;350&nbsp;million fund to pay for the scheme and, by all accounts, that should be enough money to finance a free bus fare system across the country. However, some genius decided that the money should be distributed through the revenue support grant system, which is in no way related to the specific issue of the concessionary fare-travelling public. I do not know which civil servant made the suggestion or which Minister took that advice, but both should be surplus to requirements. The result was that this issue got lost in the system, and areas such as Tyne and Wear, where the population is relatively low but the use of public transport and concessionary travel is relatively high, therefore lost out. However, areas with greater car ownership&#151;where more people travel by car and fewer travel by public transport&#151;got more money than they need to run free bus services. Tyne and Wear ended up with &#163;7.5&nbsp;million less than it needs to run the scheme.

<a name="stpa_337">I have raised this issue with the Minister in the past few months and, to be fair to him, he has listened carefully and done the best that he can to resolve it; however, it has not been resolved. He referred earlier to the extra &#163;1.7&nbsp;million that Tyne and Wear has been allocated by the Department for Transport, which will help to provide free fares on the metro light rail system. We cannot have free fares on buses and not on the metro, because if we did, the metro would suffer a loss as a result of people switching to the buses. Secondly, a lot of people, particularly in the east end of Newcastle, rely on the metro rather than the buses, so it would be unfair to them if they had to pay and others did not; the situation has to be equal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_338">Funding free travel on the metro cost &#163;1.7&nbsp;million, but we are still more than &#163;5&nbsp;million short of the money needed to run the free bus service. That means that at next Wednesday&#039;s budget meeting, the passenger transport authority will have to cut concessionary fares for young people generally, and specifically concessionary fares for those attending college. I have been a Member of this House for 20&nbsp;years and a public representative for some 34&nbsp;years. I do not know how many advice surgeries I have run in that time, but it is certainly a lot. Last Saturday, for the first time ever, at two separate advice surgeries two completely different representations were made on the same issue by people who were completely unconnected. They were pensioners, and they told me that they did not want something that the Government were going to provide: they did not want free bus travel in Tyne and Wear to be provided at the expense of concessionary fares for young people. However, this is what we are having to do because the Government have failed to resolve this issue.

<a name="60206-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_339">I appreciate what the Minister said about the legal problems that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister faces in trying to dish out money to different local authorities. I said some time ago that if Ministers cannot resolve this issue, we will ask the Prime Minister to do so. He has responsibility across the whole of government, and not just for one Department. But I am now told that I cannot speak to the Prime Minister because discussions are ongoing. Well, I hope that the Minister can resolve this issue, because so far as I am aware, discussions that might resolve it are not in fact ongoing. The ODPM has given us the definite answer that no further money will be forthcoming. The problem therefore remains, so I hope that the Minister will unblock the situation and allow us to have our meeting with the Prime Minister.

<p>
<a name="60206-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_342">The Minister, as ever&#151;although it is not a failing restricted to this Government&#151;described the figures as a tremendous increase, while ignoring the fact that, as has already been pointed out, education has been removed. He also ignored the fact that the percentage is based on the change that was introduced with the FSS&#151;the formula spending share. To be parochial, that change meant that Surrey county council lost &#163;39&nbsp;million year on year. So any percentage increase dates back to that loss, and I suspect that some of the officials who guide the Minister on such matters are very aware of that, because they live in Surrey.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_343">The changes were so dramatic that the Government had to introduce floors and ceilings as buffers. The ceilings have gone, but the chop for those well above the floor is dramatic. It affects those well above the floor in order to raise others to the floor. The new system coincides with the dedicated schools grant, which removes education funding from the normal grant. The new grant system, as I pointed out earlier, is extraordinarily complex, and needs a brain capable of rocket science to manage it. It is impenetrable. The Minister is giving me looks of surprise, but even if he has the intellect to handle it, what I am saying will be no surprise to anyone else who has tried to struggle with it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_344">Surrey county council&#039;s formula grant was drastically reduced on the introduction of the FSS, to &#163;101.4&nbsp;million. Without the buffers it would have been reduced to &#163;65.1&nbsp;million&#151;a potential reduction of 39&nbsp;per cent. Fortunately, the Government have recognised that such a cut would be a tad too far, so they have introduced the buffers and the actual grant will be &#163;103.4&nbsp;million. However, because of the requirements built in by the Government for the minute-by-minute handling of local government such as inspections and comparative performance assessments, the limiting of the council tax rise for the coming year to 5&nbsp;per cent., and the possible lowering of the floor in future years, Surrey county council will have to introduce some &#163;50&nbsp;million of cuts over the next two or three years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_345">I accept that many local authorities can make efficiency savings, and I hope that most of Surrey county council&#039;s savings will come from such a source. However, given the size of the cut, it cannot all be found from efficiency savings. Constituency letters about the potential impact of the cuts are already pouring in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_346">When I was a Minister dealing with these issues comparisons were always thrown at us, and I wish to pick up an example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles). He mentioned that Labour-run Lancashire county council would have to make cuts in the next financial year. However, Conservative Surrey has a grant per head of population of &#163;95.85&nbsp;and Lancashire has a grant per head of &#163;191.96&#151;more than twice that of Surrey.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_347">I remind the Minister of his second principle, because he should look carefully at the ability to pay. I have raised that issue already in the debate on the revaluation, and I suggested an alternative approach. The present approach is a duplication of that under the FSS, and hidden in the formula is the spread of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>properties over the council tax valuation bands. That is not a fair way of making the calculation. Surrey receives the second lowest grant of the English shire counties, yet it is the second most expensive area of England in which to provide services. To put it more simply: the value of properties is spread across the higher echelons of the bands, because they are more expensive to buy and maintain, with bigger mortgages that cost people more, so they are less able to afford the huge council taxes that are required because the grant has gone down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_348">Unusually, I am not asking the Minister to change Surrey&#039;s grant. That would be a hopeless request and a waste of my time. If the motion is put to a vote it will roll through, with Scottish MPs behind it. I am asking him to look ahead and think again about his second principle. Will he look at ability to pay&#151;I hasten to add, before there are squawks of encouragement from the Liberal Benches, that that would still be on the basis of a property tax&#151;and recognise that we need a mixture of an understanding of property values and the cost of living? The cost of living in Surrey and London is much greater than in the rest of the country, so that proposal would give a much fairer balance and might stifle the protestations about local income tax from some corners of the House.

 It is not new for East Sussex county council to whinge; it does so annually. Indeed, back in the 1970s I took part in the whingeing, although then we had some cause. In the four years to 1997, our real-terms funding was minus 7&nbsp;per cent., and that included education. There is a history&#151;and that situation occurred not long ago. Even more recently, at the general election, the Opposition offered us a zero increase in local government funding. If that had come about, we should be experiencing real problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_349">This year, East Sussex county council received an extremely good education settlement&#151;and not minus 7&nbsp;per cent., but a 2.1&nbsp;per cent. funding increase, to deal with everything else. As the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) pointed out, the council&#039;s Tory leadership suggests that the increase was only 0.6&nbsp;per cent. That is wrong. Let us at least get the facts correct: it was 2.1&nbsp;per cent., more or less in line with inflation.Given such an increase, it is shameful that the council is trying to destroy many important local government services, especially social services. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar for mentioning that the only day-care centre in Rye for older people is to be closed.

As far as the service is aware, no one has tried to take their life again. That may be luck, but the service has been vital, and its funding, too, will go completely. Furthermore, &#163;500,000&nbsp;is to be withdrawn from care for carers. The Government may have made a mistake in not ring-fencing the care grant, as they originally proposed, because the Tory council is now able to cut it, as well as funding for respite care.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Conservatism means in East Sussex. At least we have a test bed&#151;we know what Tories do when given the opportunity&#151;so that will be a lesson, despite what the new leadership suggests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_351">Such things might have been necessary if the funding had been cut, but with an inflation increase in grant and a double-inflation increase in the council tax proposed, they are simply unnecessary. None the less, is 2.1&nbsp;per cent. enough? Cuts are not necessary this year because the county council can look to balances and other funds, but I have to tell my hon. Friend the Minister that in the longer term, it would not be possible to maintain such services if an increase of 2.1&nbsp;per cent., covering inflation only, were provided.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_352">The reason is very obvious. East Sussex has a growing elderly population&#151;many people are over 85&nbsp;years of age&#151;and the formula is flawed. The Minister well knows about that because he has been gracious enough to listen to the arguments made by East Sussex county council&#151;or perhaps he did not quite hear them, but he certainly listened to them&#151;and there is certainly a need for additional funding for people over 85. That is very important, but it has not been fully taken into account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_353">Moreover, East Sussex has particular needs because of the cost of labour. We are just outside the home counties, but we compete with them for labour. My hon. Friend will say that the area cost adjustment has been spread, thus making it fairer, but it does not feel like that in East Sussex; the truth is that the current formulation of the ACA allows counties way outside the London area to benefit, and we lose out.

<p><a name="st_275"><a name="60206-36_spnew2"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 May I draw to my hon. Friend&#039;s attention something that I announced in the statement of 5&nbsp;December? During this round, the intention is to review the geography of the ACA, given the points that a number of councils made in their representations.

<p><a name="st_276"><a name="60206-36_spnew3"><b> Michael Jabez Foster: </b> 
 I should have given my hon. Friend credit for that. I said earlier that he listened but did not hear, but he obviously did hear, and I am grateful to him for indicating that there may be some hope for future years, which is, of course, what we are talking about.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-36_para12">
<a name="stpa_354">The formula also has another flaw. My hon. Friend has mentioned that the property value arrangements have changed, but it seems to me&#151;he may want to respond to this in his reply&#151;that property values are still taken into account. For example, a pensioner or postman on precisely the same income living in an expensive property in Hastings or East Sussex will have no greater income than a similar person living elsewhere, but the property value will be taken into account in determining the needs element under the formula.

 I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster), who drew on the nub of my argument, which is that it is possible to have areas of relative deprivation in places such as St. Albans, and it is hard for people in those areas to pay high council taxes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_357">St. Albans is a constituency that is stereotyped as being wealthy, but it has areas that are characterised by having poor housing, poor health outcomes and poor future prospects. We endure high housing costs. I stress &quot;endure&quot; because many young people are struggling to get on to the high housing costs ladder. As a result, we have long waiting lists for social rented housing, significant levels of homelessness and overcrowding. For many, the council tax is an enormous growing burden that they struggle to pay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_358">As we know, the council tax is divided into four categories: parish, police, district and county. The residents, however, do not see it like that. They make no distinction and just see the final figure that lands on their doormat. Since 1997, council tax bills in St. Albans have increased by 96&nbsp;per cent. A standard band D household could expect to pay &#163;634&nbsp;in 1997. The same household would now expect to pay &#163;1,242.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_359">What is the major cause of this grief? I talked to both county and district councillors, and the main holes are in their county, district and policing costs. A constant complaint is that a huge number of extra responsibilities and duties have been placed on authorities in each sector, but the funding does not reflect that. A person might ask, &quot;Do I have a profligate county council?&quot; Labour Members implied that some Conservative county councils either keep money to themselves or throw it away.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_360">Conservative-controlled Hertfordshire county council is rated as excellent. It is one of the best in the country and has received a four-star rating for the fourth successive year. Hon. Members should accept that it knows what it is talking about. Hertfordshire county council is on the grant floor, so any rise is 2&nbsp;per cent., which nowhere near reflects the costs and demands placed on its services. The leader of the Conservative county council, Robert Ellis, tells me that to keep costs down, it has doubled the efficiency savings that the Government required it to make. It is being very prudent. However, the margins are now tight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_361">Hertfordshire has pressed the Government&#151;I am sure that the Minister is aware of this&#151;for a realistic level of funding. The headline statistics make worrying 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 699</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reading. In the financial year 2006&#150;07, the formula grant is nearly &#163;150&nbsp;million&#151;an increase of just 2&nbsp;per cent. Hertfordshire is one of five authorities with the lowest increase out of 14&nbsp;other comparable shire counties that also have fire responsibilities. The average of all authorities in England is 3&nbsp;per cent. For 2007&#150;08, the formula grant is a little over &#163;151&nbsp;million&#151;an increase of 2.7&nbsp;per cent, but lagging well behind the rest of England, which will get an average of 3.8&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_362">What do those different figures mean for my constituents? I am told that with a grant floor it will be very difficult for Hertfordshire to invest in new capital projects, such as schools and transport. That comes at a time when the building schools for the future programme and local transport plans mean that there will be a high expectation of local authorities delivering significant new investment. However, Hertfordshire believes that it will have to cut key front-line services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_363">Hertfordshire has one of the highest incidences of people with learning disabilities in local authority-supported residential care. The demand for that service is one of the main reasons for the council spending above its funding limits for personal and social services. However, the calculations take no account of the relative needs of people with learning difficulties, so yet another funding expense will land on the taxpayers&#039; doorstep.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_364">The recent Buncefield disaster will have a major cost implication of &#163;2.5&nbsp;million for the authority, despite the Bellwin formula settlement. That disaster alone will equate to an extra 0.65&nbsp;per cent. increase in council tax. My district council will also have an ongoing cost as a result of Buncefield. Talking to it today, it said that it will have to monitor the water and environmental impact for years to come and there will be no additional funding. As I said, council tax bills have risen by 96&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_365">It would be easy to add fuel to this particular roaring fire because we have a Liberal Democrat-run district council. On top of all the other woes for my constituents, it felt it necessary to appoint an additional diary secretary, at &#163;33,500&nbsp;extra per annum, and a new chief executive, who we have always managed without, at an additional &#163;100,000-plus per annum. On top of that, the councillors have just awarded themselves a pay rise of 33&nbsp;per cent. I do not want to get carried away with or distracted by those figures. There are serious issues of additional Government-imposed responsibilities that are not funded adequately.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_366">One particular extra duty that the Government have placed on the district council is a higher recycling target. We all welcome the push to encourage greater recycling, and to be fair the Government have supplied capital funding to acquire new wheelie bins, public service vehicles and so on, but no extra funding has been provided to run the additional recycling rounds. That means an extra &#163;100,000&nbsp;burden. The head of finance at St. Albans district council today told me that he estimates conservatively that that will cost the council &#163;400,000&nbsp;in addition to the standard refuge collections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_367">I am also told by officers in the licensing department&#151;I have mentioned in the House before the fact that St. Albans is supposed to be one of the towns with the most licensed premises in Europe&#151;that the Licensing Act 2003&nbsp;has meant that additional staff are

<br>&nbsp;<br>needed to deal with inspections and to man a noise nuisance helpline, which the council feels obliged to run 24&nbsp;hours a day. That means an additional &#163;80,000&nbsp;net of the fee in extra costs to the council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_368">Another area of concern is the disabled facilities grant. I am told by my council that year on year it has had its contributions cut. I would welcome the Minister&#039;s response to that, but that is what I have been told. This year the council will receive a &#163;25,000&nbsp;real-terms cut. Demographics are changing. In St. Albans, more and more elderly and disabled people are staying in their own homes, and we welcome that. Rightly, the council wishes to try to help them to stay in their homes and to live valuable, long lives. However, the Government have also increased the eligibility criteria, which will come into effect from 1&nbsp;April. That will give additional responsibilities to the local council at additional costs. More people will be eligible for help. One thing that has come through is that families of disabled children will no longer be means-tested. That can be welcomed, but the effect of it and other changes is that the budget will need to rise in St. Albans from &#163;250,000&nbsp;to &#163;1&nbsp;million in 2006&#150;07. How are we to fund that? My council says that it will use the proceeds of the sale of council houses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_369">To return to the early part of my speech, I have massive lists of people and full surgeries of those who want houses in the social rented sector. Perhaps there is not the reinvestment that the Government would like, but the council is having to fund this budget deficit. Instead of money from council house sales being ploughed back into providing much needed accommodation, it will have to be diverted into building extensions and adapting housing for disabled people who qualify for grants. As more and more elderly and disabled people are living in their own homes&#151;private homes, I might add&#151;the majority of grants from the public sector will be diverted to residents, who I accept are needy, in the private sector. A rather perverse and, I would imagine, unforeseen method of wealth distribution is happening in St. Albans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_370">The Government give a per capitation figure for the eastern region to deliver disability grants, but as has been said, there are certain cost implications in certain areas. With the high cost of building and employing staff in St. Albans, that figure will not go anywhere near to covering the cost of allowing elderly and disabled people to have their homes extended to facilitate their living at home. My council is very worried, and to quote the words of one officer today:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;We have just about reached the limits of our ability to tax the public&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_371">I do not have time to address the &#163;5&nbsp;million year-on-year, real-terms deficit that my chief constable told me and other Hertfordshire MPs only last month he has had cut from his budget, or the &#163;17&nbsp;million rebranding exercise that may happen as a result of police amalgamations, which will also land on the tax payers&#039; doorstep. Needless to say, that will all add to high bills for my constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_372">My council is calling on the Minister for support for capital investment delivered through capital grants. That is exactly what it has written to him about. It wants a fairer and more transparent grant system that recognises the true cost of extra demands on services and which, more to the point, the person in the street can understand and see as reasonable and fair.

Many authorities receive two and, in some cases, three times as much grant per head as councils such as West Berkshire that do worst in the system. As if the situation were not iniquitous enough, some authorities enjoy annual increases far above those received by West Berkshire. Middlesbrough, for example, has received a 5.7&nbsp;per cent. increase; Stockton-on-Tees, 4.9&nbsp;per cent.; Hull, 4.8&nbsp;per cent.; and Hartlepool, 4.2&nbsp;per cent. West Berkshire, however, must make do with a below-inflation settlement of 2.1&nbsp;per cent. In short, a system that is already grossly unfair has been made more unfair with each passing year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_375">The predictable reaction to that unfairness from the Government is to claim that those disparities are simply a reflection of greater deprivation elsewhere, but that argument is flawed. If we use the indicator of average weekly income, the Government&#039;s own statistics show that average income in a relatively well-off area such as West Berkshire is 50&nbsp;per cent. higher than in council areas with the very lowest incomes in the country. How can that disparity justify Government grant levels 300&nbsp;per cent. higher in other areas?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_376">The change to the new funding system has hit West Berkshire and a number of other south-east councils particularly hard for another reason. For many years, West Berkshire council, along with neighbouring councils such as Wokingham, were short-changed by a system that imposed ceilings on grant levels. Although demographic trends meant that the Government calculated that West Berkshire required large increases in grant to meet service needs, those were curtailed to pay for grant increases to other councils. Last year, as hon. Members will recall, the grants ceiling was removed for one year. West Berkshire received an overall increase in grant of 11&nbsp;per cent., and it began to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 702</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>offset the years of bad settlements that it had previously received. A year later, under the new system, West Berkshire is no longer at or, indeed, above the grant ceiling, but is on the floor, with a below-inflation increase in its non-schools grant of 2.1&nbsp;per cent. How can a council be assessed as requiring a massive increase in grant one year, but receive a grant below inflation the next?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_377">I try not to be cynical, but one can understand why people ask if it is more than a coincidence that the funding system has been changed just as it was finally about to start to address long-term inequalities in funding for some authorities in the south-east, where the Labour party has virtually no presence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_378">There is a final aspect to the changes in this year&#039;s funding system that should not go unnoticed. We live in the world of the relative needs formula. The effect of this change is to render an already complex and opaque system virtually unintelligible. That is helpful, if the system is designed to move resources from one area to another without any genuine justification or accountability. Despite half-hearted Government protestations to the contrary, the old system of formula spending share effectively set out what the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister thought local councils should spend in cash terms on various services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_379">Not surprisingly, the old system produced some uncomfortable statistics for the Government. The last set of figures for social services FSS in 2005&#150;06, updated for the last time in this year&#039;s release of information, showed that West Berkshire came 146th out of 150&nbsp;authorities in the amount of funding the Government expected it to spend on social services per head. Effectively, the Government expected West Berkshire to provide social services by spending just &#163;197&nbsp;per head of population, compared with up to three times that sum in other councils.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_380">Clearly, that was always nonsense, brought about by the inequity of the funding system. West Berkshire has the same demographic pressures as other councils, with an ageing population, increased cases of dementia, and so on. The needs and unit costs of social services clients are not radically different because they live in West Berkshire rather than in inner-London or places further north. Why should services to some of the most vulnerable people in our society be underfunded by the Government simply because those people happen to live in an area which, by Government calculations, is moderately better off than other areas?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_381">The truth is that an elderly or disabled person in need of social services provision living in Newbury has just the same requirements as someone in a similar condition living in Newcastle, but the Government believe that my constituent is only a third as important as somebody living in another area. Unsurprisingly, the new system of relative needs formula provides no monetary statistics. The Government say that is because the old system was misrepresented, but it is precisely because the old system exposed such unfairnesses that it has been changed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_382">There are two other areas that are worthy of consideration in such a debate. First, West Berkshire receives back far less in business rates than it contributes. That is another example showing how resources are shifted surreptitiously from one area to another. It is not a system that is understood by the

</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_383">I hear a scoff from the Liberal Democrat Benches. The Liberal Democrats controlled that local authority, and they were happy to see the people of West Berkshire caught in a pincer movement between a Government who fiddled the funding and imposed the Chancellor&#039;s savage stealth taxes on them, and a Liberal Democrat authority that ramped up council tax year on year to pay for ridiculous spending and pet&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I certainly blame both, because I had to live under them for too many years. I am happy for the Liberal Democrats to see our figures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_384">The people of West Berkshire have now elected a Conservative administration which, despite the appalling settlement that it has received, has identified pensioner poverty as a major problem that is being exacerbated by council tax. The administration wants to keep council tax down. It has recognised the effect of council tax on young families as well. It has managed to achieve a record settlement, even in the climate that the Government have created. I am enormously proud of the Conservative administration running West Berkshire council. It is doing its best to provide quality services within a system of Government grant that is unaccountable, whose logic is untenable and which creates a disparity of funding that is totally unfair.

<p><a name="st_281"><a name="60206-38_spnew3"><b> David Howarth  (Cambridge) (LD):</b> 
 I want to raise two topics with the Minister: first, the supporting people programme, the grant for which has fallen by 1.7&nbsp;per cent. nationally; and secondly, the transparency and rationality of the grant formula.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_385">As the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) said, the supporting people programme is admirable. Its aim is to help people to live independent lives at home. They include those who have been homeless and rough sleepers, ex-offenders, people with disabilities, people at risk of domestic violence and people with drug and alcohol problems, as well as several other vulnerable groups such as Travellers and people with HIV and AIDS. The programme provides funds in order to, for example, help people to access their correct benefit, ensure that they have the right life skills to maintain tenancies and provide advice on home security. Finding a place for someone to live is often not enough: unless they are given help in maintaining a new and stable lifestyle, they may be in danger of slipping back into their former lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_386">The problem is that funding for the supporting people programme was cut last year, is being cut this year and looks as though it will be cut again next year. The origins of the cuts lie in the Treasury&#039;s belief that the programme is too expensive. However, the cost to the public purse, through the health service, the criminal justice system and the benefits system, of failing to reintegrate vulnerable people is also very high.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_387">I understand that the Government are consulting about the future of the supporting people programme, and I hope that they will decide to give it the funding 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 704</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that it deserves. I have two comments for Ministers to consider in the course of that consultation. First, as the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner), said, there is an interaction with health spending. That is particularly true of mental health spending. There is a serious problem with the provision of mental health services in many areas. In my own constituency, cuts of 13&nbsp;per cent. in mental health funding have been proposed. Some of those cuts&#151;to day centres, for example&#151;affect precisely the same people as cuts to the supporting people programme. All I ask is that the Department of Health and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister work together to ensure that these most vulnerable people are not hit twice by separate Government policies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para15">
<a name="stpa_388">Secondly, there is an interaction with spending on homelessness. I note from the figures before us that the special grant for tackling homelessness is rising just as the special grant for the supporting people programme is falling. That rise is welcome in itself, but Ministers should remember that the homeless are among the most important of the groups that are helped by the supporting people programme. I would like an assurance from the Government that they are not merely shifting resources around from long-term help in supporting people to short-term help for the homeless. The supporting people programme is a crucial part of dealing with homelessness. The policy of moving people through gradations of housing until they are able fully to support themselves is absolutely right, but it will not work unless people are helped to stabilise their lives. Emergency services for the homeless usually win more headlines, but long-term success depends on such programmes, and they need to be maintained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para16">
<a name="stpa_389">The other issue that I want to raise is that of the lack of transparency in the system of calculating grants for local authorities. In December, the Minister said that the settlement was purely cash based and did not involve any assumed council tax levels for each authority, as in the past. That caused much amusement in local authority circles. No system for the allocation of grant to local government can be purely cash based, because all systems start with the national control total and work backwards. The formula is a way of distributing a fixed budget. Anything else would cause chaos in central Government finances. If one proceeds as the Government have, all that one does to get the figures to add up is to introduce a bit of trial and error by running the formula repeatedly, using slightly different figures, until the right totals appear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para17">
<a name="stpa_390">The Government&#039;s purpose in shifting to the new system appears to be purely to avoid having to publish the assumed council tax figures for each local authority. They complained that the figures were misunderstood and that local authorities were using them for inappropriate purposes. The Minister mentioned standard spending assessments, which were misused. That is true but they were mainly misused by central Government. The SSA constituted a method of working out the share of the national total but it was used to criticise local government for spending too much or too little.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-38_para18">
<a name="stpa_391">It was the other way around with assumed council tax. The assumptions were understood only too well and the Government appeared desperate to disguise them. To do that, they produced a system that is, according to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 705</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, more complex and much less transparent than the previous system. However, it is not clear that the Government have even succeeded in hiding their assumptions about council tax amounts and the way in which they calculated the figures. Finance officers in councils throughout the country are busy working out what the Government&#039;s assumed council tax for their council must have been.

 They would anyway.
</p>





<p><a name="st_283"><a name="60206-39_spnew1"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 Yes, but there is a question of wasting their time. The attempt to hide the assumed council tax in relative shares of spending does not work because the Government ultimately have to publish absolute figures for the total grant and a specific negative amount to represent the total national council tax base. That means that it should be possible to reverse-engineer the formula to return to the assumed council tax levels. The Government should save people the time and effort of working that out and simply publish the figures, which they used to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_392">The other, perhaps more serious, problem with the formulae as they are currently presented is that they mix technical assessments with political judgments. Whether a formula successfully predicts the amount of need for a specific service or the cost of providing it in different areas is a technical matter&#151;a sort of exercise in amateur sociology and economics that can be checked against the research. However, the balance of funding between different blocks&#151;hidden in the &quot;basic amounts&quot; in the formula&#151;and, I suspect, different sorts of council, is a political decision. The Minister is right to say that there is no bias in different regions except accidentally at the end, but I stress that the decisions about the balance of funding between different sorts of council are political.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_393">I believe that we should be considering two reports, not one. There should be a technical report that provides evidence for a specific way of predicting need and cost, and a political report that gives the Government&#039;s reasons for opting to support particular services and sorts of council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_394">A Government who even suppressed the assumed council tax level are unlikely to want more openness in the rest of their activities in that field. However, a Government who were committed to a clear and open debate about their priorities would welcome openness.

As the Minister knows, when the national census was conducted, 20,000&nbsp;people in Southend were left off it. That means funding for 20,000&nbsp;fewer people.

Within my local authority there is, unfortunately, a need to close down an industrial organization that has given jobs to 85&nbsp;disabled members of the community. There has also been the acceleration of closures of old people&#039;s homes. The Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) raised the issue of affordability. That is an important issue, especially within the context of London.

The neighbouring constituency of Croydon, North is within the bottom 30. Careful consideration must be given to the allocation of moneys to constituencies in outer London, which are showing great signs of a decline in the quality of public infrastructure. That is recognized by the Mayor of London.

<a name="60206-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_403">Briefly, I pay tribute to the London borough of Sutton, which is controlled by the Liberal Democrats. There is a desire there to work on a cross-party basis to lobby on behalf of that borough&#039;s interests. The approach taken was a great success for the borough in terms of achieving its position in the area cost adjustment in falling within a west London council definition. Unfortunately, the London borough of Croydon has not fallen within that process. If I had some criticism of the Labour authority in Croydon, it would be its unwillingness to operate in a bipartisan approach to the Minister that involves both the Labour and Conservative parties. That is both before my election to the House and afterwards.

<a name="stpa_404">I suppose that, on a party political point, that will not be a problem for me after the coming local elections. However, it is important to take a constructive approach. When it comes to area cost adjustment in terms of west London councils on the provision of education, children&#039;s services and other elements within cost adjustment, we find that the boroughs are being funded at a rate of 6&nbsp;per cent. higher than other boroughs within outer London. It strikes me that that is an unjustifiable effect of the operation of the ACA within the funding formula.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_405">Overall, it will have cost Croydon council &#163;40&nbsp;million relatively in funding over the three-year fixed period that has been locked in by the Government. There seems also to be a contradiction in funding within London on

<p>
<a name="60206-39_para14">
<a name="stpa_406">I concede that there have been problems within Croydon, given its fascination for council tax referendums that allowed the opportunity for increases of 2&nbsp;and 3&nbsp;per cent. in the run-up to the previous local elections. Obviously, that led to a great deal of trouble for the local authority in increasing its council tax by 27&nbsp;per cent. immediately after the local council elections. Unfortunately, that will operate as a distinct handicap for the Labour party in trying to retain control of Croydon council at the upcoming elections. The residents of Croydon will easily remember 27&nbsp;per cent.

Many of the wards within Croydon have the highest populations of black and ethnic minority communities, and it is important that we serve those communities.

Boroughs such as the London borough of Croydon require greater equality of treatment. The director of finance of the London borough of Croydon recently said that we operated within an ACA that put us in a valley of payments, or low point, compared with neighbouring Bromley and Sutton.

<a name="stpa_409">Serious consideration should be given to the real dynamic changes that are taking place in Croydon&#039;s population. As many other hon. Members said, especially the hon.

That problem applies especially to the London borough of Croydon because its northern parts and some areas of Croydon, Central, which I represent, have many facets and styles that are similar to those of inner-London areas.

May I re-emphasise the fact that the changes that we have made in the settlement take account of future projections, as well as historical changes, to take on board points made by hon. Members on both sides of the House during the consultation and recent meetings?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-40_para3">
<a name="stpa_414">The hon. Member for Southend, West said that his council was implementing cuts of &#163;11&nbsp;million. I wonder why Opposition Members have such short memories. A cut is a reduction in the cash available to spend on services; a cash reduction or a reduction after inflation, if one wants to define it like that. A cut is not a smaller increase than was hoped for. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Opposition Members, who are incredulous at that point, need to get back to the days when they were a party of sound finances. It is not credible to stand before the electorate in May, in the context of increased grants from the Government year on year, over 10&nbsp;years, and complain about cuts. That is just not tenable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-40_para4">
<a name="stpa_415">That is not to say, as I said in my opening remarks, that the Government have not recognised that there are pressures on councils, particularly as a result of an increasing elderly population, increases in the costs of waste recycling and increases in other areas, above the net new burdens identified by the Local Government Association and ourselves, which were provided for in this settlement. Opposition Members cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that the reductions in services in some specific areas of council expenditure are due to this settlement; they are not, and it is not credible for them to argue that point.

<p><a name="st_293"><a name="60206-40_spnew1"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 Surely the hon. Gentleman has something better to offer us than &quot;Yah boo sucks&quot;. Surely he recognises the growing pressures and burdens 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 710</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on local authorities. Things are closing down from Rye to Rugby. Things are closing down from Lancaster to Surrey. Things that were funded last year are not being funded. Is it all just a conspiracy to make the hon. Gentleman look bad?
</p>





<p><a name="st_294"><a name="60206-40_spnew2"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 With respect, the hon. Gentleman repeats the mistake that I just warned him against. I am more than happy that he carries on doing so. He needs to listen to his own electorate. They will not put up with what they see as public sector profligacy. This Government have provided above-inflation increases and investment in local government for 10&nbsp;years. That is a fact that he cannot deny, and no amount of Central Office press releases will change that. It is also the case that the Local Government Association, very responsibly led by a distinguished ex-council leader in Sir Sandy Bruce-Lockhart&#151;not a Labour member, but a Conservative councillor speaking on behalf of all councils&#151;entered into a process with the Government to identify any net new burdens. We did that, and we reached agreement on it. We also identified pressures on local councils over and above inflation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-40_para5">
<a name="stpa_416">There are two points that the House has to recognise. The first is that those pressures exist for central Government as well. They do not stop at the county border. The pressures from the increased elderly population, the demands on health and other services, exist for central Government, and it is incumbent on us to ensure that resources are fairly distributed and that budgets balance. One cannot then say that the pressures on councils are the fault of the settlement; they are not. Where there are real pressures, and we have acknowledged them, it is because of the real world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-40_para6">
<a name="stpa_417">If the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene again, I will allow him to do so briefly because I will be fascinated to hear what he has to say. My second point is that if local government wishes to be a partner in governance of this country, it has to accept its responsibility in balancing budgets. It is to no one&#039;s gain for it to say, month after month, year after year, in the context of a 79&nbsp;per cent. real terms increase in council expenditure, that the Government should provide more; from where?
</p>





<p><a name="st_295"><a name="60206-40_spnew3"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 Given the nearly 80&nbsp;per cent. increase in council tax, how can the hon. Gentleman lecture anyone about profligacy when his own Department has wasted &#163;168&nbsp;million on consultants and when the level of financial competence in the Department is a disgrace? If the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister cannot run itself, how can the Minister possibly lecture others?
</p>





<p><a name="st_296"><a name="60206-40_spnew4"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I would make two points in response to that intervention, which notably failed to answer the challenge that I put to the hon. Gentleman. My first point in response to his allegations is that, when he sees the figures on the Gershon efficiency savings, he will find that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s Department is leading the field, along with the Department of Health, in that regard. Secondly, I challenge him again to tell the House what his policy is. If he is saying that a 79&nbsp;per cent. above-inflation increase in grant is insufficient, and that he does not wish to see above-inflation increases in council tax, what is his 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 711</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>policy? The fact is that there is no policy on offer from the hon. Gentleman, unlike the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather), who has an alternative.

<p><a name="st_297"><a name="60206-40_spnew5"><b> Dr. Iddon: </b> 
 Is not the policy of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) quite clear? He mentioned it earlier when he was whingeing about the dedicated schools&#039; budget. That is where the money would come from, as it always has when the Conservatives have been in power.
</p>





<p><a name="st_298"><a name="60206-40_spnew6"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a valid point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-40_para7">
<a name="stpa_418">The hon. Member for Brent, East once again blamed the system for the increases in council tax. She acknowledged the increase in grant, but criticised the increases in council tax and blamed the balance of funding for the problems. The problems faced by councils&#151;hers in particular; I have met a delegation from her council&#151;are to do with the real-world pressures of an increased elderly population, increased costs of waste disposal and recycling, and increased costs as a result of other demographic changes. Those pressures cannot be wished away by a change in the formula or in the balance of funding. They can be, and are being, addressed by a strategy, agreed in conjunction with the Local Government Association, of addressing those underlying causes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-40_para8">
<a name="stpa_419">Both the Opposition parties argue that Her Majesty&#039;s Government should recognise a separate level of inflation for local councils, over and above the level for central Government expenditure. That is not a tenable policy; it is economically illiterate. Were we to adopt an inflation level for local government that recognised the demands placed on local government, it would become a self-fulfilling prophecy, and people would be back again next year arguing for even more money. The public would, quite rightly, not accept that.

<p><a name="st_299"><a name="60206-40_spnew7"><b> Mark Hunter  (Cheadle) (LD):</b> 
 Will the Minister reflect on his use of the word &quot;profligacy&quot; in relation to local government? Is that really his view?

If he does think that his use of the word was valid, will he tell us which services currently provided by councils should no longer be provided?

I am grateful for the positive way in which they raised those issues. It confirms the falsehood of the accusation that this is a new distribution formula heavily biased towards Labour areas. No doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan sees some irony in that, but I am grateful to him for acknowledging that he has some sympathy for the floor as a policy. The floor relating to non-schools expenditure on education authorities provides the protection that he wants. Authorities such as his and mine would have been in severe difficulties without the double floor applying to the formula spend element and the overall grant.

Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) presented&#151;as he often does&#151;the argument against the full resource equalisation in the settlement. My hon.

<p><a name="st_307"><a name="60206-41_spnew2"><b> Natascha Engel  (North-East Derbyshire) (Lab):</b> 
 I submitted my request for an Adjournment debate on swimming facilities for disabled people in order to highlight a specific issue: the imminent closure of a swimming pool in Chesterfield, which will leave many people who live in Staveley, in my constituency, without anywhere to swim. But the campaign to keep Middlecroft leisure centre open seems to have touched on issues that go way beyond the local. To put the Minister in the picture, Liberal Democrat-led Chesterfield borough council has announced that it will close Middlecroft swimming baths at the end of this May. They will be replaced by a fitness centre a couple of miles down the road&#151;a centre that has no swimming facilities. The council is talking about providing a new swimming pool in the area, but there are no definite plans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-41_para7">
<a name="stpa_427">The fact is that Middlecroft will lose its pool and residents will have nowhere to swim. Those residents&#151;angry parents and anxious elderly and disabled swimmers&#151;have formed the Middlecroft leisure centre action group. Their slogan&#151;&quot;You can&#039;t learn to swim in a gym&quot;&#151;reflects the fact that in a rural area and a coalfield community such as ours, the nearest swimming pool is many miles away and in practice is not accessible, especially for those who do not have a car. The national curriculum now specifies that all children should be able to swim 25&nbsp;m by the age of 11, so this closure will put a huge burden on Derbyshire county council, which will have to bus children from school to swimming pool and back again. That time could better be spent learning to swim, and that money could better be spent on sport or education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-41_para8">
<a name="stpa_428">However, the real reason that I asked for this debate is the plight of the Spireoaks swimming club for disabled swimmers, which is based at the Middlecroft swimming baths. Spireoaks is not huge. It has some 20&nbsp;members with a wide range of disabilities&#151;from cerebral palsy, autism and Down&#039;s syndrome to epilepsy. It is run by the incredibly dedicated and determined husband-and-wife team of Dorothy and Brian Wibberley. They set up at Middlecroft more than 11&nbsp;years ago and have enjoyed success after success. Most recently, 16-year-old Tom Harrison, who has a brain injury, won bronze at the &quot;Double Dutch&quot; open championships in Holland. Dorothy and Brian were delighted when they heard that the 2012&nbsp;Olympics and Paralympics are to come to the UK. The club planned to have at least one Paralympic medal winner from Middlecroft and Staveley.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-41_para9">
<a name="stpa_429">Despite Dorothy and Brian&#039;s 11&nbsp;years of service, Chesterfield borough council did not even bother to write to them to explain that the pool is to close and that they will lose their training ground.

<a name="stpa_430">I cannot understand the massive lack of ambition that leads to a local council closing a swimming pool shortly after the announcement that we will be hosting the Olympics and Paralympics. What message does that send to local people in Staveley and Chesterfield? The UK&#039;s Sydney Paralympics swimming team came home with 62&nbsp;medals&#151;out of a total of 131&nbsp;medals awarded. We in North-East Derbyshire want to build on that record. We want to encourage able-bodied and disabled children to be the swimmers and winners of 2012, but how can we even think of competing if Chesterfield is to close its swimming baths?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para1">
<a name="stpa_431">It is not as though Chesterfield is flooded with pools. Once Middlecroft is closed there will be only one other pool in the borough, and that is already heavily oversubscribed. We should contrast this approach with that of North East Derbyshire district council, which manages four 25&nbsp;m pools and plans to upgrade them, rather than to close them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para2">
<a name="stpa_432">However, the context of this debate is wider than my constituency and Chesterfield: it is about health, wealth, leisure and community. As Duncan Goodhew says:

<p><a name="st_314"><a name="60206-42_spnew2"><b> Natascha Engel: </b> 
 I apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker. When my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State visited a school last week and asked the children to which sports facility they would most like to have access, the answer was, of course, swimming pools.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para4">
<a name="stpa_434">There is also the very serious issue of water safety. Learning to swim will obviously lead to fewer people, especially younger people, drowning. That is of particular concern in Middlecroft. Once the pool is closed, the nearest water will be in the Poolsbrook

<br>&nbsp;<br>country park. Come the summer, kids&#151;swimmers and non-swimmers&#151;will jump straight into unsupervised lakes and ponds. Their parents are right to be worried.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para5">
<a name="stpa_435">If we can keep Middlecroft open and carry on getting kids to swim from an early age, the health benefits will be massive. They will be less likely to suffer from heart disease or strokes, and they will be far less likely to become obese. In a high-deprivation area like Staveley, there is also a high level of drug abuse. It does not take a genius to work out that involvement in sports will make it less likely for a child to get involved in crime and drugs. As we have already established that swimming is the most popular and most accessible sport of all, is it not irresponsible to be closing down a pool in Middlecroft?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para6">
<a name="stpa_436">Middlecroft is not rich, but it is a tight-knit community and the swimming pool is more than just a leisure centre. It is where people meet and socialise. It is the heart of the community. The pool is getting a bit old and everyone would probably rather have a 50&nbsp;m competition pool with wave machines and top-of-the-range gym facilities. The pool may not be perfect, but it is all there is.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para7">
<a name="stpa_437">My right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport was kind enough to come to Middlecroft on Friday to receive a petition with 2,500&nbsp;signatures demanding that the pool stay open. He was amazed that the council is closing a perfectly good swimming pool. The problem is that swimming pools, their location, and whether they stay open or are closed, are in the gift of local authorities. But swimming pools are too important for local authorities like Chesterfield to make irresponsible decisions on closure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para8">
<a name="stpa_438">The London Pools Campaign is a group formed from six different swimming bath campaign groups. In Derbyshire and other more rural parts of the country, forming umbrella pool campaign organisations is far more difficult. In fact,the issues are arguably far more difficult, because a swimmer in Staveley does not have the option of jumping on the tube to another pool. However, the proposals I make tonight owe a lot to the London Pools Campaign and to David Sparkes, the chief executive of the Amateur Swimming Association.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para9">
<a name="stpa_439">The Government have no power over local authority decisions on pools, but they do have a responsibility to ensure a strategic policy on pools, and local authorities should be forced to sign up to it. The strategy should be co-ordinated at city or county level, with a proper inventory of facilities. It should ensure that everyone has fair access to swimming, especially children, disabled people and women. We should aim for free swims for under 16s, over-60s and disabled people. We should ensure that opening times are convenient, prices are affordable, cr&#232;che facilities are available and that new pools are built where they are most needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para10">
<a name="stpa_440">Chesterfield borough council should not be allowed to close any pool without having first opened a suitable alternative swimming facility. If that is not possible without releasing funding from the sale of the old pool, the Government should look into providing bridging loans. No one has a problem with closing pools if a new one is opened first. Everyone has a problem if a pool is closed and replaced by a small fitness room, because children cannot learn to swim in a gym.

<p><a name="st_315"><a name="60206-42_spmin3"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport  (Mr. David Lammy): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) on her success in securing this, her first Adjournment debate. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said in the House the other week, investment in community facilities should be a priority. The Government are committed to increasing sports participation, especially for disabled people, and swimming is one of the three most popular forms of physical activity for that group. The decision that my hon. Friend describes is therefore all the more surprising.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para11">
<a name="stpa_441">Access to good-quality sporting provision, including swimming pools, is an essential part of enabling people to lead healthier lives and to participate in sport. Concern about that issue has been reflected in the debate tonight. One of my Department&#039;s key targets is to increase participation in sport by priority groups, including disabled people, by 3&nbsp;per cent. by 2008. However, one of the obstacles preventing people from taking part in sport is the lack of good-quality facilities, which applies as much to the disabled as to other sections of the community. Our aim is that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;most people should be no more than 20&nbsp;minutes travel time from a good quality, multi sports environment, such as schools, sports clubs and leisure centres&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para12">
<a name="stpa_442">There is a challenge. There is a clear deficit in funding for sporting facilities, alongside the failing condition of existing stock. The average age of local authority facilities is about 25&nbsp;years. The national stock of sports centres requires about &#163;550&nbsp;million to bring their condition up to a good acceptable standard, even without upgrading to take account of modern trends in sports participation and current demand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para13">
<a name="stpa_443">The Government are taking a number of positive steps to address those issues. All over the country, responsible local authorities are joining us in the crusade, not presenting road blocks. More than 4,400&nbsp;swimming facilities in England are open to the public; 72&nbsp;per cent. are owned by the local authority or education sectors and more than half are pay and play facilities. Since 2004, 131&nbsp;pools have opened across the country. More local authority pools have opened than closed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para14">
<a name="stpa_444">Since 1997, the Government and lottery distribution bodies have invested more than &#163;3&nbsp;billion in physical activity and sport, and &#163;249&nbsp;million of lottery investment has gone to swimming&#151;the largest amount given to any sport. Local authorities will be investing about &#163;1&nbsp;billion in developing sports services and facilities over the next three years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para15">
<a name="stpa_445">We need a strategic approach, however. The problem is that many pools are old; they were built 25&nbsp;years ago, are in the wrong location and cost a lot to keep open. We are challenging local authorities to put sport and swimming provision at the heart of what they do. For the first time ever, we will be monitoring local authority performance in sports provision through the comprehensive performance assessments, and we are committed to supporting local authorities in their efforts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para16">
<a name="stpa_446">Before I turn to my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns, I want to set out the overall position. Swimming is one of the three most popular forms of physical activity for disabled 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>6 Feb 2006 : Column 718</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>people. According to research, disabled people regularly say that they would like to do more swimming. It is essential that we do all we can to provide opportunities for them to participate. Obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995&nbsp;require all service providers to take reasonable measures to remove, alter or provide reasonable means of avoiding physical barriers to accessing and using their premises. The Disability Rights Commission has statutory duties to monitor and keep under review the implementation and enforcement of the DDA and to advise the Government on the operation of the Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para17">
<a name="stpa_447">In August 2005, the Minister for Sport, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn) wrote to all local authorities reminding them of their responsibilities under the Act in the context of leisure and tourism facilities. In addition, across central Government, we know that many other organisations are involved in trying to improve the range and quality of swimming opportunities available to disabled people. For example, the English Federation of Disability Sport&#151;the national body responsible for developing disability sport&#151;receives more than &#163;1&nbsp;million per annum in funding from the Exchequer through Sport England.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-42_para18">
<a name="stpa_448">A number of local authorities have introduced free or discounted swimming for specific groups, including people with disabilities. It is important that, as local authorities assess where their sporting facilities, particularly swimming facilities, should be located, they have regard to deprivation and the context for poor people. It is also important that they can develop to those facilities at reasonable cost and in a reasonable time. I hope that that assessment is being taken seriously in Chesterfield.

 Bolsover is next door to Chesterfield, and we were promised a swimming bath. The lottery people were going to provide some of the money several years ago. We have not got a swimming bath in Bolsover. We would love to have one. We will help those people in Chesterfield if we get one. Will the Minister have a word with the people who run the lottery and the Minister for Sport to see whether we can get that swimming bath back on the road again? The money could be there if we got some from the lottery.
</p>





<p><a name="st_317"><a name="60206-43_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 I had a little feeling that my hon. Friend might raise that issue&#151;he has done so in the past&#151;so I tapped my right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport on the shoulder this morning and asked him what was happening in Bolsover. He is happy to consider the proposal with the lottery providers and to take it forward, but he told me that it is important that the people in Bolsover come forward with a business case.
</p>





<p><a name="st_318"><a name="60206-43_spnew2"><b> Mr. Skinner: </b> 
 They have done that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_319"><a name="60206-43_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 If my hon. Friend feels that that has been done recently, I will bring that to my right hon. Friend&#039;s attention in the next few days.

<a name="stpa_449">In the light of all that has been said, the situation in Derbyshire is serious, and the Government are monitoring it. I have heard what my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire said, and I am

<br>&nbsp;<br>strongly of the view that there should be no diminution in services for the people of Derbyshire. It is clearly important that the council have regard to the existing facilities that people rely on, and the gap that will be created if the council moves to any new arrangement. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport visited my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency on Friday. He takes the situation seriously, and he is monitoring it. He intends to go back to the constituency, because he joins my hon. Friend in the concerns that she has raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-43_para1">
<a name="stpa_450">I have been informed by the council that the pool in Staveley needs to close for health and safety reasons and that it has offered to provide alternative facilities, but in considering any alternative, it must bear in mind the concerns that people have been raising, such as their ability to travel the distances to other facilities and, particularly, the concerns of the disabled in the area.
</p>





<p><a name="st_320"><a name="60206-43_spnew4"><b> Natascha Engel: </b> 
 The borough council has said that it will provide alternative facilities, but the problem is that once the pool has closed, people will not have a swimming facility for a number of years, and access to the nearest alternative facility is not good enough. How can we ensure that the pool does not close in the first place, until an alternative has appeared?
</p>





<p><a name="st_321"><a name="60206-43_spnew5"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has raised the issue at the highest level, and the Prime Minister saw fit to comment on it last week. The Minister for Sport has visited her constituency. The Government are committed to sport. More local authorities are opening facilities than closing them. On which side of the debate are my hon. Friend&#039;s colleagues in another party? They need to contemplate that decision in the days ahead. No doubt constituents will look at that future offer, and if there is no such offer they will go in a different direction, for which I would applaud them.

<a name="60206-43_para2">
<a name="stpa_451">Swimming remains one of our major success stories at Paralympic level. It is especially important for the disabled, many of whom look forward to practising, training and being involved in the Paralympic games. Our competitors at the Paralympics won 62&nbsp;medals at Sydney, of which 15&nbsp;were gold, and 52&nbsp;in Athens, of which 16&nbsp;were gold. That placed the UK at the top of the ranks for swimming, with only China achieving more medals in the pool. That is why hon. Members raise the subject, why our constituents care about it and why local authorities are responding to them. This country should be proud of its record. To maintain and improve it, it is important to invest in facilities so that we have first-class athletes, and young people can take up the sport of choice that they say they prefer above all others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-43_para3">
<a name="stpa_452">We are under no illusions about the scale of the challenge ahead as we try to ensure that we have facilities fit for the future, which will support our elite athletes. As I have outlined, however, there are many positive messages across the country about swimming, in particular swimming for disabled people. We have good facilities and, moreover, a talented and aspiring generation of disabled swimmers. We need to do everything we can to encourage more people to follow that example. That has to start with local authorities, including the one in Derbyshire, ensuring that there is good local provision that meets the needs of all sections of its communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60206-43_para4">
<a name="stpa_453">I thank my hon. Friend for obtaining this important debate. I hope that political colleagues will take what has been said seriously and that her constituents benefit from first-class swimming facilities without the pause in provision that it appears others want them to experience.
