 I hope that our announcement will indeed secure a long-term future for coal in this country. Today coal generates around a third of the electricity that we use annually, and in peak times particularly, such as when it was snowing in February, that can go up to 50 or 60 per cent. However, coal emits carbon and that is why carbon capture and storage is important. The CCS announcement is good news. A commercially viable CCS power station could secure the future of miners such as those at Daw Mill in my constituency for decades to come. There are still about 5,000 miners and 800 companies supplying the industry, many of which are small and medium-sized enterprises, so our announcement is, I hope, good news indeed.</p>

 I am not quite sure what the hon. Gentleman means by various environmental campaigners, because people in the green movement have all sorts of views on the issue. There are some in the green movement who have been strong advocates of carbon capture and storage and there are others who have said that under no circumstances can we have coal power generation in this country. As with other groups of people, there are differences. However, we need electricity generation for the future in which we ensure a base load of nuclear and a clear component of renewables. The problem of intermittency needs to be addressed and that can be done by having the flexibility that gas and coal-powered generation with carbon capture and storage can provide.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. It was significant that the announcement about the strategic siting assessment and the 11 sites was broadly welcomed. That is a sign of the way in which the debate on nuclear has changed. Many people who once had doubts about nuclear have changed their view in light of the threat of climate change. The strategic siting assessment is important for taking forward our plans for new nuclear. It will be followed in the autumn by the national policy statement, which will have the strategic sites attached to it. This is genuinely a consultation. There will be a month for the public to register their views, which precedes the formal consultation&#151;a proper 12-week consultation. So we want to listen to people&#146;s views, but broadly the announcement seems to have been welcomed, including by those who live near the sites, which is a positive development for climate change and energy security.</p>

Just to make it clear to the House, the process will involve the publication of a national policy statement in the autumn with the strategic sites attached to it. There will then be a period of consultation&#151;including, I think, with a Select Committee. The plan is then to designate by the spring.

 The hon. Gentleman is right: we do have to import most of our wind turbines. Although until recently wind turbines were made in the United Kingdom, they were exported to the United States. We are talking to a number of manufacturers with the intention of returning those jobs to the United Kingdom in due course, because that is important to us in the long term.</p>

Gentleman that while the Leader of the Opposition says that he is in favour of creating a low-carbon economy, Conservative Members of Parliament are going around the country constantly running down the whole issue of the need to ensure that we have a level of onshore wind generation. We cannot build that low-carbon economy without onshore wind.</p>

 Surely it makes sense to put wind farms onshore in the windiest places, but according to the London Metropolitan business school, in 2007 the mean load factor of the 81 wind farms in England was just 23 per cent. In other words, they were working for less than a quarter of the time. How can that be an efficient use of resources?</p>

 The normal working level is about a third of the time. Intermittency has always been an issue in the build-up of the renewables economy, and, as the hon. Gentleman says, it must be addressed. We can reduce the intermittency problem by ensuring that, once it is switched on, nuclear generation has a reliable base load, and also by building renewables, including wind. We need to deal with both intermittency and the variability of demand and supply. In the case of gas and coal, that can be done through carbon capture and storage.</p>

 The Secretary of State has made the courageous and correct decision to set a target of 80 per cent. for carbon reduction emissions by 2050. Unfortunately, however, if aviation is to return its emissions to their current levels by that date, all other sectors will be required to make an 89 per cent. cut to cater for it. Given that fact, given the entirely unnecessary expansion of Heathrow, and given that transport is the only sector in which carbon emissions have increased since 1990, is it not time that the Secretary of State had a word with the Secretary of State for Transport and told him to stop derailing his climate change strategy?</p>

 My hon. and learned Friend will be aware of the plethora of measures introduced in yesterday&#146;s Budget to deal with the growing problem of climate change. Nuclear development is very important, because nuclear power can play a big role in the battle against climate change. It is safe and efficient, and it is now a crucial tool in that battle. There is a whole industry out there that this country needs to develop, particularly in the area of nuclear fuels&#151;and I am proud to be able to say that Westinghouse, which can develop such fuels, is located close to my constituency at Springfields. When will the Government get their act together and develop the technologies that we need to combat climate change?</p>

 I hope that the Government have set out very clearly how we are going to create a low-carbon economy. We need to develop the base load of nuclear, so that we have new nuclear power stations to replace some of those that will come off-stream in the coming decade and a half. We also need to ensure that we have the renewables, particularly wind generated both onshore and offshore. Beyond that, we need to ensure that, with carbon capture and storage, we have the flexibility to deal with problems of variability of demand and intermittency, and that will come from coal and gas-fired power stations. So there is a clear vision of the way forward for energy generation in this country that will move us towards a low-carbon economy, and with the commitment to reduce our emissions by 80 per cent. by 2050, we are on a clear trajectory to ensure that we meet our climate change needs.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point in the second half of his question, if not in the first. On his first point, as I said, fuel poverty has increased because energy prices have increased, but since 2002, some 5 million houses have been insulated under our programmes. Our record on fuel poverty and what we have managed to do through housing and income are not matched by the previous Government or, indeed, by other previous Governments.

 I do, which is why we unveiled plans in February for &#147;pay as you save&#148; insulation, whereby people will be able to spread the costs of energy efficiency measures over a number of years; it will not be linked to the person in the house but to the house itself, so that the costs can be spread over 20 years or so. Therefore, part of the savings from the energy bills will be able to be used to fund to kind of insulation that we need. We have very ambitious plans for 7 million houses to have whole-house refurbishment by 2020 and all houses to have it by 2030.

If we can get the newer cars, rather than the older ones, on the road, we will reduce the amount of problems that we have with atmospheric damage.</p>

 Yesterday&#146;s Budget was a missed opportunity to invest in green measures and to stimulate the economy.

 We are not rejecting the advice of our experts. One very important point is that we already have a huge amount of investment going into green technology in this country. For example, the renewables obligation will mean that about &#163;100 billion will go into green investment between now and 2020. Yesterday, my right hon.

 It is the case, of course, that the escalator was introduced by a Conservative Government. But let us not go there; let us instead deal with the real issue of the price of fuel for cars. The price of petrol and diesel spiked last year; that was a substantial burden for the motorist, but the price has gone down sharply. It is dependent, obviously, on the overall world economic situation. The demand for oil responds very quickly to global financial circumstances and, as a result, prices have fallen, but it is interesting that they have started to rise again, albeit not to a substantial extent. On the price of oil there is not only a need to ensure that we are able to get out of the recession without it spiking too high; we also need to sustain investment in the oil and gas industry, particularly&#151;from the UK&#146;s point of view&#151;in the North sea.</p>

 The House of Commons Commission has had no recent discussions with trade unions or staff associations on the basic employment contract for Members&#146; staff.

 Pending the announced review of employment arrangements for Members&#146; staff, the Green Book says that a standard contract must be used, and in practice MPs use that contract as is. The present contract represents the lowest common denominator in employment standards and is poor compared, for example, with those held by civil servants doing an equivalent job.

 On both sides of the House. In addition, under our current arrangements, Standing Orders limit the Government in significant ways&#151;for instance, they ensure that there are 20 Opposition days a year. Furthermore, after both the Budget and the Queen&#146;s Speech there are five days of debate in which the topic is decided by the Opposition, not the Government. That is more flexible and a better system.</p>

 As I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, delegated legislation is subject to a number of different procedures, usually depending on the provisions in its parent Act.

 The Deputy Leader of the House will know that a great deal of legislation goes through, necessarily, by statutory instrument, but he will also be aware that it is impossible to amend such statutory instruments; we are given a &#147;take it or leave it&#148; option when such an instrument is put before a Committee upstairs in the Committee corridor.

 Again, this is a proposal that seems attractive but which in the end I do not think is a good idea. As Lord Rippon said in the Hansard Society commission back in 1992, an amendable statutory instrument would be very like a Bill, and all the advantages of the greater flexibility of delegated legislation would be lost. The truth of the matter is that if the Government want to provide for a full legislative process, with amendments possible, it should be primary, not secondary, legislation that is being brought forward.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman asked about the arrest of the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green) and the issues of parliamentary privilege that arose from it. The House has already made a resolution to refer the matter to a Committee of the Speaker, and I do not think that it would be a good idea to set up a twin-track approach. All the issues about entry on to the premises of Parliament, the searching of parliamentary offices and constituency correspondence and what is, or should be, available to the court can be considered by the Speaker&#146;s Committee, which the House agreed should start its work after the criminal proceedings had come to a conclusion. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman that we should set up a twin-track approach and a separate inquiry into the same issues via the Standards and Privileges Committee.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman says that, but he would need to explain why the Speaker&#146;s Committee could not consider the issues that he is concerned about and believes need to be looked into. I am obviously keen for the House to be able to have all the issues that it wants resolved looked into, and I have no vested interest in the House not looking into them and coming to a satisfactory conclusion. I just do not want there to be a twin-track proposal or for us to undermine a resolution that the House has already made at your request, Mr. Speaker, that there should be a Speaker&#146;s Committee to look into the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90423-0004.htm_para19"><a name="09042347000189">The second point that the hon. Gentleman raised was about the policing of Parliament square. It is obviously very important that people have the right to demonstrate and are able to make their views known publicly and peacefully, but we have to ensure that the business of this House and the very important site of Parliament square are properly protected, and we do not want the undue tying up of police resources. The matter is under consideration by many authorities and is the operational responsibility of the police. I know that there is ongoing concern and discussions about it, but I do not have anything specific to tell him or the House today.</p>

Speed limits are a very important issue, because they are about cutting deaths on the road through traffic accidents, and particularly about cutting pedestrian deaths. This is not being done for the sake of it, and, by the way, it is a consultation; it is not being pushed through. The evidence is that lower speed limits save lives, and particularly the lives of children who would otherwise be killed in road accidents if they were hit as pedestrians. I ask him to reflect on that, and  <br>

That did not happen, and there was great concern about that. The Sutherland inquiry was established jointly with Ofqual, and it looked into the situation and made proposals for change. Ken Boston resigned, and he has now given evidence to the Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families. Incidentally, the Minister for Schools and Learners, who gave inaccurate information, corrected it is as long ago as February, and Lord Sutherland said that it was not material to his findings anyway, so I urge the hon. Gentleman not to make so much of that. We await the report of the Select Committee, and there will be Children, Schools and Families questions next Monday, so hon. Members who want to ask questions about the matter can do so to the Secretary of State and his ministerial team.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="90423-0004.htm_para22"><a name="09042347000192">As far as prior publicity about car scrappage is concerned, that first came into the public domain as a demand from the automotive industry. Hon. Members on both sides of the House whose constituents have interests in the automotive industry proposed that scheme to Business Ministers and the Treasury. There was debate and consultation, and the matter could not be kept as a national security issue in those circumstances. There was some discussion in advance&#151;indeed, some of it was in the papers. Rather than focusing on that bit of the process, however, the hon. Gentleman should welcome the car scrappage scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90423-0004.htm_para23"><a name="09042347000193">The hon. Gentleman talked about parliamentary allowances. Many Members have constituencies that are far away from Westminster, which inevitably involves extra cost. We do not want only those who can afford to pay the cost of living away from home to represent far-flung constituencies. I hope that there is general agreement on that point. It is important for us to say that, because sometimes the public do not recognise that that would be the result of not assisting with the extra costs incurred in representing far-flung constituencies. First, none of us wants that to happen. Secondly, we all want the public to have confidence in the way in which the House goes about its work and the way in which public money is spent. Thirdly, it is evident that the public do not have that confidence, and, fourthly, we need to do something about that. Fifthly, I hope that we still agree that it is important to involve an independent element.</p>

I thank Sir Christopher Kelly for agreeing to take on that work, which he has started today. He needs to engage in consideration, deliberation and consultation, and he needs to take some time before he reaches his conclusion, even though he is going to do it expeditiously. In the meantime, because of the high level of public concern, it is important to introduce an interim change. A number of hon. Members think that we should leave the matter until after Sir Christopher Kelly has made his decision, but I do not think that that is right, because we need to introduce interim measures pending the outcome of Sir Christopher Kelly&#146;s report.</p>

 The proposal for a flat-rate daily payment does not come from the back of one of the Prime Minister&#146;s envelopes. It is one of the alternatives that has been considered by this House over a period of time, including by the Committee on Members&#146; Allowances in its former incarnation.

If a flat-rate payment is established, no documentary evidence will be required to show how we have spent the money, so what are we supposed to do&#151;pocket all the money that we do not spend legitimately within the rules?

 My hon. Friend reiterates a criticism that has been made of the proposal, but the extra money would not be given just for turning up. Instead, it would go towards the costs of having a constituency away from London, but it would not be right for people to claim that money if they did not turn up here. They would not incur those costs if they never came to Westminster and only stayed in their constituencies.

We are reviewing the provision in primary care for former members of our armed forces.

Eighty per cent. of lending for mortgages is covered under the scheme, because those who lend into 80 per cent. of the mortgage market have signed up to it. That means that we will back those lenders so that they can allow people who get into difficulty with their mortgage interest payments to defer them, either in whole or in part, for up to two years.

The primary concern for the Government and for us all is the safety of the civilians caught in the conflict area. The Prime Minister has taken a leading role and was one of the first to call for a ceasefire. Although large numbers of civilians have been able to leave the conflict area, a longer pause is needed.

For example, on the A15, which is one of the most dangerous roads in the whole of Britain, there is a 40 mph restriction on lorries over a certain weight. The restriction relates to their braking capacity and goes back years, but the design and technology have moved on.

 It may well be that we can put a daily rate in the resolution until such time as the Senior Salaries Review Body produces its proposal for the daily rate. The 1 July start date is stretching, but there are a number of simple propositions here. The point is that we have to take action. Public confidence has been draining away.

to do that anyway. He has to take some time to deliberate, but it is not acceptable to leave the present lack of confidence to continue until after Sir Christopher has reported. It is therefore right to take on the issue by way of interim proposals that can come into effect. The public do not accept the current situation and they want it to be changed. We can change it on an interim basis while Sir Christopher Kelly continues to reflect and until he comes forward with his independent proposals.</p>

 My right hon. and learned Friend will have heard earlier what I said about the shamefully low pensions that are payable under the present pension arrangements for Members&#146; staff.

 Given the typical state of the Liberal Democrat Benches throughout business questions, it is easy to see why that party is so strongly opposed to Members having to turn up at Westminster in order to be able to claim their allowances. However, my question is about NATO. One of NATO&#146;s two supreme commands is based in America and the other in Belgium. There are reports that the one based in America might now be moved to France as part of the price for France reintegrating with the NATO military structure.

It will not deal with Members who are away carrying out duties with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the Inter-Parliamentary Union or the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or other parliamentary duties, but who still have to maintain accommodation in London. Furthermore, no mention has been made of how Members will pay for the accommodation that they have to maintain during the summer recess, when no per diem will be paid. This really is absolute nonsense. As many people have said, the proposal appears to have been decided after writing a few notes on the back of an envelope.</p>

 If the criteria involve parliamentary duties, duties involving the CPA or the IPU could certainly come within that definition. Obviously, the resolution will need to address these issues and satisfy Members that they will be able to carry out their parliamentary duties. In relation to that, we need to ensure that parliamentary duties are properly defined. As far as the recess is concerned, the proposal is that the new scheme would be introduced in July and that the flat-rate daily payments would depend on the days attended. Because there would be fewer such days between July and 12 October, owing to the recess, there would have to be transitional arrangements.</p>

 With permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement on coal and carbon capture and storage. In our energy policy, we face three challenges: to transform our energy to low-carbon sources; to maintain security of supply; and to do so in a way that is right for the British economy and industry. To meet that challenge will take all the low-carbon technologies at our disposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="90423-0006.htm_para7"><a name="09042347000269">We need renewable energy, and in the last five years we have tripled renewable electricity supplies. We have more offshore wind power than any country in the world, and yesterday my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced new support for offshore wind and new financial help for the wind industry to get through the credit crunch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="90423-0006.htm_para8"><a name="09042347000270">We need to facilitate nuclear energy, too. In the face of climate change, with assurances on safety and cost, many who once opposed nuclear power now support it. Thanks to decisions made by my predecessor, Britain is on track for a renaissance in nuclear power, and I announced last week the nominations for 11 potential sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="90423-0006.htm_para9"><a name="09042347000271">The future of coal in our energy mix poses the starkest dilemma we face: it is a polluting fuel, but it is used across the world because it is low cost and it is flexible enough to meet fluctuations in demand for power. In the UK, a third of our existing coal-fired power stations are due to close in the coming decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="90423-0006.htm_para10"><a name="09042347000272">To ensure that we maintain a diverse energy mix, including maximising our domestic fuel supply, we need new coal-fired power stations&#151;but only if they can be part of the low-carbon future. Across the world, we know the challenge that coal presents. With many countries, including China and India, reliant on coal and many building new coal-fired power stations at a rapid pace, there is an urgent international imperative for us to make coal clean. With a solution to the problem of coal, we greatly increase our chances of stopping dangerous climate change. Without it, we will not succeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90423-0006.htm_para11"><a name="09042347000273">There is a solution to the challenge&#151;through carbon capture and storage. Capturing the CO2, transporting it and locking it permanently underground would reduce emissions by 90 per cent. While this technology has been demonstrated in its different parts and at small scale&#151;capturing emissions from 30 MW&#151;it has never been tried on a commercial scale, and never as the complete process from start to finish on a power station, so the first task is urgently to drive the technology at scale. We are already running a competition for one of the first end-to-end demonstrations in the world, covering capture, transport and storage. It will be one of the biggest CCS projects in the world&#151;more than 10 times bigger than the largest existing pilot.</p>

We will select bidders to proceed to detailed designs, but we know that we need to go further and, because of yesterday&#146;s Budget, there will also be funding for up to three more demonstration projects, which we want to involve a mix of pre and post-combustion so that all the technologies can be tested.</p>

It could be based on a CCS feed-in tariff, so that projects could receive a fixed price for electricity, or on a fixed price for carbon abated. We will consult on this alongside our new coal conditions by the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90423-0006.htm_para14"><a name="09042347000276">We need to ally this reliable stream of funding for carbon capture and storage, which we now have, with a policy on coal-fired power stations to drive the demonstration and deployment of CCS. We consulted last year on carbon capture readiness as the condition for new coal-fired power stations, but I have concluded that while it is right to go ahead with this condition, it will not on its own drive the change we need. I believe that we need to signal a move from the building of unabated coal-fired power stations&#151;it is right to drive our country towards low carbon as part of a progressive decarbonisation of our power supplies. That is also an essential part of a new industrial strategy, and it is necessary if we are to show international leadership on climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90423-0006.htm_para15"><a name="09042347000277">I therefore propose two new conditions that any new coal-fired power station must meet to gain consent in England and Wales. We are proceeding with a strategic environmental assessment and will consult formally in the summer. First, we must send a decisive signal that change starts now, so I propose a requirement to demonstrate CCS on a substantial proportion of any new coal-fired power station. We will propose for consultation a requirement to demonstrate at least 300 MW of net capacity or around 400 MW of gross output as a condition of any consent. The demonstration condition would mean that henceforth unabated coal-fired power stations would not get Government consent.

Every coal-fired power station built from now would have to commit to retrofitting CCS on the whole plant&#151;100 per cent.&#151;within five years of 2020, subject to the technology being ready. Once the technology had been judged as proven, every new coal-fired power station would have to commit to CCS, not just on a portion, but on the whole plant.</p>

They set us on a decisive low-carbon path, with the UK doing more than any other country to demonstrate and deploy CCS, and they are the most environmentally ambitious coal conditions of any country in the world.

This route to low-carbon coal is also right for the British economy, and will enable us to lead the world in carbon capture and storage. With a reliable stream of finance, we are investing in British skills so that our industries can lead CCS not just in Britain, but at power stations around the world.

I pay tribute to our regional development agencies for what they are already doing on carbon capture and storage, and look forward to working with them. Teesside, the Thames Gateway, the Firth of Forth and the Humber are among the locations that could be suitable for a new CCS cluster. For our North sea oil and gas industry, CCS can herald a new low-carbon future. The 1960s and 1970s saw the development of a new North sea industry; in later decades, Britain can do the same with CCS.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for early sight of his statement. I know from our exchanges that he is an avid student of my policy documents, and he knows how long the Conservatives have been trying to persuade him and his predecessors to give Britain a lead in carbon capture and storage. Sadly, that leadership has now passed to China, Germany and the USA. It is two years since the Government&#146;s characteristic dithering led to the collapse of BP&#146;s CCS project at Peterhead. That work is now being done in Abu Dhabi.</p>

technology, financed by Britain&#146;s share of receipts from the EU emissions trading scheme; and to introduce an emissions performance standard that would limit emissions from any new plant to the equivalent of those from a modern gas-fuelled power station.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="90423-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09042347000288">Our criteria remain those against which today&#146;s announcement must be judged, but let us be clear why the statement was so urgently needed. After 12 years, Britain's energy policy is as much of a horror show as our public finances, and for the same reason: the Government did not fix the roof when the sun was shining. We have known for more than a decade that a third of our generating capacity is to be turned off during the current decade, and that there is no remotely adequate plan to replace it with a low-carbon alternative. We have known for many years that North sea oil and gas are in decline, but our gas storage capacity is grossly inadequate. During the cold snap last February, storage dropped to just four days&#146; worth. No other major European country generates less of its electricity from renewables, although we have some of the best wind, wave and tidal resources in Europe. If anyone thinks that the Government&#146;s handling of the economy was an aberration, let them look at the mess of their energy policy. While we welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s Damascene conversion to Conservative policy, it is from that appalling position that we now need to recover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90423-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09042347000289">The Secretary of State will understand our need for reassurance about his intentions. Will he confirm that the new coal-fired power stations to be developed with CCS technology will be required to achieve an overall emissions performance standard of no more than 500 kg of carbon dioxide per MWh from the outset? If there is consent for four pilots, each generating 300 MW of abated electricity, that will mean the abating of 1.2 GW of new capacity by 2020. How much unabated electricity does the Secretary of State expect to be generated by those plants by that date? Is there any limit on the proportion of unabated electricity generated by them? Can we expect to see a monster new coal plant generating massively increased carbon dioxide emissions of which only a small proportion are abated by means of the measures that the Secretary of State has described?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90423-0007.htm_para10"><a name="09042347000290">As for the funding for the CCS clusters and the demonstration plant, will the Secretary of State explain why the Government have chosen to raise the money by means of a consumer levy rather than from EU ETS receipts? Will he tell us how much that levy will be and on which consumers it will fall, bearing in mind the burdens placed on households and firms by yesterday&#146;s Budget? Will he tell us how many clusters he expects there to be, and can he assure us that their locations will be chosen with technical viability rather than political convenience at the forefront of the considerations? Will he tell us plainly whether he will consent to new coal plants outside the cluster areas?</p>

If the Secretary of State&#146;s conversion on CCS is genuine, I welcome it, but I sincerely hope that today&#146;s announcement does not turn out to be another example of Government greenwashing. The Secretary of State said that the Government must send a decisive signal, but much of the commitment that he has made is still subject to consultation. He has left it perilously late  <br>

 I have respect for the hon. Gentleman, but I hope that when he reflects on his performance today he will reconsider his position and think hard about what policy he wants to pursue. I have to say that he gave a pretty disappointing response that did not show much understanding of the difficulties that we face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90423-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09042347000293">The hon. Gentleman asked about the funding mechanism. He was right to point out that part of the challenge is finding the funding, but the problem with his proposal of using funds from the auctioning of the European carbon allowances is that that has already been accounted for in the Chancellor&#146;s Budget plans. The money is not available. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal constitutes an uncosted commitment to providing billions of pounds without the faintest clue about where the money will come from. He does not have the money, because it is included in the general accounts published in the Budget. It is difficult to find the necessary finance, and I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor for deciding that we will fund these measures. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reflect on the means of financing them; he has no such means at his disposal.</p>

Let me say to him candidly that while he can pursue his demand for 100 per cent. CCS from day one&#151;I dealt with that in my statement&#151;I believe that it is a foolish approach. It is unaffordable, and it does not make sense in the context of a demonstration technology. It is true that 20 or 25 per cent. of the plant would be abated through CCS, and obviously we will consult on that, but I have thought hard about the matter, and I believe that we have struck the right balance between what is affordable and what is a proper way of demonstrating the technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90423-0007.htm_para14"><a name="09042347000295">We will of course consult on the level at which the emissions performance standard could be set, but I must caution the hon.

Unabated coal-fired power stations are the worst of all options&#151;worse even than seeking a derogation from the European Union to extend the life of existing gas-fired power stations for a few more years until CCS is ready.

We are looking at social tariffs&#151;compulsory social tariffs is one of the issues&#151;and the answer is to act on fuel poverty at the same time as driving towards a low-carbon future. Therefore, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we need to take additional measures on fuel poverty.</p>

However, we are performing a very fine balancing act between getting coal plants built&#151;because, after all, energy companies and others could say they are just going to build gas&#151;and driving towards low carbon. That is why I have set out a framework today, and I say, in the spirit of genuinely wanting co-operation, let us consult on the detail and get that right.

While the priority must be coal, as he will know, a lot of carbon capture work is going on in, for example, the steel and the petrochemical industries. In the south Humber and Yorkshire region we have, of course, Europe&#146;s biggest coal plant: Drax. Regionally, there are some very exciting proposals for clusters and network collections of CO2.

Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks), who laid the platform for this particular statement&#151;we should recognise that fact. May I also say that I hope that my own Front-Bench team will become more consensual once the Budget period is out of the way?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="90423-0008.htm_para0"><a name="09042347000322">I wish to ask two very quick questions, the first of which relates to the coal-producing areas. We know that much of the coal required is being imported and there is a lot of work to do to involve our coal-producing areas, so what thoughts does the Secretary of State have about that? Secondly, I wish to press him on a decision about Kingsnorth, but, from day one, I also urge him to include that power station within the parameters that he has outlined today. We need a decision on the current proposal on Kingsnorth urgently, but we also need that power station to be included in the particular programme that he has described today.</p>

 I obviously agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman said, and I think that today&#146;s announcement offers a big opportunity for the former coalfield areas from which they can really profit. Kingsnorth is involved in our competition, and the next stage of the process will be front-end engineering and design studies&#151;the bidders will put forward their proposals and we will judge who will be the eventual winner of the competition. The good news is that there are a number of opportunities to benefit from the four demonstration projects.</p>

 I congratulate the Secretary of State on a very imaginative statement. Will he say a word or two more about sourcing? If we do nothing to develop new deep mines, for example in north-east Leicestershire, where 800 million tonnes of clean coal is available, what will inevitably happen is that there will be an expansion of imports from sometimes unstable regimes and, more worryingly, an expansion of open-cast mine extraction. That affects all mining constituencies, particularly those in England, where there are shallow, unworked seams that the open-cast coal people would like to access because of the low cost. However, the environmental and social impact of such mining is very significant, as we see in respect of the Minorca application in north-west Leicestershire, which is about to be submitted.</p>

 On my hon. Friend&#146;s first point, indigenous coal does have an important future, and I obviously discuss that with UK Coal, the miners&#146; unions and others when talking about these issues. It is important to put that on the record. It also helps security of supply if we are able to benefit from such coal. On his second point, the existing planning guidance, which has been in place for some time, is obviously a matter for the Department for Communities and Local Government, and it remains the basis on which we are moving forward.</p>

 I am tempted to say better late than never. Scotland could have been well in the forefront of carbon capture and storage had the Government not pulled the rug from under the Peterhead project. Given that Scotland has some of the largest carbon storage reserves in Europe in the North sea saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas fields, and the expertise on how to access them, it would be a tragedy and a travesty if the firth of Forth was not one of the clusters chosen in this project. Can the Secretary of State tell us when the winning entry will be announced? Is he still committed to having a full-scale demonstration project up and running by 2014?</p>

 Two processes are involved&#151;the existing demonstration competition, in which three bidders are still involved, and the new incentive mechanism, which will require legislation to go through this House. If the Scottish Executive also want to put some money into taking these projects forward, we would be interested in having some of it. The basic point that I wish to make is that the firth of Forth will be part of the competitive process. It is not part of the existing demonstration, but given our announcements about an extra three demonstration projects, there is the potential for it to be involved. We have to use all the means at our disposal to develop this technology, and that will be true throughout the United Kingdom.</p>

 May I offer a warm welcome to the very measured statement made by my right hon. Friend? It really will set us on a transformational agenda in terms of the future low-carbon economy worldwide. Given that carbon abatement technology is the new black gold, will he carefully examine what can be done in areas such as the former coalfields in north Staffordshire, where there used to be many jobs in mining? Will he work with the regional Minister and the regional development agency to see how the former Chatterley Whitfield colliery in my constituency, which produced more than 1 million tonnes of coal in its heyday, can be transformed so that the people still living around that site have opportunities for new manufacturing work in carbon abatement technology?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very important point in a characteristically eloquent way. There is a real opportunity, including in her area, and this will require work with the regional development agencies and others who are already getting involved.

 As I have said in earlier answers, indigenous coal has an important role to play. If the Conservatives are supporting indigenous coal supply, that is much to be welcomed&#151;it certainly does not bear any relationship to their record in government. Indigenous coal can play an important role and some of the decisions made in the 1980s were a tragedy; we could have much more viable coal mines and many more mines than we have if those wrong decisions had not been made. We need to do all we can to maximise what we can get from indigenous coal.</p>

 I welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s announcement. The framework that he sets out will be very helpful, and I was particularly pleased to hear what he said about his meeting with Yorkshire Forward. He will be aware that the Yorkshire Forward project is an infrastructure project that would rejuvenate the engineering and steel industries in south Yorkshire, because it is proposed that it would create 55,000 jobs. May I say to him that we are likely to hit a real problem between 2012 and 2015, when there will be the simultaneous run-down of coal power stations and nuclear power stations? Perhaps we could consider some retrofitting with super-critical boilers, because we would thus be introducing a CO2-reducing technology. Such work would provide us with the opportunity to be able to have them fitted ready for carbon capture so that when the technology is proven, it could be fitted. That would get us through a crucial energy supply period.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. The view about nuclear in this country was coloured by the experiences that we had, the plants that were gone for and the cost of waste and clean-up. I am pleased that my predecessor made the decisions that he did about nuclear. As I said earlier, I think that climate change has changed people&#146;s view about the role of nuclear in the energy mix. On the subject of the French example, I am not sure that we would want to be wholly reliant on nuclear. It should be part of the energy mix along with clean fossil fuels and renewables, and there should still be a role for gas, at least for the time being. I think that that is the right way to go.</p>

Sinking new deep mines requires considerable investment, and I want to know what steps the Government are taking to foster further development of deep mines so that we are not reliant on imports, which have a carbon footprint because of their transportation and which offer less security of supply, and so that we provide jobs for our own people here.</p>

 There are obviously limits&#151;one should be candid about it&#151;in terms of rewriting history on these things. Decisions were made in the 1980s and 1990s and it is hard to reverse some of them. I have mentioned Harworth, where a particular case has been made. It has been mothballed for a couple of years and we are in discussions with UK Coal about it. We will listen to all representations that we receive about deep mines and their potential. The mines that are open provide an important indigenous source of fuel for Britain and will do so for many years to come.</p>

I hear sneers and dismissal from Government Members about the IMF&#146;s figures, but I thought that the IMF was going to be the new early-warning system for the Prime Minister. In a stroke, the IMF destroyed the credibility of the premise on which the Budget and its borrowing figures had been built. The claim is that within just two years, the British economy is supposed to bounce from the deepest recession that it has known since the second world war to levels of economic growth and household consumption seen only at the height of the boom; we now know that, frankly, in the view of almost every independent forecaster, that is a complete fantasy.

I guess that that leaves the Prime Minister as our mad hatter&#151;and given the expression on the face of the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, he is the white rabbit.</p>

Almost every single business organisation and independent forecaster followed suit, including the Institute of Directors, the Engineering Employers Federation and a host of others.

That is the scale of the mess that the Government have created. The tragedy of yesterday was that instead of being honest about that mess&#151;instead of taking responsibility for the mistakes that have been made and giving us a credible plan to pull Britain through&#151;we got that complete fantasy.</p>

The central task of a Budget in a recession such as this is to inspire confidence in the future&#151;confidence that the Government are realistic about the problems that the country faces, confidence that they have a credible and rigorous plan to deal with those problems, and confidence that they have the leadership and vision to take this country forward. Who would say that in Britain today, people and families are feeling more confident about this country&#146;s future as a result of the Budget? Almost no one. That is why yesterday was not a route map to recovery but the death rattle of a tired and discredited Government who are limping on until the law of the land actually forces them to hold a general election.</p>

First, it would involve understanding why the public finances are in such a disastrous state. The Prime Minister is still stuck in the rut of claiming that this is the recession that came from America and hit an otherwise sound British economy. I see the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton) nodding his head. He must be about the only person in the world who believes that now. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Okay, the three of them do&#151;the hon.

Indeed, it was greater in the UK than in the US. It was an illusion of economic stability built on a mountain of debt. Given that, the claim to have abolished boom and bust was surely one of the greatest political deceits ever told to the British people, and the decision to borrow at unsustainable levels during the boom, instead of fixing the roof when the sun was shining, left Britain totally unprepared for the economic slow-down. That is why Britain now has the worst public finances of any major economy in the developed world. Even in the past 24 hours, after the Government forecast a Budget deficit of over 12 per cent. of national income, Ministers still will not admit it.</p>

We should be working out what replaces the completely defunct fiscal rules and the two-year spending reviews that used to provide at least some appearance of a fiscal framework. But what do we have from the Labour party? Absolutely nothing. The fiscal framework now consists of a temporary operating rule that will be more permanent than the temporary fiscal rules that were supposed to be permanent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="90423-0009.htm_para20"><a name="09042347000379">To be fair, some people in the Labour party, and some people who used to be in the Labour Cabinet, want to have debate about the politics of austerity and how to deliver government to the people in a time of spending constraint. The right hon. Members for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) and even the hon. Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas) have all called for such a debate, but their problem is that their party is led by someone who still wants to reduce everything to a pathetic dividing line of Labour investment versus Tory cuts. How on earth does the Prime Minister expect to achieve that? How on earth does he expect to advance that argument when, on the basis on which Labour fought the last election, the cuts announced in yesterday&#146;s Budget amount to &#163;84 billion? Does he really think people will not notice that, far from seeing so-called Labour investment, we have just seen investment in the health service&#151;capital investment&#151;cut by &#163;2.3 billion next year and investment in schools and universities cut by &#163;900 million?</p>

Although the Budget accepts the principle that Labour spending plans were completely unaffordable, and although the Government have told us that billions of pounds are being wasted in Whitehall as we speak, they cannot explain why they are still planning to increase spending in 2010 by 2.9 per cent. Indeed, yesterday the Government actually increased their spending plans for 2010&#151;next year&#151;by &#163;20 billion, and only half of that was extra spending on debt interest and unemployment. When will they admit in their arguments what the figures in their Budget tell them? Their spending plans are simply unaffordable.</p>

tax rises and tough spending decisions until after the election? How courageous. What leadership: a move worthy of a Prime Minister who has never had the courage to submit himself to a democratic vote. Thankfully, the public have seen straight through it. Instead, we see the Labour party lurching left, off the centre ground that Tony Blair put it on to all those years ago. Gone is the language of aspiration and opportunity; in comes the talk of &#147;soak the rich&#148; and &#147;pips squeaking&#148;. Never mind that a 50 per cent. tax rate before the election clearly breaks one of the central promises in Labour&#146;s election manifesto. It will be interesting to hear what the Secretary of State says about the election manifesto commitment not to raise the top rate of tax. The manifesto said:</p>
<a name="90423-0009.htm_brev10"><a name="09042347000861"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We will not raise the basic or top rates of income tax in the next Parliament.&#148;</p>

When we look closely at the Red Book, it is clear that the headline-grabbing measures announced by the Chancellor will actually raise less money than the national insurance rise on the jobs and incomes of people earning more than &#163;20,000 a year. Although we do not think that higher marginal tax rates are a good idea, and although we agree with all the arguments that used to be advanced from the Dispatch Box by the former Chancellor and the former Member for Sedgefield that higher top rates of tax can damage enterprise, our priority will be to reverse the tax rises on the many, not the few.</p>

I know that the shadow Chancellor does not really want to do this, but let us try to engage with the substance of the argument, because on the question of how get Britain out of recession, we have an honest difference of view, which it is probably better to make plain.</p>

The big difference, although he wants to get away from it, is that he is doing something that is seen to be economically illiterate.

 The Secretary of State said something pretty significant about future spending plans. During the Budget speech, the Chancellor announced from that Dispatch Box that current spending would grow by 0.7 per cent. from 2011 onwards. The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change now says that those spending plans are not valid because there might be a spending review before then. That is the basis of the question. He said that there was going to be a spending review and that we cannot take those figures as fixed. Given what has been promised by Labour, the right hon. Gentleman is now, in his terms, cutting those spending plans by &#163;84 billion. He said that he wanted an honest debate, so why does he not have the honesty to admit that?

 I was making a very simple point. The money has been allocated for the spending review up to 2010-11, because, as the hon. Gentleman knows, we have three-year spending plans.

We think that it is right to support the emerging industries of the future and that there is a role for public spending as we do that.

Again, there is a difference of philosophy that the shadow Chancellor probably will not want to talk about. He now says that he accepts the higher top rate of income tax, but he did not mention his uncosted proposals on inheritance tax, which are still out there and have, I think, been reaffirmed. This is an interesting point, given that we are in the middle of a time when resources are scarce. The shadow Chancellor made his promise in 2007; he now has an opportunity to move off it.

 Funnily enough, I do not know the figures off the top of my head. What I do know, however, is that there is a big difference in priorities. At this most difficult economic time, the shadow Chancellor thinks that the right priority is more inheritance tax cuts for millionaires. If he wants to abandon the policy at the Dispatch Box, I am sure that many people, including some on his own side of the House who are probably more sensible, would think that was the right thing to do. I give him that chance: he can now say that it is an aspiration rather than a firm pledge. Funnily enough, he does not want to do so.</p>

I think that the Conservatives are still committed to a married couples allowance&#151;presumably another uncosted commitment that they have no clue how they would fund.

 No, it was correcting an anomaly in the tax system regarding the position of married couples compared with other couples. That is the explanation. If the hon.

 I will give way in a moment, but this is a Conservative policy to which I should like wider attention to be given, as it is significant. Not only is the shadow Chancellor going to go into the election saying that he would take money away from people, but to cut the level of tax credits he would either have to cut the overall rate, which would affect everyone, or raise the taper in the tax credit, which would worsen work incentives. Those are the two ways in which he could take money away from people through tax credits. That is another policy that he was hoping not to talk about.</p>

 That says it all, really. There were overpayments in the tax credits system. Some of that is to do with the design of the system, in that it is a flexible system that responds to people&#146;s circumstances. As a result, as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said yesterday, hundreds of thousands of people have seen their hours reduced and their income go up by up to &#163;35 a week.

Sea levels will therefore rise faster than expected, making floods and storm surges much more dangerous and threatening the homes and lives of millions in coastal communities worldwide. The latest data on Arctic sea ice show its likely summer disappearance in just a couple of years&#146; time. The IPCC predicted that that might happen by the end of 21st century. Some 80 years earlier than expected, the summer Arctic ocean will turn into a dark, heat-absorbing sea and accelerate the melting of permafrost on nearby continents.

That was made quite clear in Sir Nicholas Stern&#146;s report to the Government. With a cool economist&#146;s eye, Stern also pointed to another successful example of carbon reduction in a major economy&#151;Russia&#146;s reductions in the 1990s, achieved through the spectacular collapse of its economy. Come to think of it, perhaps that was the bit of the Stern report that the Prime Minister did read. Let us hope that neither he nor the Secretary of State attempts to make similar claims in future that the inevitable fall in greenhouse gases that will result from recession are anything to be proud of. Instead, we should be wary of the false message that those possible reductions could send.

For example, it is absolutely irresponsible to waste &#163;1 billion a month on a VAT cut that hardly anyone has noticed. The Budget also lacks any serious measures to help us adapt to climate change. I notice in the detail, because it affects my constituency in particular, that the &#163;800 million flood budget is being supplemented by a &#163;20 million increase, although the increase will be brought forward only from next year, when there will presumably be a compensating cut. The Budget does not include a scheme to compensate those communities located in counties such as Norfolk that face much faster than expected coastal erosion, perhaps in large part due to the action of climate change.</p>

We do not want to force local authorities in that direction. I do not necessarily disagree with an increase in landfill, but we must have compensating support for local authorities to enable them to meet that in an environmentally responsible way.</p>

That would have provided not only a fantastic short-term stimulus, but support for business and local economies, which would have been a long-term investment in this country&#146;s future. It could have been extended to include high-speed rail to Scotland or Wales and the west country. There could have been more investment in innovative ideas such as ultra-light rail, which would work in not only urban areas, but mixed urban, rural and suburban areas such as Gloucestershire. Instead, we have had the very hyped announcements on electric cars&#151;a very new Labour idea. The Liberal Democrats suggested years ago that the EU might be crucial in directing the whole of the new-car market towards electric and zero-carbon vehicles. However, we also said that a short-term investment in the railways would do much more to reduce CO2 than would subsidies to the car industry for vehicles that, although more efficient, would still run on fossil-fuel powered electricity for years to come.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change amply illustrated the clear divide between the two sides of the House.

However, it is interesting to note that the success of our local economy during the period of Labour Government has meant that, although unemployment is starting to rise in Sheffield, that is not happening as quickly as it is nationally. That is completely different from the city&#146;s experience in the 1980s, when our economy was based very largely on steel and engineering. The collapse of those industries had a devastating and dramatic effect, but we now have a much more diversified economy, with a range of different industries. They include education and health provision in the public sector, as well firms in the high-tech, financial and leisure-related sectors. That diversity certainly holds us in better stead to come through what nevertheless will clearly be a difficult period.</p>

 I am glad to hear that unemployment is not rising in Sheffield as quickly as it is elsewhere.

 Of course, the rate at which unemployment is rising depends on the base from which it starts. I can comment with particular knowledge about my city of Sheffield, and that is what I will do. As I have pointed out, we certainly benefited from the period of a Labour Government and their actions.</p>

Nor should we forget about the Advanced manufacturing park, which is located just in Rotherham but works with the university of Sheffield. Through that partnership we are now working to redress a long-term British problem, which is that we do well in research and invention, but not so very well in innovating and extending that research and invention into products. That is what the Advanced manufacturing park is all about, and its work with Boeing and a number of other high-tech companies will spin off into jobs for the future.</p>

A management buy-out of a firm in difficulties a few years ago, Davy Markham now has an order book for months ahead and is exporting most of its work. The managing director said to me, &#147;I can take on any skilled machinist who walks through the door, because we are successful and producing products that are needed.&#148; Davy Markham makes massive machining products for turbines and other parts.

One of the problems for those firms is the legacy of the lack of training for so many years after the recessions of the 1980s, the effects of which still lingers today. We took away a swathe of skilled operatives and did not train any more. Therefore, firms such as Davy Markham are still suffering today from a shortage of experienced, skilled operatives, even though they run their own training schemes. We must ensure that the recession of the day does not leave for the future the sorts of legacies that we suffered from after the recessions of the 1980s. I therefore welcome the help being given to businesses through capital allowances, the deferment of business rates and the strategic investment fund. All are important to ensure that our successful high-tech firms with export markets are sustained for the future, and helped and encouraged to train the people who will be needed when the recovery comes.</p>

I also hope that some of the measures that we have taken to support industry will help to sustain and develop firms in the green transport sector, which is something that I am particularly keen on. Indeed, I have two ministerial meetings arranged with two companies in my constituency that have some very interesting proposals.</p>

That is an interesting development, because it means that we do not need a great network of sites throughout the country; rather, people can use the unit in their own homes.

If we can produce an environmentally friendly car that people still enjoy driving, that must make success in tackling climate change a real possibility.

ITM is looking at the possibility of turning the energy produced by offshore wind farms into hydrogen, storing it under the North sea and using the pipelines from the North sea as a means of bringing it onshore. It is a concept at this stage; it is an idea, but it is exciting and interesting and, again, something in which we have the potential to become a world leader.

It says that it can achieve a 40 per cent. fuel saving on an HGV or a bus. It is a practical proposal. The technology is there; it works.

I argue strongly that, as well as a line to Birmingham, we can take a line off from Rugby&#151;the old Great Central line&#151;and run it through between Nottingham and Derby up between Sheffield and Rotherham and on to Leeds. There is no reason why we should think simply about one line. A line to Leeds via Nottingham and Derby and Sheffield and another line going up to Manchester seems to provide an entirely sensible system if we then have a proper link through the Woodhead tunnel linking the west of the country with the east. The possibilities for rail are real, and I hope that the Government remain committed to them, because their development would be good for British industry, for the travelling public and for the environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90423-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09042347000525">I welcome the extra money for the Warm Front programme, but tenants who live in social housing are still at a disadvantage because the work permitted under that programme is available to owner-occupiers and private tenants on particular benefits, but not to social housing tenants. It is not just a matter of insulation&#151;often houses in the social housing sector are well insulated&#151;but often a problem with old and antiquated boilers. If social housing tenants had assistance through the Warm Front programme, we could do an awful lot to make their homes more energy efficient and save those tenants money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="90423-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09042347000526">It is absolutely right that the Government are targeting help on unemployed young people and the long-term unemployed. Again, I go back to the 1980s in Sheffield. We are still suffering today from the problems caused when the breadwinner of families became unemployed in the 1980s, never got back into work and invalidity benefits were seen as a substitute for jobs. As a result, one generation after another has remained unemployed. We have to recognise that long-term unemployment is a major social problem as well as an economic one, and we must ensure that we focus on those people. It is often easy to forget about them. With more people becoming unemployed, those who have been unemployed the longest and who perhaps have the fewest skills are often forgotten about altogether because they are the hardest to deal with. We must not let that happen now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90423-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09042347000527">When people lose their jobs, it is also important to ensure that they do not lose their homes as well. The Government have already taken steps to ensure that people who end up on income support get help with their mortgage payments after three months, rather than nine months. That was a good step, as is the home owners mortgage support scheme that was announced this week. That scheme will be important, because it is not usually the whole family that goes on to income support. Instead, one family member might become unemployed or go on to short-time working, but the family as a whole relies on both people working full time to support the mortgage. That is why our support for home owners needs to become more flexible in enabling them to keep their homes. When one member of a family becomes unemployed, the family as a whole does not get income support, and it is going to struggle to pay the mortgage. The home owners mortgage support scheme therefore represents an excellent step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90423-0013.htm_para4"><a name="09042347000528">In questions earlier this week, I raised the issue of private tenants with the Housing Minister. More people are going to get into difficulty when the owner of a property&#151;sometimes on a buy-to-let mortgage, but sometimes not&#151;defaults on their mortgage, and the private tenants, who have paid their rent and done  <br>

nothing wrong, suddenly find that their home is at risk. I know that the Government have an agreement to extend the period of notice involved, and I have some sympathy with the mortgage lenders in this regard. When they offer a buy-to-let mortgage, it is clear to them that tenants will be in the property. Unfortunately, however, some home owners with an ordinary mortgage subsequently let their property without telling the lender, which can lead to real difficulties. We have to take that issue on board, and I was pleased that the Housing Minister recognised that that problem still exists and that the Government need to introduce further measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90423-0013.htm_para5"><a name="09042347000529">I also welcome the help for building more homes, for buying up empty houses, including those on sites where private developers have not been able to sell, and for encouraging local authorities to begin building programmes. We must think about the longer-term issues as well, however. The Government have set a target for 40,000 units of social rented housing to be built each year, but that target is unlikely to be hit, even with this extra help, for the simple reason that section 106 agreements are no longer coming to fruition because the private schemes that would have delivered them are not being built.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="90423-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09042347000530">Also, housing associations are in difficulties because most of them rely on a mix of funding for their schemes. They get some money from the social housing grant and some from building houses for sale on the same site as their rental properties, which involves cross-subsidising. As there is now greater uncertainty about whether those houses will be sold, the housing associations cannot get private finance and many of their schemes are simply not happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90423-0013.htm_para7"><a name="09042347000531">There is therefore going to be a real problem hitting the 40,000 target, even with these extra measures. If there is to be any chance of moving forward on building social housing for rent at the moment, the Government must make it absolutely clear that they will provide the money to local authorities that are prepared to provide their land for free in order to make these schemes happen. There is a challenge for local authorities up and down the country to come into partnership with the Government and to get social housing grant, but they then need to make that grant go further by putting their land in for free in order to get homes built in their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="90423-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09042347000532">Local authorities often moan about the shortage of housing, and there is a real shortage up and down the country. That problem becomes more stark when people cannot afford to buy or cannot get a mortgage. More people are therefore going on to local authority waiting lists, and there is a real shortage of rented housing. This is certainly true of my own constituency; I get people contacting me about this problem almost every day. However, local authorities must be prepared to step up to the mark and recognise that this is a priority for them as well as for the Government.</p>

It was only a year ago that we were welcoming people from the Czech Republic, Poland and many other places to help us to sustain our house building and to carry out home improvements through  <br>

Demand will not have gone away, but we will have had a period without adequate supply, in which people have not been trained and others have been lost to the industry. When demand comes back, the resulting shortage of capacity could lead to another sharp upward spike in house prices. How we cope with that and retain people in the industry&#151;we need to retain people in skilled manufacturing jobs as well&#151;is a real challenge.</p>

If the Government had assisted with that, we might have been able to retain more skilled workers. That challenge still has to be met.</p>

In many countries on the continent, diesel is much cheaper than petrol. Why cannot we offer diesel at the pumps for at least the same price as petrol? Why do we have this price differential, which encourages people to buy less fuel-efficient cars? The Government should have a word with the industry about that with a view to mitigating some of the extra costs.</p>

Clearly, we have a problem with binge drinking, which is mainly about crates of cheap lager from the supermarkets getting into the hands of young people, and I am sure that we have all heard complaints from our constituents from time to time about that sort of activity. However, we face a fundamental problem in terms of the demise of the British pub as a community institution, so carrying on regardless putting up the beer duty will have an impact. The problem is not just one for the Government. The other day, I met a group of tenants in my constituency who work for Enterprise Inns; they did not point their fingers at the Government, but said that, in their calculations, Enterprise Inns could make a pound a pint on the beer it sold, so perhaps putting 2p on beer duty was not the real issue. Nevertheless, the Government need to be sensitive about this point. Yes, of course we are against binge drinking; yes, of course we want sensible measures to deal with it; but if that means putting at risk community institutions such as pubs, we need to be very careful indeed. I urge the Government to think again.</p>

It is working with local people, and David Slater, who has worked closely with me and the council on these matters, is involved. British Waterways is a key part of the regeneration, so we were a little concerned that in stretching its assets, the Treasury might be looking at fire sales of some property. I hope that I am receiving signals of reassurance that British Waterways will not be forced to sell off much of the land around the canal. That may be necessary at some point in the future, but British Waterways has a very good track record of sensitively developing that sort of land and the surrounding buildings, so gaining maximum value for local communities, stimulating wider regeneration and using such properties on the land appropriately. I am not sure that it is a good idea simply to sell the land off to private speculators who may not develop it in the near future, and may develop it badly when they eventually do develop it.

 Let me begin by saying something about personal debt. Many people throughout the country are extremely worried about their personal finances during what will be&#151;notwithstanding the Chancellor&#146;s announcement yesterday&#151;a long and deep recession. They are worried about their jobs and their housing problems and, elderly people, in particular are worried about what will happen to the income on which they rely from investments, especially building society and bank savings accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="90423-0013.htm_para16"><a name="09042347000547">We know that even before the recession started, the savings ratio had halved under the stewardship of this Labour Government. That should have sounded a loud warning bell to Ministers, but they were very tardy in attempting to do anything about it. When people lose the incentive to save&#151;to put money aside for a rainy day, or perhaps to fix the roof while the sun is shining&#151;it is a very serious matter, not just for them personally but because it changes the culture in the country. It affects people&#146;s feeling that they have a personal responsibility to put money aside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90423-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09042347000548">For many years, I have been concerned about the way in which the younger generation&#151;by which I mean young people of working age, many of them bringing up young families&#151;have taken account of the experience of their mums and dads, who have suffered under this Government as a result of the erosion of their pensions. The former Chancellor&#146;s hundred-billion-and-counting taxation raid on pension funds means that many people now do not have the funds that they expected to receive. All too often, their adult children think of what has happened to mum and dad and ask, &#147;What is the point of putting money into a pension?&#148;. That should be a worry for us all, and for them in particular, but the Government do not appear to have recognised that the problem has been building up over many years. Now that we are experiencing this appalling recession, the problems of pensioners and those about to retire are particularly acute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90423-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09042347000549">The Government had an opportunity yesterday to remove the basic rate of taxation on people with investment income, but failed to take it. Although I welcome the Chancellor&#146;s announcement of an increase in the tax-free amounts in personal individual savings accounts, many people on fixed incomes, especially the pensioner population&#151;a great many pensioners live in my rural Devon constituency&#151;do not necessarily have the capital to put into an ISA. They have depended on interest on which they have drawn regularly to pay essential household bills, including bills for utilities such as fuel, and they feel extremely vulnerable now that interest rates are falling while they continue to be taxed on their income if the aggregate is above the tax threshold. Price reductions do not necessarily help them. In February this year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that the poorest pensioners&#151;those over the age of 80&#151;faced an inflation rate of 6.7 per cent., more than four times the rate affecting the general population, because of the types of products and services on which the very elderly rely.</p>

of the population. Interest rates have fallen, and those with modest savings who rely on interest rates to supplement their income have been hit particularly hard. Therefore, I regret that the Government did not take the opportunity to adopt what was a Conservative policy. They have adopted Conservative policies in the past, such as on inheritance tax. Had they done so on this occasion, I promise that I would not have stood here today and said, &#147;You&#146;ve pinched one of our policies&#148;; instead, I would have warmly welcomed the abolition of the 20 per cent. tax rate on investment income for basic rate taxpayers.</p>

 This is an important point, and all Members will have encountered constituents who raise such concerns. Does the hon. Lady agree that it is important that people with modest savings whose income from those savings has decreased should look at the changes to the capital arrangements for pension credit? It is, of course, just the income that is taken into account, but nevertheless a raising of the threshold will have a huge impact, and some people might look at pension credit as being a sensible way of supplementing their income in the current difficult circumstances they face, even if they do not like claiming benefits.</p>

 The hon. Lady raises a good point, and that will help some pensioners, although not all. She also points to an issue that I hope the Government will take very seriously. Will they, through various agencies such as the citizens advice bureaux and Age Concern, redouble their efforts to ensure that anybody who is entitled to a state benefit, whether means-tested or not, is encouraged to apply for it and is assisted in obtaining it as soon as possible? I have held surgeries with my own CAB offices to encourage pensioners to apply for various benefits that they were entitled to but did not know they were entitled to, or&#151;to pick up on the point the hon.

Nevertheless, I think that we as Members of Parliament, and certainly the Government, should do all we can to make the process as dignified and simple as possible. In this recession, there is an enhanced opportunity for the Government to do all they can to make sure the statutory bodies, voluntary services and charitable agencies encourage more people who are entitled to apply for such benefits to do so.

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09042347000562">When we first introduced the regulation of financial services in the mid-&#146;80s, before I was elected, it seemed on the face of it that there was a very sensible way forward. Financial advisers, whoever they worked for&#151;even if they were linked to a financial institution but were working independently&#151;would carry out an analysis of somebody&#146;s financial needs. In giving best advice, as it was called at the time, they would need to ensure that the product that they were selling was right for that person and that they could afford to pay the premiums or put capital in. The advisers were regulated and checked to ensure that they did so. All of a sudden, out of the blue, every department store, every chain store and every bank could market products through the post, over the phone&#151;and now over the internet&#151;without the same criterion of best advice applying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09042347000563">The principle of best advice was right but, for some reason, it went wrong, and there were loopholes in it. I do not think that the answer is over-regulation. It is common sense to ensure that there is a level playing field wherever we regulate. If we do not have that level playing field, people will take advantage. When they take advantage by selling their products, however they sell them, the person who loses out is usually the poor investor who puts their money on the line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09042347000564">Let me move on to something else. I realise that today&#146;s debate is going to consider housing, in particular, and I want to touch on one aspect of that&#151;that is, park homes. We have an all-party group on park home owners, of which I am a member, and I know that a few years ago the Government made some changes to the anachronistic rules that govern the purchase and sale of park homes. In a recession, park homes offer a wonderful opportunity for low-cost housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09042347000565">There are several park homes in my constituency, and although they are not exclusively occupied by pensioners, many people who have not owned their own home or have owned a very small home move to a park home when they retire&#151;that releases a lump sum, too&#151;so a lot of elderly people live in them. Will the Government look again at the rules that apply to the sale and purchase of park homes, as they missed the opportunity to do so yesterday? There is no doubt that we still have what I would regard as restrictive practices in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09042347000566">I understand that site owners are business people who need to make a profit. Nobody is suggesting for one minute that they do not have a material interest in the sale and purchase of park homes. However, the way in which people are obliged to purchase a new home from a particular supplier and the way in which a cut of  <br>

the sale price goes back to the park home owner is anachronistic in this day and age. I want the Government to think of the recession as an opportunity to look favourably on park homes and consider them as a way of providing more low-cost housing. Such housing would be more readily provided by park homes than by the construction industry, which seems to be moribund. If the Government plan to help the construction industry, I hope that they will equally consider the park home industry, provided that they take a fresh look at the way in which people who purchase homes from site owners are treated under the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09042347000567">We have heard a lot about helping people on low incomes with energy costs. I have been in correspondence for nearly a year with various Ministers&#151;I received yet another reply today, which was very negative&#151;on the subject of those park home owners who are on sites where the landlord provides the fuel, which is usually liquefied petroleum gas and is often metered. The landlord sells the fuel to all the people on the site, and they are locked into a pricing regime over which they no control whatsoever. It seems that just about everybody else has the opportunity to shop around, to change supplier and to get the best deal that they can, yet these people are locked in. I have had a letter from a Minister yet again today to say that the Government have no intention of changing the regime. I do not believe that it would be that difficult to change it, and I ask the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, to look at that, as well as at the issue of the selling and purchase of park homes.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a powerful point on park homes. Through her, may I make the point to those on the Treasury Bench that many people on low incomes live in park homes for most of the year? They may be paying rather a high price for the fuel that heats those homes, which are often poorly insulated. When I go into many of my constituents&#146; park homes, I find them there with many plugged-in electric heaters, and that costs them a fortune. They often have historical industrial conditions such as emphysema. It is important that the Government take seriously the insulation and the standard of those homes to ensure that those people, who, as I say, are often on low incomes, do not find that most of their money goes on keeping themselves warm.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that. I know that the all-party group on park home owners has made representations to Ministers on those issues. We are talking about low-cost initiatives that would make a difference. They would not necessarily affect the Treasury figures&#151;particularly not the changes to the regulations that I asked for&#151;but would certainly help a lot of people. They might encourage more people to buy and live in park homes at a time when low-cost housing is absolutely essential.</p>

end of a Labour Government. They leave the country bust. Nothing in the Budget, or in what has been said in the debate so far, makes me think that the situation will be any less serious when it comes to the inheritance left by this Government; in fact, it will be a great deal more serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09042347000571">I mentioned the generation of those who are 80 and over, and I mentioned the savings culture. There is a culture in the British spirit that says that when we are up against it, we will go without certain items to make sure that we get things right. We saw that in the wartime spirit in the second world war, and we have seen it on other occasions. The British public are intelligent enough and tough enough to know that we are going into a period of great austerity. They want honesty from their politicians and their Government. If there are difficult choices to make, they want to see those choices clearly laid before them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09042347000572">Yesterday&#146;s Budget was dishonest. It deferred until after the general election a lot of tax cuts and swingeing impositions on people who are not the wealthiest in the country. The Government may argue, &#147;It&#146;s until the downturn picks up,&#148; but nobody believes that the downturn will pick up by the end of this year, and we have heard all the independent evidence that corroborates the view that it will not pick up. None the less, I think that people will understand it if politicians stand up and say to them, &#147;No, sorry, we cannot afford it,&#148; or &#147;Yes, it is our intention to do or provide certain things with your taxes, but because of the situation that we are in, the imperative must be to get the economy of this country back on to a stable footing.&#148; We are old enough to know what happens if we do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09042347000573">If we do not get the economy back on to a stable footing and we go into a period of what I would describe as funny money, in which the whole economy collapses and the currency is a paper currency only, that will a very serious situation. It is about time that the Government treated the British population as grown-ups. Instead of kicking things into the long grass when action is needed now, the Government should grasp the problem, which is with us today and will be with us for a very long time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para11"><a name="09042347000574">The Financial Secretary is a reasonable and honest man, so I am sorry to have to direct these remarks to him rather than to some of his colleagues. None the less, both he and I understand what collective responsibility means. The Government are leaving it far too late to take the right action to restore the economy of this country and that is a grave disservice to the British people. They have been through trials and tribulations in their history and they will not baulk at understanding that we are in a serious situation that calls for serious measures. The Government must rethink what they have told the House over the past 24 hours, because it will clearly not solve the problems.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning). I agreed strongly with all her comments about debt and the role of park homes, but of course we parted company at the end of her speech when she started to talk about just a quarter of the last century when Labour Governments were in control. My recollection is that those Governments had to redress the appalling lack of investment in our public services&#151;in our hospitals and in our schools, where children were taught in leaky school buildings with outside toilets. If there was a price to pay, I think it was one worth paying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09042347000578">When the debate started, I became depressed. I enjoy the cut and thrust of debates in the Chamber, but there were times when there was inappropriate guffawing from Opposition Members at what was meant to be a serious contribution to efforts to get the country out of the most appalling global difficulties. Then I heard the shadow Chancellor planning the Conservative poster campaign by saying that Crawley would be a target for the Conservatives&#146; inheritance tax and tax credit plans. Frankly, I hope they do that, because none of my constituents will benefit from their inheritance tax plans, whereas 10,500 families will be badly affected by their plans to cut tax credits. Such an Opposition campaign would be a very positive move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09042347000579">I shall concentrate on how we can reduce carbon output in the power we use. We desperately need to do that as quickly as we can. Earlier, we heard an incredibly heartening statement about the carbon capture and storage scheme. It will certainly be heartening in my constituency, where the company Doosan Babcock, which is developing many of the new technologies, has its headquarters. It was interesting to hear Members say that the statement had come far too late, because in fact the technology is untested. It is very new. We are the first country to commit to such investment at that level and I am delighted that we are doing so. I certainly hope that the effort, investment and research that Doosan Babcock has put into carbon capture and storage will pay dividends for the company in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09042347000580">The reason why I take an interest in such matters is that just a few short steps away from Doosan Babcock&#146;s headquarters is another company, of which Members may be aware, called Ceres Power. It appears that Ceres Power is one of those companies that could offer the answer to many of our home power needs. It has developed a brand new fuel cell&#151;a very interesting technology, in which many people throughout the world are hugely interested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para15"><a name="09042347000581">It is great that in my constituency there are two companies with very different ways of trying to reduce our use of power and our carbon output&#151;one an older technology that uses the very best research to deal with  <br>

coal burning, and the other a fuel cell that holds enormous potential. Both received a good lift and encouragement from the Budget, and I am delighted about that. When I revisit those companies, I will be able to hold my head up and say that this Government are serious&#151;particularly given the strategic investment fund, which I hope will take those new technologies further along the line. They have already had plenty of money from the Government to continue their research, but I sincerely hope that they will be able to move to the next phase and, for example, put fuel cells in people&#146;s homes, so that we can genuinely see that they work. I see the Budget&#151;particularly proposals to try to reduce our carbon output&#151;as adding to a jigsaw of other measures and building on work that has been going on for a long time to ensure that we continue to play a world-leading role in those technologies. It is a pleasure to represent a constituency that is taking part in such activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para16"><a name="09042347000582">I shall focus the majority of the rest of my speech on housing, which has truly become one of those subjects that occupy not only people who go to advice surgeries, but young people, for whom access to housing has become a critical issue. It is the key to answering many problems as we try to tackle the global downturn. It is difficult to look at any one subject in isolation, but, if we encourage housing development, as I expect the Budget to, many other issues&#151;education, training, job opportunities for people&#151;will become part of the whole package. There is also an opportunity to ensure that the proposed homes are the best in terms of environmental soundness and liveability for families. That is why I was delighted by the release of the new money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para17"><a name="09042347000583">Central to all that development is the fact that we must allow our local authorities to play a part in developing housing. We tend to bandy about &#147;affordability&#148;, and the Library had a good stab at trying to define it. I find it extremely difficult, however, to sit in my surgery opposite a lovely young couple who have recently married and are saving furiously but have nowhere near enough for the price of a small flat in my constituency&#151;even though, thank goodness, the amount that can be borrowed has been reduced to three times a person&#146;s salary. People in the south of England face problems of affordability and they will find it extremely difficult to access housing, even with the new HomeBuy scheme and access to shared equity programmes, but attempts to tackle scarcity, which is at the heart of the housing problem in the south-east, will assist those young people enormously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para18"><a name="09042347000584">We are fighting tooth and nail for a university centre in Crawley, because, again, it is part of the jigsaw of keeping our young people in the town and giving them the education that they deserve and the job opportunities that they so badly want. No measure can be taken in isolation, but we have to make sure that we can house people decently. I am extremely pleased that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing is now giving serious consideration to allowing local authorities to play their part in developing housing projects within our towns and communities. They are key to most of the things that happen; they understand how a community needs to exist and know that housing development without any of the services that make houses decent places to live does not reflect how we want to develop in the future.</p>

have the opportunity to come into homes in a lovely community such as Crawley. Such places have neighbourhoods with pubs, shops, churches and community centres. Local authorities must be at the heart of the decision making and they must be able to develop housing in the way that we believe is right and proper. People deserve to live in homes with an environmental rating of at least &#147;very good&#148; so that they do not spend most of their money on fuel and so that they can be proud of their new homes for many decades.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para20"><a name="09042347000586">I hope that you can see, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I am keen for local authorities to play their part and get access, so the extra &#163;100 million for local authorities to develop their housing was very welcome. We also have to consider the quality of the services offered by those local authorities into the future. Before we allow Government money to be placed in the hands of a housing authority, we must make sure that it is held in the highest regard. I shall press Ministers to ensure that, as the scheme goes ahead&#151;I certainly hope that Crawley borough council will take advantage of it&#151;the highest-quality local authorities are able to take part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para21"><a name="09042347000587">Another part of the jigsaw is the negative subsidy of many local authorities. I applaud and support those who have bought their council homes, but in Crawley, where there were more than 20,000 council homes, fewer than 8,000 are left in the control of the local authority. I want the local authority not to give up the principle of having a housing pool, but to be allowed to use more of the money to continue to build new homes and to improve the homes of existing tenants to the decent homes standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="90423-0014.htm_para22"><a name="09042347000588">There are lots of competing arguments. The one thing that stops me from being flippant or taking part in all the shouting and jeering today is that tomorrow I will probably have to sit in front of a hard-pressed business man who is trying to hang on to his business, which employs fewer than 10 people in these difficult times; I will look into the eyes of a man who is working hard and trying to find out what the Government can offer. There are numerous schemes to help him, particularly the ability of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to delay payments. That is incredibly welcome for many companies. There are also hard-pressed families who have difficulties with mortgage payments and are looking to see how they can be helped. The Budget certainly allows such help. However, it is difficult to be jolly at a time such as this.</p>

They may well go to their local bingo hall on a Friday night to have a little bit of fun and let their hair down. Will she sympathise with them when they see that bingo duty has been put up in this Budget and that in the next three years &#163;105 million extra will be taken from bingo players?

 I remind the House of my interests recorded in the register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para0"><a name="09042347000595">This year&#146;s Budget had to meet three crucial tests: to focus real help on those hardest hit by the recession; to start to rebalance our economy and put it back on a path towards sustainable growth; and, of course, to put the public finances back under control. Some of the Budget&#146;s measures to give real help to the hardest hit are welcome, particularly those to help people back into the labour market as quickly as possible. However, I do not think that the Minister needs reminding that what really matters is that help is real&#151;not just announced, packaged and put up on a website, but working on the ground and getting through in our constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09042347000596">The two groups who obviously need help are home owners, as the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) said, and small businesses. Home owners who may be facing redundancy, through no fault of their own, are still unable to access the help that the Government announced on 3 December&#151;four months ago&#151;and then re-announced earlier this week. It is still not clear exactly who will be eligible or which banks and building societies are participating. That delay has been scandalous because people being made redundant now are already falling behind with their payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09042347000597">Let me give an example from my constituency. A couple living in a village close to mine have both been made redundant&#151;the husband in September and his wife at the end of January. She has been able to find a small part-time job, but because they have some savings they are being told by their lender that they are not entitled to anything more than a three-month payment holiday. I quote:</p>
<a name="90423-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="09042347000875"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In fact we have been advised by several people that NOT ONE of the banks/mortgage companies that have &#145;signed up&#146; to the scheme have helped anyone. In fact one broker was informed by the Halifax that they would only give mortgage holidays to people who were going on holiday as they had a job!&#148;</p>

involved, I generally find that the banks respond quite well. However, local branch managers do not seem to be fully aware of how the schemes should operate, so the help is not getting directly through to the companies that need it most.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09042347000600">I hope that the Minister winding up the debate will assure us that all the schemes that have been announced are now working&#151;including the working capital scheme, which does not seem to be working at all&#151;and yielding results in our constituencies. It is essential that, as the pain continues this year, we try to protect the two groups I have mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09042347000601">Secondly, the Budget was an opportunity to begin to rebalance our economy. If we have learned anything over the past 10 years, it is that it is not enough to depend on a highly leveraged financial sector, an over-extended private housing market and an ever-expanding public sector. That simply does not give us the investment that we need in new industries or the all-round performance that we need as one of the world&#146;s larger economies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para7"><a name="09042347000602">Roughly every year, I ask the Library to rank our country&#146;s gross domestic product per head against all 50 American states. Over the past six or seven years, the answer, surprising as it might be, has been about the same. This country now ranks 45th, coming ahead of only Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Idaho and South Carolina. On GDP per head measured in purchasing parity terms, this country is actually poorer than Oklahoma, which is some achievement after 10 years of ever-increasing public expenditure and the so-called investment strategy of this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09042347000603">Why is that? It is because the three sectors that I mentioned&#151;the highly leveraged financial sector, the overheated housing market and the ever-expanding public sector&#151;have all been fuelled in exactly the same way: by debt and excessive borrowing. The levels of borrowing are simply unsustainable, as we have seen in the banking crisis, and are beginning to unwind, and as they do so we begin to see the damage that has been caused by our overdependence on those three sectors. We see how reliance on debt and leverage has crowded out investment, equity and savings as a basis for the commercial markets, and how our obsession with driving up home ownership even among those who could not afford it&#151;we have all been guilty of that&#151;has crowded out the development of a broader rental market. We have seen how the inflation of the public sector has caused growing resentment among those who are not entitled to the special working practices, protected pensions or early retirement enjoyed by those in the public sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09042347000604">I would have liked this Budget to encourage other things. For example, I would have liked it to encourage equity rather than debt and to look again at how we can back early years funding for the new companies to which the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) referred. This country is not as good at that as the United States. We need to look again at venture capital trusts and how they can be developed, for example by allowing them to invest in secondary markets, as the London Stock Exchange suggested in its Budget submission. Of course, we need to look again at having more and better applied industry-driven research to turn a handful of clusters into serious, knowledge-driven business communities, as has been done much more successfully in the valleys of California and elsewhere.</p>

The deficit that has been announced for the next two or three years is of course appalling, but it is important to understand that a large part of it is structural and has nothing to do with the huge sums that have been put aside to bail out the banks, or the way in which stabilisers kick in and welfare rolls grow during the recession.

Three years ago, they forecast that we would be back in surplus this year. Last year, the forecast was pushed out further to 2011.

They have overestimated revenues and failed to get proper control. There was a time when the job of the Treasury was to control spending. In the past seven or eight years, the Treasury has been directing spending and failing to control it.

 Like the Secretary of State at the beginning of the debate, I was encouraged by the opening remarks by the shadow Chancellor, because I thought that we were at last going to get an inkling of the Conservative way forward in the current financial circumstances. The shadow Chancellor started quite well and indicated that he had five points. For the next 24 minutes of his speech, I was waiting to go through those five points to examine his solutions. First, he told us that we must analyse how we got here, which is fair enough&#151;I probably disagree about how we got here, but such an analysis is a good place to start. He referred to some relatively minor movement of spending priorities that he said were fiscally neutral and would presumably make no overall difference, therefore, to the general strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09042347000614">I might have miscounted, but the shadow Chancellor seemed to get to only three of his five points. His final big point that I noted was that there should be a national debate about how we tackle an age of austerity. We all recognise that the economic situation is very serious: the Conservatives say that it is one of drastic seriousness yet, at a time when urgent action and policies are called for, the central point of the Conservative shadow Chancellor&#146;s policies is a call for a national debate about the age of austerity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09042347000615">That reflects the fact that Conservative Front-Bench Members are, to put it bluntly, too frightened to put forward any policies. They recognise that the public would not like what they would hear if the Opposition were to follow through the logic of positions such as that taken by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon). I give the hon. Gentleman credit for the honesty of his arguments today, but anyone who heard them could not but conclude that his recipe for recovery from the current crisis involves massive cuts in public expenditure that would affect large numbers of public services. We all heard what he said about the need for much more outsourcing in elements of the public sector such as housing, health and education, and I am sure that we will all eagerly enter into debate about those matters in the months to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09042347000616">Conservative Front-Bench Members may not have put forward many ideas today about how we can get out of the current situation, but other people have done so. I am glad to say that the Chancellor has been listening, and that he has implemented many of the more constructive proposals. Many people, organisations and MPs&#151;and I was certainly one of the latter&#151;have urged him to establish a programme for green jobs, arguing that such a programme would allow us to link the need to tackle the challenges of climate change with the need to provide jobs here and now for people facing unemployment.</p>

Therefore, I strongly welcome the plans announced yesterday for funds to provide 100,000 new jobs in socially useful activity, to be delivered through councils and voluntary groups. I welcome in particular the commitment that at least 10,000 of those jobs will be in the green-job sector. When the Government do something for which one has been calling for some time, it is right to recognise the fact. I am certainly glad that the Government have responded in the way that they have, as that will allow us to tackle some green issues and at the same time provide jobs here and now for people who need them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09042347000618">I look forward to finding out more about the proposals shortly, and believe that the concept can be built on and developed. The voluntary sector in particular can play a major role in delivering these jobs as quickly as possible. Even more than local authorities, voluntary organisations can move quickly and come up with sensible and practical schemes that will deliver lasting benefits to local communities.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making a case for the innovative industries, particularly in respect of what he has described as &#147;green jobs&#148;. However, he will know that one feature of previous recessions has been that businesses tend to cut their investment in training and research and development. The Government&#146;s response has been relatively unsuccessful: the R and D tax credit and the Train to Gain schemes do not seem to be reaching small and medium-sized enterprises. My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) spoke about venture capital for early-years and start-up businesses. Why did the Government not do more in that regard in the Budget?</p>

<p><a name="st_o282"><a name="09042347000620"><a name="90423-0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="09042347001219"><b>Mark Lazarowicz:</b>
 If the hon. Gentleman looks in more detail, he will find, for example, that the pledge for 16- to 24-year olds is that every one of them facing long-term unemployment will have the opportunity to take up training. That is precisely the sort of positive measure that the Budget contains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09042347000621">The proposal to create 100,000 new jobs, many of them green jobs in socially useful activity, is one that I certainly welcome. However, I would ask the Government to consider the possibility of extending the scheme even further, to involve more than just younger workers. I understand that there are proposals in the Budget for 50,000 jobs in the programme to be concentrated in those areas of highest unemployment, which is obviously right and proper. However, we have an opportunity to spread the scheme throughout the entire UK once it is up and running, which is something that I would strongly endorse. I look forward to the Government coming up with the details of those proposals, so that they can be put into effect and make a difference to our communities as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para22"><a name="09042347000622">I would also emphasise that it is important not to assume that those environmental jobs are only those that involve clearing up rubbish or physical construction or work in that type of environmental project. Such work is of course important and valuable to the community, but there is a host of other green jobs that could be provided and which would make use of the wide range of talents and skills of those who find themselves without work in the current downturn.

there is interest in environmental education among those in every age group. Work is also to be done in promoting green travel plans for employers and employees. There is also a need not only to install energy efficiency and conservation technology, but to advise people on how to go about saving energy in their daily lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para23"><a name="09042347000623">Those are just some examples of a wide range of green jobs that could be made available through the development of the scheme that has been referred to in the Budget papers. Such jobs will clearly not fill the gap for everyone who is made unemployed in the current downturn, but they can certainly help to tide people over in the current difficult period. Again, let me emphasise that they are jobs that could come on stream in months, and in some cases perhaps weeks, which is what we need. We need to provide people with jobs soon, because they will increasingly feel the effects of the recession in their communities. Action of that type is therefore needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para24"><a name="09042347000624">It is certainly the case that many of the proposals for a low-carbon economy can have relatively quick impacts on employment. However, as I am sure the Minister would be the first to acknowledge, other proposals would take a lot longer to have an effect on jobs, because they require investment programmes that would take some time to result in large numbers of jobs. It is therefore important to consider ways of trying to produce employment opportunities in the short term, as well as in the medium and long terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para25"><a name="09042347000625">That said, the proposals for a low-carbon economy in the Budget as a whole are important, wide-ranging and very much to be welcomed.

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para27"><a name="09042347000627">The chairman of the BWEA said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90423-0015.htm_para28"><a name="09042347000628">I could continue at length, but finally I will quote the Combined Heat and Power Association, which says that the Budget</p>

That is the reality of what people out there in the renewables industry and the low-carbon sector think of the Budget. It is also the kind of message that we should be hearing, not some of the negative messages that we have heard from some Opposition Members today.</p>

Friend the Chancellor was absolutely right to place a major emphasis in his speech and in his proposals on the longer-term economic and industrial strategy, with a focus on the low-carbon economy, as well as on dealing with the immediate economic and financial pressures. He was right to do that for two reasons. First, there are short and medium-term economic and employment benefits to be had from investment in the low-carbon economy. In my constituency, that is particularly relevant because we have had a major reliance on the financial services sector for a number of years. Much of the financial services sector in Edinburgh, as elsewhere, is still doing well, but some of what is happening in the banking sector is bound to have an effect on the local economy, and that will obviously be the case in other areas where the financial services sector has been important.</p>

There are many companies big and small in the renewables sector that are well placed to gain from domestic and international opportunities in the low-carbon economy. There may even be expertise in the banking and financial services sector that could be used in the low-carbon economy. For example, there are interesting proposals for a green bank to use expertise in providing finance for long-term investments in low-carbon technology. That could represent part of a shift in emphasis in banking away from short-term speculation and playing financial markets to longer-term strategies and investment in the real economy, which certainly deserves every encouragement.</p>

They include the demand for resources&#151;energy and food&#151;and environmental pressures, leading to the spread of deserts and an increase in flooding, which we were rightly warned earlier would accelerate as a result of climate change. Some suggest that some of those factors may have already played a part in triggering the current crisis. Certainly, they have every potential for doing so in even more dramatic ways.

It contains hints of the things that the Government think are important. There is a nod in the direction towards dealing with child poverty, for example, and a gesture towards greater progressiveness in the income tax system, but even these are not grasped firmly. I am left with the overwhelming feeling that the Government have run out not only of cash but of political capital and self-belief. I applaud some of the things that they have done, but the figures are so nugatory and limited that their effect will be negligible, given the scale of the overall challenge that we face.</p>

treat the electorate as adults. We can see a sleight of hand at the heart of the Budget statement, which is unforgivable, and I think that the electorate will see through it. That expresses itself in a number of different ways. Earlier, the Secretary of State suggested that this was a case of &#147;We say cuts, they say efficiency savings; let&#146;s call the whole thing off&#148;. The electorate probably will, soon.</p>

The Minister on the Front Bench might find that amusing, but many people, including Labour Assembly Members&#151;and people who have hitherto been Labour voters&#151;will not find it amusing when those measures result in cuts in public services. The Labour First Minister&#151;the leader of the Labour party in Wales&#151;has said that he cannot give any guarantee that there will not be public sector job cuts or cuts in the quality of public services as a result of the changes made in the Budget.</p>

The changes will affect the bottom line there. The Government&#146;s report on the operational efficiency programme praises the efficiency savings programme in Wales. On page 34, it refers to Value Wales and to the savings that have already been made. The First Minister in Wales told the Prime Minister that one would need to be the Archangel Gabriel to find any further efficiency savings in the Welsh Assembly Government. They simply are not there, as what the devolved Administrations by and large do is focus on health, education and public services; there are no armies of project managers and other non-jobs that may abound here in London.</p>

Is it an admission of their inefficiency and the lack of productivity in the public sector? If these are genuinely efficiency savings and not cuts, why have they not been found up until now? Why did the Government, by their own admission, waste public money while the economic situation was far better than the one we face at the moment?</p>

Nobody believes that this is a V shape and that we are suddenly going to bounce back from the worst fall in economic output in the post-war period. It has never happened&#151;not once in the post-war period&#151;that we have bounced back to a reasonable level of growth in the second year. That is clear if one looks at the Government&#146;s own table on page 200 of the Red Book. All the post-war recessions have involved either a second year of output reduction or minimal and negligible growth, which happened in the early 1990s. The British economy has never bounced back, as I say, in the second year. Nobody believes that.</p>

 Absolutely. This recession is much deeper than all the other examples that are cited. The other factor, of course, is the global economic outlook, which was different in the 1990s&#151;the example most often cited by the Government as the comparator for this recession. If anything, this recession is closer to what happened in the 1980s. The three great drivers of economic growth in the UK&#151; exports in the global economy, financial services and the housing boom&#151;have all gone, so where is the basis for this projected incredible growth? Suddenly, it appears, after next year, we are going to re-enter the golden days and a halcyon era will be born again. That is the only way anything close to the Government&#146;s projections on tax revenue will be realised.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making a studious argument and he is right. Does he accept that growth over the last 12 years was predicated on two bases&#151;first, borrowing, both Government and personal; and, secondly, state or Government spending&#151;and given that neither will apply, the economy cannot possibly bounce out of the recession in the way the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on it. There is a structural demand gap and an output gap in the British economy, and the loss of the financial services sector means a once-and-for-all loss of about 2 per cent. of non-inflationary economic output, which will certainly have repercussions for many years to come. It is absolutely right that the public sector was a major driver, but that will not be there either.</p>

There was a recovery in 1980-81, but the effect of the fiscal stimulus America had embarked upon fell off, taking the country back into recession in 1982. A double-dip recession is as likely as any other scenario, because the growth in public-sector spending is falling.</p>

 The point that I was making, which I think the hon. Gentleman accepts, is that the basis of economic success over the past 12 years was flimsy. The case that he seems to be making is that the response to the recession must not be equally flimsy. In other words, if we invest in infrastructural improvement, we can shorten the recession and make it more shallow, but if our response to it is flimsy, like the one in the USA which he described, the recovery is likely also to be temporary.</p>

 I am one of those who say that if we are to rip up the public balances, we had better make sure that we do it with a comprehensive strategy in place. We have not seen such a strategy from the Government. I advocate a radical fiscal expansion on the Obama model, which is based on long-term investment in the economy. David Blanchflower has made a similar point, as has the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.

 If we add up the figures, we may find that I am wrong, but the pre-Budget report mentioned a stimulus of about &#163;21 billion. According to my analysis, the maximum in terms of active stimulating measures in the Budget is not much more than an additional &#163;5 billion. That does not compare with the &#163;820 billion to which the Obama plan amounts in toto, and it is a fraction of what others have demanded. David Blanchflower called for a &#163;90 billion stimulus in the Budget, and the NIESR called for a similar figure&#151;&#163;50 billion or &#163;60 billion.

However, most people might not have the time to plough through the 280-odd pages of the Red Book in the way that we Members do, and it is important that the public realise that we will be paying for the mistakes that have been made in economic policy and the management of the public finances for many years to come.</p>

If he wants to compare us with the United States, the tables in the Red Book that have been referred to show that the Americans did implement a large number of discretionary measures, but that was because their automatic stabilisers were so small that they had to have a much bigger discretionary package to deal with the pressures they were facing as a result of the same global recession that we have experienced. Our discretionary package is smaller because our automatic stabilisers are larger&#151;by and large, in line with those of our European partners, with whom our welfare packages and tax systems are also much more closely aligned.

 A lot of people did. It is now really important to learn the lessons of what happened and to work out not only how to prevent it from happening again, which is not the subject of this debate, but how to build our way out of the difficulties that we have experienced. The Government have been very bold&#151;some might say excessively bold&#151;in what they have done through the asset protection scheme and the asset purchase facilities that have been extended.

The fiscal stimulus package that he wanted was not huge, and its main focus was a measure to deal with what happens to young people who miss out. The focus in the Budget on the opportunities for 16 to 24-year-olds is very important, even though it is perhaps more modest than David Blanchflower might have liked. I want to see the detail of these provisions because I want quality schemes to be provided, unlike the youth training schemes, youth opportunity schemes and so on that we saw before.

I am pleased that the Budget has dealt, to an extent, with both those points. More money is being put in, particularly for new builds, which are extremely important, through local authorities and in conjunction with the private sector, in order to ensure the provision of a range of housing and tenures.

Secondly, local building firms should clearly be given the opportunity to compete for contracts with the very big contractors on a level playing field. Particularly at present, some of the big building firms will try to keep themselves going by picking up public sector work, and the pricing will be very competitive. Unless we make sure that we support small and medium-sized building firms and enable them to keep going, we might find that when the upturn comes, we have the brickies and the plasterers, but not the contract managers and the people who can look after the range of types of contract that we will need.</p>

It is vital that the money starts flowing again for the provision of mortgages. The most recent figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show that there have been improvements.

Friend the Exchequer Secretary to make absolutely sure that banks that have received public funds stick to their obligations to maintain their 2007 lending levels, and that we get reports quarterly, not just annually. That way, we can be absolutely certain that the banks that the public bailed out are now supporting the public by providing the lending that is needed for recovery.</p>

as the mortgage rescue scheme is not huge. There is a range of different measures targeted to support different groups of people. Furthermore, although it might sound cruel, the reduction in house prices will help first-time buyers, and the Building Societies Association projects that that reduction still has a bit further to go.

Those questions will become more acute now that spending is tighter. As a number of Members on both sides of the House have said, we have to make sure that public spending counts and is even more effective than it has been so far. We need to look at how we provide services and think about not just how we cut, but how we reconfigure. By any measure, cutting services year on year until 2015 would probably destroy the morale of everybody who came into public service, because, by and large, they do so to make sure that public services are provided.</p>

agencies. We need to take a hard look at them, so that we can have not necessarily a smaller state, but certainly a flatter one without so many quangoes and hierarchies of structure. For example, I know of one town where there are two chief executives sitting across the road from one another&#151;I suspect my colleague on the Conservative Benches, the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), knows about them too. Each of those executives draws a large salary and each has a large bureaucracy serving exactly the same community.

It considers two models: one would make cuts, but PWC finds that completely unacceptable, because it would mean a level of cuts that we had never seen in the public sector; and the other would raise taxes, combining a 2 per cent. rise in VAT, a 1 per cent. rise in all national insurance contribution rates and a &#163;5 billion increase in green taxes, which, again, would test public patience past breaking point.</p>

For example, over the time scales in the Budget, there are projected savings in back-office operations and IT of &#163;8 billion, in collaborative procurements of about &#163;24 billion, and in properties and facilities of about &#163;5 billion. Those figures are indicative, but they certainly posit that, if we think carefully about the services that the public want, the way they want to access them and how they are provided, in a very different world where people want more say and do not want people to purchase for them&#151;in other words where purchasing power is with the public, not with an institution&#151;we can maintain the quality and quantity of public services to which people have become accustomed and still make sensible savings that chime much more with the public mood than heavy tax rises or public spending cuts ever would.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to point to the potential savings from collaborative procurement.

Does she agree that such differences must be driven out? Those are potential efficiency savings that would not impact on the front line.</p>

 I completely agree that there is scope for efficiency savings. It points to changes to the way in which services are provided, so that, instead of having multi-tiered delivery agencies between a Department and the public, the public have much more direct control over the way in which services are provided. That involves much careful thought about service design, implications and ensuring equal access for disadvantaged groups that do not have the same clout as others. It also means ensuring that the people who work for such agencies&#151;an awful lot of whom are women&#151;do not suddenly lose their jobs. Given the current situation and attitudes towards public services, it is important that we think carefully about how our polices are designed and how services are provided.

In fact, the small print says that there is a 3 per cent. flat fee to start with, and that after the six-month period the normal variable rate will apply. One would think that with the base rate at 0.5 per cent., the variable rate for credit cards should be falling, but instead it is rising.

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady, who shares my concern about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09042347000715">I wish to refer to a specific instance in my constituency. There is an international company headquartered there, with a turnover of &#163;170 million a year and 248 employees. It has a &#163;16 million loan, which it is not seeking to extend. Its bank is one of the nationalised banks, and the rate is linked to 1 per cent. above base rate. If the Government&#146;s policy was working, interest rates for that company should fall. But what has this nationalised bank done? It has said, &#147;Oh, no. You&#146;re not going to have 1 per cent. over base, you&#146;re going to have 4 per cent. over LIBOR.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09042347000716">The company has already had to lay workers off because of the recession. The hike in interest rates means that it will pay an additional &#163;640,000 a year, and to cover that it would have to lay off 20 people. The only way in which it could cover the increase imposed by the nationalised bank would be to lay off 20 people in the research and development department. Although that would cover the costs in the short term, it would greatly damage the future of a leading local company in a field in which it is imperative to remain at the forefront of development. The research and development department is at the cutting edge and does groundbreaking work. It is developing products for use in wind farms and products that reduce weight for transportation&#151;two areas that the Government want to promote. Job cuts to the department would be a huge loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09042347000717">On top of the significant extra cost that the company faces during the recession, the bank is charging unjustified fees. For example, it has demanded that the company&#146;s budget projections are audited at a cost of &#163;25,000. In effect, it is imposing a &#163;25,000 fee that will merely prove that the company&#146;s projections are right. We are not talking about a new company or a fly-by-night company; we are talking about an international company that has been in existence for a long time and is extremely well known.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09042347000718">The Government have announced a number of schemes to help businesses through the downturn, but that company has not been able to access any funds. It appears that a successful, innovative and respected company based in the UK does not qualify for that money. Lots of money that is inaccessible to businesses is sloshing around quangos, and numerous Government schemes, most of which are not even operating, have been announced. For example, only one agreement has been signed as part of the working capital scheme, which Lord Mandelson announced in January and which was said to be &#147;going live&#148; on 16 January 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para18"><a name="09042347000719">The position looks even more pitiful if we compare it with the practical help being provided abroad. In France, research and development operations are being encouraged  <br>

through a scheme that covers 50 per cent. of the cost of staffing research and development projects. That practical help will ensure that those companies come out of the recession with a bright future. It is not surprising that the company in my area is having seriously to consider expanding its research and development project abroad, despite having a firm preference to locate it in the United Kingdom. Surely the Government should be encouraging successful businesses to remain in UK and not to go to France. Do not forget that the company in my constituency is a well established, international company that is based locally and at the cutting edge of its field. Instead of receiving help and support in the recession, it is being punished by a nationalised bank and this Government. The schemes that have been implemented are simply not working, and the help that is available overseas is threatening to encourage companies from this country to relocate abroad. The Government&#146;s policies are failing. They are failing the company in my constituency; they are failing thousands of companies across the country; and they are failing the British people.</p>

 I came along today hoping to discuss the environmental and energy aspects of the Budget, which, to be fair, includes some quite good measures in that respect. Unfortunately, we were treated at the outset to a Punch and Judy show between Front Benchers on the question of cuts. Whether one calls it an efficiency saving or a cut, the effect is the same at the end of the day&#151;there is less money for services. The Government are going to cut &#163;1 billion from the Scottish budget over two years. The problem, other than that they are cutting money, is the danger of choking off a recovery, should it start to happen&#151;nobody believes that it will start in the next few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para19"><a name="09042347000721">We must look at, for example, what President Obama is doing. The state of Maryland has a similar population to that of Scotland. It will receive &#163;2.6 billion in extra funding supporting 66,000 jobs over the next two years rather than destroying jobs with budget cuts. The Government need to look again at what they are doing in that regard. The problem is not confined to Scotland, as the First Ministers for both Wales and Northern Ireland have made similar points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09042347000722">During the initial exchanges between the Front-Bench teams, the Secretary of State said that people on short-time working were being helped by tax credits. I accept that, but a loophole exists that I have taken up with the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. He was here earlier and I hoped that he would return to the Chamber to hear me make the point again, as I am still waiting for a response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para21"><a name="09042347000723">Many people in my constituency put on short time have ended up working for fewer than the minimum hours required to qualify for tax credits. For those who do not have children, that minimum is 30 hours. People are facing a double whammy&#151;losing wages and also their tax credits&#151;and that is causing a great many problems. I have asked the Treasury whether there is any scope for treating people whose hours have been cut as though they were still working the minimum number, as that would both avoid the double whammy that I have described and help them out of what is a difficult situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para22"><a name="09042347000724">I appeal to the Exchequer Secretary, who is on the Front Bench at present, to give consideration to that proposal. The problem is serious, and it is getting worse as short-term working increases. Many firms are trying to hold on to people and skills rather than making them unemployed, and the proposal that I have made would be a way to help them out in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para23"><a name="09042347000725">I turn now to the environmental element of the Budget. It makes a good start in some areas, although it remains well below what is known as the Stern test, which is that 20 per cent. of fiscal stimulus should go towards green initiatives. It compares unfavourably with South Korea, for example, which has achieved a rate of 82 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para24"><a name="09042347000726">The Budget has made progress in respect of carbon capture and storage&#151;a subject in which I have had an interest for many years. It is possible that I have bored successive energy Ministers about it&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o315"><a name="09042347000727"><a name="90423-0018.htm_spnew3"><a name="09042347001252"><b>John Robertson (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab)</b>

 I see the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson) nodding at that, but there was a good chance that Scotland could have been well ahead with carbon capture and storage through the Peterhead plant. However, Government indecision dragged on and eventually they decided not to back it, with the result that the project went to Abu Dhabi. That proved to be a disaster, and a great disappointment for the CCS industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para25"><a name="09042347000729">Since then, the Government have set up a competition that the earlier statement on carbon capture suggested was still grinding on. The Budget papers reveal that &#163;90 million has been allocated to fund companies in that competition to undertake detailed preparatory studies for CCS schemes, with &#163;60 million transferred from the existing transport budgets. I understand that the purpose of the studies is to reduce the technological risk associated with CCS projects and to give greater clarity on costs, but I wonder whether it will merely lead to yet further delays. I am not sure how that interacts with the announcements about CCS made in today&#146;s statement for, although it seemed to move things forward, it also left a lot of unanswered questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para26"><a name="09042347000730">We are very keen, especially in the Scottish context, that the Forth basin and the Longannet plant in particular should be part of the CCS project. As I mentioned in connection with the earlier statement, Scotland has some of the largest carbon storage reserves in Europe in the North sea&#146;s saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas fields. It also has the skills from the North sea oil and gas industry to access them, something that will be very important in the development of CCS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para27"><a name="09042347000731">The Budget also makes some tax changes to the petroleum revenue tax and those governing the use of installations for other purposes, both of which are designed to help the development of CCS. However, the Energy and Climate Change Committee, of which I am member, has been conducting an investigation into the oil and gas reserves of the North sea and one company raised a slightly different problem with me. It had a licence for exploration for one part of the North sea. It decided that it was not economic to use that licence for oil exploration, but it thought that it would be possible to use it for carbon capture and storage, which may have had the benefit of extracting some oil from that  <br>

area by pumping out the carbon. However, the company tells me that the licence conditions do not allow it to use carbon capture and storage technology, which means that it has to surrender the licence. The Government should look into whether there is any scope for giving a bit more leeway. Carbon capture and storage can also have quite a long lead-in time. Total has launched a scheme in the south of France, but there is a two-year period in which it will be looked at before a decision is taken on whether it is commercially viable, so we need to get moving as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para28"><a name="09042347000732">There are other things that might stand in the way of carbon capture and storage. In questions this morning, I raised the balancing charges being proposed by Ofgem and the National Grid Company with the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change. Those charges may impact on Scottish generators&#146; ability to invest in new plant, and in carbon capture and storage in particular. The Minister kindly said that he was prepared to meet me to discuss the issue. I will be taking up that invitation, because it is important that we look into the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para29"><a name="09042347000733">Transmission charges have long been a problem with renewable generation. It would be dangerous if we did not sort the issue out or if we imposed new charges that affected the ability of Scottish generators to develop carbon capture and storage, especially given that Scotland is nearest to many of the possible storage places. The Government need to look at the issue in the round and not put carbon capture and storage up against the competition without looking into its distribution and the investment that could come from energy companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para30"><a name="09042347000734">There is also the question whether the Government are considering transferring the carbon to the offshore field or wherever it is ultimately to be buried. Is the intention to build a transmission network for the carbon, once it has been captured, or is it intended to be stored on site? Significant investment will be required if the carbon is to be transferred in order to be eventually stored. The Government also said that we would look into pre and post-combustion, which is welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90423-0018.htm_para31"><a name="09042347000735">I also welcome the move to allow greater help for offshore wind energy. However, I noticed that there seemed to be no mention of wave or tidal energy, both of which can be very important. Again, both may be some way from commercial application, but we need the investment to get them up and running, and to strengthen the grid so that they can be fed in. I would like to ask the Exchequer Secretary whether there are any plans to extend the help for offshore wind to wave and tidal power, with a view to moving them forward. As she may know, the Scottish Government have launched the Saltire prize to try to bring that development forward, which has generated a great deal of interest from all over the world.</p>

 Because wave power is further behind than wind power, there is &#163;405 million for technology transformation, which is aimed at things such as wave power. However, the support through renewables obligation certificates, to try to ensure that the existing potential in offshore wind comes about, is&#151;to use the oil analogy that the hon. Gentleman has been using&#151;further upstream. I hope that that gives him some reassurance.</p>

When I left here I went on a sort of comfort-eating crusade. Thank gosh I do not smoke or drink or I would have been a mess by midnight. No slice of carrot cake in the precincts of the House of Commons was safe, and when I had worked my way through the various tea rooms, I got home and raided the fridge. I was just trying to come to terms with the enormous figures that had been put before me, and I thought that if I ate, somehow things would become clearer. I put my svelte figure under huge stress last night, but this morning I was back to the muesli.</p>

It will probably be more than that, but right now the Government are telling us &#163;703 billion. Our total debt will be well over &#163;1 trillion. There are 12 zeros in a trillion. I have only 10 fingers and thumbs. There are more zeros in a trillion than I have digits. This is an enormous sum of money. The real concern that I have is that I will not be able to pay it back. Personally, Charles Walker will not be able to pay this money back. My peers will not be able to pay it back. Members of Parliament will not be able to pay it back. People of working age will not be able to pay it back. Our children will not be able to pay it all back. Our small children will have this debt around their necks. Even our grandchildren will struggle with the size of this debt. It is truly an enormous sum of money.</p>

We will be borrowing money to pay money back on the gilts that become due in any certain year. Every year, a little more than 30 per cent. of income tax receipts will go to fund our borrowings&#151;&#163;43 billion a year. When our constituents pay their income tax, &#163;1 in every &#163;3 will go towards funding the debt mountain. This is a huge sum of money; a frightening sum of money.</p>

They do not always get it right and they have not got it right this time, but I do not question their integrity for a moment. We were told by the then Chancellor, who is now the Prime Minister, that the Government would borrow only to invest, that he would spend only to invest, but in reality Governments only borrow and spend, however you dress it up. They can borrow prudently and spend prudently, or they can borrow foolishly and spend foolishly. Now, the Government are not borrowing prudently.

The Chancellor is a very decent man, and he really did not want to tell the country quite how bad things were going to be. Thank God that we have the International Monetary Fund, however. A couple of hours after the Budget, it told us how bad things were going to be. It gave us the real picture and told us that there were hard times ahead. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) who, in her thoughtful speech, said that the British people were very resourceful and brave, and that they were able to face down a challenge.

I have to say that his speech appeared to be a rehearsal, or perhaps an audition, for one day being shadow Chancellor. I am not sure whether that is his aspiration.</p>

 His ambition might be higher.</p>

 I, for one, believe that the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s ambition should be higher. I think the Labour party could do a lot worse&#151;I genuinely mean this&#151;than make the right hon. Gentleman its leader. In fact, it is doing a lot worse, so perhaps he should consider this course sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para14"><a name="09042347000756">This Budget is, as right hon. and hon. Members have argued in today&#146;s debate, essentially about the issue of borrowing and debt and the state of the public finances. We have seen a spectacular deterioration in our public finances. Just a year ago, in the 2008 Budget, it was anticipated that we would need to borrow &#163;38 billion this year&#151;a not insignificant sum in itself. Now, however, we are looking at a figure of about &#163;175 billion&#151;the highest level of borrowing in our peacetime history. As the IMF has made clear, we have the highest deficit in the G20.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para15"><a name="09042347000757">The figure for debts&#151;an area where we were relatively better placed than many of our competitors&#151;is also pretty frightening. In the early years of this Government or up until relatively recently, it is true that debt fell as a percentage of gross domestic product from 42 per cent. to 36 per cent. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and, indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough pointed out, it has fallen less than in than the majority of OECD countries during those years, but it is now rising more quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para16"><a name="09042347000758">Let us not forget the sustainable investment rule, which says that debt should be no more than 40 per cent. of GDP. We have learned from the IFS today that such is the state of our public finances that the rule is unlikely to be met until 2032. In fact, we are going to see a doubling of the figure in the sustainable investment rule level up to just below 80 per cent.&#151;overtaking in the process the debt levels of France and Germany. Those figures are based on what the Government provided yesterday, yet the real concern persists that what we heard yesterday was an underestimate. Within an hour of the revealing of the Budget figures, the International Monetary Fund predicted that growth would be worse in 2009 than the Government&#146;s projection, and that we would still be in recession in 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para17"><a name="09042347000759">Conservatives and, I am sure, Members in all parts of the House hope that the Government&#146;s figures will be proved right and the IMF&#146;s will be proved wrong, but the Government&#146;s claim that growth in 2011 growth will be at 3.5 per cent. is clearly unsustainable. As my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, that is a trampoline recovery. Independent forecasters whose views were published by the Treasury only a month or so ago predict growth at such levels as 2.2 per cent. and 2.6 per cent. in 2011, 2012 and 2013, not 3.5 per cent. It appears that after many years of the Prime Minister&#146;s promising that there would be no return to boom and bust, it is the Government&#146;s aspiration and hope to return to boom and bust, with another boom in 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para18"><a name="09042347000760">Let us look at the small print of what was published yesterday. Paragraph 108 on page 26 of the National Audit Office&#146;s &#147;Audit of Assumptions&#148; states:</p>
<a name="90423-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="09042347000888"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Treasury has reduced its trend assumption further for Budget 2009, incorporating a permanent reduction in output totalling around 5 per cent, phased in between&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para19"><a name="09042347000761">the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2010. What that means is that the productive potential of the United Kingdom has taken a permanent hit of 5 per cent., yet the Government still think that growth of 3.5 per cent. will be possible in 2011. As the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr pointed out, there is no historic precedent for that sort of recovery from a recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para20"><a name="09042347000762">The significance of that is twofold. It makes the claim for growth in 2011 less credible, and it reveals that much of the &#163;175 billion deficit&#151;&#163;140 billion, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies&#151;is structural. Given the current projections, we are not likely to be able to grow our way out of a recession unless serious measures are taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09042347000763">The test of the Budget is whether it represents a credible route out. As we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks, the Government&#146;s record on projecting the public finances is so grim that they consistently overestimate the position, yet even according to these projections we shall have to wait for many years. For the last eight years or so, the Government have tended to say that the Budget will balance in about two years&#146; time. In last year&#146;s pre-Budget report the period was extended to six years, and, in this year&#146;s Budget, it was extended to eight. Those are hopelessly optimistic assumptions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para22"><a name="09042347000764">Yesterday the Government had an opportunity to explain how to restore the public finances, and they failed to do so. What did we get? We got their proposal to alter their own spending plans in 2011. In 2010, they will still be increasing spending, although they believe that the economy will be growing. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), the shadow Chancellor pointed out, if we use the methodology that the Government have used against us for many years, any reduction of announced spending constitutes a cut. We see this as a cut of &#163;84 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para23"><a name="09042347000765">That is not just a pedantic point. At the last election, the Government managed to reach a figure of &#163;35 billion on the basis of an alteration in our announced spending plans. We heard the statements made by Labour Members at the time. The current Chancellor said that it was the equivalent of sacking every teacher, doctor and nurse in the country. Over the past 10 years, the central argument has been that the Government could always afford these big increases in public spending: increases of 4, 5 or 6 per cent. We have argued against that, and in doing so have been portrayed as slashers and burners of public services. We could not afford those increases then, and we cannot afford them now. The question now is how we can deliver quality public services in an age of austerity. The Government, however, continue to search for the old dividing lines, trying to pretend that we are the party that cuts public spending while they are entirely different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para24"><a name="09042347000766">What is the Government&#146;s approach to bringing down the deficit? Let us look at tax.

four respects. First, it is a breach of a manifesto pledge. The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change was very keen for the shadow Chancellor to intervene on him, and I am perfectly prepared to let the Secretary of State intervene on me to say whether he denies or accepts that the Labour party&#146;s last manifesto stated that it would not raise the basic or top rates of income tax in the next Parliament and therefore that the policy announced yesterday is the clearest and most blatant breach imaginable of a manifesto pledge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para25"><a name="09042347000767">Secondly, it is cynical because it is a distraction from other taxes. In truth, even before the next general election, most of the taxes imposed will apply across the board, such as the fuel duty increases, and the increases in the cost of alcohol and tobacco. However, the really big tax increase will happen after the next general election. As soon as the election is over, Labour will increase national insurance contributions, affecting everyone earning more than &#163;20,000 a year.</p>

<p><a name="st_o323"><a name="09042347000768"><a name="90423-0019.htm_spnew4"><a name="09042347001260"><b>Mr. Betts:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman was talking about manifesto commitments. Will the Conservative party put in its manifesto that immediately after it wins the next general election&#151;if it does&#151;it will reverse the 50p income tax rate? Also, as he has described a black hole that he believes exists in the public finances, will he come clean and spell out precisely the cuts in public expenditure that he would make if he got into power?</p>

<p><a name="st_o324"><a name="09042347000769"><a name="90423-0019.htm_spnew5"><a name="09042347001261"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 The Labour party has announced&#151;under, I suspect, the same methodology that it used at the last election&#151;&#163;84 billion-worth of cuts. The Conservative party position is that our priority will be to try to tackle the tax increases introduced by the Labour party that will affect the many and not the few. Therefore, there is no commitment here to reverse that particular tax rate&#151;but whether we can reverse it or not, the fact remains that it is a cynical policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para26"><a name="09042347000770">That point brings me to another reason why this tax rate is so cynical. One can see what happened here. As the Government sat down in No. 11 Downing street&#151;or, more likely, No. 10 Downing street&#151;the thinking was not, &#147;How are we going to bring in some tax increases that are good for the UK economy and will not damage its productivity?&#148; Instead, the thinking was more, &#147;What can we do to put the Conservative party in a difficult position?&#148; That is the way that this Government work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para27"><a name="09042347000771">The fourth reason why the policy is cynical is that it will not raise the amount of revenue that has been claimed. We do not dispute that it will raise some revenue, but as the IFS has stated today, no account has been taken of the fall in indirect consumer spending that will result from this tax increase, so the Government will not raise as much money as they claim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="90423-0019.htm_para28"><a name="09042347000772">Let me return to the issue of how this Government operate: they are not thinking about what is best for the country; they are not thinking about addressing the fiscal crisis that we face; the way they operate is all about political positioning and trying to damage their opponents. This is all of a piece; it is consistent with the way that this Prime Minister has operated throughout his career. Even when dealing with his own party colleagues, he blocked public services reform because it suited his own internal party position. As Chancellor of the  <br>

 We have had an interesting, at times thoughtful, sometimes amusing and sometimes vitriolic debate this afternoon. I shall first mention a few of the contributions that we have heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para0"><a name="09042347000775">My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), who welcomed the support in the Budget, particularly to prepare for the upturn, gave many examples of companies in his constituency that are preparing for just that. He also rightly pointed out our determination to lead in environmental technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para1"><a name="09042347000776">The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning), who always makes thoughtful speeches, particularly about retired people, talked about loan sharks and banks in the same breath. We all share her desire to see the standing of financial services and UK banks return from its present point to somewhere reasonable. She also wanted cuts in taxes on investment income, which is a feature of what we hear from the Opposition. They scaremonger about the size of the debts that face us after what is a global shock and then complain about anything that we do in terms of fiscal consolidation to try to raise money and restore the sustainability of the public finances. They always make the basic argument that the deficit is too large and then complain when we try to raise money to shift it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para2"><a name="09042347000777">My hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) again demonstrated her commitment to and experience in housing, and she particularly welcomed the fund that will allow local authorities to build. She emphasised the importance of housing&#151;we share that view&#151;and particularly wished to ensure that we deal with some of the existing shortages. The Budget contains modest but important measures in that regard, despite the problems that we are experiencing in the public finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09042347000778">The hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) made his usual robust speech. We have shared many years of experience serving on the Treasury Committee and I continue always to enjoy his contributions. He talked about the structural problem of debt, but when we have had a shock of the sort that we have seen in the global financial system, which, without being predicted&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) mentioned that point in her extremely good, thoughtful and interesting presentation&#151;shifts our tax receipts in such an unprecedented way, it is not surprising that a structural deficit occurs. We have to think very carefully about how to restore some of that  <br>

tax funding, and I believe that the approach that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor took in his Budget will begin to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09042347000779">The hon. Gentleman, in line with a lot of his party, said that the public sector was too big and has to be cut, but he did not explain quite how he would like to see it cut. I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North made much more interesting comments on the efficiencies that can be driven through the public sector&#151;we have made a beginning on that with the operational efficiency programme&#151;and how collaborative procurement, shared services and a different way of delivering public services are beginning to give us the chance to transform how our services are used. She described this as a &#147;flatter&#148; public service, more driven by its users than providers, and she offered us some important and interesting insights into what the future will be if we can do that in an appropriate way, while protecting front-line services. That is the important difference between the two sides, it seems to me. The question is whether we should slash and burn in the middle of a recession, or take a careful and focused look at how we can deliver real service efficiencies while protecting those on the front line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09042347000780">The hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) at least admitted that the Government have put in effect policies that might have&#151;I am quoting him&#151;averted a recession&#151;</p>

 Indeed, a depression. After that, his contribution went downhill. We probably do not agree on much more. He is at least in favour of a fiscal stimulus, and we had some discussion about the size of that. Of course, that puts us on the same side of the argument, against those who said that we could not afford a fiscal stimulus. The Opposition voted against the fiscal stimulus that was a centrepiece of the pre-Budget report. They would have put us in a position where we would have been unable to bring forward the &#163;3 billion of investment that was already planned, as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced. We would not have been able to stimulate the economy in order to support people now.</p>

I hope to see him in the Committee on the Finance Bill, so that we can carry on our jousts there. Naturally, I do not agree that the Labour Government have destroyed the economy. He needs to take into account what is going on outside the country. We have had a massive unexpected global banking shock, which has created the first synchronised global downturn and decrease in world gross domestic product since the first world war&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It does not say that anywhere; I am just describing what is happening in the world economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09042347000784">I know that it suits the Opposition to pretend that all these problems and the sudden huge shock in our financial services have somehow been generated internally in this country, leading to the deficits that the Opposition go around the country trying to scare people about, but the circumstances of the credit crunch and of events in the global international financial system are unprecedented. Inevitably, those circumstances have had a big effect on all economies in the world, both advanced and developing,  <br>

and we face major economic challenges as a result. I would have thought that, just once, an Opposition Member might acknowledge that that is going on, instead of peddling the view that all the problems were internally generated in No. 10 and No. 11 Downing street&#151;that we could all have foreseen them somehow and that we have deliberately got ourselves into a situation where we have to deal with a borrowing requirement of 12 per cent. of GDP. If the Opposition were being more honest, rather than talking in their slogans for the forthcoming general election, they would acknowledge that we have been affected by an unprecedented global situation and that we have to recover from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09042347000785">It is important that we acted to shore up the banking system. That was essential, but it was done at a cost. Initially, the Opposition opposed our action, then they were in favour of it, then they opposed it again. Their thoughts on what we should be doing to save the global banking system seem to change from one day to the next. They spent years acknowledging that financial services were a major part of our economy and that we are an open and trading economy, but they now blame the Government for the fact that the global downturn is having an greater effect on our economy than on some more closed economies. That is true, because ours is an open economy that had a comparative advantage in financial services. That is why we have been hit more severely than some economies. Japan and Germany, neither of which have large financial sectors in the same way as we do, have been hit even harder because they manufacture and export. They are being hit by the same sort of global slow-down&#151;the stalling of the economic engine&#151;that was the result of the credit crunch.</p>

That was essential, but it had a cost. We acted in the pre-Budget report to provide real help for people and businesses, and that included the fiscal stimulus that the Conservatives voted against. A tax cut for the 22 million basic rate taxpayers will go into their pay packets this April. The Conservatives have to explain to the people of this country why they voted against it. They have to explain why, when things are so challenging and difficult, their priority for expenditure is to spend &#163;1 billion on giving &#163;200,000 each to the 3,500 richest estates in the country. Our priority is giving a tax cut to 22 million basic rate taxpayers. They have to explain why they refused to change their mind about that when they had the chance to do so&#151;the shadow shadow Chancellor, in his usual way, suggested that perhaps they should change their mind about the policy. They have to explain why it continues to be their priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09042347000787">The Conservatives also have to explain what they will do about the increase to a tax rate of 50 per cent., which we have had to introduce to deal with the unprecedented situation that we are in. They have to explain why the Mayor of London today announced that he was against it and that the Conservative party should vote against it, when the Conservative Front Benchers are being rather coy about their view. The Conservatives have had much fun talking about potential leadership challenges in our party&#151;they even tried to provoke my right hon.

<p><a name="st_o330"><a name="09042347000796"><a name="90423-0020.htm_spnew4"><a name="09042347001267"><b>Mr. Don Foster (Bath) (LD):</b>
 Given the current financial crisis, using even a small amount of parliamentary time to debate the problems caused by urban seagulls might seem bizarre. However, while we rightly devote much of our time to the financial crisis, we should not lose sight of other issues, especially ones that cause significant problems to many people and cost individuals, businesses and local councils a great deal of money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para17"><a name="09042347000797">I am particularly grateful to Mr. Speaker for giving me the opportunity to raise the issue. I pass on huge thanks to the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), who is not in the Chamber because, as he has explained to me, he is on important departmental business. I am, however, delighted to see on the Treasury Bench the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), who I am sure will be a worthy substitute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para18"><a name="09042347000798">I have received numerous complaints in my Bath constituency about urban seagulls. Mr. Henry Brown, chairman of Bath Residents Associations, wrote to me recently about the serious health and safety problems caused by seagulls in Bath. He referred to faeces deposited on tables, chairs and other furniture outside catering premises creating a health hazard; stone pavements and steps rendered slippery by freshly deposited faeces creating safety hazards; aggression towards pedestrians in public spaces and gardens, which is extremely frightening; and the pecking open of refuse sacks, which leaves debris and encourages other vermin, creating further health problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para19"><a name="09042347000799">A search through local newspapers across the country shows that Bath is not alone. For example, in August last year, the <i> Daily Mirror</i> reported:</p>
<a name="90423-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="09042347000891"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A terrified woman in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire was left drenched in blood after a seagull protecting its young dive-bombed her. Jean Wemyss, 68, had to have a one-inch gash in her head glued after the attack. &#145;It felt like someone had hit me with a rock. There wasn&#146;t a stitch that wasn't covered in blood.&#146;&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para20"><a name="09042347000800">Such results from a bird attack might seem exaggerated, but with a wingspan of four and a half feet, an adult body weight of about 2 lb, a long, vicious beak, a flight speed of 40 mph and sharp claws that are swift to draw blood in an attack, each bird represents an impressive threat as it hurtles through the sky.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para21"><a name="09042347000801">The newspapers have hundreds of similar stories&#151;from attacks on people carrying food to birds swooping on bike riders, causing accidents. The headlines illustrate the problem: &#147;Raging Gull&#148;, &#147;Pensioner&#146;s Horror At Gull Attack&#148;, &#147;Hitchcock&#146;s Vision Rapidly Becoming Terrifying Reality&#148; and &#147;Vicar Has To Wear Hard Hat To Church After Seagull Attack&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para22"><a name="09042347000802">As well as the birds attacking people, urban communities increasingly have to deal with their ear-splitting noise, the mess gulls&#146; excrement makes on rooftops, pavements, cars, and windows and the damage they do to buildings&#151;even pulling away lead flashings. It is no wonder that in January the <i> Daily Mail</i> ran a story with the rather lengthy headline, &#147;They&#146;re noisy, filthy, violent...and  <br>

they&#146;re moving into a street near you. No, not marauding teenagers, but the seagulls invading Britain&#146;s inland towns by their thousands.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para23"><a name="09042347000803">Before world war two there were no urban seagulls, but the growth of urban landfill sites offered a whole new source of food, especially after the Clean Air Act 1956 put a stop to landfill operators burning rubbish on site. With so much edible waste going into landfill, the large gulls were quick to take advantage. Plenty of food meant plenty of offspring, and previously small, wild populations grew rapidly to the tipping point where their colonies were overgrown. The overspill came to our towns, which have fewer predators and little disturbance. Towns are 4 to 6 C warmer than the surrounding countryside, and street lighting enables gulls to scavenge at night as well as during the day. Gull expert Peter Rock wrote to me, saying:</p>
<a name="90423-0020.htm_brev3"><a name="09042347000892"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Three years ago, I estimated that we had 130,000-180,000 pairs of gulls nesting on rooftops in the whole of Britain and Ireland. It&#146;s quite clear that the growth of these urban colonies has been startlingly high. I estimate that by 2019&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para24"><a name="09042347000804">10 years&#146; time&#151;</p>
<a name="90423-0020.htm_brev4"><a name="09042347000893"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we could have over a million gulls nesting on our rooftops. And by then urban gulls will outnumber wild gulls. Once settled in, gulls virtually never return to the wild. They are urbanised for life&#151;a very long time, considering that the average seagull lives to 20 years, and the record is 35.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para25"><a name="09042347000805">In my constituency, our seagull colony has doubled in size in just six years, and we now have more than 850 breeding pairs. When non-breeders are added, it means that we already cope with 2,500 seagulls, and the numbers continue to increase rapidly. Other places are in an even worse position. With gull populations expanding rapidly, the problems, previously perceived as little more than an irritation and often with a great deal of mirth, have, instead, become very costly indeed. Repairs to damage, clearing up fouling and mess, nest clearance and so on are obvious areas of expense, but gull noise elicits the vast majority of complaints, affects tourism and the resource from it, causes sleep deprivation in the work force and distresses hospital patients. Attacks from aggressively protective parent birds deter shoppers, with obvious effects on local economies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para26"><a name="09042347000806">A plethora of pest control equipment and deterrence systems has been deployed during the past decade, involving very large sums of money. Looking across the roofs of any town where gulls breed, we see nets, strings, spikes, tensioned wires and even plastic models of owls and helium-filled balloons, and we hear loudspeakers broadcasting distress calls. Birds of prey are sometimes flown, as they are over this Palace, to try to deter nesting, but, despite those interventions, populations have grown rapidly. The gulls have taken everything thrown at them in their stride, and even more recently developed methods do not seem to be working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para27"><a name="09042347000807">Some councils are deploying the method that Peter Rock suggested some years ago, whereby eggs are coated in oil to prevent hatching. Bristol city council, for example, is spending &#163;30,000 a year on certain measures. But, while egg oiling and, latterly, egg replacement can help calm sensitive areas, it does not seem to reduce populations. Rock now says:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para28"><a name="09042347000809">Indeed, it is increasingly clear that the solutions that have been tried so far merely move the problem somewhere else.

<a name="90423-0020.htm_brev6"><a name="09042347000894"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it is noticeable that in the last few years there are more complaints coming from areas outside the city centre where there were previously no problems&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para29"><a name="09042347000810">In short, we seem no nearer to an effective solution than we were a decade ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para30"><a name="09042347000811">The Government have a responsibility to ensure that appropriate research is conducted to help identify solutions. After all, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is spending &#163;2 million on the urgent eradication of the ruddy duck. Should it not also research some effective means at least to ameliorate the seagull problem? We certainly know a great deal about the biology of gulls, but most of our knowledge comes from studies of wild colonies. We know which species of fish that they prefer, but that casts no light on the situation in our towns. We know almost nothing about what makes urban gulls so successful, so, if we are to manage this issue properly, we surely need to find out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para31"><a name="09042347000812">We also need to know about issues such as site fidelity, breeding success, foraging strategies, foraging distances, time-energy budgets, chick growth rates, dispensing with migration, survival rates and much more. Most of all, we need to know about how and where urban gulls get their food, what it is and what, in particular, they provide for their offspring. Knowing how and where urban gulls obtain food will enable appropriate and efficient control of food supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="90423-0020.htm_para32"><a name="09042347000813">Experts are ready and willing to do the work. I know that Bristol university, for example, can be ready to take on preliminary work this season and start fully in 2010. But despite the urgent need for research, at the beginning of this month the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs wrote to my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) saying:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="90423-0021.htm_para0"><a name="09042347000814">I hope that, following this debate, the Department will rethink the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90423-0021.htm_para1"><a name="09042347000815">Action is also needed on a number of other fronts. Even if research identifies new solutions, it is unclear how the law will allow them to be used. At present, action against seagulls is allowed via a general licence. This includes a licence that allows the taking and killing and the damaging or destroying of eggs and nests of certain seagull species for the purpose of preserving public health and safety; a general licence can also be issued in respect of ensuring aircraft safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="90423-0021.htm_para2"><a name="09042347000816">At present, such a licence does not allow such activity in respect of nuisance, such as that caused by the noise of seagulls, or damage to property. Given that the vast majority of complaints about seagulls involve nuisance and damage to property, surely there is a case for reconsidering the conditions that surround the issuing of general licences so that those factors are also taken into account? Natural England is currently reviewing the general licence provisions and I hope that the Department will encourage it to take the point on board. The review is already also considering whether to have tighter restrictions on the issuing of general licences in respect of one type of gull&#151;the herring gull.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) on securing this debate and thank him for agreeing to go ahead with it even though the Government are able to field only a reserve team. The Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), to whom the hon. Gentleman says that he has spoken, sends his apologies for not being able to listen in person. He cannot be here because he is at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="90423-0021.htm_para7"><a name="09042347000822">The hon. Gentleman set out with characteristic vividness the problems caused by urban gulls. The Government recognise that gulls can be problematic when found in high density in urban areas, such as Bath. We also recognise that measures need to be taken to mitigate such problems. I was interested to hear his statistics and the fact that in Bath the breeding population is now estimated at between 800 and 900 pairs. However, the suggestion that there are between 130,000 to 180,000 pairs of urban gulls is unrealistic. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee estimates, which are based on the seabird colony register census in 2002, show that there are probably some 30,000 pairs of gulls in urban areas out of a total breeding population of 370,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="90423-0021.htm_para8"><a name="09042347000823">The hon. Gentleman asked if more research could be done into the behaviour of urban gulls, but the scientific advice from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Natural England is that it is not clear what further benefits new research into gull behaviour or movements would bring. Gull behaviour is influenced  <br>

primarily by the need for food and for safe nesting and roosting sites, regardless of where they may be. Gulls will scavenge and exploit food supplies on the coast as much as inland. Research funding, especially in the present financial circumstances, must be targeted at problems where there are no, or insufficient, solutions, but that is not the case for gulls because a range of well-tested measures, some of which have been researched extensively, can be used to overcome the problems, including adult bird removal, oiling or pricking of eggs&#151;which the hon. Gentleman mentioned&#151;nest destruction and the proofing of buildings. He draws a comparison with the ruddy duck, but that case is different because the ruddy duck is threatening the extinction of white-headed ducks. Nevertheless, DEFRA has commissioned research into the use of immuno-contraceptives in a range of species, including birds. That research is still at an early stage, however, and we do not want to wait for further results before continuing with effective action now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="90423-0021.htm_para9"><a name="09042347000824">The hon. Gentleman asked about the legal status of gulls. As he knows, all wild birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. However, in some circumstances it is possible to apply for a licence from Natural England to take measures to control problem bird species where there are no other satisfactory solutions. There are several specific purposes, defined in law, for which Natural England may grant licences, including preventing the spread of disease, preserving air safety, the conservation of wild birds, and preserving public health and safety. As he noted, nuisance and damage to property are not legal purposes, but the Government&#146;s view is that the problems he has raised fall fairly and squarely within the category of public health and safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="90423-0021.htm_para10"><a name="09042347000825">A build-up of gull populations to problem levels is usually the result of the presence of readily accessible food and/or the availability of attractive habitats for roosting or breeding. While licensed control of bird populations can provide temporary relief, the elimination or reduction of those factors will provide the long-term solution. Access to readily available nutritious food is the single most important factor in boosting gull populations. If that can be denied, the problem may be resolved without recourse to other measures. The Government urge all local authorities and individuals to help address that problem by, first, avoiding the spillage of foodstuffs; secondly, keeping food storage areas secure and bird-proof; thirdly, ensuring that disposal and waste facilities are kept clean and tidy; and fourthly, limiting or preventing the deliberate feeding of birds by the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="90423-0021.htm_para11"><a name="09042347000826">I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is aware that local authorities in Devon and Cornwall have had good results by using hessian sacks for rubbish disposal to deter gulls from accessing food. The gulls find it more difficult to deal with hessian sacks than with plastic sacks. I understand that it is proposed to trial the use of hessian sacks in Bath as well, to reduce the availability of food to gulls. If there are lessons to be  <br>

learned from that, we will look into new techniques that may be more successful than those that are being used at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="90423-0021.htm_para12"><a name="09042347000827">The licensing authority, Natural England, sets conditions to ensure that the licences that it issues, including general licences, are appropriate and take account of the risk of the activities licensed and the conservation status of the species concerned. The hon. Gentleman understands that although great black-backed and herring gulls may cause problems locally, there are concerns about the conservation status of those species at national level. As a member state of the European Union, the UK has an obligation to conserve wild bird populations, and Natural England was absolutely right to take that into account in its consultation on general licences. I emphasise, however, that we are taking that action not simply because we have a legal obligation to do so but because we are concerned about the wild bird populations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="90423-0021.htm_para13"><a name="09042347000828">There has been a greater than 50 per cent. decline in the breeding population of the herring gull since 1969 and a greater than 50 per cent. decline in the wintering population in the past 25 years. As a result, the herring gull is now listed as a biodiversity action plan priority species and meets the qualifying criteria for a red listing as a bird of conservation concern. The great black-backed gull is a scarce breeding species in England, with a breeding population of only 1,500 pairs. The wintering population of the species has declined by between 25 and 50 per cent. in the past 25 years, so it will be moved from green to amber listing as a bird of conservation concern.</p>

It proposed that the herring gull would be removed from almost all general licences, the exception being that it proposed to continue to allow the destruction of the nests and eggs of herring gulls for the purpose of preserving public health and safety. That proposal recognised the need to mitigate the problems that herring gulls can cause in urban situations and meet the need to provide a licensing regime that is not overly burdensome. For great black-backed gulls, a general licence will be available only for the purpose of preserving air safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="90423-0021.htm_para15"><a name="09042347000830">I stress that although the consultation proposed a reduction in the available general licences, it will still be possible to apply for an individual licence to control those species where they are causing problems. That option is, of course, open to local authorities. Natural England&#146;s proposals were aimed at striking the appropriate and proportionate balance between protecting species and mitigating negative impacts in areas where species may be over-abundant. None of the changes that Natural England is proposing will prevent cities such as Bath from continuing to deal effectively with their urban gull populations.</p>
