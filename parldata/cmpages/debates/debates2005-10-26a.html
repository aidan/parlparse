May I ask the Secretary of State how General de Chastelain and the two witnesses could be so certain that all the IRA weaponry and explosives had been put beyond use?

<p>
<a name="51026-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">I remind the Minister that the general and the two witnessing clerics put it firmly on the record that the arms that they saw decommissioned were largely old arms. The priest who was there said, &quot;If you put them to your chest and pulled the trigger, they might kill you.&quot; That is a serious statement, which was added to: the real modern weapons formed a tiny percentage of the arms. Does that not worry the Secretary of State? We know that the IRA has modern weaponry, which needs to be put away. It is essential that that is done.
</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51026-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 It is indeed essential that all weapons are put away, to use the hon. Gentleman&#039;s phrase. I think he will agree, however, that the statement made by General de Chastelain and verified by the two independent clergymen was emphatic that the IRA&#039;s arsenal had been put beyond use. We must recognise that that was the view of the independent commission.
</p>





<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51026-01_spnew6"><b> Mark Durkan  (Foyle)</b> 
 (SDLP): The IRA&#039;s failure to decommission is what caused suspension in the first place. Now that the IRA has decommissioned, does the Secretary of State recognise that we should be clearly on a countdown to restoration of the institutions? In order to give the public confidence in that regard, does he believe that the politics of the concession of the weak, with parties doing handstands one week and head staggers the next, combined with a budget that hits the weak with a tax hit for years, is the best way to give the Northern Ireland public confidence that we are moving to taking responsibility ourselves?
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51026-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 It is crucial that the Independent Monitoring Commission&#039;s reports&#151;the first one, which I published last week, and the one expected in January&#151;become a bible for testing whether the promises to end paramilitary and criminal activity have been delivered on the ground. So far, so good. If and when that is clear, there will be no reason for parties not to engage in discussions towards the resumption of power sharing. The draft budget that I published yesterday, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, proposes a massive increase in health spending: an extra &#163;450 million, and a massive increase in education spending&#151;an extra &#163;100 million. Yes, rates will go up by 19 per cent. to fund new child care support, new skills and science investment and new investment in renewable and clean energy, but I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman welcomed that as it will assist the most vulnerable in Northern Ireland.

</p>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51026-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 When we are ready to bring proposals for dealing with on-the-run suspects to the House, we will do so in the usual way, and we will have a chance to discuss them then. Exiling and punishments must stop. The IMC report showed that such activity had largely died out, but we are keeping a beady eye on it, because exiling is a pernicious practice, and if the IRA meets the terms of its commitments made on 28 July, exiling should stop, just as much as punishment beatings, targeting, intelligence gathering, and all the rest of it.

 (LD): The Liberal Democrats of course welcome the decommissioning of IRA weapons, as was confirmed by the de Chastelain commission on 26 September, but does the Secretary of State recognise that the long delay has damaged the peace process? Does he agree that one way in which the IRA could help others to gain trust is by publicly stating that anyone who has been exiled from their home by the IRA during the troubles is free to return home safely and without retribution?
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51026-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I agree. The hon. Lady makes an important point on exiling. Yes, it would have been much better if decommissioning had occurred much earlier; if it had, there would be less suspicion within Northern Ireland, especially within Unionist communities, about the IRA&#039;s real intentions. However, the decommissioning and the statement made before it are an historic event. A year, or even two years ago, no one would have said that it would have been possible. It has now happened.

<a name="stpa_4">I welcome the act of decommissioning, but does the Secretary of State agree that over the years the Provisional IRA has accumulated enough money from bank robberies and other crimes to afford to re-arm itself, should it ever choose to do so, and that what we therefore need now is not the decommissioning of weapons and explosives only, but the decommissioning of the IRA&#039;s paramilitary organisation and its command structure, so that we can start to believe that this step by republicans is permanent and irreversible?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 290</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51026-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s points and I welcome the fact that he too regards the decommissioning that occurred and the statement on 28 July promising an end to armed struggle&#151;in the IRA&#039;s own words&#151;as very significant, as the IMC statement made clear when it was published last week. It is interesting to quote from that statement. In respect of the Provisional IRA it says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;We have no evidence of training or recruitment after the 28 July statement. There are indications that the organisation&#039;s intelligence function remained active though its focus may be becoming more political. There has also been some identifying of drug dealers, though it is not clear for what purpose.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">So there is still something going on. That is why the statement in the report in January is very important.
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51026-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 But as the Secretary of State indicated, the IMC declared in its report that it was too early to tell whether the steps that republicans have taken are indeed permanent and irreversible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-01_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Will he explain why he has rushed to restore the Stormont and Westminster allowances to Sinn Fein, given that the IMC, which he prayed in aid, explicitly refused to make that recommendation? Should not Sinn Fein have to wait until it agrees to play by the same democratic rules that we expect of every party in Britain and every party on the island of Ireland?
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51026-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Sinn Fein has committed itself to maintaining and playing by those rules. We will have to judge whether that is fulfilled. I thought that it was the right decision. I am sure that if, in those circumstances, the hon. Gentleman had been standing in my shoes at this Dispatch Box, he would have taken the right decision. It is for the House to decide what it does about the Sinn Fein allowances, which were suspended earlier this year. However, I thought that it was right to recommend to the House that Sinn Fein&#039;s allowances in the Assembly be restored in view of the enormous historic progress that has been made, which, to be fair, the hon. Gentleman has welcomed.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. As a former Northern Ireland equality commissioner, I, too, welcome the decommissioning.

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51026-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. I am sure that the House would congratulate the Police Service of Northern Ireland on the huge improvement in public confidence in recent years. Central to that are the improvements in crime reduction and crime detection. Crime in Northern Ireland is now at its lowest level in six years. Last year, recorded crime fell by nearly 8 per cent. on the previous year, and burglary and car crime fell by 18.3 per cent. and 23.7 per cent. respectively. The public&#039;s growing confidence in the PSNI is clearly justified.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_7">The Minister will be aware that part of the reason for the reduction in confidence in the police among the Unionist community is the legalised discrimination that has prevented 3,500 of them from joining, despite their being suitably qualified. Following the figures released last week, which show that if the merit principle had been applied 26 per cent. of recruits would have been Roman Catholic, will he establish the merit principle so that everyone can join the police in Northern Ireland on a non-discriminatory basis?
</p>





<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51026-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 Fifty-fifty is a temporary provision to ensure that we meet the target set by Patten that 30 per cent. of the PSNI should be Catholic. Parliament will, of course, review it in 2007. The vast majority of unsuccessful qualified candidates, Catholic and Protestant, are rejected because there are greater numbers of applicants than available places. We should celebrate the fact that so many young people now wish to pursue a career in the PSNI. It is also worth remarking that fewer than 2 per cent. of all non-Catholic applicants are rejected as a direct result of the 50:50 provisions.

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51026-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 Work is ongoing to produce guidelines that encapsulate safeguards, which will be discussed with members of community-based schemes and other interested parties in due course. The Government recognise that community restorative justice schemes have a part to play in helping to secure a normal society, but it is crucial that they work actively to uphold the human rights of all and that their members are prepared to work with statutory agencies, which, of course, means the police.

 The IRA has taken major steps this year. The 28 July statement and the independently verified decommissioning of the IRA&#039;s arsenal of weapons are historic.

 I certainly want to see the whole of Northern Ireland involved in support for the London Olympic games. So far, we have commissioned a report to explore the opportunities for Northern Ireland that will arise from London&#039;s successful bid. I want to see some events organised in Northern Ireland, and I want Northern Ireland to bid for training camps to support our athletes and those from other countries. I also want to see volunteers taking part, and to see excellence in competitors and a wider participation in sport, so that medals can come back from the London Olympics to Northern Ireland.

 Well, there&#039;s a surprise: the Leader of the House did not answer the question. Let me help him.

 Again, the answer is clear. Since 1997 the Government have sought to reverse the disastrous education policies of our predecessors.

Ultimately, although a solution has to be found locally, it is clear that the Government will help where they can to improve the financial position of PCTs.

<a name="51026-04_head0"><h3 align=center>Avian Influenza</h3>
<a name="time_0">
<a name="51026-04_time0"><h5>12.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51026-04_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 On Friday, my Department announced that we had identified a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in birds held in quarantine. After further analysis by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, we announced on Sunday that the virus was H5N1. We now consider that the virus was found in samples taken from two birds&#151;one Pionus parrot and one Mesia. The closest match is a strain identified in ducks in China earlier this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">There has been no reported occurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the United Kingdom since 1992. The premises in which this event occurred contained two consignments of exotic birds from Surinam and Taiwan. At this stage, we cannot say for sure where the virus originated, but our working hypothesis, taking account of the identification of the particular strain, is that the virus is most likely to have come via Taiwan. However, it is important to keep an open mind about other possible sources and we are doing exactly that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">As the House knows, the birds in the quarantine premises were culled by officers from the local animal health office on Friday evening. All those at the premises who may have come into contact with diseased birds were given antiviral treatment to protect them against risk of infection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Since Friday, we have been investigating the sequence of events that led to the death of the birds. As we announced on Sunday, some birds had already died in quarantine before 16 October. Thirty-two of those birds were being held in a freezer. Initial tests, which have not yet been validated, identified that H5 is present in some of those birds. We have not yet established the full circumstances of those deaths. However, our standard instructions on deaths in quarantine state:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;When birds die during quarantine, their carcases must be placed by quarantine staff in a fridge or freezer until the Local Veterinary Inspector can collect them for transmission to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">That is, of course, where the tests are carried out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Our investigations will continue and we will of course bring our findings to the attention of the House as early as possible. Meanwhile, we are taking certain prudent steps to ensure that our protection against avian influenza is as secure as possible. First, I want to underline the fact that this incident has demonstrated both the threat posed by avian influenza and the controls that we have in place to meet that threat. The quarantine system provided the protection that it is intended to deliver. That is not a reason for complacency, but it is right that we should recognise the swift and effective action that was taken once the disease had been identified. It also means that our disease-free status on avian flu remains unaffected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The incident took place against a background of increasing reported outbreaks of avian influenza in wild birds. Since July, we have seen outbreaks first in an area of Russia and then in Romania and Turkey. There have been other confirmed and suspected cases in some of those countries and in Croatia. We are taking those developments very seriously, but I should perhaps stress 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 308</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that they are not in themselves a cause for undue alarm. Avian flu does not at present transmit easily to humans. But there is concern about the potential for avian influenza viruses to mutate into new forms that might directly affect humans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Such transmission has not yet happened and indeed may never happen, but there is good reason to be very vigilant against the establishment of avian flu. I stress that avian flu is a disease of birds and that we receive a number of reports of suspected cases in any normal year, and for the obvious reason that people are being particularly cautious, we have received more than normal this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">Moreover, we in the UK and more generally in the European Union have worked to establish a good level of preparedness. Our contingency plan for avian flu was laid before Parliament in July. We regularly exercise the contingency arrangements nationally and locally, and our recent experience of managing a Newcastle disease outbreak demonstrated the fundamental soundness of those arrangements for dealing with a disease outbreak in birds, but we will continue to build on that good level of preparedness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">In response to the specific incident that has occurred in quarantine, we issued instructions to the state veterinary service at the weekend that releases of birds from quarantine should now be subject to a case-by-case risk assessment. We understand that there are about 15 consignments of birds currently in quarantine. Each of those will be subjected to an individual veterinary risk assessment and referred to DEFRA headquarters before any decision to release is authorised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">At the weekend, the chief veterinary officer and I ordered that a general review of our quarantine arrangements and procedures be undertaken. Pending the outcome of that review, we have called on the European Commission to propose an immediate temporary ban on imports of live birds into the EU while we collectively assess the risk that they pose. I am pleased to say that the Commission responded very positively to that call, and a ban lasting until 30 November was agreed in the relevant EU Standing Committee yesterday.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">At the same time, we are especially mindful of the potential threat posed by illegal imports. My Department already works closely with Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs on the control of illegal imports of animals and animal products, and I have asked my officials immediately to address how we can increase our vigilance against the specific issue of illegal imports of live birds. The Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), who has responsibility for rural affairs, landscape and biodiversity, will also take up the issue of illegal trade at an EU wildlife trade enforcement event tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">We were already working actively with the Commission and other member states to tackle the wider threat of the introduction of avian influenza by migrating wildfowl and other routes. As a result of that work, I expect to bring before the House within the coming days sensible and measured regulations that will assist us in reducing the risk of disease and strengthening our ability to control an outbreak. Those regulations will implement the announcement that we made last 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 309</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>week about establishing a register of all commercial poultry producers in the country. As we said then, we shall start that process of registration next month.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">For non-commercial poultry keepers, we have produced a simple, clear and, I hope, effective guide to biosecurity, and we are actively distributing that guide through lobby groups, veterinary networks, hobby magazines and other available channels. We have also decided, with fellow member states, that in the present circumstances, it is desirable to prohibit bird fairs, markets and shows, except where a risk assessment shows that they can be safely conducted. We are in full discussion of that proposal with potentially affected stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">Ornithological groups are also very important stakeholders for us, and earlier this month, we reached an agreement with them jointly to monitor wild birds. That is, of course, in addition to our existing annual programme of monitoring domestic poultry for avian influenza that is already under way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">The regulations that we will bring before Parliament will give legal effect to the provisions in recent legislation that enable us to instruct poultry keepers to keep their birds indoors, and we are urgently discussing that provision with stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">In conclusion, I recognise that the public are rightly concerned about avian flu. I am pleased that our quarantine rules worked to identify and eradicate the immediate risk in this particular incident, but because we are not complacent, we are taking the steps that I have indicated both to review and strengthen our protection against legal and illegal imports of captive wild birds, and in the next few days, we will bring forward the new regulations that I have described.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51026-04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Oliver Letwin  (West Dorset) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for making available an early copy of her statement and for the technical briefing that her officials provided us with yesterday. I welcome unreservedly the ban on commercial live bird imports that she has announced today, but I have some questions about the past and some questions about the future. I shall start with the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">First, why did the Secretary of State and her Ministers for six months strenuously resist EU proposals to impose a ban on commercial wild bird imports? Secondly, in her statement she admitted that despite press briefings over the weekend she does not currently know whether the infected bird was a parrot, whether it came from Surinam or whether it was infected by a bird from Taiwan. This is horribly reminiscent of the confusion over sheep and cattle material for which she apologised to the House in 2001. Can she explain how she and her Ministers have for many months presided over quarantine procedures so lax that birds from different continents are kept together, test samples are pooled and there is no clarity in her Department about the true implication of the tests?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">Thirdly, when we surveyed poultry concerns we discovered that fewer than half could recall proactive steps by the Department or any other intermediary body to inform them fully about avian flu. Why, after months 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 310</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of reports about the problem, have the Secretary of State and her Ministers failed to take such proactive steps to inform the poultry sector?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">I turn to the future. What will the Secretary of State do to ensure the proper separation of birds still in quarantine, to which she referred, and to provide proper polymerase chain reaction testing for poultry flocks? Can she guarantee that the compensation paid to farmers for slaughtered flocks will be sufficiently generous to give incentives for full reporting? How will controls at ports of entry be increased to prevent the smuggling of wild birds once the ban is in place? How will commercial imports be distinguished from pet imports that are merely being restricted? Who within her Department will be accountable for ensuring that any outbreak in the poultry flock is fully and immediately contained?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-04_para19">
<a name="stpa_19">In the light of past serious failures and the confusion and inactivity surrounding recent events, the House has a right to an assurance from the Secretary of State that from now on it will no longer be business as usual. We do not want to see her Department once again rendered impotent in the face of disaster and the Army brought in to clear up the mess.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51026-05_spnew0"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Well, no need to urge the public not to be hysterical.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_20">It is not the case that for six months we strenuously resisted such a ban. I always believe in being charitable to the Opposition, so I appreciate that the right hon. Gentleman may have a mistaken impression from things that he heard on the radio. The facts are that as long ago as last March a request was made to the European Commission via the Belgian Minister&#151;not, by the way, on the grounds of anything to do with animal disease or avian flu but on the grounds of the welfare of wild birds&#151;from those who have long and legitimately campaigned on those matters. Ministers were not unsympathetic. We sought advice, but the advice was that such a move was not justified. That was also the view of the Commission. The matter was discussed in Council. The Commission argued strongly that on welfare grounds it was a disproportionate response. I repeat that it was not a disease issue at that stage. It is not the case, as has been reported, that only the UK did not share that view. That is wholly untrue. Indeed a moment&#039;s thought would make people realise that it was untrue because if only the UK had taken that stance, it would have gone through. The Commission took the view that it was not required, and several member states, of which we were one, supported the Commission. There is thus no truth in the suggestion that we strenuously resisted such a move.
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51026-05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 So you did strenuously resist?
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51026-05_spnew2"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 We did not resist at all. We said that we felt it was not justified at that time; it was not an animal disease requirement, or concern.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_21">In September I asked my hon. Friend the Minister of State to review our contingency plan and our contingency arrangements. Following that, a decision was made to draft a letter to the Commission asking for such a ban. In fact, before the dead parrot ever hove into view over the horizon the Government had already 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 311</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>decided to approach the Commission to ask it to reconsider the position with regard to a ban. As for the question of separation, the pooling of test samples is a standard procedure, as I said in my statement, and has been for many years. Obviously the whole question of whether birds are separated in different places and in quarantine, and of whether test samples are pooled, which are not at present addressed in the rules, will be considered in the review that we will undertake. It is, however, absolutely clear what the procedures were. We must consider two separate issues: whether the present events occurred because procedures were not followed, or whether they happened because of something to do with the procedures, which we should be refining in any event. That is the exact issue that we are considering.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_22">The right hon. Gentleman asked me about his famous survey. I understand that there are 70,000 or so keepers of poultry, who are, of course, probably the ones with relatively large numbers of birds about whom we know. He seems to be under the impression that those people should have been contacted by my Department. I thought that he was in favour of reducing the number of bureaucrats. I am not quite sure how many staff he wants the Department to have if it is to contact 70,000 poultry keepers personally. May I remind the House that it has been the case for a considerable time that poultry keepers are under an obligation to monitor their birds and report signs of illness? They must, as a condition of keeping those birds, know what to do about serious and notifiable avian diseases. These are notifiable diseases.

 I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the answer to some of his questions. For example, as I said a few moments ago, whether the regulations were observed and whether the rules are adequate are separate issues, and we are pursuing both of them. At present, different species can be mixed, and he is right to assume that that is exactly the kind of issue that the review of general rules will consider. As for where the birds were kept and who was keeping them, there is nothing that I can say about any individual except that the press reports include observations about individuals who are said to have committed offences, but those offences are not reported to relate to the keeping of birds per se. What have been reported are revenue offences.

We are also looking at the question of whether there is a potential for vaccine, but no authorised vaccine is available at present. If a suitable vaccine were used, birds would have to be vaccinated twice with a minimum three-week separation period. Poultry would be dead by then anyway, because there is a seven-week lifespan. Of course, we will look again at vaccination, but it is not the immediate remedy that people may hope for.

 The whole House should welcome my right hon. Friend&#039;s statement, including her confirmation that consideration is being given to a requirement that commercial poultry production take place indoors. Such a policy would require premature slaughter, would involve significant commercial and public cost, and would doubtless be based on the best veterinary and medical advice available to the Government. However, if we have to go down that road, does she agree that it would make sense for the Republic of Ireland to do so as well? If the position has to be decided at European level, it may be best to do so. Which EU member states have already implemented such a policy?

 I cannot give my right hon. Friend a great deal of information, because the position is changing. It is for member states to make a risk assessment, not merely in their country but in its regions. Yesterday, or perhaps this morning, France advised poultry keepers in coastal areas and another area in the eastern region of France to take their poultry indoors, but that does not apply to the whole country. The issue of whether or not there are circumstances in the UK in which we would advise people to take such a step is something that we keep under review, as does every member state. As I said, member states that are closer to the wildfowl outbreaks that have been reported have taken action in some parts of their territory.

 The hon. Gentleman makes some important points. Frankly, I do not have any idea whether the facility is within his constituency because I do not know where his constituency boundaries are. Nevertheless, in whatever constituency such an event occurs, he makes a valid and legitimate point and his constituents&#039; questions are relevant. When people wish to set up a quarantine facility it is inspected in advance to check that it is adequate. When there are animals in the facility, there are regular inspections and monitoring by local veterinary inspectors and so on. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents can be assured that such precautions are in place. They can also be assured that the review will look at whether those precautions are adequate and whether, for example, we should continue to permit the mixing of birds from different continents. I cannot comment on the position of his local primary care trust, but I repeat that the case was detected in a secure facility. Although there is proper concern about the long-term implications for human health of the avian virus we are not in circumstances where its feared consequences are apparent.

We must keep a balance between what will help us to maintain proper precautions and biosecurity, and clarity of information.

 With other hon. Members, I am concerned about the management of the quarantine centre in Essex and general quarantine practice, particularly that birds that died during the quarantine period were put into cold storage, waiting for a convenient time for a veterinary investigation to take place. Birds could have been released from quarantine, showing no symptoms but incubating the disease that they caught from the birds that died. Surely birds that die during quarantine should be investigated immediately.
</p>





<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51026-07_spnew10"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, so let me try to make matters as clear as possible. I take his point about the investigation on the birds being carried out straight away, but it is standard procedure, and has been for many years, that they should be frozen until examination. However, there has been some misinformation on the point. If, as happened in the quarantine facility that we are discussing, one set of birds is in quarantine and another set of birds is brought in, the quarantine period for the whole lot restarts when the second set arrives, and no birds are released until that quarantine period has expired. In addition, apart from that extended quarantine period, if there are any outstanding tests&#151;tests are carried out on birds that die in quarantine&#151;the birds are still not released until the results of those outstanding tests are confirmed. All of that, and whether it is a good thing to pool the samples and so on, will be considered in our review of how our quarantine facilities operate. It is understandable because it is not always easy to follow matters through, but there has been quite a lot of reporting about the birds having been released early. No, they were not near the end of their quarantine period, and while tests were outstanding&#151;which there would be if there were dead birds&#151;they would not have been released until the test results were known.

Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) asked about that and I did not get round to the answer. Compensation is not available in the circumstances that she describes. With regard to an incident of disease where some birds die but others are not affected, compensation is available only for birds that do not have the disease. That is an incentive to keep birds healthy and to have strong biosecurity, because there would not be compensation for birds that get a disease and have to be culled.

Police believe that that is the tip of the iceberg. Those who download such images say that they have committed no crime, but every single vile picture that includes babies and children being raped and tortured has destroyed an innocent life.

Over a year ago, BT proved conclusively that the technology now exists to allow ISPs to block access to child pornography on the internet. This effective filtering system, called Cleanfeed, has been live for over 18 months, and allows the user to enjoy the full advantages of the internet minus illegal websites. By blocking the connection between the site and the user, child pornography becomes inaccessible. Instantly, supply will be cut off from demand and the illegal act of producing child pornography will become unprofitable.

For every day that they delay, more children are being abused, so the Bill is a wake-up call to them. It is not designed to force ISPs to adopt the technology or tell us what technology they use.

<a name="stpa_39">The Bill is intended primarily as a public accountability mechanism. All UK companies have to make a range of declarations in their annual reports&#151;for example, on health and safety issues or carbon emissions. From that perspective, this is not a revolutionary idea. Although I am interested in a company&#039;s policies on global warming, if it happens to be an ISP, there is at least one other aspect of its activities that is more immediately relevant and of interest&#151;what it is doing to end the terrible trade in illegal child sex abuse images.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_46">The Bill seeks to place our counter-terrorist legislation on a permanent and secure basis. I should say at the outset that I am well aware that Members on both sides of the House have doubts about two particular aspects of the Bill: first, the definitions of terrorism and glorification and how we describe them; and secondly, the length of time that somebody may be detained before charge, and proposed amendments in that respect. I will come to those issues later in my speech, but I should say now that I am ready to give way to debate them at the relevant time today, although of course the major debates will take place in Committee and on Report on the Floor of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_47">The Government have said all along that in a matter as important as this legislation we want to proceed on the basis of consensus. In that spirit, I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) and the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten), and to the Select Committee on Home Affairs, the Joint Committee on Human Rights and others, for the constructive tone that they have adopted over the summer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_48">I made a commitment to bring forward further counter-terrorism legislation earlier this year during the passage of the Bill that became the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. Preparations for the Bill were already well under way in early July of this year, and I set out a list of measures to the Opposition spokespeople on 15 July. I am grateful to them both for the constructive response that they were able to give. I also made it clear that we were consulting the police and intelligence agencies in the light of the terrorist attacks and would consider whether additional measures were required. On that basis, I sent out a draft Bill to the Opposition and to Committee Chairs on 15 September.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_49">In the light of the helpful comments that we received from a variety of sources, on 6 October I set out some revised proposals in respect of the offence of glorification. On the same day, my right hon. Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary published a paper setting out anti-terrorism laws in other countries, which I hope will help to inform today&#039;s debate. In the same spirit, through the usual channels we agreed a substantial amount of time to debate the Bill in Committee and on Report on the Floor of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_50">That is how we reached the stage that we are at today. In addressing the central issue that we face, I must start from the fundamental premise that there is a serious terrorist threat that has to be addressed. From New York, Nairobi, Sharm el-Sheik, Istanbul, two offences in Bali&#151;one recently&#151;Madrid, and our own events in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 323</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>London this July, we know of the existence of that terrorist threat. As we legislate to address it, we must do so on the basis, first, of clarifying the values and society that we are seeking to defend, and secondly, of identifying the threat with which we have to deal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_51">Of all the societies throughout the world, perhaps that of the United Kingdom is the society that laid the basis for the values that we here seek to defend: valuing and building free speech and freedom of expression, including a free media; believing in a society that respects all faiths, races and beliefs; believing in a society founded on the rule of law; wanting every citizen to have a democratic stake in our society; valuing the free economy which has built prosperity, including high-quality public services on which we all depend; and valuing the fact that women can play a full role in our society. We all know that our society, based on those values, will continue to evolve and develop. We also know that we can all point to aspects of our society that fall short of those aspirations. However, people on all sides of politics have struggled over the centuries to achieve the values that we celebrate today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_52">The society that we have built, with the values that it embodies, is not slight nor passing but deeply rooted and profound. I emphasise that those values are embraced by the overwhelming majority of our citizens, from whatever faith group or minority ethnic group they come. Indeed, most of those who have migrated to our country did so precisely because they wanted to embrace the values that I just set out. Our society is characterised by common values but diverse backgrounds, faiths and lifestyles. It has been a stunningly successful model of integration, despite regular challenges.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-08_para8">
<a name="stpa_53">If one compares the United Kingdom of the 1950s, before significant migration took place, with the United Kingdom of today, one sees that in many key parts of life and endeavour&#151;our businesses, our design, our literature, our food; there are too many to name&#151;the vibrancy of diversity has powered creativity and economic success. I emphasise again, however, that that has always happened within the framework of our common democratic values.

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="51026-08_spnew0"><b> Mr. John Baron  (Billericay) (Con):</b> 
 Some aspects of the Bill create further concerns that the Government are too willing to accept recommendations from the security forces without adequately scrutinising them. Control orders and evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq are two examples of that. Will the Home Secretary make it clear why he believes that the detention period without charge should be extended to 90 days?
</p>





<p><a name="st_43"><a name="51026-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was present when I began, but I said then that I would deal specifically with the 90-day point when I reached that part of my speech. I shall do that.

<p><a name="st_44"><a name="51026-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Alan Beith  (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</b> 
 The Home Secretary is rightly dealing with the theme of values. What about the value to which Lord Carlile referred when he criticised the excessive use of section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000? He described its use as a substantial encroachment into the reasonable expectation of the public at large that they would face police intervention in their lives only if there was a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 324</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reasonable suspicion that they would commit a crime. Is not that value threatened if events such as those at the Labour party conference or the instance of the person who was told that she could not walk on a cycle path occur?
</p>





<p><a name="st_45"><a name="51026-08_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am surprised that the right hon. Gentleman adopts that tone. However, he is right to cite Lord Carlile because his report is the basis on which we deal with legislation on all such matters. We will continue to pay serious attention to his comments on section 44 and other aspects of our proposals because it is his role to report to Parliament and to the Intelligence and Security Committee, of which the right hon. Gentleman is a member.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-08_para9">
<a name="stpa_54">Our type of democratic society has been created over many years and all parts of our community embrace and support it. I argue even more strongly that the ambition for democratic society has driven enormous political and social change in the past 30 years throughout the world. In those 30 years, fascist or militaristic rule in Greece, Spain and Portugal in southern Europe has been succeeded by democracy; apartheid South Africa has been succeeded by democracy; colonialist southern Africa has been replaced by democracy; the totalitarian states of central and eastern Europe have been succeeded by democracy; Latin and central American dictatorship has been replaced by democracy, and, even in south-east Asia, democracy has replaced dictatorship. Democracy and the need to protect our democracy is at the heart of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-08_para10">
<a name="stpa_55">I understand perfectly well that, in each of those parts of the world, massive problems remain. However, those enormous changes, which have occurred across the planet in one generation, prove that change for the good can happen, and, moreover&#151;and more important&#151;without violence or bloodshed in many cases. It is important for this generation to assert that. I repeat that the fight for democracy is at the core of those great changes.

 The Home Secretary is making an important point. Does he also accept that this country has an important tradition of being a place where people have a right of asylum and where people can proselytise to get rid of oppressive regimes throughout the world? Does he agree that many such people were labelled as terrorists but later lauded as freedom fighters for achieving change? Will he assure me that the Bill will not criminalise those who plead for decency and change in their societies?

 The House welcomes the progress to democracy in many parts of the world, but it is relatively recent and we cannot be sure that it is permanent. I am one of those who, in the 1980s, regularly produced material that praised the then Government of Nicaragua for their work in education, health and tackling poverty. That Government came to power in a revolution in which a brutal dictatorship was overthrown. Were those events to repeat themselves, I cannot understand how I would not be guilty of an offence under clauses 1 and 2.
</p>





<p><a name="st_53"><a name="51026-09_spnew6"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 With all due respect to my right hon. Friend, he is wrong. We have had that conversation privately and in the Select Committee that he chairs. I respect the motivation in Nicaragua&#151;it also applies to other parts of the world&#151;to which he refers, but I do not accept his point. To argue that what he described would in any way violate the terms of the Bill is to misread the measure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_56">The fight for democracy is at the core of the changes that have occurred. It is precisely because we have developed a highly successful model of integration, which enables people of all backgrounds and faiths to prosper and live together within the safeguard of common values, that our society has become an affront and a reproach to the ideologues who believe that only their way of living is right. We should make no mistake: the threat that we face is ideological. It is not driven by poverty, social exclusion or racial hatred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_57">Those who attacked London in July and those who have been engaged in or committed the long list of previous terrorist atrocities were not the poor and the dispossessed. They were, for the most part, well educated and prosperous. Terrorists in the UK have also been ethnically and nationally diverse. Ideas drive those people forward. To revert to the point that my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) correctly made, unlike the liberation movements of the post world war two era, they are not in pursuit of political ideas such as national independence from colonial rule, equality for all citizens without regard for race or creed or

</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_58">However, there can be no negotiation about the recreation of the caliphate in this country, the imposition of sharia law, the suppression of equality between the sexes or the ending of free speech. Those values are fundamental to our civilisation and are simply not up for negotiation. It is equally wrong to claim, as some do, that the motivation of al-Qaeda and its allies is some desire to seek justice in the middle east&#151;the part of the world where progress has been most difficult to achieve in the past 30 years and where the litany of change that I read out has made so little headway. Al-Qaeda and its allies have no clear demands for the middle east. The only common thread in their approach is a violent and destructive opposition to democracy in any form. They find democracy in Palestine abhorrent and seek to destroy it.

<a name="51026-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_60">Al-Qaeda&#039;s methods, too, are different. It recognises no common bonds with people who have different beliefs and its members are prepared to kill indiscriminately. Indeed, mass murder is their explicit objective&#151;the measure of success in their terms. Their methods of recruitment bear more comparison to self-destructive cults than political movements. However, we must acknowledge that their modern nihilism is innovative, flexible and cunning. Al-Qaeda and the networks that are inspired by it approach the task with all the resources of modern technology and all the focus of modern zealotry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-09_para5">
<a name="stpa_61">The most important conclusion to draw from this analysis is that there is no particular Government policy decision, or even an overall policy stance, which we could change in order somehow to remove our society from the al-Qaeda firing line. Its nihilism means that our societies would cease to be a target only if we were to renounce all the values of freedom and liberty that we have fought to extend over so many years. Our only answer to this threat must be to contest and then to defeat it, and that is why we need this legislation.

 I do not disagree with what the Home Secretary is saying about al-Qaeda, but he must realise that the terrorism covered by the Bill also extends to overseas terrorism. There might well be movements designed to displace by violent means the Administration in Burma or that of President Mugabe. There are many people in the House who would want to see both those regimes displaced and who might 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 Wanting to change the regime in Zimbabwe or Burma is the legitimate right of every citizen of this country.

It would not be right, however, to say that blowing up a tourist bus or a tube train, or taking action of that type, was a legitimate way of changing the regime of Robert Mugabe or whoever.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_63">I suggest that the best way to contest this threat is by building and strengthening the democracy of our society, by isolating extremism in its various manifestations, by strengthening the legal framework within which we contest terrorism, and by developing more effective means to do so. That is why, particularly since 7 July but also before then, we have worked very hard&#151;my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench in particular&#151;to build our relations with the Muslim communities and the communities of all faiths, and to discuss how we can build our democracy and strengthen it so that all communities, young and old, men and women, have a genuine, strong stake in our society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_64">That means that we have to promote a society based on the true respect of one individual for another, one culture for another, one faith for another and one race for another. It also means promoting the view that democracy is the means of making change in our society. We therefore need to take steps to isolate extremist organisations and those individuals who promote extremism. In so doing, it is essential for us to work closely with the mainstream faith communities and to understand their preoccupations. That is why we need legislation to outlaw incitement to hatred based on religion or race. We need legislation that makes it clear that the glorification of terrorism is not a legitimate political expression of view. We wish to encourage faiths to pursue their faith openly and directly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-09_para9">

We intend to remove from the United Kingdom those foreign citizens who are using their time in our country to promote extremism, although that course of action is not legally straightforward. All the measures we have taken will further isolate and weaken those extremists who wish to promote terrorism as an appropriate form of activity. However, we need to strengthen the legal framework within which we can address those issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-09_para10">
<a name="stpa_66">Throughout all this, I assert the need to retain and strengthen our human rights and the values that underlie them, but, at the same time, I say that the right to be protected from the death and destruction caused by indiscriminate terrorism is at least as important as the right of the terrorist to be protected from torture and ill-treatment. Our peoples expect not only the protection of individual rights but the protection of democratic values such as safety and security under the law. We need a legal framework that seeks to address the difficult balance in relation to those rights. We cannot properly fight terrorism with one legal hand tied behind our back, or give terrorists the unfettered right to defend themselves as they promote and prepare violent attacks on our society. That is why we are proposing legal changes in Britain to outlaw acts preparatory to terrorism and terrorist training.

 The misgivings of many Members of the House relate to the final part of what the Home Secretary said about necessary and appropriate means. Will he confirm that of the 900 or so people who have been arrested and detained under the Terrorism Act 2000, there has not been a single successful prosecution made for membership of any organisation on the burgeoning proscribed list, which we are told must be banned internationally. What we have done is to create a culture of fear, and a sense of division and vulnerability, that has nothing whatever to do with successful action against terrorism.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-10_para13">
<a name="stpa_80">The Liberal Democrats&#039; have legitimate arguments about the definition of terrorism in relation to the term &quot;glorification&quot;, and about the extension of the time limit for detention from 14 days to 90 days. I know that the hon. Member for Winchester has doubts, as he has said publicly and privately to me, about the wisdom of extending that time limit, and he has been perfectly fair about that. In relation to the structure of debates in the House, however, I do not believe that such doubts, which will be expressed, voted on and considered in Committee and on Report&#151;and which, if so serious, could lead his hon. Friends to vote against the Bill on Third Reading&#151;ought to break the unity of the House in seeking to carry through the principle established on Second Reading. His leader, the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy), wrote to <i>The Spectator</i> on 22 October&#151;which I thought was a spectacular thing for him to do&#151;revealing that the Liberal Democrat shadow Cabinet was having

<a name="stpa_81">I am sure that they are not mired in it; the debates and discussions currently taking place on that matter are inspired and interesting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-10_para15">
<a name="stpa_82">If the Liberal Democrats want to provide real opposition to the Government, the way to do that is not to offer knee-jerk opposition to everything, but to work on the basis of principle, to carry things through and to debate things in a proper way. The principled position, in my view, is for the party to vote for Second Reading, and then vote against, as and when the hon. Member for Winchester thinks appropriate, on the particular measures later. Even at this late stage, I hope that the Liberal Democrats will reconsider their position.

<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51026-11_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mark Oaten  (Winchester) (LD):</b> 
 It is our judgment that real, principled opposition is about making a stand on the key issue of holding suspects without charge. We feel so strongly on that issue that we want to oppose the Bill&#039;s Second Reading tonight. It is still our long-term aim to achieve consensus, however, and we aim to work with the Home Secretary to find alternatives to this measure in the weeks ahead.

 I believe that the hon. Gentleman does have a sincere intention in that respect, and is seeking agreement on some issues and trying to put forward positive proposals.

If, in his view, the matter is resolved unsatisfactorily by the end of that process, he should vote against the Bill on Third Reading.

 I certainly recognise that. I have discussed those reservations with a number of colleagues, and if I might say so, my hon. Friend put the position accurately and succinctly. The way to address such reservations is to accept that we need legislation, to have arguments and discussions inside our party and across the Floor of the House on the matters of concern, and in particular the 90-day limit and then to decide what to do.

On the three-month detention, however, will my right hon. Friend accept that the deep concern felt about that period is certainly not confined to the Liberal Democrats? Will there be further consultation between now and Committee to see whether an accommodation can be reached? If we want to reach a consensus, let us be frank: we will not reach a consensus on the 90 days, be it in this House, the other place or in the country at large. I hope that he can show some flexibility on that important issue.
</p>





<p><a name="st_80"><a name="51026-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention, and I agree that it is right to be flexible. I have made it clear throughout that consensus is the right way to proceed, not only in our party, which is an often ambitious target, but even with Opposition Members. It would be better if we sent out a united and coherent message. In Committee, on Report and otherwise, I am ready to be flexible in discussions, if we can reach an agreement. Furthermore, it would be better if the House resolved the matter rather than left it to the other place, but that requires both sides of the House to work constructively to reach agreement.

 Allowing for people&#039;s anxieties, is not our track record that detention beyond seven days has been used very sparingly since that period was extended in 2004? Is not it fair to say that the real choice that might confront the House is whether to give an advantage to the police when trying to deal with complex terrorist investigations&#151;an advantage that can be subject to parliamentary and judicial scrutiny&#151;or to give that advantage to the terrorist?
</p>





<p><a name="st_82"><a name="51026-11_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b>

 My right hon. Friend talked about the strategy for fighting terrorism, the final part of which was the international element.

In addition to concerns about section 44, does he accept that some sections of the Bill limit the

 My hon. Friend is entirely correct to put the gathering of intelligence at the centre of what we do. He is also entirely correct in the corollary of that point, which is that it is important to have close relationships with the community.

It is only a few months since we produced legislation of this kind in response to Belmarsh, which was highly controversial and which referred to none of these issues.

<p>
<a name="51026-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_84">This Bill was envisaged in debate on the Floor of the House during the passage of the Bill that became the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. That is because when measures to deal with offences involving, for instance, incitement and training were proposed by the Newton committee and others, we said that we would return to them for precisely the reason that the right hon. and learned Gentleman cites: the need for prosecution. I gave the House a commitment that we would legislate on those issues during this parliamentary Session.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_85">It is true that following the events of 7 July there are more measures in the Bill than would otherwise have been the case. We sent a list of proposals to the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden and the hon. Member for Winchester as early as 15 July. That

<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 334</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>list had been prepared in the spirit of following through our proposals. The Bill is therefore not emergency legislation. Moreover, the fact that we are allowing two days on the Floor of the House for the Committee stage and another two days for Report indicates our keenness to establish the non-emergency nature of the legislation, and to put it on a proper footing.

The first is the offence of encouragement of terrorism, also known as indirect incitement. It is already an offence under our law to incite people directly to commit specific terrorist attacks. We now want to be able to deal with those who incite terrorism more obliquely, but who nevertheless contribute to the creation of a climate in which impressionable people might believe that terrorism was acceptable.The Bill criminalises those who make statements which they believe, or have reasonable grounds for believing, are likely to be understood by their audience as an inducement to commit terrorist acts.

Accordingly, glorification is now an offence only if the person who glorifies terrorism believes, or has reasonable grounds for believing, that the remarks will be understood as an incitement to terrorist acts.

We will have to tackle this issue, because as drafted the definition is so wide that legitimate armed resistance to tyranny would be covered and any encouragement of it would be criminalised.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_99">The Bill creates a new offence of acts preparatory to terrorism that I hope will find favour in all parts of the House. It also deals with training for terrorism and makes it an offence to give or receive training for terrorist purposes, or to attend a terrorist training camp. It contains the necessary measures to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the United Nations convention on the suppression of nuclear terrorism, and it extends the offence of criminal trespass to civil nuclear sites for reasons that, I hope, all Members will understand, given that such sites need the maximum possible protection. On that theme, we have decided that a small number of key military sites should be covered by the protection afforded by the offence of trespassing on a designated site in sections 128 to 131 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. An order designating those sites to be protected will be submitted to the House by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence in due course.

<a name="stpa_104">Lord Carlile of Berriew, a Liberal Democrat peer, said in paragraph 61 of his report published on 12 October:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;I am satisfied beyond doubt that there have been situations in which significant conspiracies to commit terrorist acts have gone unprosecuted as a result of the time limitations placed on the control authorities following arrest&quot;.</p>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_105">That is a strong statement, which I greatly respect. The case for an extension to three months was set out very clearly in my letter of 6 October to Opposition spokespeople and in the accompanying paper from assistant commissioner, Andy Hayman, the nation&#039;s most senior anti-terrorist police officer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_106">Much of our anti-terrorist legislation derives from our experience of dealing with 30 years of Irish terrorism, but the fact is that we are dealing with a very different threat now and we believe that the current time limit is not well designed to deal with that new threat. Recent terrorist plots have been designed to cause mass casualties, with no warnings, sometimes involving suicide and with the threat of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons, to which Lord Ashdown referred last Monday in the quote that I cited earlier. The need to ensure public safety by preventing such attacks means that it is necessary to make arrests at an earlier stage than in the past, when there was a culture of warnings and where weapons of mass destruction did not exist as now. That often means that less evidence has been gathered at the point of arrest, which means that more time will be needed to gather sufficient evidence to charge a suspect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_107">Terrorist networks are often international&#151;another difference in the evolution of the threat that we face. That means that inquiries have to be undertaken in many different jurisdictions and under different rules. Many of those cannot operate to tight time scales. Moreover, establishing the identity or even the nationality of suspects can take a long time and the use of forged and stolen documentation compounds the problem. The global nature of modern terrorism means that it is often necessary to employ interpreters. It is sometimes necessary to find interpreters who can interpret dialects from remote parts of the world. Such interpreters can be hard to find, which, together with interviews to be translated, slows down the process and restricts the amount of time available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_108">Terrorist cases are also highly complex. I remind the House that investigations into the events of 7 and 21 July yielded 38,000 exhibits that filled two warehouses, all of which need to be scrutinised. The same investigations required 80,000 videos of CCTV footage to be studied and 1,400 fingerprints across 160 crime scenes. As I said earlier, terrorist networks are now highly capable of using technology. In recent cases, a large number&#151;sometimes in the hundreds&#151;of computers and hard drives have been seized and much of the data on those computers have been encrypted. The examination and decryption of data on such computers and hard drives takes time and expertise; then, of course, the data need to be analysed in order to incorporate the outcome of the analysis into an interview strategy.

They are trying to make a serious assessment while legislation is being considered in the House of the time that they are likely to need in certain extreme circumstances.

A person might be held for 90 days while evidence is pursued, but if that pursuit fails, he or she will be released after, in effect, spending three months in jail.

 That is a possibility, which is why extensions of the detention period will be subject to judicial review at each stage. Moreover, when the police decide whether to seek judicial agreement to extend the period of detention prior to charge, they will take into account precisely the considerations that the right hon. Gentleman outlined. He raises a legitimate point, but given the very small number of cases that are likely to arise, I do not think that the outcome that he suggests is either likely or realistic.

: My right hon. Friend has said that Lord Carlile supports the extension proposal. However, Lord Carlile has criticised the Bill for the inadequacy of the protection given to suspects, and has recommended eight separate safeguards&#151;including the use of an examining magistrate&#151;to be employed if consideration is being given to detaining a person for more than one month. Given that the recommendations are unlikely to be included in the Bill, will my right hon. Friend concede that there is no possibility for hon.

 Andy Hayman makes a pretty strong argument in his submission, but I accept that the extension of detention from seven days to three months is dramatic and rather arbitrary. In the past, the judiciary have demonstrated a very strong commitment to protecting human rights in such cases. Would not the sensible and balanced procedure be to pass enabling legislation in respect of the extension, but to put its scrutiny, process and management into the hands of those who have demonstrated both expertise in and concern for human rights&#151;that is, the judiciary?

 I reject the hon. Gentleman&#039;s charge completely. Perhaps I should have done so earlier, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin). It is completely and utterly false to suggest that the police come up with a proposition to which we all say, &quot;That&#039;s all right then.&quot; When we ask the police for their assessment of a situation, they give it. We take that assessment seriously, because the police have high levels of professional expertise and competence in dealing with matters of forensics, encryption, international relations and so on. That was demonstrated most recently here in London in July. They understand the problems that they are trying to wrestle with very clearly, and the old days of good cop, bad cop are gone.

 Earlier, my right hon. Friend spoke about the need to comply with the European convention, and I endorse what he said very strongly. However, this country gives off very strong signals when it changes its laws on terrorism. Any change here is used as evidence by other countries that they can do the same. Given that, is this aspect of the Bill compatible with the European convention?
</p>





<p><a name="st_163"><a name="51026-15_spnew13"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 This aspect of the Bill is compatible with the convention because the whole Bill is compatible, but my hon. Friend raises an interesting point. I discuss how to deal with terrorism with colleagues in the EU, the US, Russia and other countries, yet our legal system adopts a different approach from many others. That is why I referred to the report from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office about how these matters are dealt with in a variety of other jurisdictions and systems. I acknowledge that completely different legal systems are involved, but in the EU and other countries people can be held for very long periods&#151;up to four years&#151;while charges are investigated. We must look at that, and I accept that legal systems vary widely. However, we discuss these questions a lot, and I repeat that the Bill is compatible with the European convention.

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="51026-15_spnew14"><b> Mr. Denham </b> 
: My right hon. Friend has been very generous in giving way, and I have a simple question about the Crown Prosecution Service.

If not, should not consideration be given to developing their use in that respect? In that way, the option of charging people with lesser offences for

 I can answer my right hon. Friend directly: yes, there are specialist prosecutors in the areas that he mentioned, and I accept his recommendation that their use should be developed. However, it is important to note that the CPS&#039; expertise in these matters has led it to support the changes proposed in the Bill. People sometimes say, &quot;Don&#039;t trust the experts.&quot; I suppose that that is a good guide in many walks of life, and better than saying, &quot;Trust the politicians, they&#039;re not experts in anything.&quot; The truth is that we should take the views of our experts seriously, whether they be prosecutors, police or something else.

<a name="stpa_117">On 7 July, there were a few evil men, but many more good men and women. They responded to the horror with fortitude, self-sacrifice and great generosity.

We must balance the security of the nation with the rights of ordinary citizens.

<a name="stpa_121">With that warning, let me turn to the substance of the Bill. Let me start by thanking the Home Secretary for the way he has conducted himself throughout the discussions we have had about this piece of legislation, over the entire summer. Despite the pressures from the public, the press, and even the Prime Minister, he has brought a welcome openness of mind to the negotiations. As a result, there are many aspects of the Bill that I am able to support unequivocally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_122">We welcome plans to create a new offence of acts preparatory to terrorism; indeed, my party has called for that for some time. We also welcome the powers to clamp down on those who take part in terrorist training, or who visit terrorist training camps. Also, within limits, we support powers to introduce a new offence of indirect incitement to terrorism. Although there are significant drafting problems, all of these, and a number of other detailed aspects of the Bill, are intelligent, proportionate and, arguably, long overdue. They are necessary, and they are necessary now. But there are serious issues with other parts, so we must all pause, draw breath and think through the implications very carefully indeed.

 I understand why we want to put up a united front with the Government today against terrorism. However, while going through the Bill, would my right hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 348</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>indirect incitement to terrorism is an offence that could be committed by negligence. We have to carry with us not just communities but, in due course, juries, and would not that offence be far better as an offence of specific intent rather than an offence of negligence?

 My hon. Friend is entirely right. Indeed, he picks up the point made by the shadow Attorney-General to the Home Secretary, which is that the definition of terrorism in the Bill, because it is based on the United Nations definition, is inadequate. There are common-sense elements to this which are self-evident: for example, that it is always wrong to blow up innocent civilians, and that it is always wrong to attack a democracy. So I do not believe that we are incapable of creating a set of definitions that will allow us to achieve what is intended in the Bill. That is what we will set out to do in Committee on the Floor of the House, in which everyone can take part, and on Report if we do not succeed.

<a name="stpa_123">I intend to make progress now. Poorly drafted counter-terrorism measures have many risks. They can be ineffective. They can fail to ensure successful prosecution of actual terrorists. They can trip over human rights legislation, or be used and abused for the wrong purpose. They can impinge on the rights and freedoms of innocent people in their attempt to deny those rights and freedoms to guilty people. As a result, they can easily create a sense of injustice which can act as a rallying call to each would-be terrorist in the country. Time and again we see counter-terrorism measures&#151;statutory and otherwise&#151;being used for the wrong things.

<p>
<a name="51026-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_127">Such examples highlight why we must look at new proposals with scepticism until the case is proven. Let us apply that test particularly to those that are the most controversial. The proposed new crime of glorification, which I have been asked about, is one. Today&#039;s proposal is better than that originally anticipated when the Prime Minister announced the clause back in August. As the Home Secretary said, he wrote to the Liberal Democrat spokesman and myself. I objected to various aspects of it, as did others, and he has changed it. The revised version has brought together the incitement and glorification clauses of the existing Bill, but the term &quot;glorification&quot; still remains too broad, and I am not convinced that it is necessary or desirable. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley), we clearly have to address a definition of foreign terrorism if we are going to pursue this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_128">The proposed law does not require that an individual intends to encourage terrorism in order to commit a crime. It rests on the requirement that someone&#039;s comments could &quot;reasonably be expected&quot; to incite terrorism. That is a test of negligence, not criminality. Of course, it also fails the Cherie test. The Prime Minister&#039;s wife famously talked sympathetically about the motives of suicide bombers, as the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) reminded us. Unless the Prime Minister is seriously suggesting that his wife should be locked up, the clause needs to be thought through again. If it cannot be improved in that and the other aspects that have been mentioned today, it must be removed.

<p><a name="st_192"><a name="51026-17_spnew5"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 My right hon. and learned Friend makes his point brilliantly, as always, and it is the question of intent that is key. We cannot have a serious criminal offence that can be committed by negligence rather than intent. When we discussed the matter with a variety of officials, it was suggested that it was difficult to prove intent.

That argument is answered by changing that rule in terrorist cases, which would be a much smaller infringement of our traditions of liberty and justice by comparison with the proposed 90-day extension, but it would achieve the same aim. The Prime Minister has said that he wants to give the police the powers that they need. But he should not simply give the police the powers they demand.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the reasons given at the time&#151;to be found in the <i>Official Report</i> for 20 May 2003 at columns 942&#150;3&#151;are similar to the reasons advanced for the increase from 14 to 90 days?

 That is a good point. One issue that needs to be resolved is that of resources. We have heard about problems with resources for interpretation and reading computer disks.

<p><a name="st_196"><a name="51026-17_spnew9"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 That is one of many measures that would make the 90-day proposal unnecessary, and I shall return to that point shortly.

 Will the right hon. Gentleman give us his view on those cases in which it would not be possible to look at all the evidence within 14 days?

 I am not especially fond of control orders, as the hon. Gentleman knows from previous debates, but there are several methods of dealing with the problem. One is greater surveillance before arrest. Another is refusing bail, after an early charge, if the individual is a threat to the state or the citizens of this country. We must not confuse an arrest with a view to conviction with an arrest to prevent terrorist action, which is what appears to be under consideration. We must be clear that from what we have seen so far, the 90-day proposal is not necessary.

I suspect that that is why he ran away today. We should add the words &quot;not withstanding the Human Rights Act 1998&quot; to the provision, so that we do not get into a legal quagmire.

<p><a name="st_202"><a name="51026-18_spnew3"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend&#151;<i>[Interruption]&#151;</i>except that I do not agree with him about supporting this case. There are real problems with the extension beyond 14 days, such as the oppression of the individual. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), the shadow Attorney-General made the point that, given the ECHR and the Human Rights Act 1998, we would have to change the PACE rules to ensure that people were not oppressed. A whole series of problems would arise from such an extension, and it would probably end up being counter-productive in terms of producing evidence in court.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_138">Such an extension would be particularly exorbitant given that Australia, which has faced every bit as much of a terrorist challenge as we have, has just had a heated debate about increasing the time from 48 hours to 14 days. Our Government are looking for more than six times that amount, but Australia is not even considering a 90-day proposal. Given everything that I have read and heard, I can say with absolute certainty the case has not been made. It remains a fundamental sticking point between the Government and the Opposition. It is a provision that we wish to see excised from the Bill and replaced with other measures before the Bill is signed into law. As I have told the Home Secretary already, although I am happy to support the Bill on Second Reading, if those significant matters are not corrected, I will recommend that my party does not support the Bill on Third Reading.

<a name="stpa_139">Finally, we must turn our minds to what is not included in the Bill. As the Home Secretary will know, we have long campaigned for intercept evidence to be used in courts.

It would be an effective force that could bring together the work of the seven different Government agencies that are currently responsible for the task. Once again, Sir Ian Blair has said:

 It has been a fascinating hour and a half. Obviously, the thrust of the debate in Committee will be about the 90-day question, but it seems much more significant&#151;the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), the shadow Home Secretary touched on this in the final part of his speech&#151;that we in the House must always balance the first duty of any Government to protect their citizens from outrage, death and disaster and the duty to ensure that we safeguard those liberties that, over a 1,000 years, the House has gathered for our people. However, we must be aware that we are in a situation that is not the same as in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_146">Some hon. Members have referred to a casual Bill, while others have said that it is a knee-jerk reaction to what happened in July, but the reality is that we live in an extremely different world, so far as terrorism is concerned. My experience, which is limited in these matters to Northern Ireland, tells me that the sort of attacks that we saw in July are unprecedented in our history. Although the July bombings came out of the blue in a particular sense, in a general sense, they did not. We had been warned by the security services for many months&#151;indeed, years&#151;that it was inevitable that, sooner or later, we would face the situation that we faced in July.
</p>

<a name="51026-18_para9">

<br>&nbsp;<br>continue to do so in the months to come. The important thing is always that balance, which was not easy over 30 years in Northern Ireland. I suspect that internment did not prove successful, but certain parts of the terrorism legislation, certainly the gathering of intelligence, was extremely successful and helped to bring Northern Ireland to where it is today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_148">The Intelligence and Security Committee has already taken evidence on the Bill over two hours or more from the Home Secretary and it will continue to monitor the Bill&#039;s progress through both Houses. On those clauses that deal with amendments to the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which relate to the issuing of warrants in the pursuit of national security, I agree strongly with Lord Carlile, whose views my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has touched on already, that the clauses on the intelligence services are helpful in countering terrorism and that, subject to appropriate controls and limitations, they are sensible and practical changes to the law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_149">We will as a Committee consider in some detail the deliberations of both Houses during the weeks ahead, but I repeat the point that I made earlier, which must underpin our debates in the House on Second Reading and in Committee, that if anyone thinks that what we have seen over the past weeks and months is something that we have experienced before, they are very much mistaken, and we must adapt new legislation to new circumstances. At the same time, of course, as a number of hon. Members have said, it is not just a question of changing the legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_150">As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary suggested and as I am sure my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety will indicate when she responds to the debate, we must consider the Bill in the context of a whole range of measures that exist to protect our citizens from the sort of outrages that we experienced in the summer in London. For example, we need to recruit more people to our police and our security services. We need to combat the so-called radicalisation of some of our communities. Religious leaders and Governments need to work together very closely. Police forces need special branches that can cope with the fresh challenges posed by 21st-century terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_151">It is worthwhile, too, to put on record that the way in which the agencies and the emergency services reacted in July has been praised right across the world, as has the way in which we responded to that outrage in our capital city. All these issues must be taken in the round, as a whole. For example, on the restructuring of the police, there is no question in my mind about the fact that we need police forces that can deal with the intelligence requirements and the need to counter terrorism in the modern world. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has rightly decided to look at those issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-18_para14">
<a name="stpa_152">I want to digress, but on an important point. In Wales, the situation is slightly different from the rest of England as regards the police, and an all-Wales police force, accountable to the Home Secretary but working closely with the National Assembly, would be sensible. However, long-standing, effective and successful forces, such as Gwent, should be able to continue in some form within the new structures so that accountability, efficiency and community support are retained.

 Like other Members, I start by referring to the events that took place in London during the summer and in doing so pay two tributes. The first is to the intelligence and police forces that handled that three or four-week period with great integrity and received much public support for their management of the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_154">Secondly, I pay tribute to the Home Secretary who dealt with those difficult circumstances with great calm, not only at the time of the attack that killed so many people but also a few weeks later when the failed attacks took place in London. I also welcomed the fact that, although he was busy and focused, he was courteous enough to include his opposite numbers in the discussions and to keep the Opposition parties briefed. That was an appropriate response and I am very grateful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_155">The Liberal Democrats have always acknowledged, even during those long hours in January when we were debating the control orders, that there is a real threat to this country from terrorism. Our cross-party differences have been not about whether there is a threat to London and other cities but about the appropriate response to that threat. We remain convinced that the issues are serious and we do not in any way underestimate the need for a proportionate response. We accept that there is a terrorist threat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_156">The issue has always been about the level and balance of the response to the threat. I have thought long and hard about our party&#039;s approach to the Bill. Any responsible politician wants to introduce measures that will make the country safer and it would be irresponsible not to look at measures that could make all of us safer as we walk through the streets of our cities. I was very taken with the Prime Minister&#039;s remarks, at press conference after press conference, about civil liberty and the principle of freedom that we should be able to walk freely without fear of attack. Of course we support that. However, as politicians we also need to argue for other freedoms and civil liberties and for the important principle that we do not hand the terrorists a backhanded victory by doing away with our strong principles of justice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_157">When the bombings took place in London, people said time and again that they did not want the bombings to change their way of life. From that, I drew the conclusion that they wanted sensible measures to make their lives safer but that were not so draconian as to change the way that they lived their everyday life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_158">It was right that the three parties came together during the summer to try to achieve consensus. At that point, the public wanted their politicians not to disagree, but to work together and try to find a way forward. We made much progress in agreeing and signing up to three measures that are in the Bill and still have our support. However, during September, problems emerged, as the Home Secretary said, when the Government decided to go further than the three measures to which we had agreed.

<p>
<a name="51026-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_159">Our party felt that a wide, sweeping new offence of glorification was unacceptable, too hard to tie down in law and would infringe freedom of speech. We also felt that the principle of holding people for three months without charge was a step too far. It was at that point that the consensus began to fall apart. I welcome the fact that the Home Secretary has thought again about the provisions on glorification. The removal of the former clause 2 is extremely welcome, but will he go one step further and address the use of glorification in clause 21? It seems to be very much used as it was in its previous incarnation&#151;as one of the grounds for banning organisations. If there could be the same movement on the use of that word as occurred in clause 2, I should certainly welcome it. In substance, we support a large amount of the legislation. We are left with one significant objection about which I shall speak later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_160">I reiterate the point I made in my intervention. I understand the Home Secretary&#039;s irritation at our decision not to support the Bill this evening. I repeat that we are determined to try to get consensus back on track in Committee. We want to persuade the Home Secretary and the Government that there are alternatives to holding suspects for three months. However, he needs to understand the strength of feeling about the issue in my party and why we felt that rather than waiting to show our objections on Third Reading&#151;if those provisions remain unchanged&#151;we had to send the Government the strongest possible signal that, if things stay the same and the clause remains in the Bill, we could not support it. That is why we felt that it was right to make that stand tonight. However, our commitment to try to resolve the issue and our commitment as a party to support a changed and modified Bill on Third Reading remain.

<p><a name="st_207"><a name="51026-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 May I support the hon. Gentleman in what he has just said? If one cannot support the core measures of a Bill, one must oppose it, even though it will be considered in detail in Committee.

 I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for that intervention. The decision was difficult because there is much in the Bill that I support and much of it has been subject to talks. At the end of the day, however, I took a judgment and my colleagues agreed&#151;we debated it at the party conference&#151;and we felt that we could not support a Bill that included such a provision. I would have found it extremely hard to abstain or to support something that included a provision with which I fundamentally disagreed. The honest thing to do in those circumstances is to take the position that we have taken. I regret only that it could be interpreted as our wanting to wreck the consensus. We do not want to do so.

 In Committee, we shall want to look at the whole question of intent and when I talk about the indirect incitement provisions I want to look at how both intent and likelihood are built in, so I shall address those points when I get to that section of my speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_161">I want to deal with some of the measures that we support. First, we have long argued that acts preparatory to terrorism should be a criminal offence. We argued that when the Newton committee reported and when we were dealing with derogations from the European convention on human rights. We said that such an offence was a better way of getting suspects into court than holding them without charge. The provisions on acts preparatory have a clear level of intent built into them and that principle should run through the whole Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_162">Secondly, we very much support the creation of a new offence of training for terrorism although I want to flag up one concern. The Bill also includes an offence of attending a place used for terrorist training. It would be nonsense if, for example, journalists who attended a place of training as part of their investigative work fell foul of such an offence. We need to tidy that up in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_163">Thirdly, and more problematically, we support the idea of creating an offence of indirect incitement to terrorism. We support it because there will be occasions when people with some influence will be able to use either written or spoken language with the clear intention of encouraging others to commit a terrorist attack. That should be an offence in this country. The problem is that the clause, and the criminality of the statement, depend on the interpretation of a third party, not the statements themselves or the intentions of a publisher. It depends very much not on what somebody says but on how other people react to what they say. We have concerns about the provision, but we broadly support it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_164">It would be extremely helpful if some safeguards could be included. At present, the offence is modelled on the proposal of the Council of Europe convention on the prevention of terrorism, which was signed earlier this year. Under that convention, there are two key safeguards: first, incitement must be intentional and, secondly, there must be the likelihood of a terrorist attack as a result. As we explore the matter in the next couple of weeks, it would be helpful if we could move back towards that model and build into the Bill those sensible twin safeguards that are already enshrined in the European convention on the prevention of terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_165">As I said, those matters have our broad support, but before I address our key difficulty with the Bill, I want to touch on the definition of terrorism itself. We have debated the way in which we define terrorism and it is my general view that the current definition is too wide. The Home Secretary helpfully wrote a note to the shadow Home Secretary and me yesterday in which he outlined his arguments for why&#151;bluntly&#151;he thinks that that definition is probably the best one in town and we should thus probably try to stick with it. He said that the definition was very close to that drawn up by the EU in 2002, but I am worried that there is an important difference between the Home Secretary&#039;s definition and that of the EU.

<a name="stpa_168">I turn to our major concern, which the shadow Home Secretary outlined in detail: the provisions of clause 23. Why is the question of holding suspects for such a long time a key principle for this party? Article 40 of Magna Carta says:

 Is the hon. Gentleman saying that 14 days is the limit, and that any period of detention without charge that was greater than 14 days&#151;forget 90 days&#151;would be unacceptable to him and his colleagues?
</p>





<p><a name="st_212"><a name="51026-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Oaten: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to give him a direct answer. We do not believe that there is a case for moving beyond 14 days. When we discuss how we move forward on the matter, we should not have some kind of auction for 90, 60 or 28 days. We wish to persuade the Government that there are alternative approaches that suggest that we do not need to go beyond 14 days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_171">We have been cautious about the number of days for which a person may be held for decades. The police have the automatic power to hold individuals for 48 hours, with a possible time extension of up to four days for serious cases such as murder. A complex murder case is allowed a time extension from 48 hours to just four days. Of course, provisions passed in 2003 extended the time limit for terrorism cases from seven to 14 days. We have rightly trodden carefully when changing the time limits. The history of the changes shows that we have been cautious, which is why it is remarkable that it is suggested that we could suddenly smash that approach apart under the Bill and move to a 90-day period.

 I am struggling with the question of 90 days myself, but several hon. Members&#039; criticism of the Home Secretary has been unnecessarily harsh. I think that he has made a compelling case that more time is needed, especially 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 360</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>when we consider the collection of video tape evidence. What alternative is the hon. Gentleman offering us to deal with the situation?
</p>





<p><a name="st_214"><a name="51026-20_spnew3"><b> Mr. Oaten: </b> 
 I am just coming to that part of my speech. Let me acknowledge that I think that the police have made a case. I shall go through the police&#039;s arguments one by one and outline how we could find an alternative measure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_172">The police&#039;s arguments were neatly set out by Andy Hayman, the deputy commissioner, in a letter to the Home Secretary that he made public. In essence, it listed eight compelling reasons why we should move towards a time period of 90 days. Some of the problems could be easily overcome, while several points have merit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_173">One argument was that suspects needed to be allowed time for religious observance. It is frankly ridiculous to suggest that a person praying five times a day will hold up an inquiry to a great extent. Two of the five prayers take place before sleeping and after waking, when no questioning would take place anyway. This country&#039;s questioning system already allows a suspect a 15-minute break every two hours, plus an additional 45-minute break. Surely there is adequate time in the current system to allow for such observance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_174">The police&#039;s second argument related to interpreters. I understand the Home Secretary&#039;s point that it might be difficult to track down interpreters for such cases, but surely there are other ways to solve the problem, such as training and finding new interpreters and using interpreters who are already involved in the immigration process. Is the problem with interpreters so real that we should be prepared to break such a strong principle? Surely the answer is no.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_175">A further argument in the police&#039;s list of eight was that there could be problems with clarifying a person&#039;s identity, but, believe it or not, one does not need a person&#039;s correct name before charging them. Indeed, it is an offence for people to withhold their names anyway, so that issue can be overcome.

</p>





<p><a name="st_217"><a name="51026-20_spnew6"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that we are dealing not with ordinary questions of criminal jurisdiction, but terrorist activities that verge on being threats of war and could lead to public emergency, which is why the question of derogation arises? Does he also realise that there is a whole stack of case law on the matter, including the Lawless case in Eire in 1961, when an even longer time period than that contemplated was upheld?
</p>





<p><a name="st_218"><a name="51026-20_spnew7"><b> Mr. Oaten: </b> 
 I now wish that I had adopted the Home Secretary&#039;s approach on taking interventions from the hon. Gentleman, but I might be able to cover that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_176">I now turn to the four matters on which I have made it clear that the police have a genuine case. The police are justified in saying that it would be difficult to deal with forensic evidence, encryption, mobile phone records and the international data trail in a 14-day period. However, we think that there are other ways in which those difficulties could be overcome.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 361</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_177">The first way is that raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) during an intervention. The Bill creates the kind of offences that could be used as a tool to charge individuals within a 14-day period. I was grateful for the Home Secretary&#039;s acknowledgment today and during his appearance before the Home Affairs Committee that he wants to consider that matter. I acknowledge that there are two problems with moving towards that position. First, such lower charges could have a bail attached. Secondly, it is currently difficult to interview someone after they have been charged. However, both those problems can be overcome. As the shadow Home Secretary said, there must be a way in which we can deal with those difficulties by, for example, changing guidelines under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to see whether or not lower offences should have bail attached. Making such changes, as the right hon. Gentleman said, is a lesser change than those that have been proposed. I believe that the Attorney-General is looking at these issues and, if we can speed up that review, it will be tremendously helpful in finding a way forward. If the Home Secretary suggested that changes were made to allow individuals to be charged with lower offences it could be argued that some individuals would not fall into that category, as they could not be charged with a lower offence. I find that argument questionable. If the police decide to arrest someone, they must have grounds and evidence for doing so. I find it hard to believe that there are circumstances in which such evidence could not be used to charge someone with an offence.
</p>





<p><a name="st_219"><a name="51026-20_spnew8"><b> Mr. Llwyd: </b> 
 May I commend to the hon. Gentleman the use of section 47(3) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which, coupled with stringent conditions such as tagging, curfew and reporting requirements, is a way of meeting his concerns?
</p>





<p><a name="st_220"><a name="51026-20_spnew9"><b> Mr. Oaten: </b> 
 I do not believe that that would be necessary, and I am outlining circumstances in which it could be avoided. However, there may be narrow circumstances where that proposal is relevant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_178">There will be few occasions on which individuals cannot be charged with a lower offence. If the police had arrested someone but could not employ the evidence that they had used for arrest to charge them with an offence, a change in the Government&#039;s policy on intercept communication would be key. I accept that there is a narrow category where information from intercepts could not be used to create lower-order offences, which is why the Government should move to allow intercepts to be admissible. That would allow us to deal with the problem.
</p>





<p><a name="st_221"><a name="51026-20_spnew10"><b> Emily Thornberry: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is floundering, so perhaps I may be of assistance. The police can arrest someone if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they have committed an offence. That does not have to be based on admissible evidence. If someone was held for two months at Paddington Green police station and, in his 15th interview, named a particular individual, the police could arrest that individual because they had 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 362</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reasonable grounds to suspect that he had committed an offence. However, that would not be evidence admissible in court. I hope that that makes it clear.

<p><a name="st_222"><a name="51026-20_spnew11"><b> Mr. Oaten: </b> 
 I think that I am grateful for that intervention, but I am not sure that it makes the position clear. I have argued that alternative offences could be used and that, with the use of intercepts, other individuals could fall into that category
</p>





<p><a name="st_223"><a name="51026-20_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 Should not the hon. Gentleman stress the fact that the essential vice is allowing the police to question people who have been in custody for weeks if not two months or more? Such confessions are inherently unsound.
</p>





<p><a name="st_224"><a name="51026-20_spnew13"><b> Mr. Oaten: </b> 
 The right hon. and learned Gentleman makes a valid point, but I am arguing that someone could be charged with a lower offence or one of the new offences that we are creating. If such a charge is brought within 14 days, I support the police having the opportunity to continue questioning that individual. I do not completely agree with him, because doing so would be intellectually wrong. We are arguing that, having brought that initial charge, the police can continue to charge and work to achieve a higher offence at a later date.

<a name="51026-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_179">I wish to suggest another way forward to the Home Secretary. Even if the alternatives do not fit the profile of the individual whom the police want to hold and arrest, the right hon. Gentleman has the power of control orders, which we debated at length at the beginning of the year. While I find the way in which control orders are put in place problematic, I accept that there will be rare occasions when it is difficult to charge someone, and control orders are then a useful tool. If all the alternatives are tried, but none of the lower offences works, the use of control orders would be a better way to tackle the problem than holding individuals without charge for a long period. Those control orders, however, would be different, as the clear intention is to move towards a point where a charge could be brought. They would not be open-ended orders without any prospect of charge.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_180">In conclusion, it is clear that there is potential to find a way forward on differences that have emerged over the 90-day issue.

<p><a name="st_229"><a name="51026-21_spnew4"><b> Tony Lloyd  (Manchester, Central) (Lab):</b> 
 The Home Secretary is right to remind us of the grave threats that our society faces from terrorism. Every Member of the House would be at one with him on that. However, the House has a duty to find a balance between measures that are necessary in an era of new technical challenges and new types of terrorism, and safeguards for the traditional values of our society and the legitimate rights of those who stand accused of certain offences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_181">I was interested in various sub-debates that have taken place this afternoon. I distinctly remember, as some of our Northern Ireland colleagues may also recall, that at the time of the introduction of internment and detention without trial in Northern Ireland, one of the almost certain effects of that was to radicalise, and not in an acceptable way, a generation of those on the then republican side of the political divide. I speak from near-personal experience. It was a profound mistake on the part of the Labour Government of the day, who introduced those measures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_182">I say that not because the debate today is about the introduction of the same principles of detention or internment, but because we must measure the impact of the Bill not only in terms of the legitimate enhancement of the security of society, and not even in terms of its impact on those who come within the power of the legislation, but in terms of its wider social impact if it is deemed not to be appropriate or proportionate to the challenge that we face. That is the problem that I see with at least two aspects of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_183">The first relates to the better rehearsed arguments about the 90-day period of detention. Like many hon. Members, I feel extremely uncomfortable that the case has not been properly made that that length of time is necessary. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) is being over-cynical when he says that the measure is a police bargaining chip, but we need a much more robust defence of their need for anything like that increase in the period of detention or for any increase at all, before the House accepts that they should be the arbiters as we, the House of Commons, seek to erode the freedom of our fellow citizens. That case has not been made today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_184">As my hon. Friend observed, under existing legislation only two people have been held for 13 days, not the full 14 days. Both were charged at the end of that period. Although it is not possible to argue by extension that the period must be absolute and precise, that is at least an indication that so far the police have not found the present arrangements inappropriate for the type of activities with which they have had to deal. Things can change, but the case must still be better made.
</p>





<p><a name="st_230"><a name="51026-21_spnew5"><b> Mr. Khan: </b> 
 In support of that argument, does my hon. Friend agree that there have been 10 occasions where somebody has been detained for more than seven days but less than 14 days and released without charge, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 364</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in none of those 10 cases was the individual re-arrested at a later date when the police or the authorities had deciphered any encrypted computer data or any other data that had come to their attention? That supports the argument that there is no evidence for extending from 14 days to 90 days the period in custody without charge.
</p>





<p><a name="st_231"><a name="51026-21_spnew6"><b> Tony Lloyd: </b> 
 My hon. Friend helps me in the case that I am presenting. We need an intelligent debate and we need to consider whether the present structures are appropriate. The case has not been made for the legitimacy of the leap from 14 to 90-day detention in terms of the need for the police to interrogate suspects and obtain evidence. Therefore, I, like many hon. Members, share the concerns, and I hope that we will see a robust debate in Committee and during further proceedings on the Bill as we examine where the proper balance and test should come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_185">The question of glorification troubles me every bit as much as the 90-day period. It is easy to dismiss this by asking, &quot;Are we not all against those who advocate the killing and maiming of others?&quot; But I want to remind the House that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) said earlier, many of us have lived through periods in our political lives when we have not simply sought to explain but actively advocated the concept of armed force as a legitimate defence. I met someone in Guatemala many years ago who told me how, under the military Government at the time, he saw his father taken off a bus and told to hold his hands out, whereupon they were systematically macheted off, salami style, by members of the armed forces. That was a particularly brutal crime, and at the time it was a particularly brutal way of persuading me that it was legitimate to defend the ordinary peasants of Guatemala by recourse to the force of arms. I cannot run away from that view these years later simply because that country is now, happily, at peace. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) referred to the situation in Burma today, a situation that ironically and tragically is parallel to that in Guatemala.

We may say that we deplore the words of the most crazed exponents of violence, but what do we achieve as a society if we stop treating those individuals as objects of scorn and social condemnation and instead put them in prison cells, thereby making them martyrs? Experience from many different situations around the world shows that the way to radicalise young people or the population generally is by creating a sense of injustice through the arbitrary, or seemingly arbitrary, imposition of such imprisonment on those whose offence may be an inappropriate use of words.

<a name="stpa_193">This is a Bill that the House would do well to scrutinise with considerable rigour: first, because it was born out of crime and tragedy&#151;the recent events in July&#151;and Bills that are enacted so soon after such events are frequently seriously flawed; and secondly, because it follows a raft of legislation that we have passed since 2000, in the shape of three substantial Acts. If these matters are so important, it is difficult to see why they were not included in that legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_194">I am willing to concede that there are parts of the Bill that most Members would support, myself included&#151;particularly clauses 5 and 6, which deal with ancillary acts, and those clauses that deal with radioactive material. However, they are not the core of the Bill. One has to go to the core to determine whether to support the measure. When I go to its core, I find myself unable to vote for it. Indeed, I shall vote against it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_195">Let me begin with clause 23, which enables a person who is not charged with an offence to be held in custody for up to 90 days. That is deeply offensive and, while it remains in the Bill, the measure should be opposed. There are several reasons why the provision is deeply offensive and I shall enumerate them briefly. First, it amounts to administrative detention, which we deplored when it was done in South Africa under the apartheid regime. We deeply criticise the state of Israel when it does that today. Secondly, it contravenes a basic 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 367</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>rule of English law that a person should not be held in custody for extended periods unless convicted of or charged with a serious offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_196">There are two further points of a more technical nature. First, it is inevitable that the provision will bear most harshly on the ethnic and religious minorities in this country. They will say, with some force, that they are being treated in a discriminatory manner. That will increase the sense of alienation that one often finds in those communities. Secondly, I raise a point that I have previously put to the Home Secretary and to the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten). What weight can one properly place on confessions when they are made after an extended period in custody? To put the same point in reverse: what weight can one place on accusations by detained persons of third parties when they have been detained for extended periods? The 90-day provision opens up the prospect of serious injustice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_197">Let me deal briefly&#151;I know that others wish to speak&#151;with clauses 1 and 2. First, the common law offences of conspiracy and incitement already cover much of the ground in the provisions. Secondly, the right of free speech should be safeguarded and fought for, even if it involves hearing things that one might find deeply offensive. For example, when Gerry Adams speaks of the &quot;glorious volunteers&quot; of the IRA, I am deeply offended. After all, the IRA murdered thousands of our fellow citizens, including four Members of this House, who were friends and colleagues of many of us who are still in this place. We are deeply offended when Gerry Adams speaks in those terms. However, I do not wish his words to be criminalised. When the BBC was banned from broadcasting such words, Labour party spokesmen rightly denounced the Government.

<p>
<a name="51026-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_199">Let me deal with the detail of clause 1. I hope that I shall be forgiven if I paraphrase because its language is complicated. It provides that an offence is committed by a person if that person publishes a statement, knowing or believing that those who hear or read it are likely to treat it as an encouragement to commit an act of terrorism The Bill defines the sort of statement that falls into that category as including every statement that glorifies terrorism, whether in the past, the future or generally, and that might encourage others to emulate such conduct. The Bill does not provide for intent. The provision is far removed from an offence of incitement with intent.

Such acts of violence will often include actions that are undoubtedly acts of terrorism within the definition in the Terrorism Act 2000. Do we really want people to be made criminals if they urge an armed insurrection against the military regime in Burma? Are we really prepared to say that people who say that Mugabe&#039;s regime should be displaced by force are committing a criminal offence? Is that really what we are bringing this society to?

</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_209">May I start by praising the Home Secretary for his general approach to the legislation and willingness to make himself available to Members, and particularly for the many hours that he spent in front of Select Committees, including the Home Affairs Committee? The way that he has approached the issue gives me some confidence that a useful piece of legislation will be produced at the end of the process. I will certainly vote for the Bill tonight, although certain aspects of it need a rethink.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_210">It is important to get the Bill in perspective. The major changes needed to terrorist legislation have been made in previous Acts. Despite the dramatic claims that the rules have changed, this Bill is rather marginal to the issue of our security. The real battle against terrorism is not in the battle over legislation in the House but in the community and the country outside. It is in our policing, our intelligence, the development of community support, and crucially, in winning the hearts and minds of people at home and abroad.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_211">This is a long-term fight. Once terrorism is established, it takes years to get rid of. In my view, we will be extremely lucky if we are not facing attacks such as those that we have seen in London for the next 30 years. These are not, therefore, short-term, emergency measures. To all intents and purposes, they are permanent. The fight against terrorism does not lend itself to short-term initiatives. The public need to be reassured that things are being done, but they want to be safer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-23_para7">

<br>&nbsp;<br>question of how we win arguments. The key battle is for hearts and minds. We must persuade young British people from the Muslim community who feel angry about what is happening in the world, in Palestine, Kashmir and Chechnya, and who feel that in the west their Muslim lives are less valuable than others&#039; and their rights less valued than others&#039;, that engagement in politics, democracy, public life and argument is the way to achieve change, not terrorism.

We must be careful not to feed that argument. As the Bill stands, however, it is more helpful to the propaganda of the extremists than it is in winning hearts and minds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_214">The Bill is drawn too widely. Let us draw briefly on the Northern Ireland experience. We banned the IRA but we tolerated Sinn Fein, not, in my view, because we thought that they were entirely separate organisations, but because we believed that it was better to draw the supporters of militant republicanism into a political process of democracy than to leave them supporting purely violent action. Today, there are organisations in the world such as Hamas. I hold no brief for it, and we have proscribed it as a terrorist organisation. Many people in our society, however, who totally condemn the London bombings, would see Hamas in a different light, as a product of the situation in Palestine&#151;something understandable, and for a significant number of them, justifiable; not just a terrorist organisation but one that takes part in and wins elections.

 I certainly do not accept Hamas&#039;s strategy of terrorism, or its vision of the destruction of Israel. However, we make a mistake if we believe that organisations such as Hamas are indistinguishable from organisations such as al-Qaeda. One of the problems with the Bill is that it condemns such organisations and support for them in precisely the same terms as those in which it condemns support for the London bombings or 11 September. It allows for no distinction. It bans Hizb ut-Tahrir. It is designed to do that, as we know from the Prime Minister. The language of that organisation is undoubtedly extreme, and its aim of establishing a Muslim theocracy is equally extreme&#151;and is extreme in the eyes of most Muslims to whom I have ever spoken. I have not, however, seen evidence that it is actively involved in the promotion of terrorism.

They will say that it is not possible to advocate a Muslim state without being silenced, and that it is not possible to be part of a resistance movement anywhere in the world without being silenced. They will say that the terrorist route is the only way. That is the argument that will be advanced in streets and communities up and down the country, and what we must ask ourselves is whether the phrasing of clause 1 will help us to win the argument for democracy and engagement.

 Does the right hon.

In many ways, the history of decolonisation is the history of fighters being turned into statesmen and the supporters of fighters being turned into members of political parties. As we know, it did not always work, but we knew that it had to be done. We had to win the arguments of engagement, of alternative ways of doing things.

I would have no problem with a Bill that drew the line where it needs to be drawn: between what the Home Secretary described today as indiscriminate terrorism, or what could be described as nihilism, and the much wider and more complicated set of political movements that sometimes use violence in various circumstances. But it does not do that, and I am worried that it betrays a profound misunderstanding of the problem.

<a name="stpa_222">I am no international lawyer&#151;in fact, I am not a lawyer of any sort, for which I regularly give thanks&#151;but perhaps equally significant is UN Security Council resolution 1566, which clearly locates terrorism primarily in terms of action against civilians. It also refers to criminal acts in a way that, I suspect, excludes genuine liberation movements and genuine violence against oppression. We could also use wording such as the following:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;any action . . . that is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an international organisation to do or to abstain from doing any act.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-23_para19">
<a name="stpa_224">Although such a definition would certainly catch the indiscriminate terrorist attacks on civilians of organisations such as Hamas, it would none the less draw the line in the right place.

Killing civilians indiscriminately for political purposes is wrong, and that is where we need to set the argument.

Solicitation to murder is an offence under section 4 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and incitement to racial hatred is a crime under the Public Order Act 1986.

<a name="stpa_231">I have troubled the House with a lengthy excerpt, but I am trying to demonstrate that the Home Secretary has not answered the core of our fight&#151;a national fight, which affects our constituents&#151;and has not demonstrated why, given the present state of the law, clauses 1 and 2 are necessary.

<a name="51026-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_232">It is the wider implications that really worry me. Freedom of expression is perhaps the most important and basic right in a democracy. It did not come about casually, as we said last week in debating the Identity Cards Bill. It was a long march, and many of the acts that brought us to where we are&#151;the Home Secretary has defined democracy&#151;were products that would be caught by the legislation in any event. That is the truth of the matter. Those who burned rickshaws, if that was their march, would be caught by it, as I read the provisions. Is that really our intent&#151;to define our own democracy in those terms?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_233">In respect of the extension to the overseas provisions, the Home Secretary said that he had attended the ceremony&#151;in St. Paul&#039;s cathedral, no less&#151;marking the 60th anniversary of the UN. The UN has nearly 200 members, but would we call all of them democracies, even though they all subscribe to the universal declaration of human rights? The hypocrisy is writ large, and the Home Secretary offers an extraordinary historical analysis when he claims that the movement in the world at large is towards democracy. However, that process of edging towards democracy has often been ignited by something else.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_234">Mr. Mugabe, through his country&#039;s membership of the UN, subscribes to those universal principles. People in other benighted countries suffer under the heel of cruel and vicious Governments, but do we tell those who rise up against their privations that anything that improves their lot is passable? No: the Home Secretary says that there is an ineluctable movement towards world democracy, but that is simply neither true nor real. In the pursuit of the Home Secretary&#039;s dream, we are asked to degrade and undermine some of our basic principles of freedom and democracy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_235">It is the crafting of the Bill that worries so many of us. The principle behind extending detention to 90 days clearly nags at the consciences of many hon. Members. There has to be some form of compromise.

<a name="51026-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_236">I am grateful that the Government concede that the matter is important enough to be discussed on the Floor of the House. That allows all hon.

Nevertheless, I congratulate the Government on their approach today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_237">I think that the Bill will founder on the Government&#039;s flagship Human Rights Act 1998, that at some time it will be declared to be incompatible with that legislation, and that we will be back to where we started. There will come a time when the House has to determine whether an instrument of declaratory power is appropriate to the circumstances that we face. The Bill challenges our declaratory principles of freedom of expression and the proportionality of actions taken by the state to meet the exigencies that we face.

<p><a name="st_255"><a name="51026-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Michael Meacher  (Oldham, West and Royton) (Lab):</b> 
 It is always a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), and I agree with a great deal of what he said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_238">As expected, the Home Secretary offered a very robust defence of the Bill. No one doubts that it was the Government&#039;s duty, and his in particular, to take all appropriate steps to protect the population against terrorism, especially in the light of 7 July, but any Bill designed to achieve that purpose must be tested against several criteria.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_239">First&#151;and this question was rightly posed by the hon. Gentleman for Aldridge-Brownhills&#151;is the Bill a necessary addition to the existing corpus of law to prevent acts of terrorism in the UK? Last year, the Director of Public Prosecutions told the Joint Committee on Human Rights that there was
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">&quot;an enormous amount of legislation that can be used in the fight against terrorism.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_240">Indeed, the common law of incitement and the Terrorism Act 2000 already provide very considerable scope for prosecution. For example, the Bill&#039;s new offence of encouragement of terrorism has been justified on the grounds that it is intended to criminalise incitement to murder, yet acts of incitement to murder or terrorism are already punishable by life imprisonment. In fact, I suspect that any difficulty in bringing prosecutions at the present time is much more likely to arise from the self-imposed ban on admissibility of intercept evidence, which in my view should be lifted, than from the absence of a prosecutable offence. Therefore it is not clear that the Bill passes the first test.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_241">The second test is whether the Bill is drafted tightly enough to catch those against whom it is allegedly directed and not those who may unintentionally be trapped by loose drafting? It is certainly to be welcomed that, after considerable concern has been expressed, the original proposal about glorification of terrorism has now been dropped. But encouragement of terrorism is still drawn extremely broadly. In particular, as others have said, it allows acts to be criminalised without the need for intention by the person committing the offence. That is wrong and we must return to that next week.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-24_para16">
<a name="stpa_242">Moreover&#151;almost everyone has mentioned this&#151;the definition of terrorism under clause 1 is so wide that, contrary to what I think the Home Secretary was saying, it would criminalise calls to overthrow oppressive regimes where democratic means do not exist. In my reading of the definition, it would have caught those supporting the African National Congress and its methods in the fight against the apartheid regime. It would also have caught those calling for action involving, for example, violence against property, even if not violence against the person, against such regimes as North Korea, or Burma&#151;that has been mentioned&#151;or Ceausescu&#039;s regime in Romania, and would have criminalised those who called for action against the Nazi regime in Germany.

<p><a name="st_256"><a name="51026-25_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that it goes much further than that, because people who write about that in a historical sense are also caught?

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_257"><a name="51026-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Meacher: </b> 
 Yes; I take that point and I support what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has said on this. A definition that catches all those examples goes far too wide, and in my view the Bill does not pass that second test.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_243">A third key test is whether the Bill is drawn so loosely that it is likely to be used rather more indiscriminately in future years against persons who are not necessarily the ostensible targets? There is plenty of evidence historically that that has been the result of using wide definitions. The best example, of course, is the stop and search legislation. Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which has been mentioned, has been used against anti-war protesters and arms trade protesters as well as, most notoriously, the 82-year-old Walter Wolfgang.
</p>





<p><a name="st_258"><a name="51026-25_spnew2"><b> Ms Dawn Butler  (Brent, South) (Lab):</b> 
 On stop and search, does my right hon. Friend agree that there are serious concerns about the additional powers that have been offered to the Metropolitan police, and that they need additional training? We must ensure that they are given additional training because any abuse of those powers will cause a further deterioration in race relations in this country?
</p>





<p><a name="st_259"><a name="51026-25_spnew3"><b> Mr. Meacher: </b> 
 I very much agree with my hon. Friend, but I would go further. The existing drafting of the stop and search legislation has led to its being used in a massive number of instances, but hardly any have led to prosecution, and there is suspicion&#151;which may well be founded&#151;that the legislation is being used by the police for wider purposes. I do not think that the fault is police training; it is the laxity and looseness of the original definition in the legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_244">There are already suggestions that clause 10 might be used against animal rights protesters. Whatever one feels about that, whether one uses anti-terrorism measures against them or other protesters is another matter&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> This is arguable, but it is not being proposed that that is the purpose of the Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="st_260"><a name="51026-25_spnew4"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_261"><a name="51026-25_spnew5"><b> Mr. Meacher: </b> 
 I will give way for the last time.
</p>





<p><a name="st_262"><a name="51026-25_spnew6"><b> Mr. Shepherd: </b> 
 The Home Secretary confirmed on Monday in front of the Joint Committee on Human Rights that it could be used against animal rights protesters.
</p>





<p><a name="st_263"><a name="51026-25_spnew7"><b> Mr. Meacher: </b> 
 That only confirms my point. The Bill is intended to deal with the problem of acts of terrorism, such as those which the country faced on 7 July. For it to be used in this much wider way is not sanctified, and it is for us here in Parliament to make that clear. However, those who might be affected include not only animal rights protesters, but those protesting against a revival of civil nuclear power, the replacement of Trident or genetically modified crops. It is no answer to say that prosecution could be pursued only with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. We should oppose the provisions because such catch-all legislation undermines the legitimacy of our anti-terror efforts precisely when we need to build a consensus around them. We should also oppose the insidious 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 377</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>switch from defence of the state to defence of property&#151;or whatever the prevailing ideology of the Government of the time happens to be&#151;that is apparent in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_245">The fourth test is whether the Bill will undermine the rights and liberties of the free society that it is purportedly designed to protect. Everyone agrees that the balance between liberty and security is a difficult issue. By far the most contentious issue, as we have heard this afternoon, is the proposal that terrorist suspects should be detained for up to three months. That is more than 20 times the pre-charge detention limit for murder. It would allow the equivalent of a six-month custodial sentence without a charge being brought. Apart from the breach of the habeas corpus principles and article 5 of the convention on human rights&#151;I disagree with the Home Secretary on that point&#151;it is difficult to believe that the provision is really necessary. The Association of Chief Police Officers says that it is needed because of the potentially huge amount of material and the possible involvement of several jurisdictions, but the same argument applies to much white collar fraud, for which pre-trial detention is limited to only four days, or one twenty-fifth of the time proposed in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_246">An interesting Foreign and Commonwealth Office document, which has not been mentioned today, makes comparisons between the proposals in the Bill and existing practice in other countries. In almost every case, they have a much shorter pre-charge detention limit than that proposed. Most terrorist arrests will usually follow months of previous investigations, which would allow large amounts of evidence to be compiled. If, occasionally, that were not so&#151;if an event had happened that the police were not expecting&#151;a much better compromise would be for a suspect to be charged under existing legislation and further charges added later, if appropriate. If that requires changes to the PACE code, so be it. The 90-day provision is the most serious in the Bill and it must be addressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_247">A fifth test is whether the Bill will alienate those sections of the population whose support is vital to isolate and defeat the supporters of terrorism. In that context, any measures that cause Muslims to be treated unfairly&#151;or to perceive themselves as being treated unfairly&#151;would be counter-productive. Legislation that is too widely drawn, like this Bill, might well make Muslims who strongly condemn attacks very wary of contacting the police and volunteering crucial information. They might feel that their legitimate but critical views of middle east policy would make them vulnerable to prosecution. Equally, the banning of organisations that do not advocate terrorism, such as Hizb ut-Tahrir&#151;however objectionable their views are&#151;would drive them underground and make intelligence gathering more difficult. The Bill is not acceptable on that score either.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_248">My sixth and last point is somewhat wider, but essential. Does the policy behind the Bill take account of the wider underlying causes of terrorism and seek to redress them? That question goes a long way beyond a Home Office Bill, but it is a crucial component of our whole approach to terrorism. While in the short term we should certainly take all reasonable steps to protect our own security, we should never lose sight of the fact that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 378</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>one of the major roots of terrorism is the widespread perception of a fundamentally unjust and untenable political situation in the middle east.

<p><a name="st_265"><a name="51026-25_spnew8"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone) (Con):</b> 
 I fear that some of the discussion that we have heard this afternoon has perhaps gravitated rather more towards the experiences of those in the criminal law than towards the questions that lie at the heart of the Bill. This legislation is about terrorism, and I would make the case strongly that we verge closely in that context on the problems that exist in a state of war, as I indicated in an earlier intervention. During our discussions on the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 in March this year, there was a failure to appreciate that the most important thing was to achieve a balance&#151;security on one hand and liberty on the other. I am bound to say that I have more sympathy with the Government&#039;s position in respect of the Bill than do some of my right hon. and hon. Friends.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_249">The criteria applied under the Human Rights Act 1998 and, indeed, in respect of the European convention on human rights must be regarded as a question of proportionality in the context of the threat that exists to public order and public safety. Indeed, I took exception during the proceedings on the former Bill in March to the line that was then being taken by those who sit on the Conservative Front Bench with respect to the question of our complying with the obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998 in relation to control orders and terrorist suspects. I thought that profoundly wrong, and I continue to feel the same way about the application of the ECHR to the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_250">I would not want to give the slightest impression that I am in favour of taking away rights that I thought justifiable, as enacted by the House. Indeed, in a very short clause that I produced to the Bill in March, I said that nothing in any Act should stand in the way of
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;a writ of habeas corpus or other prerogative remedy and . . . a fair trial in accordance with due process and the rule of law.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_251">I believe profoundly that, whether or not a person is a terrorist or someone who incites hatred or whatever else, that person should in no way be denied the opportunity to benefit from habeas corpus, the rule of law and a fair trial. Indeed, I had an exchange with the Home Secretary during those previous proceedings, and he said that habeas corpus would apply. There was some serious doubt about that at the time, but the reality is that, in the context of the Bill, the Government have dug themselves into a substantial hole in trying to have their cake and eat it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_252">In my opinion, it is not possible for the Government to avoid tackling the problem of the application of the Human Rights Act 1998 to such legislation. Indeed, Lord Carlile made it clear in a well considered report that he thought that a period of up to three months was justifiable on the evidence that he heard. I hope that we hear more during our proceedings about what that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 379</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>evidence amounted to. Lord Carlile thought that the Government would have serious problems preventing the Law Lords from eventually ruling against provisions in the Bill on the grounds of the Human Rights Act. We have seen that after enormous amounts of time and delay, Belmarsh and other cases were taken to the courts and the Government&#039;s declarations of compatibility with the Act were struck down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_253">The remedy is simple. If the Government want to legislate for a specific purpose, based on evidence they provide, and if they can make a case on the Floor of the House and in Committee to justify extension of the period to three months or a bit less&#151;whatever emerges from the debates&#151;they should seize the nettle and, as I suggested earlier, include the provision:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;notwithstanding the Human Rights Act 1998&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_254">I do not need to take the House through the case law, save to say that Lord Hoffmann made it perfectly clear in a case a few years ago, as did the Lord Chancellor when the Human Rights Act was going through the House, that the 1998 Act can be amended by unambiguous subsequent legislation passed in the House. Just as it is the first priority of the Government to ensure the protection and security of the nation, so it is the first principle of the House to make up its mind about the legislation it wants to ensure that protection. That may bring us into dispute with some members of the judiciary, but it would not be for the first time over the many centuries that the House has existed. I profoundly believe that we must legislate according to the proper requirements of protection of the nation and that that should be decided in Parliament and not in the courts. That is the first and fundamental principle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_255">Secondly, I want to refer to the report of the Gardiner Committee in 1975, when similar problems emerged with regard to the protection of the nation from IRA terrorism. The report stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">&quot;Some of those who have given evidence to us have argued that such features of the present emergency provisions as the use of the Army in aid of the civil power, detention without trial, arrest on suspicion and trial without jury are so inherently objectionable that they must be abolished on the grounds that they constitute a basic violation of human rights.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_256">I remind Labour Members that that was a Labour Lord Chancellor in a Labour Government. The report continued:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;We are unable to accept this argument . . . The suspension of normal safeguards for the liberty of a subject may sometimes be essential, in a society faced by terrorism, to counter greater evils.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_257">As I made clear earlier, it is essential that if the period of time is to be extended beyond 14 days, there should be no possibility of not holding a serious review by a senior judge of the circumstances in which the person is being held. It cannot be left to district, or even circuit, judges. The cases would be few and far between, so fair process&#151;fair trial and habeas corpus&#151;must be reinforced as the most fundamental principle on which we rely. However, that does not mean that terrorists or suspected terrorists should be given a more privileged position than they deserve.

<a name="stpa_259">I intend to direct my remarks solely to the proposals for 90-day detention. I say at the outset that I realise that, with the arrival of the suicide bomber in the United Kingdom, we face a wholly new form of terrorism. I accept that we have an obligation to provide the police and security services with the tools that they need to deal with that, and I acknowledge that a difficult balance must be struck between the protection of the suspect and the liberties of the subject. I accept all those things, but do not believe that a case has been made for detaining suspects for up to 90 days. What is more, the provision will lead to unintended consequences that could store up a lot of difficulties for when the Bill is implemented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_260">As I said when I intervened on the Home Secretary, it is unfortunate that the Government have uncritically endorsed what I still believe to be the police&#039;s first throw of the dice. The police did not think for a moment that they would get 90-day detentions. The request was their opening shot in what they perhaps thought would be a process of negotiation, so they would have been as amazed as most hon. Members who have spoken that the proposal was uncritically endorsed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_261">I oppose the 90-day detention because there is a danger that the power will be abused, whatever safeguards we try to put in place. The overwhelming majority of terrorist suspects are released without charge. Of the 895 people arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 up to 30 September 2005, only 23 were charged&#151;not convicted, but charged&#151;with any form of terrorist offence. Some 300 others were charged with other offences, some of which were quite minor, and 496 were released without any charge at all. Under the Bill, it would have been possible to hold those 496 people for up to 90 days instead of up to 14 days, as can be done at the moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_262">With the best will in the world, the police will be tempted to string out the process. If they do not have to work their way through a big pile of documentation and other evidence quickly, they might wait 30 or 40 days before even getting round to starting to do that. I am not suggesting that that would always happen, but it is a reasonable supposition that it will begin to happen in some cases over time.

The points about the need to study computers and technology were made almost word for word. I accept that other considerations have emerged since then and that there might be a case for extending the limit, but not to 90 days, for goodness&#039; sake.

<a name="51026-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_265">Some Members have said that Lord Carlile endorses the proposal. I accept that he does so in his report, but not with any great enthusiasm. He does not endorse all the proposals in Assistant Commissioner Hayman&#039;s letter, and dismisses some of them explicitly:

 Indeed. That brings me to the point made by the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg). Courts may find it difficult to convict on the basis of admissions or accusations that emerge after 20, 30, 40 or 50 days in custody. That may be an unintended consequence of the measure and may lead to some people walking free who should not do so. I take no comfort in the safeguard that a district judge should approve detention at regular intervals. I have a little experience in this area and, in the past, many members of the judiciary, both senior and junior, have proved remarkably gullible in believing whatever nonsense was put before them by the Crown and, in some cases, by the police. The words &quot;national security&quot; have only to be breathed for some district judges, magistrates and even High Court judges to roll over and have their tummies tickled. With the best will in the world, it is difficult for a judge, however senior, to turn down a request from a Crown prosecutor who tells him that the detention order is essential and that the world could be blown up tomorrow unless he renews it.

The Home Secretary will concede that it must be a High Court judge at least. Indeed, that must be one of the concessions in my right hon.

<a name="stpa_267">Some say that we should place our trust in experts, and that the experts who track down terrorists have a complex job, so we should listen to whatever advice they give us. I certainly listen with respect to anyone who has that difficult job, whether they are in the police or the security services, but I do not endorse blindly or automatically whatever they say, because in years gone by experts have been known to be spectacularly wrong in terrorism cases and other matters. In the mid 1970s&#151;the situation then has a bearing on today&#039;s situation &#151;they caught the wrong people for all the main terrorist bombings. A total of 18 people were wrongly arrested. Some of those experts and High Court judges still argue in private that all the people who were captured in the &#039;70s were guilty. They are still in self-denial and labour under a massive illusion. My message is therefore, &quot;Put not thy faith entirely in experts.&quot;

Was it not instructive that we subsequently learned that, the day after the shooting, the Metropolitan Commissioner had quietly written to the Home Secretary and asked that there be no independent inquiry into the shooting? The Home Secretary rightly rebuffed him. Indeed, the law requires that there be such an inquiry.

 Many of us are nervous about the Bill because we have seen how the 2000 Act has been operating out in the field, so to speak. A cricketer on his way to a match was stopped at King&#039;s Cross and questioned under section 44 of that Act about his possession of a cricket bat. Police thought he might be travelling to Scotland to cause trouble at the G8 summit.

<p>
<a name="51026-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_274">I speak on behalf of Plaid Cymru and also the Scottish National party. On clause 1, which deals with the encouragement of terrorism, we are concerned about the way in which the clause has been drafted. The requirement that the accused knew or believed or had reasonable grounds for believing that other members of the public were likely to understand it as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to commit terrorist acts looks fairly reasonable, but it is not good enough. Without a more specific definition, the offence is likely to have unintended consequences, one of which, I can readily see, is the inhibition of free speech. Furthermore, it is unacceptable to create such a wide offence that will require reliance on the discretion of the prosecution as to its appropriate use.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_275">We have heard about the Cherie Blair and Jenny Tonge test. I will not go over that again, but suffice it to say that many worthy causes&#151;and, I regret to say, many hon. Members&#151;will be outlawed if the Bill goes through in its current state. The law must be accessible, and those affected by it must know exactly what it prohibits. That must be formulated with clarity, so that those affected understand it and regulate their conduct according to the law.
</p>





<p><a name="st_276"><a name="51026-27_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman find it difficult to explain what the law would mean in this case, because not only would the speaker not have to have an intent to cause this, he would have to be telepathic in order to discover what someone might think if he spoke in that way? Many of us find that our speeches are not entirely understood, however clear we try to make them, but this makes speechifying almost impossible when we are dealing with circumstances as terrible as, for example, the fate of the Palestinians, the way in which they have been treated, and the way in which so many countries now suffer under the heel of dictators. I find it very difficult to know how one would measure one&#039;s words in this way.

<p><a name="st_277"><a name="51026-27_spnew2"><b> Mr. Llwyd: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is spot on, and I know he gains support from throughout the House for what he has just said.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_276">The dangers of allowing clause 1 to continue unamended stem from its broadness and vagueness of definition, the lack of any intent, as the right hon. Gentleman said and the lack of any sense of the certainty essential to a fair and credible criminal justice system. People will be unaware of the consequences of their actions, as he said and have no control over how their words or publications might be interpreted even. We are on very dangerous ground at the moment. Liberty, for example, believes that this offence is totally unnecessary anyway, because there is sufficient criminal law allowing prosecution of those who incite terrorism, a point that the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) made well earlier. If there is to be any new offence&#151;I do not believe that there should be one&#151;it must have at its core the element of intent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_277">Furthermore, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman said, anyone arguing for deposing brutal dictators anywhere in the world at any time would be guilty of a breach of clause 1. If this offence had been on the statute book a few years ago, it would have caught dissidents against Saddam, and it would certainly catch anyone calling for the deposition of Robert Mugabe.
</p>





<p><a name="st_278"><a name="51026-27_spnew3"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the mistake that the Government are making is that they fail to recognise what I had thought by now was fairly widely acknowledged, namely that there is a difference between a terrorist on the one hand and a freedom fighter on the other? The differences are twofold. The freedom fighter is fighting for something that in any conceivable sense can be described as freedom, and he is doing so in circumstances where there is no credible alternative because he is operating within a closed political system. Surely the Government understand that proposition.
</p>





<p><a name="st_279"><a name="51026-27_spnew4"><b> Mr. Llwyd: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes that point extremely well, but what is insidious is that even support for that kind of action will be criminalised in this country, and he and I and others may find ourselves before the courts in short order.

<p>
<a name="51026-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_278">Clause 8 relates to being present at a camp where terrorism training is taking place. That again is a difficult matter. I am sure that no sensible person would find themselves in such a camp, but again in that instance there is no actus reus and no mens rea; it becomes an absolute offence. A person in such a camp might be a bit slow on the uptake and not have picked up on what was going on, but if one is there for whatever reason, that is it&#151;seven years, thank you very much. Again, that is extremely dangerous ground. Will we be breeding terrorists rather than inhibiting them by going along this particular road?
</p>

<a name="stpa_279">An offence is created by just being in a place at the wrong time, with no intention whatever. It is guilt by association. That can never have any place in the law of England and Wales, and it should never have any place at all.

<br>&nbsp;<br>there has never been a case where anybody has been held for longer than 14 days, so why do we need 90? Why not make it 190, or 300, while we are at it? The whole thing is ridiculous.

<p>
<a name="51026-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_282">The provision may have come about because of the press release by the Association of Chief Police Officers within a week of the awful occurrence in July. As has frequently been said, if we rush into legislation, we often, if not always, get it wrong. If we rush into this legislation, we will get it wrong big-style. It may act as a recruiting sergeant for terrorism and will certainly alienate large sections of our society&#151;the very people we need on our side in such times. It is extremely dangerous, and we need to reflect far more on what we are doing. In the round, most of it would be covered by existing legislation in any event and is therefore, to use the famous parliamentary word, otiose. We need the current law to be properly enforced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_283">I have made my point clear. I do not believe that there is a case for extending the 14-day period. Under section 47(3) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, a person can be bailed during the investigation to come back to the police station. He or she can be tagged or put under curfew, and surveillance can take place. Reporting restrictions may be followed. All that is preferable to holding somebody in what might be termed administrative detention, with all the problems that we saw in Northern Ireland when that occurred over there.

 No Member of this House would in any way deplore measures to prevent terrorism occurring in our country. One of the reasons why many of us voted against the war in Iraq was that we realised that it would make our country even more vulnerable to terrorist attacks. In my view, the Bill is an excellent example of legislation that has been introduced in a knee-jerk reaction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_285">The Government have to show that they are macho about the terrorist threat. We have heard assurances from the Home Secretary that the 90 day-detention provision and the other clauses will be used only against suspected terrorists. However, we heard those assurances when the Terrorism Act 2000 was considered, but they did not prevent the arrest of Walter Wolfgang, after he had been removed by thugs from the Labour party conference, under&#151;believe it or not&#151;the Terrorism Act. A refugee from Nazi oppression was arrested under the Terrorism Act. I am not therefore comforted by the assurances that we have been given this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="51026-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_286">Cherie Blair&#039;s statement has been mentioned several times. I signed the early-day motion to defend her from attacks in the press. If the Bill had been law and we had expressed that view in the country, we might have been affected by its provisions. It is no use people shaking their heads. I have visited the west bank and seen the oppression under which the Palestinian people live. I can understand why there have been suicide bombers there, although I do not understand it in this country. Let us imagine that a radical Palestinian heard a statement by Cherie Blair or Jenny Tonge. He might become even more radical. I am sure that it could be proved that statements by people from this country tipped the scales so that a person became militant and involved in the terrorist acts that we all deplore. That could apply to the statements that I mentioned.

<a name="stpa_287">The Bill contains much that is objectionable and much that I appreciate. However, it includes little that is not already covered in statute or common law. The means for tackling the terrorist threat already exists. Indeed, the Government have been successful in dealing with extremist clerics, although they have some difficulty in deporting them, but that is another matter. They have done all that they could to deal with those who were rightly arrested because of their blatant statements, which were a spur to terrorists.

<a name="stpa_288">Let us imagine that the Bill had been on the statute book some years ago, during the Thatcher Administration, when the Prime Minister expressed support for Pinochet and described Nelson Mandela as a terrorist. Many of us went on the streets to support Nelson Mandela and the fight against apartheid. I was the chairman of the Merseyside committee for solidarity with Chile after that other 9/11 in 1973. If the Bill had been law, perhaps we would have been in prison. Let us picture the situation: Cherie Blair in prison, me in prison, and, if her husband had come out in her support, I might have shared a cell with the Prime Minister. Heaven forbid, but it might have been possible.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>terrorism is whatever the Government of the day believe terrorism to be. The Thatcher Administration thought that it was terrorism to attack the Pinochet regime or apartheid South Africa.

<p>
<a name="51026-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_290">I do not know what the Government consider to be terrorism. I am sure that they do not believe that tackling terrorism includes getting rid of an 82-year-old man at the Labour party conference. They do not really believe that, do they? Could not the legislation also have been used against the Greenham Common women? Were they terrorists? If someone at a CND demonstration leaves the rest of the crowd and tries to cut through the wire fence to get into an American air force base, is that terrorism? Such people could be pursued under this Bill.

I agree with the hon. Gentleman to a certain extent: there are other issues in the Bill. However, we might want to tell the Government to go back to the drawing board. But is that needed? As I have said, they already have enough powers to take the action that they need to take, and they have done reasonably well in dealing with the extremist clerics. If clause 23 is still in the Bill at 7 o&#039;clock tonight, I can see no reason for voting for the Bill. I might abstain on a number of issues, but I do not believe that anyone whose conscience tells them to oppose the 90-day provision could possibly support the Bill.

<br>&nbsp;<br>circumstances that we would like to be in, and we have to deal with the circumstances as they are. The former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the right hon.

The first is their duty to protect the lives of the citizens of this kingdom; the second is their duty to protect those people&#039;s liberties.

<a name="stpa_294">Secondly, in relation to the 90-day issue, I intervened on the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) in the hope of drawing out some answer to the problem that I faced. The Home Secretary has made a strong case as to why additional time in detention is necessary. We are dealing with a new world, with different technologies. The proliferation of CCTV across the United Kingdom is such that when an incident occurs, the investigating authorities can view it from various standpoints and gather information. The issue of computers was mentioned, and it was not adequately dealt with by the shadow Home Secretary&#039;s answer that although it might take time to get around the problem of encryption, a suspect who withholds information should be charged and could be held on that charge. The reality might be different. Three people might be responsible for what was intended to be a series of suicide bombings, two of whom might have given up their lives in the process. Those two might be the ones responsible for the encryption, and no matter what legal redress one might have against the remaining person, he could not decode the files even if he wanted to. That is one of a series of different possibilities that would prevent such a solution.

: The hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, which is a strong one, is that if someone refuses to provide a key to an encrypted piece of data, the shadow Home Secretary&#039;s suggestion is that he should be charged with the latter offence rather than the potential offence, which might be much greater.
</p>





<p><a name="st_287"><a name="51026-28_spnew5"><b> Mr. Robinson: </b> 
 I imagine that the shadow Home Secretary&#039;s argument is that that would be the holding charge in the first instance. That was much the argument of the Liberal Democrat spokesman, who said that he had the answer to the 90-day problem: if people were brought in on suspicion of responsibility for some terrorist incident, some lesser charger should be made against them. I do not like that option, because, in effect, we would be giving the police a wink and a nod to concoct some holding charge in order to keep the suspect in custody. That is a worse set of circumstances, because the police are unlikely to withdraw that charge later, whereas if they find, as the Home Secretary suggests, that the person is not of value to them, they can be released. They will end up being charged with what might be, in Northern Ireland language, the duff charge.

<br>&nbsp;<br>I have not heard today the answer to the conundrum of how we overcome the problems associated with the longer detention period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_295">While I said that the Home Secretary had convinced me that a longer detention period was needed, he has not convinced me that 90 days is the right period and, to be fair to him, he has not tried to convince me of that. We need some evidence as to why those 90 days are necessary. I would have thought that the provision of as short a detention period as possible is in the interests of anyone who loves liberty. Certain arguments have been advanced, and some thought that they would poke fun at the Labour Member who suggested that because the 14 days had not been exceeded, there should be no concern about a 90-day detention period. The reality is that the police will work within whatever length of time might be available to them.

: If there is another atrocity, the red-top papers will call for blood, and the police will want to show that they are taking action. Is there not a danger that they will trawl the friends or associates of anyone who they believe may have been involved, and that as a result such people will spend a long time in custody? People who have committed no offence may be convicted as if they had committed an offence that would normally carry six months&#039; imprisonment.
</p>





<p><a name="st_289"><a name="51026-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Robinson: </b> 
 That danger is certainly there, although I do not believe that the police act in that way. I believe that they will use the legislation sensibly. Perhaps I am far too innocent and trusting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_296">Steps can, of course, be taken to ensure that supervision takes place. We have already talked about that. A High Court judge, for instance, might be appointed, and some parliamentary activity might be possible at the same time. Such measures could reduce, if not remove, the likelihood of what the hon. Gentleman has described.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_297">I do not doubt that if we give this power to the Home Secretary and, through him, the police, circumstances will arise in future in which it will be deemed to have been used improperly. Let us, however, return to the balance that the Home Secretary, and indeed the House, must determine. If the Home Secretary leans towards the side of protecting liberties rather than protecting lives, there will be no redress for the people who lose lives. If he leans towards the other side there will at least be redress, however unfortunate the circumstances may be. He has still to convince us of the length of time that is necessary, but he has made a good start by convincing us that a longer period is necessary.

<a name="stpa_298">Yesterday I spoke in the House about a Bill dealing with electoral law. On that occasion, it was the Conservatives who had tabled a reasoned amendment. They said that they would vote against the Bill, although they also said that that would not destroy it, that it contained good things, and that they wanted it to proceed. They were pilloried by the Liberal Democrats, who said &quot;You cannot throw out the baby with the bathwater.&quot; Now the Liberal Democrats have turned

<br>&nbsp;<br>their argument on its head. They have left me completely confused, and I presume that they have left others confused as well.

<p><a name="st_290"><a name="51026-29_spnew2"><b> Martin Horwood  (Cheltenham) (LD):</b> 
 Perhaps I can deal with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s confusion. A vote on Second Reading is a vote on the principle of the Bill. The principle that we are supporting is that there should be robust and effective measures against terrorism without the contravention of fundamental civil liberties. We feel that this Bill involves a fundamental civil liberty, and that we must therefore object to it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_291"><a name="51026-29_spnew3"><b> Mr. Robinson: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman probably was not here for yesterday&#039;s debate, but the Liberal Democrat argument was that in Committee it would be possible to make the legislation into a satisfactory Bill. It is still possible, in my view, to make this Bill satisfactory. It is still possible to change the definitions, and it is still possible to make changes to the 90-day rule. Yet the Liberal Democrats are saying &quot;Throw out the Bill.&quot; I think that that is the wrong position to adopt, and it is certainly not the position that my hon. Friends and I will adopt.

 When I was appointed chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, some may have thought that I was a poacher turned gamekeeper, in view of the efforts that I had made over the years to expose the activities of extremists. I started to ask questions about them as long ago as 1998. I do not agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Wareing) on whether effective action was taken. I think that the answer is self-evident, given all that we have learned over the years about some of those concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_299">My work in that regard has given me a perspective on human rights. It is important to look at both sides of the argument; one side is often overlooked. I believe that my Committee&#039;s ongoing inquiry into the Government&#039;s response to terrorism is looking at both sides&#151;and I am pleased about the constructive way in which the Home Secretary has engaged with us on the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_300">The attacks on 7 and 21 July themselves constituted gross violations of human rights. The murder of 56 innocent civilians, including four of my constituents, and the severe maiming of scores of others are not capable of legal justification. It is well established in human rights law that invoking human rights to justify the destruction of other human rights is itself an abuse of such rights and never attracts protection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_301">Human rights law also imposes onerous positive obligations on states to take steps to protect the lives and physical integrity of everyone within their jurisdiction against the threat of terrorist attack. Where an attack has taken place, the state is required by human rights law itself to review the adequacy of the legal measures that it has in place to protect people from terrorist attack and to bring perpetrators to justice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_302">The fact that attacks have taken place is highly relevant evidence in an assessment of the level of terrorist threat, which itself is relevant to the proportionality of any interference with human rights that can be restricted in the interests of public safety and

<p>
<a name="51026-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_303">My Committee will have reservations about much of the Bill&#039;s detail, and particularly about the breadth of its coverage, its definition of terrorism and the question of international comparators.

 As the newly appointed Chairman of this important Committee, does the hon. Gentleman rule out&#151;as I think he did on the &quot;Today&quot; programme&#151;any amendment to, or repeal of, the Human Rights Act 1998?
</p>





<p><a name="st_294"><a name="51026-29_spnew6"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 I do, because we can do what we need to do without taking such action. I heard the hon. Gentleman&#039;s earlier contribution and I agreed with much of it&#151;apart from that aspect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_304">There is a big distinction between explaining and understanding a terrorist act such as a suicide bombing, and knowingly encouraging others to emulate that attack. We have to devise a wording that will deal with the particular problem of liberation movements&#151; I subscribe to the Home Secretary&#039;s view on this issue, but I realise that others do not&#151;and with the sort of statements that have so far gone unpunished by the law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_305">On 20 April 2004 in Westminster Hall, I referred in particular to an example of such a statement: that made by Hassan Butt, an al-Muhajiroun activist, who said that &quot;close to 50&quot; British volunteers had approached him for advice on emulating suicide attacks in Israel. When asked whether that meant suicide missions in Britain, he replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">&quot;&#039;Yes, absolutely.

<p>
<a name="51026-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_306">Under our existing law, that is not an offence, but under the Bill as drafted it would be. If we are to change the Bill&#039;s definitions, we have to do so in a way that does not exempt such appalling statements from potential prosecution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_307">In the end, this issue comes down to the question of proportionality, as the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) said earlier. In considering the question of compatibility with human rights legislation, we must bear in mind the balancing act between the infringement of individual human rights and the human right of society at large not to be blown up.

<a name="51026-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_308">Much of this afternoon&#039;s debate has focused on the proposed extension of the pre-charge detention period to 90 days, and I want to focus on that issue in detail. Two days ago, our Committee heard very cogent evidence from the police. We pressed them very hard on many of these issues, and I certainly recommend that all Members who have reservations about extending the pre-charge detention period read the transcript of that evidence. We heard from deputy assistant commissioner Peter Clarke, a senior hands-on detective with a number of years&#039; experience of such cases, and from chief constable Jones, of the Association of Chief Police Officers. If Members read that transcript, many of the reservations that have been expressed today would be answered.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">&quot;had we had this provision in 2002, the outcome of a recent court case, the so-called ricin trial, might have been very different. Mohamed Meguerba was one of the suspects in that case and it is likely that we would have held him or applied for his detention for sufficient time to find that his fingerprints were on the ricin recipe and he would have stood trial as a main conspirator in that case had he not fled the country.

<a name="51026-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_313">Mr. Clarke provided another useful example of a current case in which the police found&#151;by chance on the 13th day of detention&#151;crucial evidence on a computer, which led to the authorisation of charges from the Director of Public Prosecutions. The inference 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 393</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>was clear&#151;that if the computer had not been decrypted until the 15th day, the particular individual could have walked and probably done a runner. Mr. Clarke made it absolutely clear how much pressure is on the police, when he told us that officers are often

<a name="stpa_319">I was very pleased to hear that the police welcomed judicial oversight of the process.

They cited some cases where district judges had not given the police what they had asked for. Mr. Clarke said:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55">&quot;It is very often the case that we will ask for perhaps four or five days and the district judge will say, &#039;No, 48 hours and then I want to hear the case again.&#039;&quot;</p>

All of that combines to give this Government a somewhat dubious record on civil liberties. Yet I find that, this evening, I will be passing through the same Lobby as those hon.

<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 395</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee. He made the valuable and powerful point that there are many things besides passing legislation that we must do to reach out to the hearts and minds of those communities in this country that we need to influence. I disagree with him, however, in respect of Hizb ut-Tahrir. That organisation is more than just a vehicle for eccentric views at the extreme of the political spectrum. Throughout Europe, it has a record of publishing vicious and violent&#151;and often violently anti-Semitic&#151;propaganda. From time to time, it may seek to cloak itself in the guise of peaceful debate, but at other times it expresses hateful and hurtful opinions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-30_para17">
<a name="stpa_327">I want to turn briefly to two aspects of the Bill that have attracted particular attention. Some of the problems associated with the offence of glorifying terrorism in clause 1&#151;it was originally clause 2&#151;have been ironed out as a result of the welcome concession that the Home Secretary has made, particularly in respect of the need for intent in the offence. Much more needs to be done, however, and matters as they stand are not satisfactory. That much was demonstrated by the interventions in the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s speech from hon. Members of all parties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-30_para18">
<a name="stpa_328">We understand what the Home Secretary is trying to get at with the proposed offence but, although he may hit that particular target, I am afraid that he may hit too many other targets as well. In seeking to address the problem that he has identified, he is in danger of criminalising statements that should be part of normal political debate. For example, the right hon. Gentleman was not able to deal satisfactory with suggestions from various hon. Members that expressions of opinion about Zimbabwe or North Korea, railway lines in Burma or statues in Uzbekistan would be criminalised by the Bill. That needs to be looked at again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-30_para19">
<a name="stpa_329">Following the interventions that he accepted, the Home Secretary&#039;s final position was that he hoped that the provision would not have the effect that had been described, but I do not see why that should be so. For me, it remains possible that expressions of opinion of the type that I have described would be caught by the Bill. Therefore, I hope that there will be some movement in that respect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-30_para20">
<a name="stpa_330">I turn next to the length of detention before charge&#151;a very serious feature of the Bill, which we need to deal with very seriously. When the anti-terrorist branch of the Metropolitan police makes a request for an extension of the period of detention permitted before charge, we must give it serious and sympathetic consideration. It is not a question of our doing automatically what the police request of us. The fact that the police have made such a request is surely not a reason for turning it down out of hand, and we must give it serious consideration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-30_para21">
<a name="stpa_331">We are all aware of the fact that grave issues of public safety are at stake, as the letter from Mr. Hayman makes clear. We have to accept that we are facing a terrorist threat of a different order from that in the past&#151;a threat which can have appalling consequences&#151;and we must listen to the police when they tell us that they need therefore to intervene earlier to protect the public.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-30_para22">
<a name="stpa_332">Against that background we must give the proposals serious consideration. We should remember that Lord Carlile has broadly given them his approval, but we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>should also remember that a massive extension of the present maximum is proposed, that the present maximum was itself a very substantial increase&#151;a doubling&#151;on the previous limit, and that that increase was allowed only as recently as January last year.

There is nothing in the letter that tells us something about international terrorism of which we were not aware when the previous legislation was passed. We must have known about those matters then, and we should take that into account as well.

The person would definitely face a lesser charge, and may face a more serious charge later. In the meantime the police could continue to question him. All the points made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) about questioning someone for a long time when they are held in detention not knowing their ultimate fate must apply with as much force to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s proposal as they do to the Government&#039;s. I recoil from the concept of charging someone with a lesser charge rather than the full charge; they should face the full charge at the earliest possible opportunity. So, there are problems with those provisions.

<a name="51026-30_para26">
<a name="stpa_336">Problems also arise from the operation of the Bail Act 1976. When a person is charged, they are brought before a court, as is their right, but from the point of view of bail the court will deal with them with the lesser charge in mind, and the decision on bail may well go in the person&#039;s favour when the police are still investigating them for very serious matters. So I do not think that the hon. Member for Winchester has the answer; he needs to do more thinking.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Malik. She is in good company, because my mother was watching the BBC Parliament channel last week and saw me referred to as Sadiq Khan. She was not pleased that I had not consulted her on the name change. We are often confused, but I assure the House that we are not twins.

<a name="stpa_338">Most hon. Members will agree that since 7 July few places have been challenged as much as my constituency. I was proud to be elected as Dewsbury&#039;s MP, but that pride pales into insignificance compared with the pride I feel at the way in which we have responded, as a united community, against the twin evils of terrorism and extremism. However, I am not naive, and the arrest this weekend in my constituency of a young man whom the tabloids have labelled the fifth suicide bomber underlines the need for constant vigilance.

More than 50 innocent people, including six Muslims, were murdered in the attacks, so let us make no mistake that he meant people like me. Let us be clear that the only people responsible for those heinous acts were Siddique Khan and his twisted associates. Nothing in this world could excuse or justify their vile actions.

<a name="stpa_340">I shall touch on the debate about the cause of the suicide bombings. It is true that foreign policy concerns about Chechnya, Kashmir, Palestine and Iraq, coupled with deprivation and the negative portrayal of Islam in the media, have caused frustration and anger among British Muslims. I am often angry and frustrated about injustices at home and abroad, but I do not blow myself up and kill innocent fellow citizens in the belief that I will go to heaven. No Muslim I have ever met would suggest that such actions were Islamic. The lethal ingredient that turns legitimate anger and frustration into hatred and terrorism is an utterly grotesque and perverted interpretation of Islam. That is why I associate myself with the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), who talked of debate, discourse and democracy as the vehicle for change in this country.

I also applaud his decision to chair the commission on integration and cohesion, which has the potential to do much good.

We ignore their needs at our peril. However, the debate is about legislation, and like many hon. Members I have much sympathy with the Home Secretary&#039;s intentions in introducing the Bill.

Our world has changed, and I accept that we must respond to the challenges that that change presents.

Members, I do not take lightly the prospect of enacting legislation that could imprison a person for up to 90 days without charge&#151; I am most uncomfortable about that&#151;but I am aware that, after 7 and 21 July, the police amassed some 38,000 exhibits and 80,000 CCTV videos, which needed to be monitored and examined. Hence, in exceptional cases, there is plainly an argument for increasing the current 14-day maximum pre-charge detention. On that point, I disagree with the hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_347">The question for the House is not whether an increase is needed, but whether 90 days is justifiable. I am not 100 per cent. convinced, but there is some reassurance in the fact that Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer of terrorist legislation, is a strong supporter of the Bill, and that extending the pre-charge period will require judicial review every seven days. I also draw comfort from the fact that, over the past two years under the current laws, only 11 people have been held for the full allowable period and all 11 were charged. That suggests that the new legislation will be used sparingly and only where the likelihood of charges being brought is high.

 Everyone in the House will remember 7 July for a long time, but I will never forget 12 July for as long as I live. At about 11.30 on that Tuesday morning, I received a text message from a council colleague in Leeds. He told me that helicopters were hovering over a property in the Hyde Park area of my constituency, police were carrying out an armed raid and that I should return as quickly as I could. I was at the police cordon by 4 pm that day, in a community with a deep sense of shock. I am delighted to say, however, that the community&#039;s response was magnificent, as I am sure it was in Dewsbury. We must emphasise that point. The communities of Hyde Park, Beeston and Dewsbury have been united in both their condemnation of the appalling events of 7 July and their real resolve to move forward as united, diverse, multicultural communities.

They are also deeply concerned about deportations to countries that practise torture, whatever bits of paper people may be given. Most of all, they are concerned about the provisions&#151;to which we object&#151;to detain people without trial for 90 days. From my experience of the community perspective, I can tell the House that those provisions are seen as draconian, dangerous and deeply divisive. They are divisive because, as was said earlier, we all know who will be detained for 90 days without trial. They will be members of communities such as ours who are Asian or Arabic-looking.

That said, there is something a little circular about some of the arguments that have been put forward in support of several of the more contentious aspects of the Bill. They almost seem to suggest that because we are dealing with a new kind of terrorist threat, the more uncompromising the apparent response, the more effective that response will be. I do not necessarily agree that that is the case.

<a name="stpa_357">Part 1 of the Bill and other relevant provisions are profoundly deficient and may well achieve precisely the opposite of what Home Secretary wants them to achieve. It is already illegal to incite others to commit terrorist acts. Now, however, the Government are asking us to approve legislation that will lock people up for seven years if they say something that &quot;glorifies&quot; terrorism and can be held indirectly to encourage it. Those are sweeping powers. They are directed not at what people do but at what they say, so we would expect to have to be careful about the way in which we define glorification and terrorism.

<a name="stpa_358">Many hon. Members have talked about the deficiencies in the catch-all definition of terrorism with which we are working. The example of the African National Congress in South Africa is a good one. Equally, however, if someone incited or encouraged a Government to launch a military attack on another country to achieve a political objective such as the removal of a tyrannical regime, that would be considered terrorism under the definitions in the Bill and

They say that the Director of Public Prosecutions will look at the &quot;context&quot; of each case and the public interest. That is not very reassuring. It sounds as if we may try to prosecute individuals who glorify politically motivated violence by people of whom we do not approve but that we may turn a blind eye to statements in support of political violence committed by our friends. It is precisely the perception of such double standards that has contributed to the scepticism with which many people, particularly in our Muslim community, view the much-vaunted war on terror. One does not have to be a supporter of Hamas or even a sympathiser to worry that someone could be locked up in this country for suggesting that Palestinians might be justified in using some form of political violence to resist the occupation of the west bank.

<a name="51026-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_366">The Bill is supposed to be the cornerstone of how we deal with international terrorism. How would it or could it have prevented the bomb that went off on 7 July?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_367">I do not understand why we are not addressing the fundamental issue of why British citizens decide to kill other British citizens. The Bill does not address that and I should like the Minister to comment on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_368">Time is limited and others wish to speak, but I want to focus on two issues that concern the international scene. We understand that no matter how much legislation we create in this House or anywhere else, it is virtually impossible to stop an attack taking place. However, I have spoken to the survivors and the families of the victims of the Bali, Turkey and Sharm el-Sheikh disasters, and there is a frustration that the energy and determination that has been expended to fight terrorism here in the UK is not matched by other countries around the world. That is reflected in the fact that a second bomb has gone off in Bali. Bali itself, or Indonesia, has yet to condemn&#151;to outlaw&#151;Jemaah Islamiah the terrorist group responsible for the first and second bombings. Those countries need our help and support, and if we are to have a strategy to deal with international terrorism, we should be at the forefront of helping such countries, whether they be in the middle east, Indonesia, Afghanistan or Pakistan.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_369">The other concern that has been expressed is that the energy and determination to prevent a bomb going off in the first place is not matched by the commitment and support to the victims. With regard to compensation, will the Minister update us on the position regarding those affected by 7 July. There is also a recognition that terrorism knows no borders, and neither should our support for British citizens, no matter where the bombs take place. Yet, because the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority refuses to acknowledge any events that take place abroad, although people in Bali, Turkey and elsewhere have been killed by the same terrorist organisations, they do not get a penny in compensation from the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_370">Terrorism is unlikely to disappear. In fact, it is likely to get worse with the use of nuclear, possibly biological and perhaps chemical weapons as well. If the Bill is supposed to be the platform to contain, stop and eradicate terrorism, I find it wanting. We need to give more help to those people where the blanket of security that we are trying to create is failing. We face the challenge of breaking down the religious divide that these terrorists are trying to widen not only here in the UK but in other parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_371">There is little in the Bill to prevent the conveyor belt of the disillusioned being recruited by the terrorist. We could be doing much more not only in the House but as a nation and on the international scene to improve our prospects in fighting the battle against terrorism.

The threat that we face is totalitarian in nature, but guerrilla-like in its methods.
</p>

Al-Qaeda is waging a war on secularism, tolerance, and racial and religious harmony. It is waging a war on Muslims in Iraq as well as on the people of all faiths and races from places as far apart as New York and Bali and as near as Madrid and London.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_375">The world in which we live is changing by the day. Affordable international air travel, the internet and even digital mobile phone technology have become the means of delivery of the poison of these people&#039;s ideology or the power of their explosives. The threat had to be faced and I believe that the Bill is part of the developing armoury of legislation that must be deployed to counter the threat and provide for a more secure Britain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_376">Today&#039;s British society recognises the need for this legislation. Some civil liberties groups, Opposition Members and colleagues have genuine reservations about parts of the Bill, but I have none. Since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, we have had the benign 1990s. Britain, and Europe in general, with the exception of the Balkans, have enjoyed relative peace and stability. Until 11 September 2001, we had come to expect economic growth, high employment, low interest rates and modern creature comforts as things that we all deserved, and the vast majority of people had hopes, expectations and a general feeling of security.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_377">Today, however, people have fears as well as aspirations because of the nature of the threat that we face. The Bill deals with those threats in a balanced and reasonable way that is a large step in the right direction. In order to stop the spread of this poisonous ideology, the glorification of terrorism is be outlawed, as is praising or celebrating terrorist acts. Good, I say.

<a name="51026-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_378">Some Members have said, &quot;What about praising the ANC or movements in Palestine, Burma or elsewhere in the world?&quot; It is clearly justifiable to support, praise and celebrate the aims and objectives of many such movements, particularly when they are oppressed by regimes that deny them their land, liberty and freedom of speech, without necessarily supporting all their methods in trying to achieve those aims and objectives. I want a stable and secure Palestine based on the 1967 boundaries, but I would never praise or celebrate the terrorist methods of Hamas or the former atrocities of the PLO. If oppressed opposition groups in countries around the world who have just cause choose to resort to terrorist methods because they have lost their land, liberty and freedom and have no vote, I would not celebrate, support or try to justify those terrorist actions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_379">That is not to say that if change occurs in a country as a result of the use of terrorist methods, I would not accept that the new regime may&#151;or in some cases may not&#151;be better than the old one. I would not seek to justify the means by which it has gained power, but be content with the outcome. I have never believed that the ends justify the means. In a situation where a regime is persecuting people, self-defence is legitimate. Wars or UN resolutions-based actions against regimes are legitimate. As for what remains on the consciences of people in other countries in determining how they attain their freedom, I, and for that matter many Governments, have little power over that. However, where there are interventions and military actions such as in Afghanistan and Iraq&#151;conflicts where genocide has been averted&#151;and conflicts that involve the UN, we can hold a view that celebrates and justifies armed struggle against the oppressors, and would justifiably not describe actions against the regime in question as terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-33_para14">
<a name="stpa_380">Let us say that the tube train that exploded in an underground tunnel on 7 July was activated by a timing device left by someone who had left the train instead of a suicide bomber, and that the suspected bomber had later been apprehended by the police. It could take months to acquire the forensic evidence to convict the suspect, as the tunnel could have completely collapsed, with a risk to rescue workers similar to that which we saw on 7 July. Finding a fingerprint on something left by the bomber would be like finding a needle in a haystack and would take longer than two weeks.

<a name="stpa_381">The stakes are now so high that half measures will not do. The nation looks to us to safeguard its security. If the Bill is not passed in something that relates to its current form and&#151;God forbid&#151;another atrocity on the scale of 7 July occurs because a detained suspect is released after a few weeks, despite the fact that he remains under suspicion on good intelligence grounds, we would have to live with that knowledge for the rest of our lives.

<a name="stpa_382">Powerful contributions have been made. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), who said that he was unable to support the Bill, voiced serious doubts about its operation and highlighted the fact that the provisions are so widely drawn that they would cover expressions of opinion. Most people would regard it as improper to criminalise those.

<a name="stpa_383">My hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), in another powerful speech, clearly expressed his anxiety that a wide range of legislation, which the Government could use, already exists to cover incitement. He thereby cast doubt on the necessity for clause 1. Those doubts were echoed by the hon. Members for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) and for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Wareing) and the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher), who made a powerful speech about his anxiety that, far from improving community relations in this country, the Bill would undermine them.

 As one who did not make a powerful speech, or, indeed, have the opportunity to make a speech at all, I stress that many colleagues are simply not prepared to support the Bill at this stage because it contains too broad a range of powers, which are too vaguely defined and threaten too much damage in return for too little benefit. It is quite simple.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 408</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>must be a starting point. There is no point in the House legislating ad nauseam to create new structures to try to stop terrorists, because we know very well&#151;I am sure that the Home Secretary will be the first to acknowledge this&#151;that the way to stop terrorism in the long term involves two things. The first is adequate security. The second is pinching terrorism out at its source by making it completely unacceptable in any section of our community. Those must be our two aims, but I have to say to the Home Secretary that the Bill does not address either of them, because it looks specifically at the legislative functions by which a greater penal policy can be directed towards the issue.
</p>





<p><a name="st_329"><a name="51026-34_spnew5"><b> Ms Abbott: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Muslim community is united against terrorism, but expressing great unhappiness about the Bill? Its members have followed the Bill with considerable attention and believe that it is targeted at them. Given the concern in the community, is not the fact that the Bill contains a provision for 90 days&#039; detention without trial unlikely to create the kind of community co-operation that will help us to fight terrorism?
</p>





<p><a name="st_330"><a name="51026-34_spnew6"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I do not disagree with the hon. Lady. What worries me particularly is that the 90-day period appears to have been plucked out of the air with very little justification. During the passage of the Bill, the Government are going to have to engage in a proper dialogue with Members of the House to explain why 90 days is an appropriate period, as opposed to 16 or 28 days, six months, or anything else.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_386">The Conservatives do not wish to get involved in a Dutch auction with the Government. Our question is: why should there be an extension from 14 days, which already represents a considerable extension of the existing practices? Are there any alternatives that might make it unnecessary to extend the period at all? We shall listen to the Home Secretary and other Ministers to establish whether they can come up with any coherent arguments as to why the period needs to be extended. However, any extension of the period beyond 14 days will, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) rightly said earlier, have the capacity to create martyrs. There would be nothing worse for community relations than individuals being released from custody without charge after six weeks of detention. I cannot think of a better recruiting sergeant for terrorism or disaffection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_387">The problems faced by the Government start with the definition of &quot;terrorism&quot;. I accept that we adopted a definition in the 2000 Act that may have been appropriate&#151;I emphasise the word &quot;may&quot;&#151;in the context of domestic terrorism in the United Kingdom. However, one of the effects of the Bill will be to extend it to a worldwide definition. I hope that the Home Secretary will have taken on board from today&#039;s debate the fact that the definition is now completely unacceptable, unless we are saying that violence for political ends can never be justified in any circumstances. If that is the case, I have to say to the Home Secretary that I am not quite sure what we are doing in Iraq. We must face the fact that we have long accepted that there may be occasions on which such justification exists.

<p><a name="st_331"><a name="51026-34_spnew7"><b> Alan Simpson: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will recall the debate in the House two weeks ago about the extension of the list of proscribed organisations. Included on that list was the Islamic Jihad Union in Uzbekistan. Many Members raised concerns about the inclusion of that organisation and, a matter of days later, the former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan wrote in <i>The Guardian</i> that there was no basis for substantiating the allegations that had been made about it, that they had come from the Uzbek Government and that we had no embedded intelligence sources of our own in the region. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the provisions relating to encouragement in the Bill would place hon. Members in an invidious position, in that, if we sought to defend an organisation that had been improperly proscribed as a terrorist organisation, we would be committing a terrorist offence under the encouragement provisions?
</p>





<p><a name="st_332"><a name="51026-34_spnew8"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 As drafted, the clause presents precisely those difficulties. While I have some sympathy with the Government in trying to consider the issue of terrorism generally, the fact is that the definition provided is hopeless to meet the problems for which we must legislate. Furthermore, as has been highlighted, clause 1, in relation to incitement, provides for an offence that can be committed negligently, not an offence of specific intent. Therefore, when those two factors are taken together, a very large number of people in this country are likely to be criminalised for their comments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_388">Let me make one thing clear to the Government: the suggestion that it does not matter that the legislation is woolly, because either the DPP or the Attorney-General will act as a long stop to prevent something wrong happening, is just not acceptable. The task of this House is to pass legislation that is intellectually coherent and intelligible, not to give a blank cheque to the Government, which they can exercise through the Law Officers or anyone else at their whim.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_389">We do not think that the offence of glorification should be in the Bill at all. I know that it was even worse in the first draft of the Bill, and I am grateful that the Home Secretary seems to have persuaded the Prime Minister to give way on the matter. One is left with the impression, however, that it has been left in the Bill specifically to save the Prime Minister&#039;s face. That is not acceptable either. Either glorification amounts to incitement of its own, or it does not amount to incitement at all. If it does not amount to incitement at all, there is no reason why it should be separately identified within the legislation. The sooner that we have an assurance from the Government that it will be removed, the better progress we will make during the passage of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_390">The second issue that has greatly exercised the House is that of the 90-day detention period. As I said a moment ago, there are ways in which we believe that the issue can be considered afresh. There are a number of possibilities. We certainly need much better scrutiny, as was suggested by Lord Carlile. The decisions should be taken by a senior circuit judge and not by a district judge, to which we shall return in Committee. There should be a review mechanism and an appeal process to the High Court, and I am dubious that seven-day periods are acceptable, because the judge should decide the period before a return, and the only basis for any 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 410</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>continuing detention would have to be persuading the judge that there is a reason, in the next three, four or 72 hours, that that detention will yield benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_391">It is also astonishing that one of the provisions under the detention clause is that detention can take place in order to facilitate continuing questioning and nothing else. One moment&#039;s thought must make the Government realise that that is an unacceptable premise. In fact, any confession that is obtained will probably be thrown out by the court. The atmosphere of oppression that will be conveyed&#151;that somebody can be detained specifically for the purpose of questioning and interrogation on its own&#151;is one that is readily curable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_392">Although I have no difficulty in agreeing with large parts of the Bill, much of it is very sloppily drafted. In relation to the dissemination of terrorist literature and publications, are we seriously saying that the offence will be so widely drafted that a university lecturer handing out copies of an al-Qaeda manifesto to his students would be caught by the operation of the Act? The Home Secretary shakes his head, but as drafted, that is precisely what the legislation does.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_393">There is much to criticise, but there is a kernel in the Bill that seeks to improve anti-terrorist powers. We accept that, which is why, in principle, we are prepared to support the Government. We are also mindful that the Government have provided a proper opportunity for the House to consider the legislation, in Committee of the whole House, a proper Report stage thereafter, and most importantly of all, a Third Reading that will be more than a 45-minute rubber stamp.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_394">For those reasons, let me first thank the Home Secretary and secondly say that we intend to engage in a constructive dialogue. However, I also ask the Home Secretary not to end this process by saying that amendments will be tabled in another place. Either the Bill is in an acceptable condition by the time of Third Reading or it will not have our support, and&#151;according to my impression&#151;will not have the support of many Members in all parts of the House.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_402">The hon. Member for Winchester said that in his view, there are alternatives to the 90-day limit that will work. We will explore them in Committee, but I point out to him now that the idea of charging suspects with a lesser offence has some serious faults. First, it is dishonest. Charging somebody with a minor offence simply as a ruse to keep them in custody is not the right thing to do. Secondly, it might not work. In order to get the evidence for the lesser offence, it might be necessary to decrypt a computer, which would take longer than the period in question in any event. Such an approach could also be inefficient and divert police resources toward dealing with minor offences, when they should be concentrating on the major offences in question. Indeed, such an approach could prove dangerous. Someone could be let out on bail because they were charged with a lesser offence, and then commit further offences. However, we will explore all those issues in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_403">My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) raised issues relating to the offence of glorifying and encouraging of terrorism. I point out to all Members that if we seek to make a distinction between good terrorism and bad terrorism, we will get into very dangerous territory. Terrorism is wrong. We should not encourage people to kill, murder and maim others, even in the interest of political change. That will prove a really important dividing line as we continue our discussions.
</p>





<p><a name="st_336"><a name="51026-35_spnew2"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 The argument is not about the distinction between a good terrorist and a bad terrorist; it is about whether there is a distinction&#151;as many of us believe there is&#151;between a terrorist and a freedom fighter, and if so, what that distinction is. Does the Minister not acknowledge the difference?
</p>





<p><a name="st_337"><a name="51026-35_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 What we have is a definition of terrorism, and if somebody is guilty of terrorism, they are guilty of terrorism. The path on which the hon. Gentleman is embarking in seeking that dividing line will lead him into significant and considerable difficulties; but we shall see.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_404">The right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) also dealt with the offence of encouraging terrorism, and he said that such an offence could amount simply to somebody being offended by something that was said. This offence is not about offending somebody. It has to be likely that those hearing the statement in question will be encouraged to emulate terrorist acts; that is a world away from having a debate and simply saying something that somebody does not agree with.
</p>





<p><a name="st_338"><a name="51026-35_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Ellman: </b> 
 Does the Minister agree that the carnage that happened in London is part of a global activity, and does she agree that inciting and glorifying the murder of civilians in Iraq or in Israel is incompatible with claiming to be against the committing of the very same acts in this country?
</p>





<p><a name="st_339"><a name="51026-35_spnew5"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Yes, and my hon. Friend puts the point extremely well. This Bill is about saying that terrorism, wherever it occurs, is wrong. People should not murder, maim and kill others in any context.

<a name="51026-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_405">My right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) made the absolutely valid point that legislation alone will not resolve the problems that we face. It is about winning hearts and minds, good policing, effective community relationships and better intelligence. But I say to him and to my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central that we need to think very carefully about this issue. If we are to limit terrorist offences simply to civilians, will that suggest that it is legitimate to attack police officers and innocent members of the armed forces? That is a very difficult distinction to make, but we will explore it in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_406">The hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr.   Shepherd) made his usual passionate speech on this issue; he will doubtless participate in our subsequent debate. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary should have allowed the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) to intervene. He spoke in favour of the Bill, and I was grateful for his emphasis on ensuring that our measures are proportionate to the threat that we face.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_407">I was disappointed by the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)&#151;he is not in his place, but he apologised to me in advance for his absence&#151;made about the police. He said that if they could use a longer detention period, they might sit on the records for 30 or 40 days. If he had personal knowledge of the work that the police have done since 7 July&#151;of the effort that they have put into the investigations, and the thousands of hours of CCTV footage that they have examined&#151;he would realise that they are not likely to sit on documents for that long a period without taking action. Of course they are keen to minimise the detention period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_408">I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) for the Bill&#039;s provisions. He has some concerns, and I am sure that we will debate them in Committee. My hon. Friends the Members for Dewsbury (Mr. Malik) and for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) made extremely good speeches. I am particularly grateful for the action of my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury in supporting his local community and for the stand that he has taken on these issues, sometimes in difficult circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_409">I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) for the measures in the Bill and I look forward to debating it further with him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_410">My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, who is now Chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, has looked at these issues in great detail and I welcome what he said about the Bill representing a proportionate response in human rights terms. I greatly welcome his support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_411">The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) made a telling contribution about his shock at the events of 7 July. I have been out on many visits to the Muslim community across the country, including Leeds, and I found some excellent work going on to bring people together to face the threat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para16">
<a name="stpa_412">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) about the importance of keeping engaged with young people. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 414</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Together with the Muslim community, there are now seven groups working with women and young people to tackle extremism, and seeking to secure the support of imams and mosques. I have to say that the young people have probably formed the most exciting working group so far, which has come out with some excellent suggestions about road shows and how they can work to tackle extremism. I am delighted about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para17">
<a name="stpa_413">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr.   Ellwood) rightly raised international issues. I can tell him that our international strategy is acknowledged as one of the best, and we intend to continue to support other countries in fighting terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para18">
<a name="stpa_414">Finally, my hon. Friend the Member for Preston (Mr. Hendrick) set out, in an excellent speech, how the world is changing and how the terrorists threaten everything that we believe in. I welcome his support for the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para19">
<a name="stpa_415">The Bill addresses difficult issues that represent some of the most important ones facing our country. I entirely acknowledge that legislation alone will not be enough to protect our people, but it is vital that we have sufficient powers to intervene early to disrupt terrorism, to prosecute terrorists and bring them to justice. That is what the Bill is all about. It is about ensuring that we have on our statute book the legislation necessary to meet the ever-changing and ever-evolving threat of international terrorism that we face.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para20">
<a name="stpa_416">We are desperately trying to strike the right balance. We must have a society in which we respect the rule of law. There will always be tension between our rights as individuals and the rights of the community. I was in the Library quite late last night, after a lengthy debate on another Bill, and I thought about how people have dealt with those tensions over the years. Those tensions&#151;over securing the balance between security and liberty &#151;are nothing new. It was John Stuart Mill who, more than 100 years ago, effectively summed up that tension and the balance that we are trying to strike today, when he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">&quot;All that makes existence valuable to anyone depends on the enforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para21">
<a name="stpa_417">That is the balance that must be struck: in exercising our freedoms, it is sometimes necessary to restrain other people&#039;s freedoms. Tonight, we are focused on getting the right balance. I look forward with great anticipation&#151;and, dare I say, pleasure&#151;to the Committee stage of the Bill on the Floor of the House, during which we can further explore some of the complex and challenging issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-35_para22">
<a name="stpa_418">I am absolutely convinced that, on the Labour Benches, we want legislation that is practical, workable, effective and will protect the people of this country from the undoubted terrorist threat that we face. I think that the first responsibility of any Government is to protect their citizens while, at the same time, safeguarding the fundamental freedoms that make our democracy one under which people want to live and bring up their families. I am determined that that is what we will do. I commend the Bill to the House.

</p>

<p>

<p><a name="st_356"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Mr. Cawsey.]</i>
<a name="time_30">
<a name="51026-38_time5"><h5>7.34 pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="st_357"><a name="51026-38_spnew5"><b> Dr. Gavin Strang  (Edinburgh, East) (Lab):</b> 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to draw the attention of the House to the urgent need for international action to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para20">
<a name="stpa_448">Back in 1963, US President John F. Kennedy stated that he saw the possibility of 15, 20 or 25 nations having nuclear weapons in the 1970s. Quite a few present Members of the House will not be old enough to remember John Kennedy, but I am, and I remember the widespread appreciation at that time of the importance of preventing more and more states from acquiring nuclear weapons. Clearly, the more states that have nuclear weapons, the more likely it is that they will be used. It was in that climate that the non-proliferation treaty was conceived, negotiated and agreed&#151;a time when there was a very real prospect of a rapid escalation in the number of states with nuclear weapons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para21">
<a name="stpa_449">The nuclear non-proliferation treaty&#151;the NPT&#151;came into force in 1970. At that time the only countries with nuclear weapons were the United States, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom. Since then, India and Pakistan have acquired and tested nuclear weapons, Israel is believed to have a nuclear weapons capability, and North Korea has stated that it has manufactured nuclear weapons. Every new state with nuclear weapons is a blow to international security, but without the NPT the world would have become a much more dangerous place much sooner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para22">
<a name="stpa_450">The Government rightly describe the NPT as the cornerstone of the international non-proliferation and disarmament regime. The NPT is built on three central pillars&#151;first, preventing proliferation, by stopping new states acquiring nuclear weapons and stopping states that already have nuclear weapons acquiring more; secondly, obliging existing nuclear weapons states to disarm; and thirdly, enabling nuclear technology to be used peacefully. The treaty is essentially a deal between those countries with nuclear weapons and those without. The non-nuclear states pledge not to acquire nuclear weapons, in return for which they get peaceful uses of nuclear energy, plus the promise of disarmament from the nuclear weapons states.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para23">
<a name="stpa_451">Nuclear technology and international politics do not stand still, so it is vital that the global regime for non-proliferation and disarmament can evolve and strengthen, in order to be fit for purpose. The NPT is therefore subject to a review conference every five years. There was such a conference in May this year, and one would have thought that if ever it was crucial that progress be made, it was at that 2005 review conference. After all, much had happened in the preceding five years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para24">
<a name="stpa_452">For the first time a state, North Korea, had announced that it was withdrawing from the treaty. Two states, Libya and North Korea, had announced that they had been working on their own secret nuclear weapons programmes, and North Korea then claimed that it had manufactured nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency had found undeclared uranium-enrichment activity in Iran, and the A.Q. Khan trafficking network had been exposed.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 427</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para25">
<a name="stpa_453">In the meantime, non-nuclear weapons states were frustrated at the slow progress on disarmament , and the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 had thrown into alarmingly sharp relief the prospect of terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction. Despite those developments, the review conference was a dreadful failure. The participants succumbed to wrangles over procedure and the conference concluded with no substantive agreement at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para26">
<a name="stpa_454">I raised the matter in the House in the summer Adjournment debate in July, and I was grateful for the reply that I received from the Government by way of a letter from my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade. He wrote that
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para27">

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para28">
<a name="stpa_456">However, my hon. Friend was keen to assure me in his letter that it is not unheard of for NPT review conferences to be unsuccessful, and that there are other forums where progress could be made. He pointed to the forthcoming United Nations millennium review summit in New York in September.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para29">
<a name="stpa_457">Hopes were indeed high for the millennium review summit. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan had published a report entitled &quot;In Larger Freedom&quot; for decision at the summit by the world&#039;s leaders. The Secretary-General&#039;s report made key recommendations concerning all three pillars of the NPT. The G8 at Gleneagles issued a communiqu&#233; on non-proliferation, which welcomed the attention given to non-proliferation in the Secretary-General&#039;s report, and declared themselves ready to engage actively at the summit.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_458">The Minister responsible for international security, who I am pleased to see in his place, was quite right when he said a week before the summit that it

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_460">The whole House should agree with that statement.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_89">&quot;The United Nations must strengthen its policy against non-proliferation; in particular, how to allow nations to develop civil nuclear power but not nuclear weapons.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para35">
<a name="stpa_463">Of course, we had the statement by the head of the UK delegation to the NPT review conference, Ambassador John Freeman, on 5 May, which was also the date of the British general election. Speaking on behalf of the British Government to the diplomats in New York, he said:

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para44">
<a name="stpa_472">This summer on 7 July we had the London suicide bombings, and earlier this evening the House gave a Second Reading to the Terrorism Bill. There is rightly a focus on terrorism. At the same time, we must not lose sight of the fact that a nuclear weapon, even a small one, has the capacity to kill thousands of people. The growth of international terrorism makes the prospect of terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons an increasingly alarming one, and that is surely a reason why Governments should be striving harder for progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para45">
<a name="stpa_473">When I had the good fortune to address the House before the summer recess, I took the opportunity to set out five proposals for progress: the universal adoption of the International Atomic Energy Agency&#039;s additional protocol; incentives for countries to forgo fuel cycle facilities; a fissile material cut-off treaty; entry into force of the comprehensive test ban treaty, which is still not in operation, as my hon. Friend the Minister knows better than I do; and disarmament. Disarmament is one of the three pillars of the NPT, and it is essential that progress is made on the elimination of all nuclear weapons as agreed by the NPT states, including the UK, at the review conference in 2000. That is what we signed up to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para46">
<a name="stpa_474">The current security climate has rightly led to calls for a tougher non-proliferation regime for non-nuclear weapons states. However, while we nuclear weapons states are perceived as disengaged from our side of the NPT deal, there is a danger that our insistence on non-proliferation will not carry adequate credibility with the non-nuclear states. In that context, I gently put it to my hon. Friend that a decision to replace Trident would further weaken the credibility of our case for stronger non-proliferation measures and would be seen as yet more evidence that the countries that had nuclear weapons at the start of the NPT are not prepared to deliver on their side of the bargain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-38_para47">
<a name="stpa_475">It is not contentious to say that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty has made our world a safer place than it otherwise could have been. Equally, however, no one disputes the fact that the NPT regimes desperately need to be strengthened and urgently need to be updated. Will my hon. Friend set out as fully as he can the Government&#039;s view on why things went so badly wrong at the millennium summit as regards nuclear weapons? Will he also set out the work that the

 Does my hon. Friend agree that it is also important that the Government pressurise other countries to sign the NPT, including Israel, which has nuclear weapons but has so far refused even to admit to ownership of them, never mind signing the treaty?
</p>





<p><a name="st_359"><a name="51026-39_spnew1"><b> Dr. Strang: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a fair and valid point. We want all Governments to sign up to the treaty, and having done so to live up to the spirit and letter of it. I take his point absolutely.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_476">I am sure that the Minister is as disappointed as I am, and indeed the whole world is, about the failure to make progress at the millennium summit. The question is: where do we go from here? For most of my life, the dominant international reality was the existence of the cold war. I well remember the build-up of nuclear weapons by the Warsaw pact and NATO. I am just old enough to remember&#151;I was a student at the time&#151;the genuine fear that permeated the people of this country during the Cuban missile crisis. We were very conscious of the continued, remorseless build-up of nuclear weapons on both sides. I remember the deep concern aroused by the deployment of intermediate range nuclear weapons in Europe&#151;the Soviet SS20s and the US Cruise missiles. There was a very real risk that nuclear weapons would be used, starting with the intermediate range nuclear weapons and escalating quickly to the massive intercontinental ballistic missiles. Civilisation as we knew it would have been annihilated. Thankfully, those days are well behind us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_477">The years in which we live now arguably provide a window, when we should be able to make genuine progress to avoid nuclear proliferation, to reduce nuclear stockpiles and the number of countries with nuclear weapons, and, ultimately, to abolish nuclear weapons. In that context, the events of the past few months are deeply regrettable. If the world&#039;s leaders do not effectively grasp the issue and make genuine progress, a future generation, if not this one, could pay a heavy price.

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang) on securing the debate. Before addressing the specific issues that he raised, I thank him for highlighting the continuing value of the non-proliferation and disarmament regime. His excellent analysis shows why the non-proliferation treaty continues to be the cornerstone of United Kingdom counter-proliferation policy. He also demonstrated the regime&#039;s overall success in averting the future that President Kennedy envisaged in 1963. I, too, remember the Cuban crisis. I remember thinking that it was not fair&#151;I had just got into my stride and Aberdare was about to be obliterated. It was not a promising scenario.

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_478">As my right hon. Friend reminded us, it is an important moment to reflect on the significance of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Iran is restarting its nuclear conversion programme, with the threat of restarting the nuclear enrichment programme. There can be only one reason for that. It has nothing to do with civil nuclear power and everything to do with creating a nuclear bomb. As my right hon. Friend said, there are already enough of those around without adding to the number of nations that possess those lethal weapons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_479">That said, the non-proliferation and disarmament regime continues to face genuine and pressing challenges. In response, the Government have consistently sought to work with our international partners to strengthen all three pillars of the treaty. In 2005, the highest-profile, but by no means the only forum for pursuing that effort was the review conference in May. As my right hon. Friend knows, it was thrown off course by procedural wrangling, and, as a result, there was no agreement on substance. As he hinted, a small group of countries at the review conference&#151;the revcon, as it is known&#151;seemed determined from the outset to ensure that was the case. In a multilateral format, which relies on consensus, the tactic can win the day even when the majority of states present seek to achieve genuine advances. That was the case in New York in May.

 I know that the Minister has had a tiring day, so I am grateful to him for giving way. Does not he agree that it would greatly help the non-proliferation cause if Britain did not announce the redevelopment of the Trident submarine system or some replacement for it, but said that we adhered to the NPT and the goal of eventual nuclear disarmament by all states?
</p>





<p><a name="st_362"><a name="51026-39_spnew3"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has been in this place long enough to know that I will not answer that one.

 Come on.

<p><a name="st_364"><a name="51026-39_spnew5"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 I say to him that the Government take the question seriously. Considering what we should do about the continuation and possession of a nuclear deterrent is a serious matter, which we shall tackle seriously. However, in this evening&#039;s debate, I should like to try to answer some of the questions posed by my right hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_480">My right hon. Friend asked whether the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, had edited or altered the form of words that might originally have been agreed for his speech. I am informed that the language of the treaty had been clear for some days, if not weeks, before Kofi Annan made his speech. It was Mr. Kofi Annan, no one else, who altered his speech, and there were no indications that he was under any pressure to do so. As far as I know, that is a very authoritative account of the procedure that occurred at that time, and I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept it. I have met Mr. Annan on several occasions, and he is certainly not someone who can easily be swayed when it comes to saying what he intends to say. He is a fine diplomat who is known for his integrity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_481">While the review conference did not conclude with a substantive final document, there is general agreement 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>26 Oct 2005 : Column 431</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that there was a lot of good, detailed discussion of ways in which the treaty could be strengthened. We hope that these ideas will be taken up actively in other forums. I take my right hon. Friend&#039;s point about the hopes that we had for the millennium summit as the most important of those forums, and I understand his disappointment with the review conference that preceded it and with the failure to agree a form of words.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_482">However, I am trying to answer my right hon. Friend&#039;s most important question, which is: where do we go from here? I would say to him that we must use whatever forum is available to take forward this hugely important problem. He told us that no single problem was more important than this one, and I am sure that we would all agree. How can we imagine a world in which people were trying to live after a nuclear holocaust? There would not be one. This is a problem that we have lived with all our lives, and I want my right hon. Friend to know that we intend to try to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in whatever way we can, using whatever venue we can to pursue that aim.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_483">There were proposals at the review conference on measures to discourage withdrawal from the treaty. These drew widespread support, including from the European Union. The EU also played its part in setting out a progressive non-proliferation agenda through its agreement on and promotion of a forward-leaning common position on the non-proliferation treaty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_484">Although our primary focus from a disarmament and non-proliferation perspective this year was, rightly, the NPT review conference, the disappointing outcome gave us added incentive to make strenuous efforts to remedy this at the UN world summit in September. That was why my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary agreed to take part in the initiative, promoted by his then Norwegian colleague, designed to generate broad support for a forward-looking non-proliferation agenda.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_485">Indeed, in the second week of the UN conference, I attended a meeting of the Norwegian group, and a great deal of passion was generated in the attempts of all the countries represented there to break through the dam of unwillingness to make progress on the language of the non-proliferation statement. I agree with my right hon. Friend that it was a great shame that we were unable to make progress there, despite the strength of that group. During our presidency of the European Union, we have also worked hard to secure European support for strong and meaningful commitments on non-proliferation and disarmament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_486">Although it was again disappointing that the summit was unable to agree on commitments to disarmament and non-proliferation, I cannot entirely concur with my right hon. Friend&#039;s assessment that the summit was therefore a failure. The Norwegian initiative, in which we participated, obtained the support of more than 80 countries&#151;more than was achieved by any other means. So I hope that my right hon. Friend does not feel entirely gloomy about this. There is a great feeling that we can take this issue forward. He will know, as I do, that there is a great deal of work to be done, especially with the non-aligned members, some of whom were very intransigent on the question of the language. There is room there to celebrate success for the cause of nuclear non-proliferation.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_487">As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has commented, if the reforms and commitments agreed at the summit are fully implemented, it will represent a major advance for the UN and the international community. The lack of an outcome on non-proliferation, regrettable though it is, should not detract from those real gains. Achieving full agreement on all the reforms put forward was always going to be very difficult. Rather than posturing getting in the way of results, that reflected the ambitious agenda and divergence of views between UN member states on many issues. The UK, in our presidency of the EU, worked to achieve the most extensive set of reforms possible, and we will continue to do so. Sadly, however, despite hard work by the UK in both its national and EU presidency capacities, pre-summit negotiations on non-proliferation issues proved very difficult.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_488">As my right hon. Friend said, that outcome was certainly a disappointment. But we should not be misled into believing that it heralds the collapse of the NPT&#151;I do not believe that my right hon. Friend believes that, and I certainly do not. Nor does it mean the collapse of the non-proliferation regime more widely. We believe that the challenges to the regime have served to bolster support for it rather than to undermine it. We share that commitment with the overwhelming majority of states and we will continue to use all available international forums to build consensus to strengthen the regime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_489">My right hon. Friend drew our attention to a number of valuable initiatives in this regard, many of which the UK wholeheartedly supports. For example, we are taking every opportunity to encourage all states to adopt the International Atomic Energy Agency&#039;s additional protocol, and are actively working with others to formulate appropriate incentives for countries to forgo fuel cycle facilities. Both have formed part of the activity of the G8 during the United Kingdom&#039;s presidency. And while we fully recognise the right of states that are in compliance with their obligations under the NPT to use and benefit from nuclear technology, as set out in article 4, it is clear that the nuclear fuel cycle presents particularly acute proliferation risks, which is why we have been promoting controls on the transfer of sensitive technology to be implemented in an objective and non-discriminatory manner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para14">
<a name="stpa_490">There are some very interesting proposals for fuel supply assurances, to establish either &quot;real&quot; or &quot;virtual&quot; banks of nuclear fuel, with some element of international involvement. I know that my right hon. Friend is very interested in some of those possibilities. It is far from straightforward, however, as one can see from the fact that Governments and experts have been trying to find a solution to this for some years. A number of complicated technical and political issues remain to be resolved, but I believe that there is now increasing international political will to reach an agreement on the way forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51026-39_para15">
<a name="stpa_491">The IAEA general conference last month demonstrated a particularly good spirit of co-operation and determination among states to strengthen non-proliferation and address other issues such as the peaceful use of nuclear technology.
