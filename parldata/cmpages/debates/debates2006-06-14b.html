 The hon. Gentleman is right to point to the progress that Russia has made. He will remember that as recently as 1999, when Russia was going through a period of financial crisis, substantial numbers&#151;almost 40 per cent. of the population&#151;were living in real poverty. Since that time, the number living in poverty has declined by almost half. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the need to divert resources to the very poorest countries is well made, and that is one of the reasons why we have taken a decision to close our programme next year. We will remain engaged in a small way in Russia, because there continue to be particular development challenges, not least the issues of HIV/AIDS, but we are increasingly directing more of our resources to the very poorest countries.</p>

 Russia, alongside other eastern European countries such as Ukraine, has significant and escalating HIV and TB epidemics and the fastest growing coterminous infection rate in the world. The G8 summit in St. Petersburg must address infectious diseases, especially the challenging multi-drug-resistant TB. Considering DFID&#146;s strategy towards middle income countries and the Duma&#146;s decision to restrict the operations of foreign non-governmental organisations, how does DFID intend to halt and reverse the incidence of infectious diseases?

 The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight both the rising prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Russia and more generally in central and eastern Europe. The adult prevalence rate is more than 1 per cent. in Russia. Although the epidemic is currently concentrated among high-risk groups, particularly injecting drug users, there are worrying signs that it is spreading into the more general population. We have over the past two years been closely collaborating with UNAIDS. We have a programme of &#163;1 million over this two-year period.

the basis for a long-term solution to the crisis, and there appears to have been a reduction in the number of clashes between the Government of Sudan and the rebels since it was signed. However, attacks by the Arab militias continue and their disarmament, as required by the DPA, is a matter of urgency. We continue to press the Government to live up to their commitments.</p>

 The Secretary of State is right to be deeply concerned about the situation in Darfur, particularly as it appears to be spreading into Chad. How does his work fit comfortably with the previous Foreign Secretary&#146;s comment that we have a responsibility to protect people from both massacres and human rights abuses, because that clearly is not happening at the moment in those two tragic countries? </p>

 I accept the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point entirely. The first thing that we are doing is providing humanitarian assistance, because that is a practical way in which we can help people to stay alive. Britain and the international community have played an honourable part in that respect, but as he will know, the only solution is a political solution that brings an end to the fighting. That is why the priorities now are, first, to enable the people of Darfur to understand what is in the Darfur peace agreement&#151;the African Union is taking the lead on that, with some support from us&#151;and, secondly, to encourage Minni Minnawi, who leads the one movement that has signed the agreement, to implement that commitment and fulfil the responsibilities that he has taken on. Thirdly, we shall continue to put pressure on the Government of Sudan to prepare their plan for the disarmament of the Janjaweed. Finally, and in my view most important of all, we shall support the United Nations and the African Union, which are at one in wanting the UN mission to take over from AMIS&#151;the African Union mission in Sudan&#151;as quickly as possible. That is why the arrival last week of the joint AU/UN planning mission was so significant. However, we shall still have some work to do to persuade the Government of Sudan to accept that mission, which I believe is desperately needed.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s question goes to the heart of the discussions with the Government of Sudan, because they are expressing considerable concern about the prospect of that mission having a chapter 7 mandate. Part of the purpose of the planning mission is to provide an answer to that question, so that the Security Council can take a decision. Based on my experience and the visits that I have paid to Darfur on a number of occasions, I think that the UN mission will have to help both to oversee the ceasefire and to ensure that civilians are protected if people do not honour the obligations that they have entered into. Ultimately, the aim must be to protect people from continuing to be attacked.</p>

That links to the question asked by the right hon. Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay), because it shows that we are serious about calling to account the people who have committed those crimes. At the same time, we continue to support the UN in preparing for the mission so that people can be protected and the agreement enforced, because that is the only way in which people will be able to go home.</p>

investigations continue. Secondly, we strongly supported the establishment of the sanctions committee which, however, did not receive the wholehearted support of every member of the Security Council so, regrettably, it took some time. Sanctions have been imposed on four individuals who were named and investigated. We continue to press for action&#151;I know that the African Union will do the same&#151;if individuals obstruct the implementation of the peace agreement. It is one thing to say that one is not prepared to sign, but it is another to obstruct the implementation of an agreement that others are prepared to sign. We should therefore not be reluctant to take strong action against individuals who impede the only hope that the people of Darfur have of a better life.</p>

 I accept the fact that the conflict over the border with Chad makes an already difficult and complex conflict even more challenging. The rebel movement in Chad is trying to depose President D&#233;by who, in turn, has accused the Sudanese Government of supporting those efforts. In fairness to the British Government, the UK was one of the first countries to recognise that a UN force was needed, not least because the African Union mission which did a sterling job in difficult circumstances, as the hon. Gentleman knows because he has had a chance to see for himself, simply does not have the number of troops, the capacity or the funding that it needs. That is why we strongly advocated the deployment of a UN force, and why we pressed hard for a planning mission in Khartoum. We are resolute in pressing the Sudanese Government to allow that force to come in, because in my view and, I am sure, in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s, it is desperately needed.</p>

 The Secretary of State will be aware that only a few weeks ago the UN said that it had to halve food rations to people who depended on food aid in Darfur. Can he give us an assessment of the situation to show that the food aid funding crisis has been turned around?

 On the first point made by the hon. Lady, the World Programme had to halve rations in May because of the funding shortfall. Last week, I met Jim Morris, the head of the World Food Programme, who told me that from the beginning of June the ration has increased to 84 per cent., because additional food has arrived from the USA and because the Sudanese Government has been able to make a contribution. Unfortunately, the cut in the ration coincided with the agreement in Abuja, so some people may have drawn the wrong conclusions. Overall, the UN work plan in Sudan for 2006 is about 40 per cent. funded. The UK, as the hon. Lady will know, is one of the countries that will give slightly more this year, but that is not the case for all the other donors. But the hon.

 There is no general food-related humanitarian crisis in Nepal, but the World Food Programme has recently launched an emergency programme in 10 of the country&#146;s 75 districts after poor winter rains led to local food shortages. The conflict has, however, created a human rights crisis, with abuses being committed by both security forces and the Maoists, and it has forced thousands of people to leave their homes. The recent ceasefire should lead to an improvement.</p>

 As my hon. Friend knows, there has been considerable progress following the handing back of political power to the parties in April. A ceasefire has been agreed between the Government and the Maoists. Negotiation teams have been appointed and a number of confidence-building measures have been implemented, including the release of prisoners, the lifting of curfews and greater ease of movement around the country. Now we need effective monitoring of the ceasefire and agreement on the timing and conditions for the Maoists to join the Government and on the arrangements for a constituent assembly. The UK is currently looking at how we can provide technical assistance, support for the elections to a constituent assembly and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes.</p>

 The Central Emergency Response Fund was launched on 9 March 2006. It is now helping UN humanitarian agencies to respond immediately to sudden disasters and to increase activity in underfunded emergencies. So far, CERF has committed $92 million to a number of humanitarian crises, the largest being the Horn of Africa, Darfur and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In total, 43 donors have contributed $262 million, and the UK has been the largest contributor.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. Having established the fund, we will need it every year, because disasters strike every year. At a Red Cross event last week, I announced that over the next three years Britain will contribute &#163;40 million, &#163;40 million and &#163;40 million&#151;&#163;120 million over three years.

 Although I agree with the Secretary of State that the fund is welcome and important, we need more effective co-ordination.

 The hon. Gentleman has raised an extremely important point. In truth, about 60 per cent. of the funding that comes through the UN system for humanitarian relief ends up in the hands of NGOs, which do the work on the ground. Jan Egeland is conscious that he should be able to take quick decisions on spending money from CERF. I praise him and his team for their work, because such money gets down to NGOs, which deliver increasing amounts of humanitarian assistance when crises strike. I hope that we have got the right mechanisms in place to ensure that there is proper debate and dialogue between the NGO community and the UN system, because we are all in it together in trying to provide assistance when crises strike.</p>

 I can indeed offer the hon. Gentleman that assurance. That is precisely why we give the assistance.

In those circumstances, the world demonstrated its capacity to respond quickly to give very practical help&#151;shelter, blankets, bedding, medical supplies, water, sanitation and food&#151;because that is what people need when they have lost everything.</p>

 I entirely understand why my hon. Friend raises this. It is very important to say that although the full impact recommendations will not come in until later, the data-sharing arrangements, including the sharing of intelligence, will come in next year. We will certainly look at how we can speed up the recommendations. However, as my hon. Friend rightly says, this is going to be difficult and complicated. It requires a lot of changes, not only in police practice but elsewhere, and we have to ensure that we get the delivery of this programme right. I ask him to bear in mind that, as I say, from the end of next year we should have the main data-sharing arrangements in place. If we can possibly speed that up&#151;if necessary, we are perfectly happy to reconvene the inquiry team if that helps, but at the moment we do not think that it would&#151;then we will of course do so.   <br>

 Since the right hon.

Of the 53 prisoners, the vast bulk were given automatic life sentences under the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997&#151;before we came to office. The automatic life sentences were given for second offences. We changed the law in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to allow indeterminate sentences to be given. Since April 2005, when the Act came into effect, there have been 1,000 of those sentences.

The shadow Leader of the House then attacked us for not introducing this measure quickly enough. The reason we are unable to introduce it quickly is that the Conservatives insisted on a longer consultation period, which prevented us from doing that.

As for the rest of the Tory attack, the fact is that, on all these pieces of legislation, they have either voted against them, dismissed them as gimmicks or refused to support them and tried to dilute them. However, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will be bringing forward further measures, and we will then have the chance to see whether the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are prepared to back up their tough talk by changing the habits of opposition and actually voting for the legislation that does the job.</p>

 I know that the Prime Minister and the whole House will sympathise with the extreme distress and trauma caused to the three-year-old child who was abducted and sexually abused in Cardiff, and with the distress caused to her family, who are my constituents in Cardiff, North. I know that my right hon. Friend will not want to comment on the individual case, but will he do his best to press the Sentencing Guidelines Council to ensure that, following the review that it is undertaking, there will no longer be an automatic reduction in sentence in return for a guilty plea in the cases of the most serious crimes and the most dangerous offenders?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and that is exactly why, with indeterminate sentences, people are not able to get parole automatically, as they used to. Under the 2003 Act, the indeterminate sentence provisions were extended to a schedule of no fewer than 66 different offences. Therefore, even in circumstances where people are considered for parole, there is no automatic right to it. I think that that entirely meets her point. Furthermore, it is important to realise that, partly as a result of the work of the Sentencing Guidelines Council, but also as a result of what has happened over the past few years, not only has the number of prison places increased but sentences are longer and people are serving longer sentences. In relation to sexual offences in particular, the law has been strengthened considerably. The powers are there, and I hope that the courts use them to the fullest extent possible.</p>

 I certainly can. First, energy prices are rising the entire time, which is why the whole issue of nuclear energy is back on the agenda not just of this country but of many other countries around the world. I think that 50 to 60 different nuclear power stations are being built this year, including the first in Europe for a long time. Secondly, our anxiety about climate change and the need to find clean sources of energy is increasing. Thirdly, when we consider our self-sufficiency in energy, we find that we are about 80 to 90 per cent. sufficient in oil and gas. Over the next 15 to 20 years, that will reverse, and we will have to import. Therefore, there are reasons of security of supply, rising energy costs and climate change. I am not saying that nuclear is the only answer&#151;of course it is not. There are renewables, energy efficiency and everything else. However, I still think that nuclear must be at least part of the debate and argument if we are to make sure that our energy needs are properly and cleanly met for the future. That answers the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s question.</p>

 Last weekend, I was contacted by a constituent, Mrs. Karen Stupart, who tragically lost her husband John in a building site accident over 10 years ago. Mrs. Stupart was subsequently awarded more than &#163;250,000 of damages through the courts, but she and her family have yet to receive one penny of that money. Her late husband&#146;s former employers declared themselves bankrupt immediately after the award was made, and their insurers, Lombard, exploited a legal technicality to avoid making a payment. This Government can be justifiably proud of setting up the Pension Protection Fund to protect the pensions of workers whose employers go bust. Cannot we now consider extending that protection to compensatory payments made in cases of workplace negligence? Will the Prime Minister meet me to discuss the extremely distressing circumstances of this case?</p>

He will know that employment tribunal awards, if unpaid, are enforced through the civil courts. The forthcoming Courts and Tribunals Bill, which we intend to publish in draft during this Parliament, will set out proposals for the reform of the current system of enforcement. At the moment, as he rightly points out, there is real anxiety that the system of enforcement does not adequately meet the needs of claimants. Publishing the Bill in draft will give us an opportunity to debate the issue and to see how we strengthen the law. I look forward to discussing the issue with him.</p>

It is also important, however, to recognise that, even with the financial situation in the national health service, there is a huge amount of additional money going in, which has to be used by trusts in the most effective and efficient way possible.

It is all very well for the right hon.

my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is very concerned about the backlog in answering parliamentary questions and is working with his ministerial team to ensure that it is dealt with as quickly as possible. However, I must tell the House that the number of parliamentary questions that the Home Office receives has shot up in recent weeks. That is understandable, given the public concern, but although it is important that hon. Members&#146; questions are answered in a timely way, the House will know that it is also important that they are answered accurately and comprehensively. I assure you, Mr. Speaker, and the House, that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and all his Ministers are fully seized of the issue.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="60614-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="06061448000644"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for the holding of referendums about methods of election to the House of Commons and to local authorities; to enable a specified number of electors to require the holding of such a referendum; to require the Electoral Commission to establish a Citizens&#146; Assembly to perform functions in relation to referendums; to provide for the adoption by a local authority of a different method of election; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para0"><a name="06061448000150">The Bill responds to widespread concern about public confidence in, and the legitimacy of, our democratic processes. It is presented in the context of declining participation in national and local elections, and growing concern about disengagement and alienation from the political process, especially among young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para1"><a name="06061448000151">In brief, the Bill proposes the mechanism of a referendum to decide on the merits of different voting systems for both parliamentary and municipal elections. For general elections, the mechanism for that would be a petition containing the signatures of at least 5 per cent. of the relevant electorate. For local elections, the mechanism would be either 5 per cent. of the relevant electorate, or a simple resolution of the local authority. In both cases, the question in the referendum would provide a simple choice between the election system in force and one of the five alternative systems specified in the Bill. The decision on which of the alternatives should be included in the question for a national referendum would be the responsibility of the Electoral Commission after it had taken the advice of a citizens assembly, which would comprise a randomly selected group of individual electors. The assembly would have the prime function of considering and reporting on the merits of the different systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para2"><a name="06061448000152">As we approach the 175th anniversary of the Great Reform Act of 1832, our democracy is in need of further great reform. Although I recognise that the voting system is only one aspect of our democratic machinery, it nevertheless has a crucial influence on the general perception of the credibility of government at all levels. It can affect the willingness of people to participate in elections and to put themselves forward for elections. It is vital that the public have confidence that all their votes can help to make a difference and that those who stand for election broadly reflect the composition of the population as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para3"><a name="06061448000153">I stress that the Bill does not simply reopen the debate about majoritarian and proportional systems of voting, and nor is it designed simply to introduce proportional representation by the back door. As the promoter of the Bill, it is my view that no single electoral system is perfect. Different systems have different strengths and weaknesses, so a healthy democracy needs a mix of systems to provide the right blend of checks and balances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para4"><a name="06061448000154">The Bill expresses no preference as between different voting systems.

elect their representatives. However, the Bill does require that the advocates of different voting systems state their case positively and win their argument, rather than maintaining the status quo through inertia or misinformation. Although the Bill expresses no preference between different systems, the mechanism of the referendum would require the advocates of all systems actively to engage ordinary people in the merits of their case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para5"><a name="06061448000155">The basic statistics on the level of democratic participation in the United Kingdom are not encouraging. The 2005 general election delivered a Government with a healthy majority of 66, built on the votes of a mere 35 per cent. of the electorate&#151;the lowest share of the vote for any governing party since 1918. With a turnout of only 61 per cent., the 35 per cent. share of the vote delivered 55 per cent. of the seats, but with the active support of barely one in five of the total of those eligible to vote. Of the world&#146;s democracies, only Turkey has a majority Government elected with a lower share of the vote. In the European Union, only the coalition Governments of Estonia and Lithuania were elected with a lower share of the vote. The turnout in last year&#146;s general election was the second lowest since 1918, and with the exception of elections in the five former Soviet bloc countries, last year&#146;s general election had the lowest turnout of all recent parliamentary elections in the European Union. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para6"><a name="06061448000156">I do not argue that the current electoral system is solely responsible for those depressing statistics. However, we can no longer ignore the long-term consequences of the declining enthusiasm for the ballot box. With the exception of France, Britain is the only country in the EU to use first past the post for parliamentary elections, and almost all the world&#146;s most recently established democracies have opted for a system with a strong proportional element. The House has notably chosen to avoid the use of pure first past the post in the voting systems for the devolved assemblies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para7"><a name="06061448000157">That brings me to the question of local democracy. There will be those who say that by allowing for the possibility of different electoral systems in neighbouring local authorities, the Bill would cause confusion and introduce further complexity&#151;but we have already accepted the principle of variability in local democratic procedures. The Greater London assembly, for example, has an electoral system different from that for individual London boroughs, and local authorities that have adopted the system of directly elected mayors have already adopted systems of political accountability different from those of authorities that have retained a leader and cabinet system. The Bill provides for exactly the same mechanism&#151;a petition bearing the signatures of at least 5 per cent. of the electorate&#151;as the House has already agreed for the establishment of directly elected mayors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para8"><a name="06061448000158">I do not argue that the system of elected mayors has brought about an immediate transformation of local government, although I think that there are many examples of very successful elected mayors, but I do say that if the House has already agreed that it is acceptable for neighbouring local authorities to have different systems of political accountability, it must follow that it is equally acceptable for them to have  <br>

different electoral systems. Similarly, if the House has accepted the use of the referendum as an appropriate means of enabling voters to choose the structure of their council&#146;s political leadership, it must follow that a referendum is an equally appropriate means of enabling voters to determine how their local political leaders should be elected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para9"><a name="06061448000159">That brings me to the heart of the Bill. By devolving power over such decisions away from the political caucus to the individual citizen, and away from the Westminster village to the real villages, towns and cities of the United Kingdom in which 60 million people live, the Bill would help to reinvigorate a debate about the nature of political representation that has been dormant for far too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para10"><a name="06061448000160">The Bill requires the Electoral Commission to establish a citizens assembly&#151;a randomly selected group of citizens who would take on the task of considering in some detail the merits of different voting systems, and then making recommendations to the Electoral Commission on the forming of the question in the referendum. By engaging the public in such a process, we would open up the debate much more directly than would be the case if the arguments were restricted to the more conventional forms of parliamentary procedures and progressed through the use of national commissions of inquiry composed entirely of the great and the good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para11"><a name="06061448000161">As the Bill expresses no preference for any single electoral system but simply requires that people should be able to choose directly the system under which they wish to be governed, it paves the way for a great national debate, or an extensive series of local debates, about the future of our democracy, in which ordinary people would be fully involved. Of course, it should also be possible for those on either side of the debate on electoral reform, together with those who are genuinely undecided or who support hybrid systems, to support the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para12"><a name="06061448000162">To conclude, the Bill proposes the use of a referendum to consider alternative systems of voting for local and parliamentary elections. It requires the signatures of at least 5 per cent. of the relevant electorate to trigger the referendum. The referendum question would offer a simple choice between the current system and one alternative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para13"><a name="06061448000163">The Bill is supported by a number of well established organisations, which have come together as the electoral choice steering committee. Its members include the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform, Charter88, the New Politics Network and the Electoral Reform Society. I am grateful to the electoral choice steering committee for its assistance in promoting the Bill. Whatever the Bill&#146;s future, the issue of electoral choice will return again and again until the argument for a referendum is finally won. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

 As far as I can see, this Bill would implement a hitherto forgotten part of the Government&#146;s 1997 programme. It is important to start by looking back at why the proposal for a referendum on electoral reform was included. It is because in the run-up to the 1997 general election, the  <br>

Prime Minister did not think that he would win sufficient seats in the House to form a majority. He therefore did a deal with the then leader of the Liberal Democrats, Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon, which provided for the Prime Minister to introduce a referendum if Lord Ashdown&#146;s party supported the proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para14"><a name="06061448000165">However, what the Prime Minister did not say at the time&#151;although I am sure that it what he would have said&#151;is that it is one thing to bring in a referendum, and another to ensure that it is carried with the support of the Labour party. It is my belief that Labour Back Benchers and many Labour voters up and down the country, in common with many on the Conservative Benches, would have voted against such a referendum, and Lord Ashdown would have been stymied. The Prime Minister was quite content with that, so when he had a majority, he did not introduce legislation of this kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para15"><a name="06061448000166">Why is the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) now introducing this Bill? Is it because he and his hon. Friends believe something that they did not believe seven or eight years ago? Is it because they believe something that they have been unable to implement over the lifetime of two and a half Labour Governments? Is it because they believe that in a year or two they will no longer command a majority in the House, and are grasping at whatever straw is available to amend or fiddle the electoral system to their advantage, as some of their colleagues have done before? Why are Labour Back Benchers becoming interested in electoral reform again?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para16"><a name="06061448000167">The hon. Gentleman says&#151;and I believe him&#151;that he is concerned about declining levels of participation in our democracy. I do not believe that those declining levels can be remedied by structural fiddling of this kind. What is wrong with our democracy is not whether people turn out when they have the opportunity to do so, but the incapacity of Members on both sides of the House to engage the electors sufficiently to make them believe that voting can make a difference. What matters is not how one votes, but whether one can vote for a party that will make a difference. It is fair to acknowledge that at the last election, the public did not believe that the Conservative party could form a majority, so in many parts of the country they saw no point in turning out to support us. On the other hand, they saw no point in turning out in elections to defend the Labour party either, because in many constituencies the Labour party was unassailable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para17"><a name="06061448000168">It is not structural change that will engage people in politics, but the belief that by such engagement they can change the country for the better. I am confident that by the time we get to the next general election, the belief that voting can change the country for the better will be much wider. The hon. Member for Bury, North complains about the lowest turnout in the western world, but the current electoral system did not lead to that, and when a real choice is put before the British people and an opportunity presented to vote for change, the turnout will certainly be high enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para18"><a name="06061448000169">The hon. Gentlemen says that democracy is in need of greater reform, and I agree with him.

a system of committees, we now have a system of elective dictatorship&#151;but I did not see the hon. Gentleman vote against that. I agree with referendums and I think that they are a good idea, but I do not see why they should be confined to votes on issues that the Government and their supporters believe people should be allowed to vote on. People should be entitled to choose which issues to vote on for themselves. Perhaps they should have an opportunity to bring forward propositions of their own&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Yes, propositions to protect grammar schools, or propositions on sentencing, capital punishment and other issues that really engage with this country&#146;s electors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para19"><a name="06061448000170">The hon. Member for Bury, North suggested bringing forward five alternative systems of voting, which are specified in the Bill, but we are not to give people the opportunity to choose a system of democracy for themselves. Rather, they are to be handed down a system of democracy from the very place that the hon. Gentleman describes as the Westminster village, from which he says he is going to take away these powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para20"><a name="06061448000171">The hon. Gentleman says that people will be able to adopt a system of democracy appropriate to their area, but I must tell him, in all candour, that politicians in those areas would&#151;as the Government did in their Bills for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland&#151;adopt the electoral system that they believed would lead to the outcome that they desired. That, I am afraid, will be the consequence of introducing a range of different electoral systems in different countries. The proportional system in Northern Ireland has merely spread power to the extremities in politics, rather than give a greater voice to the men of good sense and moderation, like ourselves, in the middle. I cannot see how introducing a system&#151;either by the front door or by the back door&#151;that allows politicians to pick and choose the electoral system that will keep them in power can be good for democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="60614-0004.htm_para21"><a name="06061448000172">Finally, the hon. Gentleman suggested giving greater responsibility to the Electoral Commission&#151;as if it did not have enough to do already. For example, it is examining the boundary review system to ensure that we do not start with unfair boundaries and end up with unfair boundaries. As if the Electoral Commission could not be doing more to look into votes for members of the armed forces, or as if it did not have enough to worry about in respect of impersonation and postal votes! The Electoral Commission consumes a huge amount of money and it does not require additional responsibilities, but instead should focus on its current responsibilities.</p>

Gentleman is convinced that his Bill will take power away from the Westminster village into towns and villages up and down the country. I wish that that were true. He believes that ordinary people in their pubs and clubs spend their time discussing the electoral system by which their local authorities are elected&#151;but he must live in a world very different from that of the Isle of Wight. In my constituency, very little time is spent discussing the electoral system. The Bill   <br>

 Tomorrow and on Friday, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and I will represent the United Kingdom at the European Council in Brussels. We expect discussions to focus on the constitutional treaty, enlargement and Hampton Court follow-up, as well, of course, as current world problems. This afternoon, the House has its customary opportunity to debate the Government&#146;s priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="60614-0005.htm_para1"><a name="06061448000427">It is now a year since two founding member states of the European Union, France and the Netherlands, rejected the draft treaty establishing a constitution for Europe. Out of those two decisions and the intense debate that they provoked came a very clear message: the European Union needed to reconnect more closely with the people of Europe. They were wary of a European Union that seemed to set its own direction with minimal reference to what they actually wanted out of it, or what was relevant to and would improve their daily lives. That may be an unjust perception, but it was clearly a strong one. Citizens were looking for an effective Europe: one that helped member states to overcome problems together and by so doing brought concrete benefits to their citizens on the things that mattered to them&#151;in short, a Europe that was part of the solution, not part of the problem. That is the kind of Europe towards which this Government are working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="60614-0005.htm_para2"><a name="06061448000428">Let me emphasise one point. An effective Europe is exactly that. I do not mean automatically less Europe, whatever that means. I do not mean a weaker Europe and I certainly do not mean a Europe in which the British Government fail seriously to engage, and in consequence fail to advance or defend Britain&#146;s interests. This Government believe, as I do, that the best interests of the British people are served by this country being a strong member of a confident, effective, outward-looking European Union&#151;one that delivers security and prosperity to its citizens. We are committed to working with our European partners to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="60614-0005.htm_para3"><a name="06061448000429">On that point, I have to say to the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) that it is far from clear to me that withdrawal from one of the major political groupings in the European Union will be of assistance in fighting Britain&#146;s corner. I should say at once that I have every sympathy for him in the predicament in which he finds himself. When he was leader of the Conservative party, he sensibly chose to keep his party within the European People&#146;s party. Now he has been lumbered with a foolish pledge made by his leader in a moment of desperation during the recent leadership contest, and I understand that he has been forced to meet some pretty unsavoury characters in his attempts to cobble together a new coalition. Indeed, one of his own MEPs called them</p>

clarion calls to save the pound and to prevent Britain from becoming a foreign land is now regarded as a moderate in his party on these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="60614-0005.htm_para5"><a name="06061448000431">Tomorrow&#146;s is the first European Council that I shall attend, but it is only the latest development in a process of sustained engagement with the Union&#146;s institutions. In negotiations both within Europe and at international level, I have seen just how great a difference our engagement in and with the EU can make. We want and need to be an influential part of that effective European Union. Many of the challenges we face as a country can be met only if we work together with our European partners.</p>

<p><a name="st_o106"><a name="06061448000432"><a name="60614-0005.htm_spnew0"><a name="06061448001030"><b>Mr. Michael Ancram (Devizes) (Con):</b>
 The right hon. Lady started by saying that the discussions over the next two days would be about, among other things, the constitutional treaty. If my memory serves me correctly, when the constitutional treaty was signed, we were told that if it did not pass within two years, it would fall. What is the position now?</p>

<p><a name="st_o107"><a name="06061448000433"><a name="60614-0005.htm_spnew1"><a name="06061448001031"><b>Margaret Beckett:</b>
 I do not recall hearing that, but no doubt my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe will deal with that when he winds up the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="60614-0005.htm_para6"><a name="06061448000434">Let me give one classic example of problems that, by their very nature, transcend national boundaries: environmental issues, not least climate change. Many of the substantial environmental improvements that we in the UK have seen in recent years&#151;cleaner air and cleaner water&#151;have been driven by regulation agreed at EU level and can be said to be &#147;due&#148; to the EU. There can be little doubt that climate change, the greatest long-term threat facing the world, is a trans-boundary problem. Climate change will have a direct impact on the lives of people in this country and across the EU, and people across Europe are demanding that their Governments take action. However, neither the UK nor any other member state can hope to succeed through unilateral action. Carbon emissions anywhere affect the climate everywhere, and international consensus and action within and beyond the borders of the EU are imperative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="60614-0005.htm_para7"><a name="06061448000435">It is because, under the present Government, the UK&#146;s voice is recognised and respected within Europe that we have been at the forefront of European Union efforts to tackle climate change. Those efforts have led to concerted action among the 25 member states to reduce their own carbon emissions. There is still much more to do, but what we have already achieved would have been unthinkable if we had needed to rely solely on a network of bilateral agreements.</p>

<p><a name="st_o108"><a name="06061448000436"><a name="60614-0005.htm_spnew2"><a name="06061448001032"><b>Mr. Eric Illsley (Barnsley, Central) (Lab):</b>
 As my right hon. Friend has pointed out, many EU countries have implemented measures to combat climate change, often to the detriment of their domestic industries. By far the two greatest contributors to global warming and climate change are the United States of America and China. Does she envisage the EU taking a much more robust position to persuade those two countries to reduce their emissions?</p>

whole House will recall the tremendous efforts made by the Prime Minister last year, particularly during our G8 presidency, to create an atmosphere in which the US could agree to do as they did in Montreal and take forward the discussions&#151;something that it had been resisting until then. Similarly, my hon. Friend will recall that, as well as the G8, we invited to Gleneagles what are known as the &#147;plus five&#148; countries&#151;five major energy users now and in the future and consequently five countries that may have substantial emissions&#151;and that we successfully drew them into the discussions. Both the United States and China are participants in the Gleneagles follow-up dialogue, of which the next meeting will be held in Mexico this autumn.</p>

 Does not the Foreign Secretary destroy her own argument when she talks about the G8 and the &#147;plus five&#148; countries? It has nothing to do with the EU.</p>

 No. The G8 is a grouping in which the United States is a participant and China was invited to the meeting. However, one of the reasons why we were able to get that agreement at the G8 is the strength of the ties between the European members of that body.</p>

In five years of climate change negotiations, culminating in Montreal, I have seen it demonstrated time and again that the EU as a group plays a pivotal role in brokering agreement. We could not play that role or reach agreements such as the one reached in Montreal if Europe did not speak with a single voice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="60614-0005.htm_para9"><a name="06061448000443">The forthcoming European Council should adopt the EU&#146;s revised sustainable development strategy. For the first time, we shall have a single, coherent and, I hope, accessible strategy that brings together all the Community&#146;s internal and external objectives in that field. Two of the seven objectives within that strategy relate to climate change and clean energy. On climate change in particular, we want the European Council to make a clear statement on the need for a global consensus on the scale of the action that must be taken if we are to avoid dangerous climate change, including a long-term stabilisation goal and a truly global debate. That debate cannot only be between Governments; it must include business, investors, non-governmental organisations and consumers.</p>

 I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was listening other than to the thread of the ideas that he has honourably pursued for a long time. I pointed out that a huge proportion&#151;I have never worked out a precise figure&#151;of the environmental improvements that have been made in this country in recent years and which are rightly welcomed on both sides of the House have come directly as a result of European regulations, which I know he hates. He refers to burdens on business, but some of the changes that are beneficial to the public, not least in terms of the impact on their health, are regarded by some people in the business community as burdens because they regard all regulation as a burden. One of the reasons why the Government made better regulation a theme of our EU presidency is that there is such a thing as beneficial regulation&#151;even, dare I say, if it comes from Europe.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. He may know that, during our presidency last year, we presided over the EU-China summit and reached an agreement with China that the UK, through the EU, would help to pilot a clean-coal power station. China, India and the United States have substantial coal reserves that they are bound to use, particularly as development is the highest priority for China and India. There can be few more beneficial things both for development and for the cause of climate change than developing the capacity for clean-coal power</p>

Since the rejection of the constitutional treaty last summer, Europe has been in a period of reflection. Throughout that time, the United Kingdom&#146;s position has been consistent and clear. An effective Europe should focus on the things that matter to its citizens: creating jobs, cutting crime, tackling terrorism and protecting the environment. Those are the questions that face the European Union, and we strongly believe that the answer will not be found in more institutional wrangling which, to the outside observer, is at best opaque and at worst self-indulgent.</p>

That was the agenda we took forward, and which Europe agreed, at the informal summit at Hampton Court. It is the direction in which we will urge our European partners to continue at tomorrow&#146;s council. In his statement to the House on 31 January 2006, my right hon.

 My right hon. Friend has not touched on the important collective role that the European Union plays in negotiations in the World Trade Organisation. Does she believe, like me, that Europe&#146;s position in that body is not facilitated by the protectionist stance that has emerged in some EU states and by our historical commitment to agricultural protectionism and intervention?</p>

 Both within Europe and outside, there are worrying signs of the growth of protectionism. I entirely share my hon. Friend&#146;s view that that is harmful to the UK and to the world community, so it must be resisted in agriculture and in other fields. He may know that on Monday, the General Affairs and External Relations Council considered a report by the Trade Commissioner, who said that the world community accepts that there is scope for each group to move its position. They must do so if we are to achieve a Doha round agreement. He clearly does not despair of the prospects for such an agreement, and we all hope that he is right.</p>

Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) is needed in the agriculture debate. Given that the EU has 25 members, and may have 27 members next year, we can move forward in some areas without the need for legislation, as that would help the transparency and efficiency of the EU. If we work with our colleagues on, for example, science and the proposed university, we could advance the agenda without the need for a constitution.</p>

 Perhaps my hon. Friend followed those debates more closely than I did before I took up my responsibilities but, with respect, I do not remember anyone making that point. There is a world of difference between trying to find a way to take forward bits of the constitution in the original package and considering measures that do not rely on a new treaty and legal basis. Inevitably, because the constitution drew together different strands and ideas that were discussed at the time, some issues in the constitutional treaty do not require a new legal basis, so it would be open to the European Union to consider them on the basis of existing treaties. A decision has not been made or even discussed about whether or not Europe should embark on the process. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) asked, quite reasonably, whether any thinking is taking place. It is, but we are not at the stage of making proposals, let alone decisions.</p>

 May I welcome the Foreign Secretary to this collection of Euro-obsessives who regularly gather together, doling out anoraks before we begin? I am sure that she will be enlightened by the end of the day. On a serious note, there are some areas in which treaty change is necessary. If Croatia joined the European Union, for instance, the voting strengths of council members would have to be redrawn, and the number of MEPs would have to be changed. That would require treaty change, but could it be achieved through accession treaties?</p>

consensus last June that a period of reflection was needed. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston asked me about that. The ongoing national debates on the future of Europe show that there is no clear consensus on the constitutional treaty.

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="60614-0006.htm_para4"><a name="06061448000479">With regard to enlargement, this European Council was due to take a decision on whether Bulgaria and Romania should accede to the Union in 2007 as scheduled or whether to delay accession until 2008. The Commission has now recommended deferring that decision until October, given its concerns about the readiness of both countries. There will be a report from the Commission in October. However, we expect that the topic of enlargement may still be raised at the European Council. Here, as in the debate on the future of Europe, the United Kingdom&#146;s position has always been very clear, and I am pleased to acknowledge that it has received full support from both sides of the House.</p>

Those benefits have been most obvious in the countries acceding. They have gained both greater economic growth and greater political stability. That was true back in the 1980s when countries such as Spain and Greece emerged from dictatorship, and it was true in 2003 when the 10 new member states stepped out from the shadow of communist totalitarianism.</p>

Our peace and security have been enhanced by that spreading stability and by the spreading of the rule of law to an ever-wider circle of neighbours. As we have seen from the most recent wave of enlargement, it has opened up new markets and given us access to much needed skilled labour. Any enlargement has to be managed carefully. It must take into account a number of factors, including the ability of the European Union to absorb new member states, as the European Council acknowledged at Copenhagen in 1993.</p>

However, the process has to advance, and if it proves impossible to proceed on that basis, which we all must hope does not happen, then other ways will need to be considered. Let me be clear that, as our Prime Minister himself set out, not least in his press conference, it is our task in the international community, the UK, the EU and the broader Quartet to do everything that we can to ensure that there is the best possible chance for a negotiated settlement.</p>

She will notice that it is also traditional for the same Members to attend them and make a speech that is 95 per cent. the same as the one that they made on the previous occasion. I will try to break out of that a little bit this time, as no doubt will other hon. Members. It is very important that we have such debates before European Council meetings, but it leads one to reflect that there may be additional ways whereby parliamentary scrutiny of Government policy at European Councils could be improved. I hope that the Government will want to consider those in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="60614-0006.htm_para16"><a name="06061448000505">The Foreign Secretary has already discussed European matters at a Select Committee meeting yesterday, after which the press referred to her ability to say a great deal without saying very much&#151;probably an essential attribute of a Foreign Secretary. It was noted in the press that when she was asked whether European issues required Cabinet representation in their own right, she uttered an immediate and abrupt no&#151;a very straightforward answer. That perhaps helps to explain the oddity of the fact that the Minister for Europe gave a speech about Europe at the Centre for European Reform just three hours ago, before the commencement of this debate. His objective, so far as one can discover, was to restart the debate in this country about the European Union. I say, &#147;so far as one can discover&#148;, because even two hours ago the Foreign Office website was not immune from the wave of public apathy that greeted his speech, so I have not yet been able to examine it in detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="60614-0006.htm_para17"><a name="06061448000506">Once again the Government are talking about restarting the debate on the European Union. Only two years ago, the Prime Minister stood at the Dispatch Box and said of Europe:</p>

 On restarting the European debate, people living in fishing communities around the country have been interested to learn that the Conservative party, which shamefully took us into the common fisheries policy, has now reneged on its policy to withdraw from it and is content to stay within it.

 I am not aware of any such approach. The common fisheries policy has failed economically and environmentally; we are very clear about that, as is the hon. Gentleman. We have long sought more local and national control in fisheries policy and agricultural policies.

He said&#151;I agree with him about this&#151;that people in Britain have come to associate Europe with &#147;obscure constitutional arrangements&#148;. He also refused to rule out the revival of the European constitution. I must warn him that in doing so, he is taking a different path from the former Foreign Secretary, the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), who has pretty much said in this House that the European constitution is dead. In fact, the last time that he was asked about it by my hon.

While he did not like to put it bluntly, his message was pretty clear. The deeply flawed constitution&#151;a centralising, integrationist treaty whose time has truly passed&#151;could not be revived, as the Dutch Foreign Minister has stated categorically.

 Is the aggression that the right hon. Gentleman is unfairly directing at my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe partly due to the fact that on reshuffle day he issued a press release condemning the creation of a Department of European Affairs that was never actually created?</p>

 I think that the Minister thought that it was going to be created, which was one of the reasons why he accepted the job. Yes, there was certainly some confusion among the Opposition as to what was going on, but that was nothing compared with the confusion in No. 10. I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman thinks that this is aggression&#151;it is merely good-natured advice to the Minister for Europe, to whom I bear no malice whatsoever. However, it is well known that he was offered a job and that, a couple of hours later, No. 10 had to ring up and explain that it was an entirely different job. That is doubtless because the Foreign Secretary asserted herself in no uncertain terms and I do not blame her for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="60614-0007.htm_para0"><a name="06061448000520">Before the Minister for Europe says anything more about reviving the European constitution or refusing to rule it out, does not he realise the extent of the relief in the Government and the barely concealed sense of heaven-sent reprieve in 10 Downing street and the Foreign Office when the constitution was defeated in the referendums in France and the Netherlands? Does he believe that, if the constitution were put back on the rails and won approval elsewhere and the Government had to hold a referendum in this country, the Prime Minister or the Chancellor would think that that was a good idea? He has just experienced one downward move in his ministerial career&#151;I say that in the continuing spirit of friendly advice&#151;and if he comes back with the European constitution alive and kicking, he will be junior Under-Secretary for paperclips in no time.</p>

 I probably share some of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns about the constitution. However, in fairness to my right hon. Friend, recent press reports show that Italy, France, Germany and Austria have all spoken about the revival of the constitution. Indeed, the Belgian Prime Minister said that 15 states have already ratified and that, when we get to four fifths, the matter should be referred back to the European Council. The decision about reviving the constitution could well be out of my right hon. Friend&#146;s hands.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to efforts to revive the constitution in other parts of Europe&#151;including, bizarrely, some countries where the people have rejected it, for example, France. That is all the more reason for our Government to make their position clear and speak out. This country would not be alone in rejecting the constitution in a referendum. Indeed, if the Governments of some of the countries that approved it had had the courage to put it to their people, it would have been rejected.</p>

 Of course I have not forgotten. We agree about much of that.

The Foreign Secretary referred to aid to Palestinian people and specifically answered the question about that. I hope that the Minister can enlarge on that in his winding-up speech, because the Quartet agreed more than a month ago that urgent delivery of aid to Palestinians was necessary and instructed the EU to take the lead on a temporary international mechanism. When I was in the occupied territories only a few weeks ago, I got the impression that the need was urgent, that the Palestinian economy is contracting more sharply than might have been expected and that that is likely to cause great hardship. Reports have emerged that the United States has rejected the European proposal. Is it true that the United States has asked the EU to go back to the drawing board? What is the state of the preparations for establishing the temporary international mechanism? Will the Foreign Secretary take steps&#151;her speech implied that she would&#151;to resolve the matter at this week&#146;s summit? Will the Minister tell us more about the mechanism and when it is likely to be in place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="60614-0007.htm_para10"><a name="06061448000546">Secondly, may I press Ministers further on the transparency issue, which the Foreign Secretary addressed briefly in her opening speech? One item to be discussed at the summit is greater transparency at meetings of the Council of the European Union. We have long supported an end to closed meetings of the Council, for reasons that the European Scrutiny Committee set out in the relevant report. First, national Parliaments and electorates cannot hold Ministers to account if it is not clear how they have acted in the Council. Secondly, it is easy for Governments to blame Brussels for decisions that they might themselves have agreed to in closed meetings. Thirdly, closed meetings can result in deals that no Government fully accountable to their own Parliament would have agreed to. Lastly, the arrangement makes a large part of the EU&#146;s business invisible to the citizen.</p>

 I hope that I can clarify this matter for the right hon. Gentleman because this is an issue on which there might be some misunderstanding. What we proposed&#151;and what was accepted&#151;in our presidency was that legislative proposals, especially those that involved co-decision and perhaps others, should be open to much greater scrutiny than hitherto, and that the initial sets of proposals should be open to public scrutiny and on public view, as should votes, explanations of votes and so on. We proposed a great deal more transparency than we have now. However, what has been proposed in these Council conclusions is to take a significant&#151;to my mind&#151;step further and to say that every bit of deliberation on such detailed negotiations should be in the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="60614-0007.htm_para11"><a name="06061448000548">I would draw an analogy with the way in which we conduct ourselves in this place.

 I am not sure that the analogy with this place is to the Foreign Secretary&#146;s advantage on this issue. The deliberations of Parliament are fully open to the public&#151;not just the decisions reached. And the Council of Ministers is now, in effect, a legislative body. In fact, the Council of the European Union and North Korea&#146;s Supreme People&#146;s Assembly are now the world&#146;s only legislatures that meet in secret.

The leaders of all the British parties in the European Parliament signed a declaration to that effect and the Government put forward a paper during their presidency proposing to make Council meetings and business more open. Those proposals contained two options. The European Council agreed to partial openness, which is what the Foreign Secretary has just referred to. However, the then Minister for Europe, now the Secretary of State for Scotland, the right hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, South (Mr. Alexander), then wrote to the European Scrutiny Committee to assure it that the British objective</p>

 I would support the Minister for Europe setting out his policy for Europe in this House rather than elsewhere. I cannot say that that would involve having a Minister at Cabinet level; I think that the Foreign Secretary and I agree on that issue. Those matters should be the responsibility of the Foreign Secretary in Cabinet.

This week has marked the opening of the first chapter of accession talks with Turkey. We strongly welcome that, and I offer my congratulations to the Government on the strong and consistent stance that they have taken in favour of Turkey&#146;s membership. We should be proud of the fact that there is cross-party consensus in this country on this wider enlargement. Will the Minister confirm, however, that no member state can ultimately join the EU if it does not recognise another or give its vessels access to its ports and airspace? This is an area of extreme delicacy, but does he not agree that it is vital that we do not leave the Cypriot problem frozen while accession negotiations proceed, because in the end neither process can succeed without the other?</p>

We know that offering EU membership is the best incentive to persuade countries to make the hard political decisions that mark the road to that end. We also know the likely cost of refusing entry to the EU. In the Balkans and Ukraine, it would be nationalism, populism, corruption and criminality. So will the Minister join us in pledging that, while their accession might take many years, the western Balkans, Ukraine and Belarus have every right, in the long term, to join the EU, should they wish to do so?</p>

The constitution is a subject that has not been sufficiently debated in this country, yet it is of profound importance. Some people in Europe want it brought back, while others want it left on the shelf while being implemented through the back door. Perhaps we should recognise that the peoples of Europe do not want this kind of integration, respect their verdict and look again at what the EU should be doing.</p>

 In the context of the flexible, open Europe to which my right hon.

Tomorrow&#146;s summit will consider the Commission&#146;s proposal to move policing and judicial co-operation, under the remit of the Commission, the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice, from third to first pillar, and to abolish national vetoes. Not only would that be a profound increase in the European Union&#146;s power and a diminution of national sovereignty in an area where voters demand national accountability, but it would implement part of the constitution through the back door, which the Government promised that they would not allow.</p>

The Foreign Secretary has again refused to come out against it today. When the Minister for Europe winds up, will he tell us what the position is?

They expressed opposition to parts of that directive because they said that it would make it hard to deport EU citizens or members of their families who were not conducive to the public good. They were outvoted, however, and we all know how that contributed to the current mess over foreign criminals.

that last time. I did say that, normally, 95 per cent. of the content of speeches in such debates is a repeat of what was said last time. I have tried to reduce that to only 10 per cent. in this speech. This, however, is an especially important point that needs repeating every time. On current trends, Europe faces the greatest loss of economic influence in the world of any group of countries in peacetime in modern history.

Thanks to the radical changes in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s, Britain is well placed to lead on that, to challenge some of the orthodoxies of recent decades and to call on Europe to replace habits of heavy regulation and rigidity with freedom and flexibility. Ministers should say clearly in speeches in the next few months that the attempt to create a politically united Europe was a response to the problems of the 20th<sup>( )</sup>century and the aftermath of world wars, and it is now time to bring the vision of Europe up to date and to advocate a Europe of decentralisation and diversity in the spirit of the 21st century.</p>

I told them politely but bluntly that, given that they know that the treaty has been voted against by two member states, agreeing it in their own Parliament would send out all the wrong messages.

 We had a very interesting COSAC conference, at which that discussion did take place. Members of the European Parliament, at least, seem to be disengaged from the reality of where the European Union is and where we want it to be. Describing the constitutional treaty as &#147;being dead&#148; is not the best language to use when discussing it, but nor is it right to argue that we should carry on with it and wait until something else comes along. The very wrong impression has been given that if the French presidential elections go ahead and there is a change, the argument will settle down. I said to the chairman of the French Assembly that if we consider the situation from the perspective of a French or Dutch politician, it could be a bit insulting to suggest at a COSAC meeting that we welcome moves to ratify the treaty. I was surprised to hear him say, however, that he was comfortable with welcoming such ratification. That worries me. If politicians in France, where there has been a referendum and a substantial &#147;no&#148; vote, think like that, it will send out the wrong message.</p>

 In my usual, respectful way, I think that the UK Government were absolutely right not to have a referendum.

 I want to ask the Chairman of our distinguished European Scrutiny Committee a question that I perhaps should have put to the Foreign Secretary, but which he might be able to answer. Why is the European Union Bill on today&#146;s Order Paper&#151;as it is on every other day&#151;with Queen&#146;s Consent to be signified, a Ways and Means motion, and all that goes with it? Given that the Bill makes provision for a referendum, does the hon. Gentleman think it extremely important that it be taken off the Order Paper, thereby indicating that the Government understand that it cannot proceed? The Labour party voted for it, but the Conservative party&#151;thanks to the efforts of some of us&#151;ensured that we voted against it on principle.</p>

I do not see it that way and I would not support that, but the proposals included other matters, especially the role of national Parliaments, that we should support. Some national parliamentarians have said that we are cherry-picking&#151;but if it is cherry-picking to argue the case for more powers for national Parliaments, I support it.</p>

Indeed, other Parliaments claim to scrutinise European legislation more than the UK Parliament. I am critical of our process of scrutiny and it could be improved, but we scrutinise European legislation better than most and as well as any.

 The hon. Gentleman may have received this morning, as I did, a document published by the Robert Schuman Foundation, which is not known for its Eurosceptic views. It was written by the leader of the EU delegation in the French Senate and makes the same point as the hon. Gentleman. I was surprised by his comments about COSAC and the French National Assembly, because the document acknowledges the no vote in France and calls for stronger national Parliaments. It is even called &#147;National Parliaments: a bulwark for Europe&#148;. The hon. Gentleman is on the right lines.</p>

I appeal to those who have influence on the matter to act. I have already made arrangements to talk to the new Leader of the House so that we may return to that report, bring it to the Floor of the House and discuss it. We should also consider some of the proposals made by my right hon. Friend, because his progressive approach was surely influenced by his 10 years&#146; experience in the European Parliament before he came here.

policy speeches in the past couple of months&#151;in London, in Canberra and at Georgetown university in the United States&#151;he made virtually no mention of the European Union. Indeed, the debate at St. Antony&#146;s revealed a former idealist who may have become more than a little scunnered over the years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para6"><a name="06061448000616">In the constitutional treaty process, the former Foreign Secretary, who is now the Leader of the House, was very focused on red lines and on never giving in, but I hope that it is not unfair to mention his barely concealed joy when he spoke about the constitution being either dead or in limbo. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks reminded us of that earlier. Being a son of the manse in the Church of Scotland, I do not know the precise theological equivalent of limbo in my faith, but I think that we can all understand what the right hon. Gentleman meant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para7"><a name="06061448000617">The former Foreign Secretary was very keen and proud about the prospect of greater transparency, better scrutiny and more openness in the EU. For that reason, it is especially sad to hear the new Foreign Secretary apparently retreat from what was to be a symbolic breakthrough for openness in EU matters, and even at this late stage, I hope that the Government will reconsider their approach. When the Minister for Europe responds to the debate, perhaps he will explain why, after years of the Government championing the treaty as a great example of what the new Europe would be about, the Foreign Office has suddenly got cold feet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para8"><a name="06061448000618">In particular, I hope that the Minister will say what the Government&#146;s attitude will be if the Austrians proceed with their proposals to reverse the burden of proof&#151;which would mean that the European Council would have to establish that there was a good reason for not having openness before people were excluded. That would be a good arrangement, and it is a shame that the Government appear to be backtracking away from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para9"><a name="06061448000619">In his characteristic style, the shadow Foreign Secretary, the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, used attack as the best form of defence. He cantered through many of the difficulties of the past year, but did not say much about the European People&#146;s party. Perhaps the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) will deal with that at the end of the debate, although, beyond talking about fruitcakes and loonies, there may not be much scope for comment at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para10"><a name="06061448000620">The shadow Foreign Secretary also said very little about his proposed British free trade area with the US.

That was a major breakthrough, and there was also the budget deal&#151;of sorts&#151;that we have debated here previously. Yet we have not heard much about reflection and re-engagement with the peoples of Europe.

made clear by the report earlier this year from the European Scrutiny Committee that was debated in European Standing Committee a few weeks ago, and it reinforces the need for this House to improve our scrutiny of what is going on.</p>

I hope that the Minister&#146;s new interest and new Foreign Office perspective will cause him to be an agent for change, helping to deliver better transparency and openness. That is especially important, as it will allow the House to focus on the important question of subsidiarity that is, quite rightly, of such concern.</p>

We learn that there is more reflection to come, and there is little prospect that a target date for reform will be agreed at the forthcoming summit. Institutional life in Europe will be very difficult in the medium term, and we must hope that that serves to focus minds. We will need to make a virtue of pragmatism, but if we want a sustainable long-term outcome, we will have to resist the temptation to indulge in comprehensive cherry-picking, as opposed to undertaking a proper review of the treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para14"><a name="06061448000624">We supported the treaty, but whatever its merits or otherwise, we cannot win trust for it if we introduce large chunks by the back door. We need to design a new process that involves both national Parliaments and the citizens of member states, but in the meantime, we must get on with dealing with voters&#146; concerns. The problem goes beyond subsidiarity, transparency and openness. There is plenty of debate about the democratic deficit in Europe, but we need to focus more on the delivery deficit, as some commentators have noted. That deficit applies to the economy, the security fears that arise from illegal migration and trafficking in human beings and drugs, other organised crime, and the environment.</p>

It certainly does now, however much the Hampton Court summit tried to give it new focus.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has spoken about the problems and failures of the Lisbon agenda and of the whole European economic project, but does he agree that far too many people waffle on about such matters? I do not accuse him of doing that, but we need to get real and admit that the treaty project is not working. We should then introduce a proper project that would enable member states to run their own economies in their own fashion. Countries could co-operate where possible, as part of an association of nation states, but there would be an end to the nonsensical attempt to square a circle. It is increasingly obvious that that is impossible.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is generous to me, but I hope that he does not mind if I say that I disagree with him on this matter. That seems to be the sad pattern of our dealings on matters European, although I admire his consistency and dedication of purpose. Nevertheless, he hits on some real issues that we need to tackle. We will get nowhere if we pretend that there are not serious problems, which national Governments and the EU as a whole must try and resolve.</p>

Each of the individual countries will have to face up to structural reform, which in some cases is long overdue. They will have to accept that getting Europe&#146;s economy into shape is essential if we are to cope in the new globalising world economy. This year, we have at least had a services directive, although it is not the full-blown one that we were originally promised, and there are signs of life in the Commission, with initiatives to tackle mobile phone roaming costs. All those things are worth while, but, relatively speaking, not as good as they might be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para20"><a name="06061448000632">The big prize is surely the World Trade Organisation. As many have already said, this is a vital trade round, particularly for our commitment to the developing world. Selfishly, for us in Europe, it is also crucial for our economies. The summit will need to recognise what is at stake&#151;and not just for the developed world&#146;s credibility or in relation to the trade benefits of new arrangements between the key economic blocs. Increasingly, the very existence of the WTO itself is at stake, with the increased risk of bilateralism, increased protectionism and a general undermining of the rules-based international trading order. The EU needs the WTO and our constituents need a credible European Union. The Trade Commissioner, going into bat on behalf of all of us in Europe, is much more effective than a single national Government. If we are to cope with the tides of globalisation we need the rules of the system to work, and the EU&#146;s negotiating stand needs to reflect that.</p>

The lure of the European Union is still powerful, and future enlargement matters a great deal. There has been widespread concern about the difficulties being experienced by Romania and Bulgaria. Let us not lose sight of the massive progress that they have made. We must hope that they can show that they have caught up with expectations by the time of the next summit. Elsewhere, the development of Croatia, and in particular its compliance&#151;eventually&#151;with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, was a major step forward and has to have something to do with the prospect of membership of the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para22"><a name="06061448000634">Like many others, I celebrate Montenegro&#146;s vote earlier this month to become a separate country, and I welcome the fact that the British Government have now recognised it as such. Countries such as Montenegro may in future aspire to membership of the European Union. It is important that we have that prospect there for them, and that we help them in that desire. Right now, our focus is increasingly on Turkey. It was nearly a bad week for the talks, but it was important that the discussions began in earnest. The wrangles are a reminder of the problems, but it is vital, not just for Turkey but for all of us, that progress can be seen to be made on its behalf, however slow the road to membership may be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para23"><a name="06061448000635">Quite apart from those important matters, as the Foreign Secretary herself remarked, a lot of time will be required for debates on foreign policy matters at the summit over the next couple of days. I am glad to hear of the issues that she expects to be up for discussion at the summit&#151;particularly in relation to Iran. After months, if not years, of growing concern, recent developments there have been reasonably encouraging. I think that there is complete agreement that for Iran to obtain nuclear weapons would be completely unacceptable. Any enrichment process for a civil nuclear programme has got to have adequate mechanisms and safeguards&#151;and crucially attract trust&#151;to win support across the world. What matters about our negotiating position with Iran is that we get the balance right between the opportunities and the threats if Iran does not respond. In recent weeks the willingness of the United States to talk to Iran has been a major breakthrough, and we must welcome that. The six nations talks have been able to make some progress, and we hope to hear more about that after the weekend.</p>

As the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks already observed from personal experience, having been there, the situation is stark. The assessment of the United Nations is that a quarter of the Palestinian Authority&#146;s people are dependent on salaries from the Palestinian Authority, and that without external funding, poverty rates in the occupied territories are expected to rise from 56 per cent. to 74 per cent. over the next couple of years. That estimate may be on the cautious or conservative side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para25"><a name="06061448000637">We recognise the need for Hamas to support the Quartet principles: to renounce violence, to recognise the state of Israel, and to accept previous peace agreements. However, we need the most careful diplomacy and some assistance from all sides if we are to make some progress. After his final visit to the middle east as Foreign Secretary, our present Leader of the House hinted that the international community had to be prepared to give a little bit of ground&#151;as well as elsewhere. I have written to the Foreign Secretary to seek clarification of that, and I hope that the Minister might be able to answer that point in his closing remarks. What is the international community willing to do, and how will it ensure that we get the temporary international mechanism in place as soon as possible? The delay in establishing that mechanism is surely exacerbating the situation, and it is not yet clear whether the funds to be provided will be sufficient, nor is it clear how long they will last. The summit must attend to that urgently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para26"><a name="06061448000638">In anticipation of the United States-European Union summit, which will follow in a week or so, I hope, too, that the European Union will have some discussion of rendition. We have seen today&#146;s Amnesty International report, which is highly critical of the particular cases in the United Kingdom. Last week&#146;s Council of Europe report was scathing. Like many hon. Members&#151;the matter was raised under points of order earlier&#151;I have tabled questions to the Home Secretary asking about particular flights that came to the United Kingdom; they have yet to be answered after three months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para27"><a name="06061448000639">The Government have been explicit that they do not support extraordinary rendition. However, they do not seem at all willing to ask questions of the United States to find out the answers to the serious questions that are being put. Far from it: we learn from a letter that I received from the Minister of State, Ministry of Defence that the United Kingdom is content to have standing arrangements of which the three wise monkeys would approve. We have got to do better than that. There may be a great deal of embarrassed shuffling of feet around the summit tables, but Europe has got to come to terms with the issue and clean its hands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="60614-0009.htm_para28"><a name="06061448000640">The expectations for this summit are desperately low. Perhaps ahead of the French presidential elections and the Dutch general election nothing much can be achieved. Certainly, there is not a diplomat I have spoken to or a commentator I have read who expects anything much at all. That is a great pity. There is much that could and should be done, not just for the credibility of the European Union but for the reality of everyday life in Europe. It will not be hard to beat expectations; let us hope that there is a real attempt to do so.</p>

 It has already been said that the same people participate in these debates on every occasion, so I suppose that I should plead guilty to being one of the usual suspects. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson) is nodding approvingly. It has also been suggested that  95 per cent. of what is said in these debates was said  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="14 Jun 2006">

during the previous debate before a Council meeting. I must admit that I was surprised about that, because I imagine that few in the Chamber can remember 5 per cent. of what they said six months ago, far less 95 per cent. We must all be operating on automatic pilot to an extent, so I suppose that I should plead guilty to that, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para0"><a name="06061450000002">Before I mention the summit, it is important to point out the development of the European Union. It started in 1956 as an economic treaty, which was a response to a Europe that had been badly divided militarily, politically and economically in the early 1950s. For the next 35 years, the European Economic Community, which became the European Community, concentrated largely on social and economic issues, so those matters dominated the summits. However, by the time of the Maastricht treaty in 1992, developments began to occur. The Community recognised that one cannot have a cogent economic policy in a global world without having a cogent foreign policy because, for example, political events in the middle east clearly affect the world economy. The Maastricht treaty thus empowered the Community to take a common view on foreign policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para1"><a name="06061450000003">Developments took place in the 1990s and the Community started to say, &#147;We want to take action on foreign policy.&#148; It was absolutely right to do so, although I know that not everyone in the Chamber agrees. It was illogical to have economic and foreign policy wings without a defence wing, because intervention on foreign policy often cannot take place without a defence capability. By the Nice summit in 2000, therefore, the European security policy was developed. If one believes that the European Union is necessary to bind together European nations with common values and cultures and a desire for the same kind of things in life, the Community must have those wings, which is why I support the approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para2"><a name="06061450000004">I am not saying that every structure is right. I have followed the arguments that have been made about transparency, although a little more has been made about the openness of European Council meetings than might be merited, given the reality of the way in which the meetings are conducted. I have never known a President, Prime Minister or Foreign Minister say anything in a Council meeting that was not reported in every newspaper in Europe that wanted to report it. What happens at European Council meetings is no secret. The positions that are stated are immediately reported. I have some sympathy with my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary because we know that if every meeting is completely open, there will be meetings on the side in which confidential positions might be expressed. It is thus not right to pretend that such transparency will do anything to open up or democratise the European Union, so we must examine other approaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para3"><a name="06061450000005">The role of national Parliaments is important. The European Parliament has no locus with regard to defence policy, so it is important that national Parliaments take a keen interest in what happens on their behalf in the European Union, and that is the area on which I want to address my comments about the summit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para4"><a name="06061450000006">As the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) said, expectations for the summit are limited. I was in Helsinki last week with the Western European Union Assembly Defence Committee. We were given a preview of what the Finnish presidency might consider following the Austrian presidency. One of the country&#146;s ministry of defence officials said that his aim was to make sure that he did not drop the baton during his six months. I understand that and, in some ways, it reflects the reality of EU presidencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para5"><a name="06061450000007">Each presidency lasts only six months, but not much changes or moves politically over six months. A process that starts during a presidency might be taken forward a little by the next presidency, with something happening in three or four years. The fact that a presidency lasts only six months makes it difficult to do anything, although that problem was addressed by the constitution, to which hon. Members have referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para6"><a name="06061450000008">The second problem is that it is difficult to have continuity and coherence in the selection of matters for discussion when 25 views are presented and each country has an equal opportunity to put its views. Some nations&#151;Finland was quite open about this&#151;do not have the capacity to run a presidency in the way in which Germany, France or the United Kingdom may do because of their size. It is thus understandable that success for a Finnish presidency would be not to drop the baton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para7"><a name="06061450000009">A general point needs to be made. We all have these debates before summits. Every nation sets out its stall and then has six months to do what it can, after which there is reflection. However, it is rare that the agenda that is promised two or three months before the start of a presidency&#151;the Finns are going through that process now&#151;reflects the issues that are discussed in the Council meeting six months later. The matters that will be discussed at the Council meeting in Vienna tomorrow are not those that the Austrians promised six months ago, which becomes clear if one looks at the content of our debate at that time. Enlargement is clearly important, but there was a lot more talk at the time about making progress on the economic front, such as on the Lisbon agenda and the financial services directive, although, to my knowledge, little has changed on that over the past six months and, indeed, it has not been addressed to any great extent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para8"><a name="06061450000010">One of the problems with the structure is that one must always monitor what is happening across the three faces of the European Union: the economic, foreign policy and defence fronts. No presidency can concentrate on all three fronts, but an event that happens during the six months, such as an oil price shock, the invasion of a country that affects the interests of the European Union, a civil war, or a major migration, can immediately become important. If no focus is put on the structures necessary to deal with such events in advance, the European Union becomes an impotent organisation. That is why even though the Austrians tell us that European security and defence policy is not a main focus for the summit, given some of the things that I want to anticipate&#151;I will not go on for too long&#151;ESDP will be important. We should thus monitor it to ensure that we are doing what we should to execute the policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para9"><a name="06061450000011">We are all aware of the threats that we face under ESDP. There is complete agreement about the threat from failed states of terrorism and the threat of environmental and other natural disasters. Although I am a strong advocate of a European Union that is bound together, I am also strongly in favour of NATO because of the defence interests of the United Kingdom. Many EU member states have also realised that their defence is crucially dependent on NATO. Before some argue that ESDP is all very well, but the real defence of the country is something else and we do not want a European army, I point out that the argument that is put for a European defence policy is not against NATO, but an argument that NATO should be complemented. I have found that that is the case in not only this country, but, increasingly, throughout Europe.</p>

<p><a name="st_o214"><a name="06061450000012"><a name="60614-0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="06061450000092"><b>Mr. Walter:</b>
 Was the hon. Gentleman as surprised as me that the Foreign Secretary did not refer at all in her opening remarks to ESDP and, particularly, the decision taken by the European Union to send 1,500 troops next month to Congo, to which the United Kingdom is making both a financial and physical contribution?</p>

<p><a name="st_o215"><a name="06061450000013"><a name="60614-0010.htm_spnew2"><a name="06061450000093"><b>Mr. Henderson:</b>
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary had a lot on her plate. She will be aware that she will have to respond to points like that tomorrow or the day after, which I am sure she will do very effectively in support of all our interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para10"><a name="06061450000014">My first point about ESDP is that preparation must be made in advance. There is no point in our finding out that we need 1,500 troops to go to the Congo in three weeks&#146; time, and that foreign policy is in favour of that, if we cannot deliver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para11"><a name="06061450000015">My second point is this. We heard another interesting speech from a Finnish Member of Parliament at one of the meetings that I attended last week. He said, &#147;The real threat today is not to a nation; it is to a people and communities.&#148; In some senses, that is true. The dangers posed by terrorism and the like do not threaten any nation in particular, but they threaten communities and peoples across nations. That has been recognised by countries such as Austria. It will be interesting to hear what the Austrians have to say at this week&#146;s summit. Their traditional neutrality, which enabled them to remain outside the threat from the cold war, is no longer a defensible position. To defend their nation, they need to do more. They are beginning to recognise that the most effective way for historically neutral countries to become part of European defence is through the European Union as it combines with NATO countries to strengthen European defence. That is not a new development, but I think people are more conscious of it than they have been in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para12"><a name="06061450000016">Capability requires the addressing of strategic issues. First, have enough resources been allocated by the various European Union countries? At summits, everyone talks of their enthusiasm for foreign policy and co-operation on defence policy, but they must also commit themselves to allocating the necessary funds within their own nations, or their armed forces will not be able to deliver their share.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para13"><a name="06061450000017">Secondly, there always needs to be a very sensitive assessment of European public opinion. If European  <br>

defence is truly to defend Europe, the policy must have the backing of the European people. If the European people believe that the European Union is not operating as effectively as it should, we will lose a great deal of our international defence capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para14"><a name="06061450000018">Thirdly, we must ensure that the systems are there to execute the policy. I shall not dwell on this in depth, but it has been recognised that the battlegroup concept that reinforces a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force cannot always be appropriate. Smaller units, but coherent units, are needed, and that is where the battlegroups come into play. The various European Union nations are now committing themselves to joining battlegroups, which is an important development.</p>

<p><a name="st_o216"><a name="06061450000019"><a name="60614-0010.htm_spnew3"><a name="06061450000094"><b>Mike Gapes:</b>
 My hon. Friend mentioned a 60,000-strong force. Is it not regrettable that the Helsinki goals have not been met in the European Union? We have a real problem. A number of countries&#151;not ours, but Germany and some of the bigger EU nations&#151;have not delivered even on the rather limited commitments to changing defence capabilities in Europe that were made a few years ago, since when there have been more and more commitments on which they have not delivered.</p>

 I agree, although I recognise the difficulties encountered by nations whose attitude to defence post-1945 has traditionally been different from those of Britain and France.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para15"><a name="06061450000021">I think that the battlegroup concept is quite a good way of building up a momentum that will, I hope, bring about a rapid reaction force that is a combination of larger battlegroups. What is needed is more interchangeability. We must all be able to operate each other&#146;s equipment. I believe that there are some 18 different armoured personnel carriers in Europe, and about 15 different radio systems. That is common gear; it is not sophisticated technology on which any one country wants to be ahead of another, but it does not operate in a unified way, for historical reasons. The European Defence Agency may help to deal with that, but I think we also need a great deal of political will on the part of our leaders at the summit tables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para16"><a name="06061450000022">The civilian response is also important. It is all very well having a rapid reaction force, a common policy, battlegroups and interchangeability, but much of the European Union&#146;s work depends on civilian support. Much more needs to be done, and I hope that the subject will be raised at this week&#146;s summit. Perhaps my right hon. Friend the Minister will refer to it when he winds up the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para17"><a name="06061450000023">There is clearly no point in sending 1,500 troops to the Congo to try to secure law and order unless we also help to strengthen the economy of the Congo, and make larger aid contributions than we have made historically. There is no point in sending the troops if there is not the medical capacity to ensure that people are remaining that little bit healthier while they are being given some law and order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para18"><a name="06061450000024">In such areas as Bosnia, it is crucial for resources to be invested in training.

The European Union has a crucial role in that regard. The ESDP will be brought into focus in connection with the growing environmental challenge. Existing commitments must be honoured: we currently have some 14 commitments, mainly in Europe. We need a debate on to what extent, and in what circumstances, the European Union should intervene beyond the boundaries of Europe. There must be international coherence on that.</p>

Many border issues will be crucial to the interests of the European Union in the coming period, so there are many reasons why the ESDP is an important pillar within the EU&#146;s structures. It should receive serious consideration at all summit meetings and not just when there is a particular emergency. I am sure that that is the overwhelming view of people in Europe. We have the same values and the same cultures and we want the same things.

was shadow Foreign Secretary, I was given to understand that, two years after the signing of the constitution, it had to be ratified by all 25 member states. That was made clear to us in a particular way; not least, it was made clear when I pressed for an early referendum from the Government on the issue and was told, &#147;No, no. We&#146;ve got two years in which to ratify and we intend to hold our referendum towards the end of that two-year period rather than towards the beginning.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para29"><a name="06061450000038">Suddenly all that has changed. At a relatively unnoticed meeting of the Council of Ministers the other day, the Foreign Secretary and other Ministers decided that they were going to extend the period within which the completion of the constitution could take place. The Foreign Secretary described it today as the extension of the period of reflection for a year, which sounds innocuous. I take what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) says about sitting and thinking and just sitting. But what is happening is neither. What is on offer is a means of trying to find a way to fly in the face of the verdicts of two members of the EU who expressed quite clearly through referendums their view that they did not want the constitution to go through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="60614-0010.htm_para30"><a name="06061450000039">We talk about coming closer to the people of Europe and listening to what they have to say, but what we have here is our Government being complicit with many other Governments in deciding that if they keep the process of reflection rolling on for long enough, the constitution will come back again in the end. That is a dangerous precedent to set in a Europe that is asking its citizens to have faith in what it is doing. It is an extraordinary move and I believe that, in some ways, it drew its inspiration from the almost incredible fact that, since last year&#146;s no votes in France and Holland, the reaction from the Government in this country on the vital question of the future structure of Europe has been a spectacularly deafening silence. I listened with great care to what the Foreign Secretary said today. She did not mention structure. She talked about the nuts and bolts, but she did not talk about the machine or the vehicle. Yet only two or three years ago in all the debates that we had on the constitution, those issues were the important ones for the Government in the development of Europe. Now there is just deafening silence, and that is why we are in danger of being taken in.</p>

If I may say to him in a friendly way, they have been somewhat long in coming, but it is important that they have now been made. However, for everyone else there is almost the feeling that the future structure of Europe is the issue that dare not speak its name. I was amazed to be told by a senior journalist on a national newspaper&#151;I will not say which paper&#151;that &#147;We don&#146;t do Europe any more.&#148;</p>

 The hon. Lady may well hear, as my speech progresses, what I think should be done. I no longer speak from the Front Bench, but she may recognise some echoes of what I said before, when I did speak from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="60614-0011.htm_para1"><a name="06061450000044">What is really irritating about the silence is that it comes at a time when the opportunity to influence the future development of Europe has never been greater. I use an analogy that I have used before, but for the last 30 years the development of what is known in Europe as the project has often been described as a single-track train journey towards a country called Europe. We were told that if we were not on the train, we were somehow out of the game. That was the argument put to us. Those who have sought to stand in the way of the train&#151;I see some in their places today&#151;found themselves well and truly bulldozed. The treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, Nice and the second treaty of Rome all drove forward in one direction only. That was the train moving forward. It seemed unstoppable, indivertible and irresistible. Those who argued otherwise and sought another way for Europe were parodied by people in Brussels as prejudiced politicians whistling in the wind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="60614-0011.htm_para2"><a name="06061450000045">Then, suddenly, the wind dropped. Suddenly, the train ground to a halt, not because Brussels lost heart or saw the light, but simply because the peoples of France and Holland looked towards the country of Europe and said no&#151;as, indeed, we would have done in this country, had we been allowed our referendum. That allowed, for the first time in my political lifetime, a real chance to reopen the debate on the future structure of Europe, to explore different structures, to look at different shapes and different tracks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="60614-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06061450000046">What I call the Europhiles could no longer argue that the issue was settled and non-negotiable, that the acquis could not be revisited, that the pass was sold. Indeed, the Prime Minister, in last year&#146;s speech to the European Parliament, effectively accepted and positively proclaimed that the post-referendum era provided a new opportunity for reform. We had the chance at long last not only to press for but to achieve progress on the renegotiation of the treaties as the price for agreeing a sustainable European Union for the future. We had the chance, in my view, to retrieve some areas of sovereignty that we should never have surrendered in the first place as the bottom line for building a more flexible Europe that could absorb and manage EU enlargement.</p>

Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) talk last week about the work that needed to be done to complete the single market, on which we all felt strongly that the benefits of the EU for the peoples of Europe would depend. He also spoke about co-operation on energy and pollution. We all know that positive measures can be taken and built on to allow the EU to serve its people. Equally, however, I am looking for us to use this opportunity to go further and look for fundamental treaty reform, which we were told was impossible because the train was running. Now that the train has stopped, why cannot we begin to examine it in detail again? Instead of grasping that opportunity, we are now in danger of seeing it squandered.</p>

 I suggest to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that we are in grave danger of misleading ourselves if we use the wrong comparison. I refer particularly to his train analogy, which implies that there is a single object that is moving in a single direction and that if it is stopped, it can be rolled backwards. Is it not a far better analogy to think about water flowing down a hill? If it is blocked at one particular point, it will find a way round and continue to flow. Simply because the train of the constitution has been blocked, it does not mean that the flow of legislation and the drive to centralisation has been halted. Those who believe that everything has led to a diminution of centralisation have made an enormous mistake.</p>

What I am saying is that if they were right in the past, which we can argue about, they can no longer use that argument because the momentum has gone. What I am saying is that at last we have a real chance to kill this wretched constitution and ensure that it cannot be revived. We have a real chance to press for a more flexible and less regulated Europe within which the primacy of the nation states, which has been undermined in recent years, can be reasserted.

I come from a farming community and represent it in my constituency, and there are many areas of sovereignty in that respect that we gave away, which meant that we have not served the British farmer.

What the Foreign Secretary said about external policy and what would be discussed at the coming summit sounded awfully like the common foreign policy about which we argued on the constitution.

Just before the end of the process, French colleagues, in particular, were strongly in favour of inserting a clause stating that a country that failed to ratify the constitution within two years would be asked to leave the European Union. I fought against that provision because the French and others favoured it only because they were absolutely convinced that it would be Britain that said no in a referendum.

He kept telling us that we had to make up our minds whether we wanted to create buns or babies in the constitution. Some people wanted buns&#151;something that was defined and that could not grow or change in nature. At one stage, the Germans were keen on the idea that the constitution should clearly delineate the powers of the Commission and member states and could not be altered. Those who were in favour of babies, particularly the Liberal Democrats, wanted organic law&#151;something that would allow within itself the creation of new powers.</p>

organic development. The debate across Europe on whether the constitution should be a defining document has not been resolved. It remains one of the big faultlines, as we see in the statement that the Foreign Secretary made to the Foreign Affairs Committee. My right hon. Friend said that the Council would discuss the provisions of article 42 of the treaty of the European Union, known as the passerelle, whereby decisions are transferred from requiring unanimity to requiring a qualified majority. That is a classic organic law mechanism, and it is still available. I am not suggesting that the proposal is wrong&#151;it is probably necessary in a union of 30&#151;but it has not been debated and there is no accountability.</p>

 I share my hon. Friend&#146;s disquiet about the use of the passerelle clause in some circumstances and believe that it should be resisted, but does she accept that it is not a new feature of the constitution, as it was part of a much earlier treaty signed by the Conservative Government?</p>

 I agree, but that does not negate the need to take a position. European Union debates are always stifled by the fact there are certain points that one is not allowed to debate or discuss. Just because something was agreed 20 years ago does not make it right for ever. I am not suggesting that the passerelle clause is wrong in itself. However, the way in which we have approached the constitution does not address the question of whether or not we want an organic system. </p>

Disproportionate powers were given to Luxembourg, which is the size of Birmingham, yet has four MEPs and its own commissioner. That arrangement was fine when membership consisted of three big and three small countries but, depending on the way in which one classifies Poland and Spain, there are now 19 small countries and six big ones. Ten days ago, <i> The Times</i> published an interesting map showing that 18 independent states have been created in Europe since 1991. It projects that there will be another 17 or 18 such states by 2020-25. The number of small countries in the EU with disproportionate rights has grown, so the problem has become more serious. Do we wish to give each of those countries its own commissioner? France, Germany and Britain have one commissioner each, but the western Balkans could have six, seven or eight. We will cap the size of the European Parliament, but we will give each new state four representatives. The constitution does not even begin to address that serious faultline.</p>

I will not spend much time on the issue, but history shows that certain requirements had to be fulfilled before the dollar became an effective single currency. The four freedoms are important, but far deeper political integration is required, as well as much greater transfers of resources between countries in the eurozone. The 0.6 per cent. that we spend on regional aid does not even begin to address the problem. In the USA, about 35 per cent. of taxes are redistributed from the centre, making the dollar an effective single currency. Countries in the eurozone must address that problem because, once again, the constitution does not offer any answers or solutions. At the same time, however, we agreed without any debate the need for a permanent head of eurozone Finance Ministers. The UK must engage with the issue&#151;it is not a question of whether or not we join the euro&#151;so that we are not left out of important developments in the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="60614-0011.htm_para20"><a name="06061450000076">I urge Ministers to be bold for once. Whether we like the language or not, and whether the constitution is dead or not, they should say plainly that that document will not help us in the next 30 or 50 years, and it is bad for Europe. They should put their cards on the table and have done with it. Instead, they are engaged in displacement therapy. They go on talking about the constitution to avoid talking about the things that really matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="60614-0011.htm_para21"><a name="06061450000077">Like Opposition Members, I care deeply about the career prospects of our Minister for Europe and I want him to move up again. I share the view that we should have a proper debate. One of the most effective ways of making European decisions explicit and letting members of the public know what we have decided would be to create a Cabinet post that deals with European matters. The post should be taken out of the Foreign Office. It is extraordinary that all the domestic policies agreed in Brussels remain within the Foreign Office. I know why that happens&#151;it is because of the European federation of Foreign Secretaries, who guard that arrangement because it is part of their power structure. Other countries have struggled with the same problem.</p>

The most significant political post in European politics is our permanent representative in Brussels&#151;UKREP. How many people can name our UKREP? Not many, but the kind of deals being done there are of great political significance and should be answered for. Would any Member like to intervene and give the name of the UK representative? [Hon.

It does not matter whether we call them diplomats or say that they are not diplomats&#151;they are representatives abroad, many of whom ought to be there.

Worse still, when individuals have had the courage to speak out against the inaccuracies of the auditing system, they, rather than the perpetrators of the errors, have been penalised.

 On the question of a referendum on Maastricht, for which I campaigned with other colleagues and got a petition presented to Parliament with no less than 500,000 signatures, does my hon.

We have European Union leaders who are keen to promote democracy to those in the European Union, to those who wish to join, and, indeed, to the rest of the world.

He referred to a conspiracy in the media and in the Government, but if he was being fair, he should also have referred to a conspiracy on the Opposition Benches.</p>

I am not going to comment on the remarks made by the putative sister party of the Conservatives&#151;the ODS, the civic platform in the Czech Republic&#151;which referred to the position adopted by the Polish putative sister party of the Conservatives as being dangerous and populist. Instead, I want to discuss the nature of the ongoing internal debates in each of the parties in our country. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) pointed out, what we have not had in the past year&#151;the Government are largely responsible for this, but the Opposition also bear a significant responsibility&#151;is real reflection and discussion. We now have another year. The Foreign Secretary told the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday about there being a further year for further reflection. I hope that in the coming year, we can have a real discussion in this country about the options and the way forward. Many of us assumed, a year ago, that the constitutional treaty was dead, but recently the Foreign Minister of Finland, Erkki Tuomioja, said&#151;</p>

 No, that is his name. If my hon. Friend cannot pronounce it, he can call him Erkki. Mr. Tuomioja said the other day that it was wrong&#151;and everybody agrees&#151;to call it a constitution. We have already been reminded of the absurd remarks by former French President Giscard d&#146;Estaing that somehow France has not decided because only 55 per cent. of the people voted no. Presumably, in his view of democracy, 101 per cent. would have to vote no before a decision could be reached. That attitude reflects a problem with engagement with reality that is found in many countries.</p>

Friend responds to the debate&#151;as he is well qualified to do, because of his great expertise and experience in these matters&#151;he can tell us how the debate can be taken forward in this country in the coming months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="60614-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06061451000045">We also need to confront the potential further enlargement of the EU. The question of Croatia is the most straightforward, but Macedonia is also a possibility. Therefore, we need to think about what will happen with the rest of the Balkans. One of the few positive things in the Balkans is the aspiration of everybody there almost to recreate Yugoslavia within the European Union. The way forward to ending the nationalistic conflicts and divisions is to get the people back together, and allow free movement of people, by bringing them into the European family. If we put up barriers to the Balkan countries, we could face serious difficulties, including conflict, in Bosnia-Herzegovina and with the Serbia-Kosovo issue, which has already been mentioned. If the latter is not resolved, it could become very difficult in a few months&#146; time, because the Kosovars believe that they will get independence and the Serbs are adamantly opposed. There is no possibility of any significant shift in those positions at present.</p>

What will be the ultimate borders of an enlarged European Union? People have talked about the absorptive capacity of the existing institutions, but the Polish Government have argued that Belarus and Ukraine should be in the EU. That means that we need to think not only about that capacity, but about the potential borders of the EU. We have seen demonstrations in the Crimea and tensions between Ukraine and Russia. I attended a meeting in the European Parliament two weeks ago at which Members of the European Parliament and representatives from national Parliaments in the Baltic states denounced the Foreign Minister of Austria, Mrs. Plassnik, because the Austrian presidency had not raised strongly enough with the Russians the territorial disputes between Estonia and Russia that predate Estonia&#146;s accession. I was never aware that the Estonians, in the process of negotiating the acquis and joining the EU, raised territorial issues with Russia as something that the EU should resolve. Nevertheless, problems will occur if such matters are not handled carefully. For example, another difficulty will arise if&#151;or rather, when&#151;Romania joins the EU. A few months ago, a senior Romanian politician told me that 20 per cent. of Moldovan citizens already had Romanian passports. Moldova is not in the EU and is not close to joining it, for all sorts of reasons.</p>

The European Commissioner responsible for the Doha round talks is Mr. Mandelson, but he and the rest of the Commission must be far more flexible and imaginative.

 We were warned at the beginning of the debate that we were the same old anoraks, saying the same old things every six months on the subject of the European Council meeting, as if we were unaware of the agenda of that meeting. However, we have heard some quite interesting new thoughts and fresh ideas in this debate. We have not all been rehearsing the same old ideas&#151;certainly not so far&#151;although occasionally we have tended to go back and refer to thoughts on the constitution.</p>

That rather reminds me of a headline in <i> Le Figaro</i> a couple of months ago which said that Dominique de Villepin spoke to France, but Nicolas Sarkozy spoke with the people of France. That reflects a nuance or difference in the minds of the French political elite as to what constitutes France.</p>

I also want to look a little at our relationships with our neighbours outside the Union&#151;particularly Norway and Turkey&#151;and to concentrate some of my remarks on an issue that the Foreign Secretary did not talk about: European security and defence policy. I mentioned in an earlier intervention that the European Union took the decision in April to launch a new military mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which will take place next month, surrounding the elections there.</p>

I am talking about the idea that we should have greater transparency in Council of Ministers meetings and European Council meetings. The Foreign Secretary gave the regrettable impression that the Council of Ministers, which is, after all, a legislative body, even if it is not a Parliament&#151;it does not always discuss legislation; sometimes it has reflective debates, rather like today&#146;s debate&#151;should for ever and a day continue to hold its deliberations in private and in secret. If we are going to scrutinise effectively and re-engage effectively with the peoples of Europe, we have to have greater transparency in the meetings of the Council of Ministers.</p>

I was intrigued by the comments of the hon. Member for Lanark and Hamilton, East (Mr. Hood), the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, about his visit to Finland last week. I was also in Finland last week, although I was with not his Committee, but another parliamentary group. I had a meeting with the Chairman of the Grand Committee of the Finnish Parliament. That Committee is very large and meets every Friday to hear the positions that Finnish Ministers will be taking prior to Council meetings. The Committee then deliberates on whether it agrees with those positions and if it disagrees, it calls the Ministers back so that there can be further discussion. The great effectiveness of the Committee perhaps reflects the fact that Finland has a coalition Government, but we could none the less take an interest in that procedure.</p>

 May I invite the hon. Gentleman to reflect on what he learned in Finland? The same thing is often said about the Folketing Committee in Denmark. From our perspective, that Committee is not scrutinising its Government, but is part of the legislative process. If a Committee in our Parliament was mandating a Minister to go to the Council, it would be part of the legislative process, rather than carrying out scrutiny.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is not just a subtle difference between mandating and scrutiny roles? One of the disadvantages of mandating Ministers is that when those Ministers go to the Council, their voting position is known, so their colleagues simply take them as part of the equation regarding building a blocking minority and those Ministers are thus not players in the negotiations, which can be quite a drawback at the European level.</p>

 I accept that point. We must examine the matter in different ways to take account of our traditions and practices. However, as I said in response to the hon. Member for Lanark and Hamilton, East, that does not mean that we cannot learn something from the Finnish procedure in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="60614-0013.htm_para17"><a name="06061451000071">According to a movement that has existed in this country for some time in certain quarters, we could somehow establish a different relationship with the European Union. The example of Norway is often cited. I was encouraged by the robust confirmation and reinforcement of our commitment to Britain&#146;s EU membership that we heard from my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague). I do not think that this country can have any role in some kind of semi-detached or associate relationship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="60614-0013.htm_para18"><a name="06061451000072">Norway is one of the Scandinavian countries that I visited. The Norwegian Parliament and Government have a better record on implementation of EU directives than most EU member states. The House of Commons Library kindly provided me with some data. The European Commission has an implementation report score card based on the percentage of directives that have not been implemented by EU member states and members of the European economic area. Norway has failed to implement l per cent. of directives. The Commission&#146;s target allows a country to have a non-implementation record of up to 1.5 per cent. The United Kingdom has failed to implement 2.5 per cent. of directives. Our non-implementation record is 2.5 times worse than that of Norway, which is not even a member of the EU but implements its directives none the less, sometimes with some enthusiasm.</p>

Its only border controls relate to states outside the EU, states that are not party to the Schengen agreement&#151;including the United Kingdom&#151;and its own territory of Svarlbad, or Spitzbergen, for those with older atlases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="60614-0013.htm_para20"><a name="06061451000074">The other point about Norway is that it makes budget contributions to the European Union. Over the coming year it will contribute some &#8364;33 million, which is a fair amount of money for quite a small country. Norway&#146;s contribution works out at about &#8364;50 a head, while that of the United Kingdom is only &#8364;76 a head. The financial benefit of our moving to a &#147;Norwegian position&#148; would amount to about &#8364;26 a head.

send troops to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Theoretically, this should have been the first test of the EU battlegroup concept. However, there has been a sad failure to test the concept despite the fact that the European Council took a decision in 2004 to create 13 battlegroups with about 1,500 troops each. They would provide the rapid reaction force capability that we are also sadly lacking or getting anywhere near to achieving. Four of the 13 battlegroups would be made up of members from a single nation and the other nine would be multinational and also include members from non-EU states such as Norway. The plan was to have the interim operational capacity of the battlegroups up and running in 2005, but we have still not got that, and they were supposed to come to full operational capacity in 2007. We are only six months away from that, but have just missed the first opportunity to test the battlegroup concept.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the fundamental failures of the grand plan for such military deployments is that other EU member states have consistently failed to invest in lift capability, defence forces and defence research? None of the plans can be put into action without going to NATO to provide the lift capability that is necessary for deployment. The plan is just something on a bit of paper.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, but I remind him that the concept of the battlegroups was for them to be within the NATO architecture. My point is that they have failed the first test. Germany is at the top of the roster in the current cycle for battlegroup deployment yet even it is unable to fulfil the commitment to providing 1,500 troops for a battlegroup formation in a German-led mission to the Congo. As a result, the Congo mission has had to be put together under existing procedures. Although it is German led in the sense that Germany has the lead role and operational control is in Potsdam, the commander will be a French general and the group will be made up of 500 German troops, 500 French troops and 500 from other European nations. The United Kingdom has had to plead overstretch, so we will offer only one officer for the headquarters in Potsdam, although we will make a financial contribution of about &#8364;3 million towards the administrative costs of the venture.</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) made the point very well: we cannot have a commitment on paper by European nations to participate in such exercises if they cannot actually fulfil their commitment to service the battlegroups.</p>

 I will keep my remarks brief, but I want to make one or two comments about the European summit later this week. I begin by remarking on energy issues. I understand that the question of energy will be discussed at the summit, and I very much welcome that, in view of what has happened to energy prices in this country over the past few months. The Government have embarked on an energy review and I understand that the summit will discuss a short paper that has been drawn up by Javier Solana and the Commission on security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para8"><a name="06061463000005">The markets in Europe are not liberalised, and the problems that we experience in this country often stem from the fact that we have a liberalised market while our colleagues in Europe do not. I therefore ask the Minister what the discussion is likely to achieve. I understand that it is due to finish in the presidencies next year with another form of review, but I hope that our Ministers at the summit will press our European colleagues for the liberalisation of European markets in order that we can buy supplies of energy in other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para9"><a name="06061463000006">Earlier this year, our gas prices in particular were increasing rapidly, yet there was no shortage of supply world wide. We could not access other sources of gas in order to bring those prices down. Members will remember that in January the Russians turned off the gas supplies to Ukraine, and that generated fears that Russia would be in command of gas supplies to the rest of Europe. I understand that European Commissioners have suggested deals between the EU and the Russians to ensure that supplies flow to the rest of Europe. However, the Germans have already signed a separate deal with the Russians on a gas pipeline, which could well undermine the efforts that are to be made at the summit on agreeing a common energy policy. The point that I want to leave with my right hon. Friend the Minister is that he must press for the liberalisation of the markets in Europe in order that we can access them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para10"><a name="06061463000007">I also want to say a few words on the constitution. Those issues have been well rehearsed throughout this debate and references have been made to our Ministers perhaps needing to take a stronger line and to state that, in fact, the constitution is dead. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) and I had an exchange on that, during which I referred to the fact that there were calls from politicians throughout the EU for further referendums, votes and the rest of it and that our Ministers would do well to be non-committal on the constitution in the light of those calls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para11"><a name="06061463000008">I understand that the period of reflection has been increased for another year, yet those calls still appear in our press. For example, Giscard d&#146;Estaing has called for a second French vote&#151;55 per cent. obviously was not enough for him&#151;the Italians have called for  <br>

further action on the constitution, the Germans have already said that they want constitutional issues to be resurrected, and the Belgian Prime Minister has drawn attention to the fact that about 15 states have now ratified the constitution and that, according to a clause in the constitution, if that figure increases to four fifths of member states, unique circumstances are created which mean that the constitution must be referred back to the European Council. I urge my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe to resist such a reference back to the European Council and perhaps, despite what I said earlier, to be a little more vociferous in playing down the constitution and the possibility of its resurrection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para12"><a name="06061463000009">Another worrying development are the calls for a Europe-wide referendum. If that were to be agreed, it would negate all the no votes that have already happened and could lead to countries being drawn into a European constitution without having had the chance to hold their own individual referendums. I call on my right hon. Friend to resist those calls at all costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para13"><a name="06061463000010">I shall now say a few words about Turkey and Cyprus. Earlier this week, a small crisis in Europe was averted when the Cypriots gave way and allowed the accession negotiations with Turkey to complete chapter 1&#151;an uncontroversial chapter relating to science and research. However, obstacles to Turkey&#146;s membership of the EU remain, not least opposition from other countries within the EU&#151;Germany and France, in particular&#151;that are reluctant to see Turkey accepted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para14"><a name="06061463000011">There are also obstacles within Turkey itself: for example, the human rights situation in that country, especially in the Kurdish region, is a cause of great concern. Religious issues, including the question whether Turkey is a secular state, have come to the forefront in the past few days. A Turkish general attacked Turkey&#146;s Government for not adhering more strongly to the secular state, and we hear stories of the &#147;deep state&#148;, as it is known in Turkey, where the military is influential. A few weeks ago, there was a disturbing incident when an individual walked into Turkey&#146;s highest administrative court and shot dead the judge who was presiding in a case, simply because, as the offender said afterwards, the judge had made a decision on banning religious apparel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para15"><a name="06061463000012">Such incidents sound alarm bells for Turkey&#146;s accession to the EU. Just as many people want our Government to say that the constitution is dead and we should not heed calls for further votes, perhaps we should decide once and for all whether it is appropriate to persist with the idea of Turkey&#146;s accession in spite of all the problems in that country.</p>

 I and Members of all parties in this House support the notion of Turkey&#146;s accession to the European Union, but does the hon. Gentleman share my concern that, ideally, the qualities and virtues that we seek in terms of respect for human rights, the rule of law and democracy should not be put in place merely to meet entry criteria, but should come from within? Should that not be part of the common values of EU member states, rather than seen merely as measures introduced in order to comply with the obligations placed on states that aspire to EU membership?</p>

 I agree. We should strive to establish those values in all countries, regardless of whether they aspire to EU membership. I am aware that Turkey has taken great strides to improve its internal situation at the same time as pursing its entry to the EU, but I fear that we will build up problems for ourselves if we continue to encourage Turkey to enter the EU while knowing full well that, at the moment, it simply does not meet the criteria for entry.</p>

 Having listened to European debates at periodic intervals in the past 22 years, I have noticed a fluctuation in sentiment. If we take a broad historical and political view, we can see that a new realism has at last begun to pervade debates in the House. The pity of it is that that is not reflected in the Government&#146;s policies. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, for example, in his five economic tests, his subsequent remarks, the Treasury paper a few months ago and so on, has indicated a change of mood or tempo. If he became Prime Minister he might take a more Eurosceptic view&#151;that is certainly the view of the journalists and distinguished commentators who have followed his career.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para16"><a name="06061463000016">None the less, others continue to speak the same old language in an attempt to square the circle. It is impossible, as I said earlier, to persist with the waffle and try to pretend that everything is all right just because the existing treaties are still in operation. We need a radical, clear-sighted, fundamental review of the European Union. That would not be difficult once it is under way, but&#151;and my motive in saying so is not party political&#151;the Government, for all their talk, cannot bring themselves to face reality. The right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) made their position quite clear shortly before he left the post of Foreign Secretary, when I pointed out that, to all intents and purposes, the European constitution was over and done with. The present Foreign Secretary tiptoed around the subject, but she was not prepared to spell out the Government&#146;s position. That is not leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para17"><a name="06061463000017">In a recent debate on democracy, dialogue and debate in the European Standing Committee, the Minister for Europe, using the old Laeken language, said that we wanted to get closer to citizens. The new project, otherwise known as plan D, would provide an opportunity to reconnect with citizens and their opinions. However, when I asked him whether the Government were prepared to make the 16 million euros that that they have received in the past 18 months&#151;indeed, there is much more to come&#151;from the European Commission available to Eurosceptic organisations or whether that funding was a Europhile propaganda exercise driven by the Commission, he was not prepared to answer. I invite him to do so on the Floor of the House this afternoon. Will the money, after proper debate and dialogue, be disbursed on an equal and fair basis among the organisations, or will the power of the state, the Commission and the purse determine the issue?</p>

was available for the no vote campaign, with predictable consequences. Basically, we are wasting time, as the period of reflection is going to last another year. It is actually a period of deflection, is it not? As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) accurately pointed out, it is an attempt to prolong the silence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para18"><a name="06061463000018">In the last European debate, I said that an eerie silence had descended on the Conservative Front Bench with regard to European matters. I am glad to say that that has gone. We are beginning to speak a more realistic language. We heard from the shadow Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), some words which, although I cannot say they filled me with a deep glow of enthusiasm about the so-called benefits of some aspects of the European Union, revealed a hard bottom line which had been overlooked by many commentators, including many of my friends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para19"><a name="06061463000019">As I noted in a letter to <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> yesterday, my right hon. Friend specifically committed the Conservative party to regaining control over social and employment and similar legislation. I pointed out that it was one thing to say we would do that, which is extremely important, and another to spell out the methods of reasserting national control. I went on to point out that on the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, 130 Conservative MPs supported my new clause 17, which I am informed was cleared by parliamentary counsel&#146;s office as I requested. The clause stated that it would be available to a Government, or to the Opposition when in government, to pass legislation inconsistent with the European Communities Act 1972 and, in particular, directives or regulations under section 2, and that the judiciary must be bound by that provision. That is the crunch point.</p>

He and I were direct opponents on it, although his job was to table amendments that were as close to mine as possible, so that when we called a Division, the Opposition would be able to try to claim that it was theirs as well. In fact, they were following us into the Lobby, not the other way around. I will not mention your role, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as that would be inappropriate.</p>

 I have noticed a continuing trend&#151;it happened in the debate in the Chamber the other day. The Liberal Democrats are beginning to show a degree of realism. I have never before, for example, heard them making Eurosceptic noises, but they are beginning to do so. Although I am sure the hon. Gentleman is trying to get me to make some statement on the EPP that would suit his purposes, I can say unequivocally that both before the leadership election and subsequently, I have been given clear assurances that we will withdraw from the European People&#146;s party. I do not need to enlarge on that matter, which I know a great deal about because, when I was shadow Attorney-General and shadow Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, I was directly responsible for advising the then leader on those very questions&#151;I was unequivocal and wrote a clear letter in which I said that we must withdraw from the European People&#146;s party forthwith.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="60614-0014.htm_para22"><a name="06061463000023">The matter is tied up with the European constitution. Despite the one-year period of deflection, as I call it, Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, clearly stated on 17 November last year that she is determined to bring back the European constitution. If that is the case&#151;I take Angela Merkel&#146;s statement at face value&#151;why are we having another year&#146;s reflection or deflection? I have always maintained that the European Union is a national objective for Germany, because Germany wants a European Union that it can dominate through the voting system. That is Germany&#146;s national interest, but the European constitution is most emphatically not in our national interest.</p>

There will be no renegotiations or answers to these important questions unless there is a serious attempt to get down to sorting out what we want and where we are to go. Step 1 is to repudiate the European constitution. I suggest to the Minister that in parliamentary terms, a good starting point would be to remove from the Order Paper the daily reference to the European Union Bill, because that reasserts the idea that that Bill, and therefore the implementation of the European constitution, is still part and parcel of the business of this House. This is not some arcane constitutional point&#151;it is about demonstrating political will. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston and many other Members made it clear that it is time that we abandoned the project of the constitution.

<p><a name="60614-0015.htm_spnew2"><a name="06061463000329"><b>Mr. Hoon:</b>
 I cannot resist commenting on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s own consistency. He says that things are moving in the right direction. What is clearly moving his way is the entire bulk of the Conservative party. In former days when we debated these issues, he was very much in a minority on the Conservative Benches&#151;one of a handful of people. I will not use the expression that the former Prime Minister used to describe them, but it was not at all complimentary. Nowadays, Conservative Front Benchers support his position. He is in the mainstream of Conservative party thinking, and I congratulate him on that.</p>

 I accept that compliment. However, the essence of Conservatism is building organically upon change in a realistic, practical and pragmatic fashion. For example, Disraeli had to take a position on the policies of the mid-19th century and he helped, with John Bright from the other side of the House, to promote democracy in the late 19th century. Those who resisted that point of view 25 years earlier came around to it. The same applies to the appeasement policies of the 1930s, home rule and tariff reform. The bottom line is that we make changes and the European issue is an example of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="60614-0015.htm_para1"><a name="06061463000034">I shall conclude with a quote from the excellent book that I cited earlier. It states:</p>

However, if the Government, leaders of other member states and the European Commission are not prepared to face up to the challenge of being realistic, exercising the political will to save Europe and sorting out the boundaries between co-operation and European Government&#151;and to do something about it tomorrow, when the summit takes place, thus changing the nature of the European Union&#151;they will betray Europe and this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="60614-0015.htm_para3"><a name="06061463000036">The Government have an opportunity to save democracy and ensure that we move into the 21st century with economic competitiveness to answer the challenges of the new globalised world. The failure of the Lisbon agenda gives them a reason to do so; otherwise, they merely whistle in the wind. It is the moment of truth. They can do it. I do not believe that they will but, when they fail, it will be their responsibility and the people of this country will turn against them and turn them out of office. Just as those in favour of the constitution failed in France and Holland, so the Government would have failed in this country had the question of the future of Europe been put in a referendum, as it should have been many years ago.</p>

Even better for the Minister for Europe as he gets on his RAF plane tomorrow morning and heads off with the Foreign Secretary, the hon.

The recent Ernst and Young report on the result of the latest wave of enlargement and the arrival of the 10 new countries showed that it had benefited the economy of this country by &#163;300 million.

They were told that they might be admitted on 1 January 2007, although there might now be a slippage to 2008; we are told that the decision is to be put back to October 2006.

a firm timetable by the time the summit ended. It is also important that the Government stick to the commitment that they made earlier this year that there would be an indication by August this year on the most important aspect of enlargement as far as Romania and Bulgaria were concerned&#151;people&#146;s freedom of movement.</p>

We do not want a repeat of the fiasco that took place before the last enlargement, when we did not have a position on whether workers from the 10 new countries would have the right to work here, or whether they would have to register. That was followed by hysteria from the Conservatives, who said that all those people would come into this country, take our jobs and our homes and cause misery for the people of Britain. Of course that turned out to be perfectly unfounded. Let us have a clear timetable, so that there can be no hysteria from the Conservatives about what we are going to decide on freedom of movement.</p>

I am disappointed with what has happened; we need to ensure that if Cyprus and Turkey are going to continue their long-standing dispute, the EU will act as an honest broker to try to sort out the problems.

 It is a point, but I urge the hon. Gentleman to read the Ernst and Young report, which examines specifically the arrival of Poles, Hungarians and others from EU countries and finds that they have been a benefit to our economy. If there is new evidence, that will have to be considered. Enlargement has benefited us, however, to the tune of &#163;300 million. In addition, other countries, having seen what Britain did, have decided to do the same. The French have agreed to open their categories so that people from the states that joined in 2004 will be able to work in France too. Obviously, we will need to keep all of that under consideration. As for Bulgaria and Romania, we should have a clear timetable and a clear decision from the Government so that we know where we stand on the issue of freedom of movement for those from the new member states.</p>

I also defer to the knowledge of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) and the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), who both represented the House on the Committee that considered the constitution. When such Members, who represent this House, scrutinise what is happening in Europe and come back here to talk about their concerns, we should listen. They would be the first to say that they raised those concerns long before the conclusion of the discussions, and many of us did not listen to or hear what they had to say.

Who do we have to thank for extending qualified majority voting and making sure Europe operated in a much more efficient way? We thank the Conservative Government who held office before 1979, who extended QMV more than any other Government in history. If we consider the results of QMV, we will find that we have been on the winning side on QMV votes on a much larger scale than any of the other big countries. The last time I looked at the figures, 90 per cent. of the times that we voted according to QMV, we won.

 The Foreign Secretary has said that she will look into this whole area, as we are obliged to do, having taken part in the entire Tampere process, which started during the last Finnish presidency in 1999. We must look at that process and see whether it is in our interests. The Government will propose it if it is in our interest to combat crime by moving forward in that way. In making such a decision, I do not want to substitute my view for that of the Foreign Secretary and her experts. However, when that decision is made, the hon.

The Foreign Office mandarins are wonderful and I pay tribute to them&#151;the people who used to work for me at the Foreign Office were among the finest civil servants in the galaxy; they were top-quality, first-class diplomats&#151;so I will have no problem if we have one diplomatic service for Europe. I do not think we will ever get such a service, but if we do, I am willing to bet anyone in this House that the civil servants will all be British, because they are the best in Europe. However, the problem is that the Foreign Office is very concerned about structure. Let me give an example by telling an anecdote.</p>

The Foreign Secretary said, &#147;Because your portfolio is so big, I&#146;m afraid you&#146;re going to have to give up Russia. Russia is so huge, as part of the Europe portfolio, that it will have to go to another Minister; otherwise you&#146;ll have more than 50 per cent. of all those portfolios.&#148; So I agreed to give up Russia.</p>

decently it treats its minorities, I hope that I am not about to put that too much to the test in relation to my Front-Bench colleagues and the Whips. It is a pleasure to make what is for me a rare speech on European matters, and I have enjoyed the debate this afternoon. I take the point made by other hon. Members that the atmosphere is not dissimilar to that of an end-of-term Adjournment debate, and there are some familiar faces who have taken part in all of those.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="60614-0015.htm_para22"><a name="06061463000065">I share strongly with the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) and my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) the opinion that Europe is much too important a subject to be left to a handful of aficionados who either take an interest in the matter outside the Chamber, as I do, or take part in our debates. I suggest to the Minister for Europe that one way to deal with that might be to have this debate on a motion that we could divide the House on, with a free vote. There are precious few free votes in this House. The hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor), my successor in that constituency, introduced a 10-minute Bill earlier designed to engage people more in political affairs, but we could achieve that by having many more free votes. We all know what our postbags are like on free votes, especially when the issue is in doubt and Members can say what they think and influence policy by doing so. I am not saying what the motion should be and I have no idea what the result would be, but it would fill the House and the Galleries and create the interest that we want.</p>

 I would welcome a free vote on British entry to the euro and on the constitution, because it would of course be extended to Ministers and Parliamentary Private Secretaries.

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para0"><a name="06061463000068">We have had an enjoyable debate. As someone who takes part in such debates only intermittently, I always learn a great deal from colleagues on both sides of the House. Over Whitsuntide, I travelled to Serbia, Macedonia and Albania. While the legacy of communism is not hard to find in eastern Europe, it is always encouraging and illuminating to see what has survived despite it. The reason for my visit was to celebrate the activities of a remarkable group of young people whom I have come to know in recent years. They come from many different countries in the Balkans, but they share a determination to go into public life with integrity in lands where trust, honesty and integrity have been heavy casualties in a dictatorship of fear. Working together, and mostly sharing a belief that the principles of Jesus Christ form an opportunity to come together and not divide, whatever one&#146;s religious background, they have slowly begun to emerge in more senior positions in politics, business and the media in their own countries. That has been the result of great commitment and dedication. At the third Balkan gathering in Belgrade, more than  <br>

150 people came together to celebrate the fact that the human spirit could not be crushed, and that faith and principle had been reduced only temporarily by repression and corruption. As with apartheid, the agony is not that dictatorship fails&#151;it always does&#151;but that it succeeds all too well in damaging mind and soul, leaving a moral and material vacuum that takes time to fill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para1"><a name="06061463000069">The countries that I am talking about are on their way. They boast busy capitals, where young people enjoy caf&#233;s, bars and restaurants. The atmosphere is open and modern but, under the surface, all three countries are poor. Unemployment is at around 35 to 40 per cent., and foreign investment is low. Politics is fiercely contested but democratic&#151;the recent referendum to detach Montenegro from Serbia rested on a knife edge. The forthcoming election in Macedonia will be close, but is likely that a centre-right Government will be returned. A Government of similar colour was returned in Albania last year, after losing power for eight years. That is an example of the sort of turn-and-turn-about politics of which this House would be proud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para2"><a name="06061463000070">Infrastructure is poor. Roads, services and transport links need investment, and professionals are poorly rewarded. A teacher in Albania, for example, will work for &#8364;240 a month&#151;not an uncommon salary for a public-sector professional.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para3"><a name="06061463000071">Old socialist attitudes die hard. An excellent private university in Skopje struggles with a Government who are not impressed with its initiative, but students pay and flow through the doors for quality teaching. A private company is told by the Government to employ people full-time, even if the contracts are not there to support such a work force. People want domestic economic reform along lines very familiar to Conservative Members, but they fear that it is happening all too slowly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para4"><a name="06061463000072">The worst damage has been done by the corrupt nature of government and its impact on trust and integrity. Public confidence is low, so too many talented and qualified people believe that their future can lie only outside their own land. Those who work abroad&#151;and 1 million out of 4 million Albanians do so&#151;send their remittances home and make a vital contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para5"><a name="06061463000073">Those people, both in government and out of it, who are working to combat the trend, need our full support. I met Ministers and politicians in every country determined to make a difference. So let us salute Samuel and his team in Belgrade for their faith in their country, and for their determination to fire people with a desire to stay and work for a brighter future</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para6"><a name="06061463000074">Let us also acknowledge the work of Vilma Trajkovska in Macedonia. She is the widow of a reforming president who was a key architect of the agreement that brought peace between Macedonia and Kosovo in 2001, yet who tragically died in a air crash three years later. Madam Trajkovska now heads an international foundation established in her husband&#146;s memory, and continues his work of defusing conflict and building a modern Balkans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para8"><a name="06061463000076">One further theme unites all those people, and virtually all the political parties in their countries&#151;the importance of joining the EU. It is very easy, in the democratic security of these islands, to forget the EU&#146;s political origins. We find little need to recall the shattered remnants of continental Europe, but we were never occupied. The legacy of a century or sometimes more of racial, ethnic and nationalistic conflict is the reality of everyday memory for millions of people in continental Europe. The EU&#146;s political impact as a force for stability, a yardstick for advancement and a barrier to all that ever happening again should never be discounted. There are very few members of the &#147;Better Off Out&#148; brigade in the western Balkans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para9"><a name="06061463000077">My right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) is on the ball. In a recent speech, he said:</p>

We have seen the EU&#146;s effectiveness in the last quarter century in the Mediterranean, we have seen it in the new members from central and eastern Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and we see it now in the Balkans and Turkey. Enlargement has been a triumphant success.</p>

It is easy to be blind to the faults of the EU when one comes from where the Balkan countries are coming from, but perhaps they see a truth in the existence of the EU that bears our being reminded of it. Equally, however, the EU has now got to step up to the plate. If the EU does not reform and deliver, it will risk letting down all those people who are pinning so many hopes on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para11"><a name="06061463000078">Even those who are interested in reform and reconstruction of the EU can now feel some greater optimism for its future. For many years, a cautious and moderate centre-right Conservative voice has warned of the worst faults of the EU, imploring it to wake up to a wider world, stop the endless self-analysis of institutions and accept that the blueprint of the 1950s, dealing with the challenges of that time, may not be the only way forward. My right hon. Friend&#146;s recent speech also had much of that spot on. He said:</p>
<a name="60614-0016.htm_brev2"><a name="06061463000263"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Britain is well placed to lead and challenge some orthodoxies of recent decades that are now so clearly failing. We must replace the habits of heavy regulation and rigidity with freedom and flexibility.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para13"><a name="06061463000080">The new Chancellor of Germany has made some recent speeches that indicate how far centre-right thinking is moving in answer to the familiar and tedious sclerosis of the EU.

Does Europe make things easier, better or does it put a brake on them, put obstacles in their way? I believe that we should not avoid these questions.

 I am not sure how far I can commit the Chancellor of Germany to following all of my hon. Friend&#146;s agenda.

What must we do and support collectively, and what must we do on our own as nation states to draw distinctions and identify differences? Whatever it may be called, that issue has still not been sorted out, and until it is, the arrangements will not work.

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para25"><a name="06061463000098">Let me identify another blind spot on which I should like to hear from the Minister in due course. I should like the German presidency of the EU to take development and aid issues more seriously than appears likely at present. Those issues were rightly moved up the agenda under the UK presidency, and an ever-shrinking world continues to demand that we recognise the need to attack world poverty and injustice through a judicious balance of aid, trade and capacity-building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para26"><a name="06061463000099">It is rumoured that the forthcoming summit of the G8 and the German presidency of the EU may not maintain interest in international development issues. It is most likely that Germany will concentrate on economic and intellectual property, but that may provide openings. Perhaps the Minister will let me know what the Government are doing to ensure that development issues are a specific focus for Germany in 2007, so that the Gleneagles commitments can be built on. That may mean holding Government to account for promises that they have made, or pressing them on new promises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para27"><a name="06061463000100">If development is not to be a focus in itself, how will we seek to use any agenda that Chancellor Merkel sets out to press for progress on commitments to developing countries? It would be a shame if we went back on everything that has been achieved, and I hope  <br>

that we shall be able to make progress. Given the effectiveness of the Department for International Development, I, along with a number of my colleagues, still feel that the EU may not always be the best vehicle for dealing with the amount of aid that is involved. I should welcome any comfort that the Minister can offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para28"><a name="06061463000101">As others have said today, the main thing is to recognise that, as the European Union stands at a crossroads once again&#151;it seems to do that during most weeks&#151;there are real causes for optimism, provided that the EU continues to listen to the moderate centre-right voices of reform that have been so consistently championed by Conservative Members. My right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks&#151;&#151;I am delighted to see that he has returned to the Chamber&#151;said in his speech on Europe the other week:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para29"><a name="06061463000102">I entirely agree. I am sure that when my right hon.

I am sure that he will urge the Government to recognise that there are valuable opportunities for reform and progress, and that in driving forward reform and progress in Germany, Angela Merkel is giving a lesson that the Government, in their indolence, would do well to follow.</p>

 I know that others want to speak before the winding-up speeches, so I shall be briefer than I should have wished to be otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para30"><a name="06061463000104">The debate has been very good-natured, as such debates usually are. I had expected a degree of consensus on the idea that the constitution was dead, just as joining the euro was dead, until my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) let the cat out of the bag by acting as an outrider for the European Union&#151;as he often does&#151;and suggesting that the whole point of a pause for reflection in this country was that it was a pause to persuade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="60614-0016.htm_para31"><a name="06061463000105">It was good that we received some copies of the text of the Minister&#146;s speech earlier. Particularly valuable was this quotation:</p>

Mr. Sch1/4ssel added that he was convinced that something new had to be added to the document and that this could be a new name or method for adoption of the document. The idea that renaming the constitution makes it more acceptable fundamentally misses the point, as does the suggestion that, because we are having difficulties with the present procedure for ratification, we need to find a new way of adopting the document. That does not recognise that perhaps the document itself is part of the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para1"><a name="06061463000108">There is a similar proposal from the Belgian Liberal Premier, Mr. Verhofstadt, who said:</p>
<a name="60614-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="06061463000274"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If four fifths of the Member States have ratified it and one or more Member States have encountered difficulty in proceeding with ratification, the matter will be referred to the European Council.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para2"><a name="06061463000109">Basically, he was saying that that was a good idea and the way in which the matter should be progressed. That also indicates that ratification of the constitution is still sought by much of Europe and that the difficulty is seen to be with those peoples who have not yet chosen to ratify the constitution. There is a wonderful comment from Giscard d&#146;Estaing, who said:</p>
<a name="60614-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="06061463000275"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What is this joke? We have to vote again until the French see what the stakes are&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para3"><a name="06061463000110">There is no limit there or the suggestion that there should only be a single vote. They should keep on voting, presumably on the basis of re-sits that they continue to take, until they come up with the right answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para4"><a name="06061463000111">The constitution is dead, but many people will not admit it. I remember the enthusiasm in this Chamber shown by the Liberal party when the Luxemburgers voted in a referendum to support the constitution. I was reminded of the way in which the Albanians used to say, &#147;We and the Chinese are 7 billion strong.&#148; The Liberals were able to say that, with the Luxemburgers, they could fill a reasonably large charabanc with supporters of the European constitution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para5"><a name="06061463000112">The drive, however, to a united European and ever-closer union has not gone away. Those who focus on the constitution as the main issue and who see its stalling as a great success and as some sort of political victory misunderstand what is happening elsewhere. The drive to a superstate continues and the flow continues towards ever-closer union. I had wanted to say something about the drive to a European defence agency, about ever-closer union on asylum issues, justice and home affairs and about the power being taken by the Commission under the guidance of the European Court of Justice to establish lists of crimes for which punishments have to be established by Europe. I also wanted to refer to the space agency and the work that has been done to establish a diplomatic service even though its establishment was clearly in the constitution and should not have proceeded. However, a consular service is being set up with embassies abroad, which is a clear example of a proposal in the constitution being proceeded with anyway. The work of the European Court of Justice is also greatly increasing the drive towards centralisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para6"><a name="06061463000113">I had also hoped to touch on issues relating to health and tax in which the ECJ continues to take powers from the United Kingdom.

matters. Again, that is a completely new area of work that the EU hopes to expand. The ECJ has recently taken the decision that it, rather than an outside body, should preside over disputes between member states. Again, that is the expansion of power into new areas in which the EU did not previously see itself as having a role, but which it now explicitly states that it wishes to take on. The question is what we do about all that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para7"><a name="06061463000114">I have come to the conclusion that reform of the budget is impossible without some sort of car crash. I believe that we should vote to reject the European budget when we have the opportunity to do so in order to concentrate minds. It seems clear that even the voice of the people in France and Holland is being ignored. Unless the situation is brought to a crisis, the elites of Europe will pay no attention. I regret the fact that we are in that position, but if those in power above us have no intention of listening to the will of the people on these issues, we have little choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para8"><a name="06061463000115">Finally, I would like to offer the Minister a suggestion about how he could make himself even more popular<i> &#151;[Interruption]&#151;</i>if that were possible. My suggestion would also give the European Union a good name. EU beef has in the past been distributed to pensioners in my constituency from the enormous surplus stocks, as has EU butter and cheese. I am aware that there are enormous stocks of surplus EU wine, so I propose that the Minister take the initiative and seek agreement with his colleagues to give some wine from the EU wine lake to pensioners in my constituency&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Yes, to others, too, but pensioners first. I suggest that this be called the Hoon allocation, which would ensure that his name was remembered throughout the country for a long time to come.</p>

 I secured a Labour gain when I was first elected in 1992 and my majority has climbed ever since to become the second largest in Scotland. I do not believe, however, that there is any necessary connection between that and the fact that the Minister has never been to my constituency. I would like to make it clear that it would not be necessary for him to hand-deliver the wine himself, only to ensure that it is done. I will arrange the distribution, and I am willing to name it after him. The Hoon allocation, or something similar, would make sure that he is remembered for more than he has been up to now. After all, his predecessor will be remembered for the destruction of the European constitution in France and Holland during his period of office, so perhaps the Minister for Europe will be prepared to help lubricate political discussion on the EU constitution during his time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para9"><a name="06061463000124">To move on to more serious matters, I have taken to heart the injunction of the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) earlier this afternoon when he said that 95 per cent. of our debates on these issues repeat points that have already been made before. I hope not to say anything that I have said here before, but it means that my speech is split into three rather odd parts. The first is about the television without frontiers directive, an important measure being considered at the moment. The second is about mobile telephony charges and the third is about the EU and its relations with Iran.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para10"><a name="06061463000125">On the first, many Members will not think of the television without frontiers directive as the single most important issue on the stocks at the moment. In 1989, it allowed originally for the system of listed events, which means that we are able to watch the World cup on free-to-air television as well as the Olympics and other events. The Commission is proposing some changes, some of which are to be welcomed and some are sincerely not to be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para11"><a name="06061463000126">The first that should not be welcomed is the proposal to extend the directive to all audio-visual media services, because that creates the danger of the European Commission bringing forward policy that should properly be the regard of individual member states. The Commission is also in danger of doing that in suggesting that there should be a specific rule governing all audio-visual services in Europe with regard to incitement of hatred on various levels. That commitment would go considerably further than UK law. Freedom of speech, as it plays out in each member state, should be for that member state to determine and not for the EU to determine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para12"><a name="06061463000127">The television without frontiers directive also suggests that there should be changes to the protection of minors. For the most part, articles 3d and 3g(f) are sensible measures. All of us would like audio-visual services across Europe to protect minors, and I would  <br>

argue that more stringent controls on the broadcasting of advertisements to children that promote eating and drinking wholly inappropriate food and drink, which in turn does not lead to a healthy lifestyle, would be only right and proper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para13"><a name="06061463000128">Ofcom has suggested rather tentative measures that fail to address the fact that the vast majority of children watch not children&#146;s programmes but adult programmes. For instance, the most watched television programme among nine to 14-year-olds is &#147;Coronation Street&#148;, which is sponsored by and advertises Cadbury. We need to address a real problem: our youngsters face a crisis of obesity and if we do not tackle that robustly, we will make a big mistake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para14"><a name="06061463000129">The directive also moves forward on the issue of product placement. Members who have watched a Bond movie will have noticed that product placement is an important part of the way in which most American-funded films are made. It is not that I want to interfere with that, but there should be honesty about the way that products are placed in television programmes, particularly those paid for by the licence fee. I note that the BBC no longer insists on people saying sticky-backed plastic instead of Sellotape, and I do not have a problem with that, but I would not want to go down the US route, where programmes are sponsored by Coca-Cola and there are large Coca-Cola cups in front of jurors for &#147;The X Factor&#148; or &#147;Pop Idol&#148; and so on. Audiences want to know when they are being sold something and we should support that important part of the directive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para15"><a name="06061463000130">One issue that, as far as I know, has never been mentioned in this House but has been debated at some length in Europe is the cost of mobile telephony when roaming around other countries in Europe. I thought that we were meant to have a single market, yet the difference in cost between a Latvian phoning home when in Malta and a British person phoning from Germany is dramatic. Mobile telephone companies have been grossly overcharging around Europe for many years. It is only because of the Commission&#146;s intervention in the past few months that, at the very last minute, some mobile phone companies have decided to cut their fees for roaming calls. I am glad that they are doing so, but it is only sometimes thanks to the international efforts of the European Commission&#151;for which it rarely gets any praise, although I note that it managed to get a whole laudatory front page out of the <i> Daily Mail</i> on one occasion&#151;that some businesses are prepared to take action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para16"><a name="06061463000131">I end by talking about an area to which the Foreign Secretary referred: EU-Iran relations. I know that many hon. Members and many members of the public feel that the most important issue to be addressed at the moment is that of Iran&#146;s intentions when it comes to enrichment of plutonium. I share that concern and I believe that Britain has played an important role, working with our French and German colleagues, to make sure that we have a robust policy. That has paid dividends by bringing not only the Russians and Chinese, but the Americans to a sane and sensible position. I hope that the Iranians will, in the very near future, respond positively to the proposal for talks. The EU representative, Javier Solana, has also played an important role in ensuring that the negotiations  <br>

between the EU3 have been successful and that the Iranian Government fully understand the EU position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para17"><a name="06061463000132">Equally important, however, is the issue of human rights in Iran. Iran&#146;s human rights record is grisly. It has been so for many years, but in many ways it has become worse in the past 18 months. Last week in the other place, Lord Triesman reported that the number of executions in Iran had increased dramatically compared with this time last year. We know that the use of the death penalty in Iran is on the increase: Amnesty International reckons that there were at least 94 instances of its use last year in Iran, and the International Federation of Human Rights estimates a much higher number of cases&#151;between 300 and 400.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para18"><a name="06061463000133">I know that not all hon. Members believe that the death penalty is wrong. I believe that it is wrong in all instances, just as torture is wrong, but it is particularly wrong when it is imposed on minors&#151;those aged under 18. Last year, at least nine people aged under 18 were executed in Iran. In 2004, a 16-year-old girl was hanged for fornication and a 14-year-old boy was whipped to death for eating during Ramadan. That is not a situation that people either in this country or across the European Union can countenance any longer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para19"><a name="06061463000134">Furthermore, the death penalty is regularly used in Iran for lavaat, or homosexuality. On 19 July 2005, Ayaz Marhuuni and Mahmoud Askari were executed in Mashhad. They were both 17, although the authorities tried to say that they were 19, and at the time of the alleged crimes, they were probably 15 or 16. Almost certainly, the charges presented against them, which changed from day to day, were trumped up. Not only were they hanged, but it was not a British-style hanging; instead, as is often the case when the death penalty is used for lavaat, they were executed by a slow hanging method whereby a thin cord is placed to the side of the neck so that the neck does not break and the person struggles on the cord, often for several minutes, before being asphyxiated. It is a deliberately brutal and cruel death, which we should not countenance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para20"><a name="06061463000135">At least 11 people were executed for lavaat between December 2004 and November 2005. Many more have been sentenced and no more has been heard of them, but we can be fairly certain that in many cases the execution has happened, not in public as used to happen, but in private. In addition to that, there are many honour killings in parts of Iran. One expert on the Ahwaz region said that homosexuals</p>
<a name="60614-0017.htm_brev2"><a name="06061463000276"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;are generally killed in Ahwaz, by the security forces or by their male kin, in one of three ways: strangulation, throat-slitting or decapitation. If the homosexual youths are killed by the security forces, their corpses&#151;frequently decapitated but accompanied by their heads&#151;are left in the street. Their families therefore have a certain tragic incentive to kill them more humanely&#148;&#151;</p>

There are, of course, countries in Europe that have a mixed record on those human rights issues, but I believe that the EU has a unique opportunity to move forward with a robust record on human rights.</p>

 After a long period away from the House, it is a pleasure to take part in one of our Euro bashes. We should have a website, &#147;Euro debaters reunited&#148;, because we debate the issue in the same fashion, and make the same arguments every six months, hands warmly clasped around one another&#146;s throats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para21"><a name="06061463000139">Our debates, however, have become rather sad. Europe used to be a serious threat for some Members, but now it has all the savagery of a dead sheep. Some Members regard it as a bright vision to distract people from reality, but that vision has become remarkably tired. Europe has ceased to be relevant to our lives&#151;it is no longer a front-line issue, as it has all the excitement and relevance of a debate on late library fines or the regular brushing of teeth. It has become a backwater, and it is of less concern to us, because it is of less concern to the people of Europe. They do not want more enlargement, and they certainly do not want Turkey to join. They do not want a constitution, even though regular s&#233;ances are held in Brussels and the Government have participated in efforts to introduce it by the back door, and they do not want the hydra of a European foreign policy. As a result, Europe is treading water, and the question of what we get out of it and what it is for is more important, particularly as our contribution has risen to &#163;6 billion a year. If we include our contribution to European institutions apart from the budget, it rises to &#163;8 billion a year. If we add the cost of regulation, we pay 4 per cent. of our gross domestic product to belong to an economic union that has become the high-unemployment, low-growth blackspot of the western world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="60614-0017.htm_para22"><a name="06061463000140">Europe has opted for a system of bankers&#146; rule, resulting in high interest rates and a high exchange rate that will become even higher as the dollar comes down, thus strangling European economies, including the recently improved German economy. In the major European countries, unemployment is at 8 or 9 per cent. or even higher, but we cannot expand demand to deal with the problem. If we cannot provide economic satisfaction and run the economy for the benefit of our people by providing them with jobs, democracy is over, because they will riot and change the Government. The unions will go on strike, and nothing can be done because Europe is locked into deflation and a system of bankers&#146; rule. The French and Italians used regularly to devalue their currencies because they wanted to remain competitive against the Germans and keep their economies going, but they cannot do so any more. There is nothing that democracies can do to improve their economic position. The Minister for Europe wishes to make Europe fun and amusing, but he would  <br>

 As always, it is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), and to conclude our debate, to which stimulating contributions were made by Members on both sides of the House. Our debates have become more interesting as the need to find a new approach to EU policy becomes more pressing. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) made a characteristically good speech, and I can assure him that we will not persecute him. Indeed, I hope that he will participate in our debates more often in future. He rightly pointed to the growing consensus on deregulation and on economic reform in the EU, but a corresponding movement towards flexible structures and away from the burdens imposed by the constitution is sadly lacking.</p>

Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) made an important speech about transparency and scrutiny, and reminded the House of the role of interparliamentary bodies such as the parliamentary delegation of the Western European Union. My hon. Friend the Member for North- West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) spoke about the extraordinary arrogance of European politicians, who are determined to ignore the will of the people, and he reminded the House of the pressing economic challenge faced by the EU.</p>

Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes), the Chairman of the Select Committee, warned that the constitution might rise from the dead at precisely the time of the next general election&#151;surely an excellent reason why the Government might want to declare emphatically now that they would veto it, and that there is no point in bringing the constitution back at any time in the future. That view was shared, I think, by the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="60614-0018.htm_para2"><a name="06061463000144">My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) revealed that he has become addicted to European debates. It is a pleasure to see him back and contributing to them. He went on to highlight the folly of assuming that the constitution is dead, and warned that the Government are missing a golden opportunity to change the direction of the European Union&#151;a point also made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash).</p>

Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) made a thoughtful speech, which bodes well for the speech that she will make tomorrow at Open Europe, to which I look forward to listening. She spoke about buns and babies, big ones and small ones, ins and outs, but most crucially, she acknowledged the importance of making it possible to return powers to the member states, ending the process whereby the acquis communautaire is a one-way street. We would welcome such flexibility in the structure of the European Union.</p>

important speech my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) stated that both policies</p>
<a name="60614-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="06061463000277"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;have failed, economically and environmentally. Conservatives have long sought more local and national control in both these areas&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="60614-0018.htm_para4"><a name="06061463000147">He also spoke about reasserting</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="60614-0018.htm_para5"><a name="06061463000148">Would I be right in thinking that the party&#146;s policy would not be to rule out the idea of establishing national control with respect to the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. We have ruled out nothing in respect of the methods that we would use to achieve what all rational people must accept as a necessary objective&#151;to find a system that works, instead of one that has failed so badly. He refers to our top priority, which is to return national control of our social and employment regulations. That is critical not just for us, but in leading the way in the European Union. Only when we have done that will we see the Lisbon agenda finally unlocked and others realising that they need to make real changes if they are to avoid the relative economic decline in which the continent is at present locked.</p>

Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) spoke of the way in which the EU has changed over the past 15 years. He said that there has been more emphasis on the political structure, and he spoke in favour of a European defence structure, although he said that it could proceed only with popular support. It would be interesting to know where he believes that support will come from, as there is no evidence of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="60614-0018.htm_para7"><a name="06061463000151">The only frustration in winding up for the Opposition is that the Minister for Europe always has the last word and I cannot reply to his speech. Today, I express my sincere thanks to him for taking the unusual step of making his speech this morning to the Centre for European Reform. He has been keeping us in suspense for some time. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks said, the Minister has refused to answer questions about the future of the constitution, for fear of having to say what he would like to see in its place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="60614-0018.htm_para8"><a name="06061463000152">I read the Minister&#146;s speech with great anticipation and could hardly contain my excitement. He succeeded at least in making Europe more interesting for me. However, instead of the serious attempt that I had hoped to see to answer the burning questions of the day, there was a vacuum. Where was his position on the constitution? Does he believe it is dead or does he believe it can come back? Where was his position on the working time directive and the crucial need to regain control of our social and employment costs? Where was his answer to the question whether the Government are poised to surrender our veto over justice and police matters?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="60614-0018.htm_para9"><a name="06061463000153">My right hon. Friend referred earlier to the written answer that I received from the Home Office a couple of days ago, which stated that when such a proposal was made,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="60614-0018.htm_para11"><a name="06061463000155">In his speech this morning, the Minister for Europe stated that public support for the European Union in this country has fallen from 57 per cent. in the early 1990s to 33 per cent. today. He pointed out that 37 per cent. of British people are now looking to buy property overseas&#151;perhaps it is because they are so desperate to get away from the Labour Government. He said that huge benefits have derived from our membership of the European Union, but he also said that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="60614-0018.htm_para12"><a name="06061463000156">He blamed the people rather than himself and his colleagues, who have not communicated the case. Support might have declined as the EU has moved further away from being a market and further towards being a political union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="60614-0018.htm_para13"><a name="06061463000157">He talked about the huge political disillusionment across Europe that leads to low turnout in elections. Does he agree that disillusionment is greater when democratic choices are ignored, as the French and Dutch referendums appear to have been, or when Governments, such as our own, refuse the opportunity to hold a vote in the first place? He discussed the need to create a Europe that addresses the priorities of the people, but he does not seem to understand that the wide priorities will come to the fore in European affairs only when we have finally consigned the constitution to the dustbin and recognised that that is precisely the wrong direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="60614-0018.htm_para14"><a name="06061463000158">The British Government have been content to sit mute and vacillating showing no leadership and making no contribution to the debate. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston has hinted, there is a danger that they will look stupid if they continue just to sit. It would be better if we were represented at the summit by someone like the Czech President, Vaclav Klaus, who is a man of real principle and who will be putting the arguments, which British Ministers should be making, for a more flexible EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="60614-0018.htm_para22"><a name="06061463000166">The British Government failed miserably to set out a new vision for the European Union during their presidency, and they also squandered the following six months. The so-called period of reflection has been a period of silence for Britain. While other EU Governments have variously ratified the EU constitution, called for the French to vote again and said that the treaty should be cherry-picked or that it should proceed for some countries and not for others, the British Government have said nothing.</p>

We have begun to set out how the EU must change if it is to prosper in future. It should not be an ever-closer union pursuing an outdated dream of increased integration; instead, it should be a structure to aid and encourage co-operation between free democratic member states. At the core of the EU should be a truly open internal market. Our aim should be to remove the remaining obstacles to trade and to widen boundaries. The creation of a new transatlantic free trade area would be a better goal for Britain to pursue than the absurd obsession with a constitution for Europe.</p>

Nothing that we have heard from the Government today or in the past 12 months gives grounds for optimism that they have the vision or energy to lead the European Union out of its current crisis.</p>

 I am delighted to see that debate on Europe&#146;s priorities is very much alive in this House.

Council and in the future, is to ensure that the EU continues to deliver real outcomes on a programme designed to address the serious problems of the day, which are of course also the issues that our citizens care passionately about. The 39 per cent. turnout at the 2004 European elections shows that despite the fact that we are working more closely with EU institutions than ever before on an agenda that has been very much driven by the United Kingdom, our citizens do not always see the benefits and opportunities that our EU membership provides.

There was a handful of supporters for such views but the great majority of Conservative Members, including Front Benchers&#151;such as the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, who was about to become a Cabinet Minister&#151;were essentially pro-European, supportive of the Maastricht treaty and arguing for its acceptance by the House and the country. Now, the hon. Member for Stone represents the mainstream of Conservative thinking on Europe. I detect little difference between what he used to say then and what Conservative Front Benchers say today.

 No. What interested me about contributions from the Conservative Benches was the subtle, sophisticated and straightforward speech that the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) made. He always speaks eloquently and clearly. Let us contrast that with the position of most other Conservative Members. In the hon. Gentleman&#146;s plea in favour of his unrequited passion for the German Chancellor, he did not seem to see the logic of the position that he was setting out. He said that the German Chancellor, a Christian Democrat, was setting out a vision for Europe that Conservatives should adopt. What is the reaction of the leader of the Conservative party? He does not want to meet the German Chancellor, who is the leading light on the centre right in Europe today. I have had more meetings with the German Chancellor than the leader of the Conservative party has. I have probably held more meetings than most Conservative Members have with leading members of the Christian Democrats throughout Europe. That demonstrates the Conservative party&#146;s isolation in Europe.</p>

Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady). The Conservatives want a wholesale change in the treaty. That is a perfectly proper political ambition&#151;or at least, it would be if even one other party in the European Union agreed with them. However, they are totally isolated and playing a game of fantasy Europe. They invent policies because they cannot deal with the reality of what is happening in the European Union today. They are trying to pretend that somehow, there is a way through without facing reality. Unless and until they face up to the genuine issues and problems, no one can take their views seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="60614-0019.htm_para1"><a name="06061463000180">The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks gave an entertaining, characteristically witty speech.

 The Minister questions Conservative policies. Will he enlighten the House on his party&#146;s policy on the constitution? Why have there been so many U-turns, with the Prime Minister wanting a referendum and then not wanting one?</p>

 As I have already said, the difference between the Labour party and the Conservative party is that we are dealing, day in, day out, with the realities of what is happening in the European Union. The hon. Gentleman was not here at the time of the Maastricht treaty debates, which occupied the House for months on end. At that stage, the Conservative Government were grappling with the detail and having to confront the realities of constitutional change in the European Union. It was a painful process for the Conservative party, because the hon. Member for Stone and his sidekicks caused enormous trouble for the then Government. Nevertheless, that treaty was ratified in the end. It was agreed by the House on behalf of this country. That is the difference between the Conservative party then, when it was seriously engaged in European issues, and its current pathetic attempt to pretend that it is discussing those matters.</p>

 I am touched by the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s obsession with the internal politics of the Conservative party rather than with the politics of the Labour party and the Government. If he and his colleagues have made such a positive case for the European Union over the past nine years, why is it so incredibly unpopular in polls up and down this country, and across the whole of Europe?</p>

 The European Union is not incredibly unpopular. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman go and look at the various soundings that are taken on this issue. Neither is it popular, however, as I made clear in my speech this morning to the Centre for European Reform. My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda mentioned mobile phone costs earlier, and we need to set out the way in which Europe makes a huge difference to people&#146;s lives. Another practical illustration of that is the number of cheap flights that all our constituents take advantage of these days. Anyone who comes to my local airport, East Midlands airport, will see planes full of our constituents travelling regularly on cheap flights across Europe&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.]</i> I am being heckled about this. I have to say that I too am on those flights, so I speak from experience. Those changes were achieved in this country only as a result of legislation in the European Union.</p>

 I am sorry that my hon. Friend made that point, because he is completely wrong. If he looks at the history of the development of European transport he will see that the only reason why those cheap flights are possible is that, through the European Union, we brought an end to the restrictive practices under which a limited number of national carriers were protected by their Governments and prevented from flying from airports such as East Midlands and many other regional airports around the country to regional airports in other parts of the European Union.</p>

demonstrate the benefits that flow from an increasingly integrated single market. Who was the Prime Minister who regularly extended qualified majority voting in order to ensure that we had a successful functioning single market? It was Baroness Thatcher. When I was a member of the Legal Committee of the European Parliament dealing with single market issues, she was responsible on 12 occasions for changing the basis of qualified majority voting to ensure that the development of the single market benefited the people of the United Kingdom and of the European Union. We must ensure that that process continues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="60614-0019.htm_para3"><a name="06061463000190">We must go on completing the single market, because it provides benefit for British business and enormous opportunities, in an enlarged European Union, to sell to a single market of 460 million consumers. That has been an enormous advantage for the United Kingdom, and when the Conservatives were thinking seriously about European issues, they recognised that. We now have no idea where they stand on those issues. They are supposed to be sympathetic to the interests of British business, but their policies would challenge the basis on which many businesses in the United Kingdom operate, which is selling into a large single market.</p>

 I regret that a Home Office Minister has drawn the short straw in having to reply to this debate. I shall not cast any aspersions on the Home Office; I shall leave that entirely to the Home Secretary. I want to raise the effects of ending work permit-free entry for international medical graduates who complete their training by working in the national health service, which will affect several thousand doctors&#151;I have heard estimates of between 10,000 and 17,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="60614-0019.htm_para9"><a name="06061463000198">The regulations were suddenly brought in on 10 March, without consultation and without discussion in the Commons. They came into effect on 3 April, and the immediate reaction was fear among international medical graduates working in the health service about their futures. Would they be allowed to stay? Would they have to have a work permit? What would happen to them? The matter was brought to my attention by Pakistani doctors in Grimsby, where more than 100 international medical graduates work in our local hospital trust. The more I found out about what is being done, the more disgraceful the situation looked. There was a working-training relationship whereby graduates from Pakistan, India&#151;which over-produces doctors by a considerable amount&#151;Bangladesh, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and other Commonwealth countries came here to complete their training by working in the health service and did not need work permits to do so. That relationship benefits us, the health service that employs them and the home country, because those doctors return better skilled and better trained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="60614-0019.htm_para10"><a name="06061463000199">The NHS has always incorporated international medical graduates, whose initial qualifications were obtained outside the UK, under the permit-free training system. We therefore had a commitment to help train international medical graduates from the Commonwealth, who work as house officers, senior house officers and in other capacities in the health service. Some of them stay on to higher grade posts, some obtain qualifications from the royal colleges and improve their skills when they get back home, and some stay and work as GPs, often in the most difficult and deprived areas of the country, where we need them. Some, of course, go home. The system has served us well. It has served the origin countries well, too, as the training that they get is of a high standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="60614-0019.htm_para11"><a name="06061463000200">Suddenly, under the new regulations, preference must be given to graduates of British universities. Nobody quibbles with that; everybody accepts it. We must have a preference for doctors produced in our own country. The second preference, however, is for doctors from the European economic area. That means that Commonwealth doctors who previously came in without work permits will now be disadvantaged. There are doubts about the linguistic abilities and relevance of the training received by doctors in the European economic area compared with the skills and linguistic abilities of international medical graduates who must take the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board test to work in this country. The PLAB will not be required for European economic area doctors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="60614-0019.htm_para13"><a name="06061463000202">My first question is why was this measure rushed in, given that it is so far-reaching, and will impact on many doctors and other people working in the health service, and on many relationships with Commonwealth countries? I can see no reason, apart from to allow the Prime Minister to announce a new immigration system for this country, into which doctors suddenly had to be crammed at the last minute. The intention behind the old work permit-free system was to give a preference to Commonwealth doctors, but the organisations concerned were not consulted about the new measure, which was simply rushed in during March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="60614-0019.htm_para14"><a name="06061463000203">My second question is, why was there no consultation? I made a mistake in the early-day motion that I tabled on this issue. I said that the British Medical Association was hardly consulted, but it corrected that; it was not consulted at all. It informed me that there was a meeting in January at which the intention of introducing a new scheme was vaguely announced, but no time or other specifics were given; the scheme was announced, rather than discussed. Suddenly, a couple of months later&#151;in March&#151;the scheme was rushed in. So there has been no consultation with the BMA.</p>

Are they going to be allowed to complete their training? What rights will they be given? None of that has been considered and there was no mention of it in the announcement. The effect has been to produce uncertainty in the health service and the medical professions, and I do not understand why the Departments involved should have acted as they did. We are talking about a highly skilled work force, to whom we owe a huge debt of gratitude and on whom the health service depends. It is monstrous that this should have happened.</p>

We are still going to need them, as the European economic area cannot produce enough graduate doctors to fill the huge gap that is going to open up. At present, between 10,000 and 17,000 such people work in the health service: we will not get that many from Europe, so we must work out how to deal with the consequences of ending the scheme.</p>

imposing new rules out of the blue, which will cause great damage to the NHS and to trainees who provide a valuable service in many parts of the country.

I am sure that the relevant high commissions and other organisations are making their own lobbying arrangements, but the most important thing is to find a way to avoid the consequences of the measure&#146;s sudden imposition. We must begin a consultation process, as should have happened much earlier on, and thus find a way to ease the transition. We need to introduce the changes gradually, rather than impose them abruptly in the space of a few weeks.</p>

 I begin by assuring my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) that I am pleased to be here to answer this debate, and that I do not believe that I drew the short straw this evening. I welcome the opportunity to talk to the House about the recent change to the immigration rules for postgraduate doctors and dentists. However, before I get into the detail of the change and address the points that have been raised, I want to take this opportunity to set out the Government&#146;s position on migration, and to set the change in context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para10"><a name="06061463000234">The five-year strategy on asylum and immigration was published over a year ago, in February 2005. It sets out the premise that we need to be clearer about which migrants we need in the UK, and why. That is the basis of our immigration system, and of our manifesto commitment to introduce a points-based system for managed migration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para11"><a name="06061463000235">It is the job of the Government to manage migration into the UK so that the needs and rights of UK citizens are maintained. That is why the points-based system for managed migration, on which we consulted widely between July and November last year, went back to first principles to identify and select the migrants whom the UK really needs, and who benefit the UK by being here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para12"><a name="06061463000236">The Government are, and have always been, very clear that migration makes a substantial contribution to economic growth because it helps to fill gaps in the labour market, including key public services, such as health and education. Migration also increases investment, innovation and entrepreneurship in the UK. Culturally, we are enriched by people with diverse backgrounds from other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para13"><a name="06061463000237">With an expanded EU, there is an accessible and mobile work force already contributing to our growing economy, closing many gaps experienced by employers. Our starting point is that employers should look first to recruit from the UK and the expanded EU before recruiting migrants from outside the EU. Migration needs to be properly managed. It also needs to be robust against abuse. Only those of benefit to the UK  <br>

should be admitted and, once here, they must comply with the conditions of their leave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para14"><a name="06061463000238">That, then, is the underlying strategy. On that basis, we outlined our proposals for a five-tier managed migration system in the Command Paper, &#147;A Points-Based System: Making Migration Work for Britain&#148;, which was presented to the House on 7 March. The aim of the new system is to develop a more efficient and transparent migration system that sets out clearly who is permitted to come to the UK and why. We want to design a system that is better able to identify and attract those migrants who have the most to contribute to the UK&#151;one that offers a more efficient, transparent and objective process and that improves compliance while reducing scope for abuse. As part of that work, we have reviewed existing routes for employment, training and study with a view to identifying which are of most benefit to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para15"><a name="06061463000239">Underpinning the new migration system will be a five-tier framework, which will replace more than 80 work and study routes. That will help people to understand how the system works and will direct applicants to the category that is most appropriate for them. Tier 1 will cover those highly skilled individuals who can contribute to growth and productivity. Tier 2 will be for skilled workers with a job offer, who can fill gaps in the UK labour force. Tier 3 will provide for limited numbers of low skilled workers, needed to fill temporary labour shortages. Tier 4 will accommodate overseas students. Tier 5 will cover what we describe as youth mobility and temporary workers: people who are allowed to work in the UK for a limited period of time, primarily to satisfy non-economic objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para16"><a name="06061463000240">We also intend to set up an independent body to identify employment shortages across all sectors of the economy. It will be known as the skills advisory body and will build on existing structures and expertise&#151;in particular the skills for business network, which is funded in part by the Department for Education and Skills. Shortages identified by the skills advisory body will inform Government decisions on the use of migrant labour within tiers 2 and 3 of the points-based system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para17"><a name="06061463000241">I want to turn to the place of doctors and dentists within the migration system. The massive investment that we have put into NHS staff and reforming medical training to build up UK NHS capacity has worked. We now have more than 117,000 doctors working in the NHS&#151;27,400 more than in 1997&#151;as well as record levels of doctors in training in UK medical schools and we do not need to rely on overseas doctors as much as we did in the past. That investment and expansion, coupled with the reform of medical education, is leading to increased competition for medical posts. It has become clear that, owing to the changing labour market, the specific category within the immigration rules for doctors and dentists that allowed permit-free training could lead to the displacement of UK graduates. There has been a growing consensus that changing the rules is the right thing to do.</p>

the big question. What will happen to their futures? It is all right to say that we need to protect British doctors&#151;everybody agrees with that&#151;but why now, so suddenly and so abruptly?</p>

 Those are the very points that I am addressing at the moment. Despite the changes, there is nothing to say that overseas doctors from outside the European economic area cannot work in the national health service. It only has to be demonstrated that such a doctor is needed because a post cannot be filled by a doctor from the UK or the EEA. We do not expect a mass exodus of the doctors who are here at present.</p>

<p><a name="st_o335"><a name="06061463000244"><a name="60614-0020.htm_spnew2"><a name="06061463000380"><b>Mr. Mitchell:</b>
 Such a decision will have to be made by the appointing hospital. If it could not find anyone from Britain or the EEA, it could then call in applications from international medical graduates and Commonwealth doctors. However, such applications could not be called in until that point, so the hospital would not necessarily be choosing the most able people because the search would be insufficiently wide and it would have to make appointments by category. Additionally, some medical graduates from overseas might not even get an interview. People are basing their careers and planning their lives around a period of training in this country and their qualification depends on that. However, they now have no certainty about what will happen.</p>

 If I can make a little progress, some of the answers to those points will perhaps become a little clearer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para18"><a name="06061463000246">It is only right that jobs and training programmes that are available in the UK for junior doctors should go first to UK nationals. That is the principle of ensuring that UK workers have access to jobs, which is the principle at the heart of our migration system and, indeed, the migration systems of developed countries throughout the world. I make no apology for the fact that the Government are committed to fostering the talent and harnessing the abilities of our own citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para19"><a name="06061463000247">The changes that we have made to the immigration rules for postgraduate doctors and dentists do not mean that we will no longer allow doctors and dentists from overseas to come and train in the UK. They mean that, as in other sectors of the economy, UK and EEA nationals must be considered first. Non-EEA nationals who wish to come to the UK as new doctors or dentists will still be able to do so, but they will have to apply in a way that is the norm for other overseas workers. That  <br>

means that employers who wish to appoint an overseas doctor or dentist first have to demonstrate that they cannot find a UK or EEA national to fill the post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para20"><a name="06061463000248">When considering the changes, we wanted to reduce as far as possible the burden on NHS trusts, postgraduate deans and individual hospitals. We thus announced the changes in March so that we could give people as much time as possible to plan for their effect before the next round of appointments to posts started in August. I recognise that we did not provide full details of the changes before they came into effect, but we took steps to ensure that all relevant stakeholders were consulted on, and informed about, the general intention of the changes. Officials from the Department of Health and the Home Office outlined the proposed changes at a NHS work force planning meeting in January, which was held well in advance of the changes coming into effect in April. Since then, officials have had several meetings and discussions with stakeholders, so I do not accept the allegation that we did not consult adequately on the change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para21"><a name="06061463000249">There have been some regrettable reports in the media regarding the change, such as suggestions that all overseas doctors and dentists training in the UK will be asked to leave before they complete their training. Those with leave granted under the previous rules still have that leave and are subject to the same conditions as they were before the changes were made. That means that they can complete ongoing posts and take new posts within the period for which they have leave. We have also put in place transitional arrangements to allow certain doctors and dentists who are in the middle of training programmes or training posts to switch into the work permit system without requiring employers to advertise the job and demonstrate that they cannot find a UK or EEA national to fill the post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para22"><a name="06061463000250">As well as making transitional arrangements for those already in training, we have retained some provisions for overseas doctors and dentists in the future. If people have chosen to study medicine or dentistry in the UK and completed their degree here, we have made provision for them to stay on in the UK to undertake the next stage of their training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="60614-0020.htm_para23"><a name="06061463000251">The changes are not the end of the road. They are a step on the way to a more coherent and consistent migration system and a response to the success of our programmes for recruiting and training UK doctors.</p>
