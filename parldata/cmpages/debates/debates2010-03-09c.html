 I asked an expert taskforce, chaired by Sir Steve Bullock, mayor of Lewisham, and Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester city council, to look at how best to achieve efficiency savings and protect front-line services. Their report "Putting the Frontline First: Meeting the local government challenge" was published on 1 March. It sets out 10 decisive steps that councils can take to achieve efficiency while delivering high-quality local services. Local people will rightly be intolerant of any council if they are told that front-line services like care provision, libraries or youth services will be cut because it has failed to carry through all the recommendations made in our experts' taskforce report.</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend comment on the disgraceful situation at the now Conservative-led Lancashire county council? It has received a 5.1 per cent. increase in Government grant but has cut the budget by 3 per cent., with the likelihood that 200 to 300 jobs will now be lost. The council is also failing to support the staff at the National Football museum who need an agreement to be reached between Lancashire county council and Manchester city council so that the museum can remain at Preston and in Manchester as well.</p>

 First, may I pay tribute to my hon. Friend's sterling efforts to support the football museum and to retain it for his constituency? He makes an important wider point, because some local authorities are trying to suggest that the cuts that they are making to front-line services in some way reflect cuts in central Government finance or the wider economic circumstances. As he has rightly highlighted, English local authorities received, on average, a 4 per cent. cash increase for the coming year, and the cuts that are being made reflect the decisions of Tory and Liberal local authorities to make them at a local level.</p>

 I worry greatly about councils that are proposing what they call a budget-airline or Ryanair approach to local government, with services stripped down to the most basic level. The only people who enjoy decent services are those who can afford to pay for them twice-once through the council tax, and once through charges. For example, I was told the other day that Wolverhampton council has made it part of its standing orders that every service should be charged at a full-cost recovery rate, unless specifically authorised otherwise by a cabinet member.</p>

 The Secretary of State seems very keen to talk about this year's Budget settlement, but less keen to talk about Government grants looking ahead.

 I certainly believe that the budget reduction programme set out by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the pre-Budget report is a credible one. It can be delivered in local government without damaging front-line services, provided that the hard decisions are taken to deliver efficiencies. My Department set out in the PBR where we expect savings to be made through operational efficiency and through savings on particular local government services. That can be done so that members of the public see their services protected and improved where they use them.</p>

Given that no credible detail is forthcoming from either the Government or those on the Conservative Front Bench, should the right hon.

 The hon. Lady is wrong on both counts. In reply to an earlier question, I said that we have published a report from two respected local government leaders on precisely the measures that local government should be planning to take now to make the most efficient use of the available resources. As the House knows, however, the reality is that there has not yet been a comprehensive spending review for the next three-year settlement because we have been through a year of the most extraordinary economic change. The policies that we have implemented have seen the Government, the country and local government through the crisis, because we rejected the calls from the Opposition to cut our spending last year. It would have been irresponsible to try to project exact levels of spending for four years from today, given the uncertainties of the past year.  <br>

 It is a shame that the hon.

It is a massive vote of confidence in the ability of local government to deliver the policy. I believe that the savings that local government is being asked to make can be achieved. As she herself has said, local government has proved its ability to make efficiency savings and to plough them into other front-line services.</p>

Is it not the case that the efficiency savings earmarked for that policy will not materialise until 2012-13, yet the policy comes into force this year? Can the Minister explain to the House where the shortfall will be found, and whether the figure of £250 million is capped?

We also believe that people working in local government, which is a vital public service, deserve the best quality of human resources management, as it is called in the jargon these days. What that really means is treating people properly and with respect.</p>

 A few days ago, the Secretary of State gave permission for 3,000 new homes to be built in Wellingborough north, against the wishes of local residents, local councillors and myself.

 Since I came into the House in 1992, I have held the view that Parliament and this House were sovereign. I do not share the concept that there is a period of time when the House is sitting when decisions should not be taken. Decisions are taken properly and in accordance with the law, after we have considered all the relevant processes. It is only right that Ministers should continue to take decisions as long as the House is sitting as a properly constituted, democratically elected Chamber.</p>

 It is important that the combination of local, regional and national policy should be used to secure sufficient homes to meet the needs of families in this country in the future. We have rejected calls to scrap regional spatial strategies and planning targets and to leave everything to decision making at local level because we know full well that the house building industry would grind to a halt, that land would not be available, that growth would be slowed and that the needs of this country's families would not be met.

 Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="100309-0004.htm_para5"><a name="10030993000197">Last year, I presented a similar Bill in an attempt to persuade the Government to regulate for the complete phasing out of HFCs in large supermarkets. Today, I shall attempt to impress on them three facts which I hope will convince them that it is time to act. HFCs are extremely harmful in terms of global warming and represent a growing proportion of our emissions. There is little to suggest that current European Union and United Kingdom regulation in the field has encouraged large retailers to speed up the process of eradicating the use of HFCs in their stores, and there is nothing in EU regulation to prevent the Government from regulating in this regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="100309-0004.htm_para6"><a name="10030993000198">According to Greenpeace, HFCs can be up to 20,000 times more damaging in terms of global warming than carbon dioxide. The most common gas used in supermarket refrigeration, HFC-404A, is 3,800 times more harmful than carbon dioxide. It is predicted that by 2020 HFC emissions will be equivalent to between 2 billion and 2.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, approximately four times the level of the United Kingdom's annual greenhouse gas emissions. In 2005, stationary refrigeration units were the biggest source of F-gas emissions in the UK, and within that total, supermarkets account for more than half the emissions. Phasing out the HFCs in supermarkets has the potential to save more than 175 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalence between now and 2050. That is equivalent to a quarter of the UK's annual carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="100309-0004.htm_para7"><a name="10030993000199">The potential impact of gases on global warming is averaged over 100 years, which reflects the extraordinarily long time that gases responsible for global warming remain in the atmosphere and add to the problem. HFCs do not last for 100 years. The evidence is that global warming is accelerating. Prompt action now to remove gases that are 4,000 times more harmful than carbon dioxide and do not linger as long as other harmful gases has the attraction of buying much-needed time for other greenhouse gas mitigating measures to take effect. I hope the Minister will accept that the time to act is now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="100309-0004.htm_para8"><a name="10030993000200">I presented my Bill last year in response to a report from the Environmental Investigation Agency on the use of hydrofluorocarbons in supermarket refrigeration units. I commend the agency on its work. Its report was prompted by the announcement by a group of large supermarkets that they intend to move away from the use of HFCs. The EIA carried out its survey to monitor progress in August 2008. Its conclusions were not encouraging-the best-performing supermarket succeeded in reducing its HFC use in only three out of 620 stores.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="100309-0004.htm_para9"><a name="10030993000201">The figures for other supermarkets were just four out of 1,700 stores and one out of 2,250 stores. I shall not name and shame the supermarkets involved, because the response in this area has been so mixed. The stated view from many in the industry is that regulation in this area would create the confidence across the industry to plan ahead, knowing that the supermarkets are all operating within the same framework. Such an approach would bring about the stated objective of the Department, which is to eradicate the use of HFCs. That view still applies today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="100309-0004.htm_para10"><a name="10030993000202">Following the presentation of my Bill last year, my hon.

<a name="100309-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="10030993000476"><ul><p class="tabletext">"reducing their emissions is a key focus of Defra's work to reduce HFC emissions overall."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="100309-0004.htm_para14"><a name="10030993000206">In Aug 2009, the EIA carried out a further study of large supermarkets to see how far they had got in moving away from being dependent on these extremely harmful gases. Only 2 per cent. of the major stores in the UK are running HFC-free refrigeration systems-only 46 are now HFC-free compared with 14 last year. One of the largest supermarkets has experimented with HFCs but has reneged on its promise to switch all its stores away from the use of HFCs, while one major chain continues to use HCFCs-hydrochlorofluorocarbons-which are supposed to be phased out this year. Aldi, Morrisons and Sainsbury's refused to share their data on leakages, and so I shall make an exception in naming them. The level of the leakages emitted into the atmosphere reported to the EIA ranged from 14 to 17 per cent. of HFCs, so I am afraid that my hon. Friend's confidence that the current regulatory regimes in the EU and the UK are sufficient to meet the urgent need for action on HFCs is misplaced. I hope that he will accept the argument that the time to regulate has come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="100309-0004.htm_para15"><a name="10030993000207">My third point is that nothing in the competition rules prevents the Government from regulating in this area. May I refer the Minister to article 95 of the treaty establishing the Economic Community which, following the passage of the treaty of Lisbon-I pardon him if he starts to fall asleep as I read this technical section-became article 114 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Community, TFEC? While on the approximation of laws, I should mention that paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7  <br>

of the article are the most relevant. They clearly demonstrate the need for the Government to make a case for the eradication of HFCs here in the UK-nothing is preventing the Government from making that case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="100309-0004.htm_para16"><a name="10030993000208">The Commission would then be required to consider whether this form of practice was aimed at seeking advantage over other EU countries or companies that operate within those countries and whether the UK was seeking to exclude those people from free trade with the UK. Those paragraphs contain clear powers for the UK to regulate to tackle environmental issues. Nothing excludes the UK from acting in this area and preventing the further use of HFCs in the future.</p>

Friends in the Department to take on board the three arguments that I have made today and to agree to meet me and the EIA in the near future to discuss ways in which we can make a case to the European Commission that we are not breaching European competition laws, that there is scientific evidence that proves that it is necessary for us to act in this field, that current European and UK regulations are not moving the large supermarket chains along the road of eradicating hydrofluorocarbons and that action in the UK is absolutely necessary? With that, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

 I rise to comment on this Bill, provoked by the question of why we need such legislation in the first place. I agree with the intentions and objectives of the hon. Member for Eltham (Clive Efford), but I am extremely worried about the situation in which we find ourselves. We always talk about the environment, as do the supermarkets, yet they do not feel compelled to act without the threat of legislation. Like the hon. Gentleman, I have heard the supermarkets making various claims on this matter, as well as various general commitments to phasing out the hydrofluorocarbon-related refrigeration units that he has described. However, as he has rightly pointed out, the reality is far from the public relations commitments. If the supermarkets are serious about the environment and about improving their environmental footprint, as they incessantly tell us in their advertising, they ought to be making a formal statement about what date they will set for themselves to phase out the refrigeration units in question-perhaps 31 December 2015, which would give them half a decade to finish the job.</p>

I fear that not only will the supermarkets give us more words without action, but when it comes down to a fairly straightforward change of the type that the hon. Gentleman wants to see, they will be resistant for purely economic reasons. The environment is more important than that.</p>

The purpose of the debate is to give the House, for what I think is the first time, the opportunity to express a view on how we want health care services in London to be provided in future. We want literally to fire a shot across the bows of those in the upper hierarchies of the NHS who want to determine these things without reference to the public whom they serve, to the general practitioners who refer patients, or to the patients themselves, who have a right to exercise choice. We also want to give the House an opportunity to set out how it wishes Healthcare for London to be improved in the years ahead.</p>

We need to focus on improving public health in London, which has some of the greatest health inequalities in the country. At ward level, between Tottenham and Kensington and Chelsea, for example, there is a disparity in life expectancy of 17 years. I know that such disparities exist in other parts of the country, but those are very pronounced. We feel the issue even more keenly when we see such relative wealth and poverty side by side in London, where nearly one in four children live in poverty.</p>

The level of sexually transmitted infections is higher in London than anywhere else, and the level of alcohol abuse and dependency is higher than in any other region in the country, as is the level of drug use and abuse. We know-not least because London is where many refugees, asylum seekers and, indeed, rough sleepers are found-that London has 40 per cent. of the total number of tuberculosis cases in the country and more than 50 per cent. of HIV cases. The importance of having an effective public health strategy must be at the heart of this issue.</p>

I shall not dwell on that at length, although there is plenty of reason to do so, because time will not permit it. The document that I published with my right hon.

We also intend that the NHS should co-operate, on a London basis, directly with the Mayor of London to pursue the health inequalities strategy. Given the particular characteristic of London as a city with city-wide government, we want that city-wide government to bear down on the particular public health challenges that I have mentioned and to exploit opportunities for promoting better health in London, and I know from my conversations with the Mayor that he is immensely keen to do that.</p>

 I assure the hon. Gentleman that what I have said about public health will not impact directly on the availability of NHS services. I remind the House about the current level of spending on public health care in London through the Healthy Living programme. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Minister might be interested in this, because 13 primary care trusts in London spend more on management than they do on public health under the Healthy Living programme.</p>

The total for management costs in London is £246 million a year, and that shows a rise of 22 per cent. in just the past three years. We want to cut those management costs by a third over the next four years. We will reinvest all the money, because we aim to protect the NHS budget and increase it in real terms every year. That means that we will be able to ensure that we have less bureaucracy and more promotion of public health.</p>

 No areas of public health are more important than drug abuse and drug treatment.

authorities and the NHS as a local strategy, with voluntary-sector bodies as deliverers. That approach will help charities and voluntary-sector organisations, when the results come through from the services that they provide, to believe that their funding will be locked in on a more permanent basis. That will be better than the constant flow of short-term initiatives that have so undermined them in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="100309-0005.htm_para14"><a name="10030993000238">In January, NHS London published an overall strategic plan, and we have begun to see some of the so-called "sector plans" for different areas of London. The plan for outer north-east London has been published and the one for north-west London has been leaked. In addition, people are speculating about what the implications might be for other places across London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="100309-0005.htm_para15"><a name="10030993000239">There are questions about the assumptions underlying the NHS London approach. It does not help that the text of the document published in January by NHS London is confusing and erroneous. The notes relating to the scenarios and the funding figures were transposed, they did not include the base case at all, and they were wrong. For example, there was a reference to 2.3 per cent. per annum funding growth in the next spending review period, which should have been minus 2.3 per cent. Essentially, NHS London is assuming that there will be unchanged real terms funding for the NHS all the way through to 2016-17. Alongside that, it assumes 3.5 per cent. cost inflation in the NHS. We need to challenge the assumption that costs can be accommodated in that way. NHS London also assumes 4 per cent. a year demand growth, which is not in line with the projections of demand growth produced by the King's Fund and the Institute for Fiscal Studies on a national basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="100309-0005.htm_para16"><a name="10030993000240">We know what NHS London set out to do-make a set of assumptions, arrive at a big funding shortfall in 2017, and tell everyone that they must do the things that NHS London is calling for them to do-but let us leave that on one side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="100309-0005.htm_para17"><a name="10030993000241">Under any reasonable set of assumptions, we have to deliver efficiency savings and improving productivity in the NHS, including in London, in ways that have not been adopted in the past. Over the past 10 years, when funding for the NHS has more than doubled, how is it possible that in London there is still legacy debt of more than £500 million for the NHS trusts and a worrying number of financially challenged trusts, and very few of the changes that should have taken place in the NHS to redesign services and deliver care more appropriately and more effectively have happened?

That is far from the case at the moment, and it is assumed that patients who are denied access to hospital services will simply be accommodated elsewhere in the community at a lower cost. The assumptions are literally heroic, stating that it will be possible for 55 per cent. of out-patient and 60 per cent. of accident and emergency attendances to take place in the community rather than in the hospital.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes a very important point. One of the assumptions is a 60 per cent. transfer of accident and emergency cases out of A and E and into the community. A study on primary care and emergency departments commissioned, and published last Friday, by the Department of Health, said that, of arrivals at A and E,</p>
<a name="100309-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="10030993000480"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We found that the proportion that could be classified as primary care cases was between 10 per cent. and 30 per cent."</p>

In Chelsea and Westminster the rate of A and E attendances has gone up by 4 per cent.; in Ealing the figure is up by 1 per cent.; for Imperial, taking Charing Cross and Hammersmith together, it is up by 9 per cent.; in North West London Hospitals it is up by 15 per cent.; in Hillingdon it is up by 6 per cent.; and in West Middlesex it is up by 5 per cent. All those hospital emergency departments have people pouring in. It is simply not true to say that there is any evidence to support the proposition that the services in the community that would justify what is being proposed in terms of the closure of emergency departments have been put in place.</p>

 Will my hon. Friend bear in mind the fact that we have had exactly this problem in north-east London, where there is a shortfall in spending between the north-west and the north-east? The drive to close Whipps Cross is mainly down to the zealotry of officials, now released from secrecy, and people not telling the truth about it. They talk about pushing stuff out into the community, but in our area there has been a 10 per cent. fall in the number of health visitors, and the caseloads in relation to children under five are at least double that recommended by Lord Laming.

 My right hon. Friend makes an extremely important point. Putting a walk-in centre or an urgent care centre on the front of a hospital is a perfectly reasonable and sensible idea, but when that happened at Whipps Cross the net effect was 2,000 fewer patients a month attending the emergency department at Whipps Cross, but 4,000 extra patients a month attending the urgent care centre.

 I can tell my hon. Friend that after the election, one of two things will happen. There will be either a Labour-derived, top-down plan that threatens to turn many of London's major hospitals into what Labour terms "local hospitals", which in some cases seems to mean a move from an emergency department to a GP-led urgent care service-a potentially serious retrograde step when attendance at A and E is rising-or a Conservative approach of trying to allow GPs, local authorities and local people to design services that respond to patient need and choice and provide referral opportunities. If patients are arriving at an A and E department, they should be handled appropriately there.</p>

On his point about A and E admissions, Ealing hospital-I was there at the opening, not all that long ago-was built to treat 25,000 people a year but deals with 100,000 a year.

There is always a case for change, and nothing will be absolutely static, but let us work with the hospitals that we have, and let them start the business of designing new services.</p>

We should work with hospitals in London and say that, yes, we may need to design better services, a care pathway that extends out into the community and services that are more integrated around patients instead of having a primary-secondary divide, but we should give the hospitals the opportunity to deliver those services. We have a lot of hospital sites in London, many of which are accessible to much of the population, and we can deliver services from them rather than shut them down and open polyclinics, as with the absurdity at Sidcup.</p>

I can see the opportunist, pre-election attempt to wrong-foot Labour, but the motion and the speech offer no vision, no new ideas, and frankly no agenda for government. They expose the Conservative party as offering no constructive way forward to address the very problems that the hon. Gentleman and his motion identify. We know that there are inequalities in stroke provision, and in heart provision. We know that London has worse outcomes and greater inequalities than other parts of the country. We know that lives are lost because of the current disposition of services. We know that infant mortality rates in Haringey are three times those in Richmond. We know that life expectancy deteriorates by a year for every stop on the Jubilee line from Westminster to Canning Town, from 77 down to 70. There is an over-reliance on A and E because GP practice in deprived areas in some parts of London is inadequate. But the best that the hon. Gentleman can offer is a vague view that we should leave it up to GPs to solve it through their budgets. He says that GPs should put more money into services if they want to keep them, on an ad hoc basis and without any process. That is an abdication of responsibility.</p>

Member for South Cambridgeshire taking the view that he does not like the Darzi process of clinically led, locally driven decisions made through a local process. He can object to that. We have set out a broad-based approach, and a decision-making process, as a result of a review by clinicians. I do not mind him objecting to that, and he is perfectly at liberty to do so-it is a matter of debate-but I find it bizarre that his alternative is no alternative. It is a "Stop the bus, I want to get off" approach. He is saying, "There are lots of inequalities in London, and lots of issues that need to be addressed, but I'm not going to address them because they are in the 'too difficult' category."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="100309-0007.htm_para1"><a name="10030993000311">For decades, reconfiguring London to deliver better services has been in the "too difficult" category for too many Governments. Virginia Bottomley attempted to do it, but got hammered for it, because it was not clinically led. As a result, Londoners have put up with a worse service than many other parts of the country. Decisions about changing the NHS are difficult, and people are attached to local provision and fear changes. After the Thatcher period, they fear that the agenda is about cutting provision, not about making it better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="100309-0007.htm_para2"><a name="10030993000312">Going back decades, Governments-Labour and Tory-have failed. In 2006, NHS London asked Professor Ara Darzi-now Lord Darzi-to set out a vision for change in London: a process for bottom-up, clinically led improvements, the aim of which was to drive up the quality of services, not to make cuts. Because Ara Darzi was an eminent consultant-not a politician or a manager-clinicians bought into the process. They accepted his bona fides and his work to improve provision, and they engaged in the difficult process of change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="100309-0007.htm_para3"><a name="10030993000313">Discussions about possible reconfiguration have taken place across London-<i> [Interruption.] </i>Yes, they have, and clinicians are still engaged today, but they will not be if the Conservatives get in, because they will stop that process. Clinicians are engaged in a variety of meetings-this comes back to a point raised earlier-considering options and discussing them among themselves before making proposals through an iterative process of asking, "What are the best proposals for each area?" This is about clinicians discussing what is best for London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="100309-0007.htm_para4"><a name="10030993000314">Those proposals are already out for consultation in north-east London, and elsewhere they are still being discussed and weighed up. Local people will be engaged when there are clear proposals. They will be bottom-up, not Whitehall-led, proposals from the local NHS, not Ministers. That does not mean that it will not be difficult-the proposals raise concerns-but it means that clinicians concerned about quality services are leading the process. The key Darzi components can be summarised as localised services where possible, and centralised services where it is necessary for patient safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="100309-0007.htm_para5"><a name="10030993000315">That is the process that the Conservative party is attacking and saying that it would do away with. Its motion identifies the problem in London, but rejects the bottom-up reconfiguration that clinicians say is needed to save lives. Instead, the Conservatives would dump the Darzi process, opportunistically attack every output from it and every attempt to allow clinicians the space to discuss what would work, play on the fears of local people, and, most damagingly and opportunistically of all, offer no real process to replace it.</p>

In the face of that, the Conservatives abdicate responsibility, advocate nothing to replace the Darzi process and play to public fears. That is what is happening. If they do that in government, the inequalities that the hon. Gentleman has identified will remain, because he has no approach to deal with them. All he wants to do is play Pontius Pilate, washing his hands of the problem and saying, "Well, we wanted something done-there were real inequalities-but it was up to the GPs locally."</p>

 Does the Minister realise that the reason why a lot of people are fearful and suspicious is that they have recent memories of reorganisations? The Tories proposed, and Labour then agreed, to the closure of the A and E unit at Guy's hospital, for example. Money has been allocated to primary care trusts in deprived areas such as Southwark, but it has then been top-sliced and taken away, even though we were meant to need and deserve it. I can tell the Minister that we have wards in hospitals across the river from this place, including in Guy's, that are absolutely full and overstretched-and not full of "not ill" people, but full of seriously ill people who need to be in hospital, not treated by their GP.</p>

That was fully endorsed by a joint overview and scrutiny committee of all 32 London boroughs, including the Conservative authorities. London's PCTs have invested £20 million in improving stroke care. In the coming months, eight new hyper-acute stroke units will open and standards will be up to the best in the world.</p>

Clinicians do complain a bit about too much sunlight, however. PCTs are working with clinicians to identify options for improving services. If some A and E services close, it will be because clinicians on the ground deem it in the best interests of patients-and never before the alternative services are up and running. Those alternatives have to be there and they have to be better before any change happens. Any changes will always be consulted on prior to implementation and the results of that consultation will be independently evaluated wherever there is a legitimate challenge.</p>

Then it was told that in any event it would not have been able to complete the process in the time available. When we checked, we found that Queen's could not have completed on time either, but had been allowed extra time.

Then we need to ensure that the process is delivered within a budget. That should be the order of priorities. Managers need to be aware of that, and they also need to be aware that it is the views of clinicians that we will consider when we have to examine any proposals that are submitted. We will have them nationally examined by clinicians to ensure that the right clinical judgment is made.

 I agree that the process needs to become much more open.

When it comes to working out how that should be done, clinicians should be at the heart of decision making. That is what is happening across the city. Change is coming. The NHS must invest more in preventive care, rather than waiting until people become unwell. The money needs to be identified.

I give him credit for knowing the NHS well, but that is why I am so concerned with the motion's vacuity. He accepted stroke reconfiguration in Cambridgeshire because he knew that it was necessary and it was clinically led. The indictment of him is that he knows that the Darzi review is right but it is politically difficult. It requires courage to change London's NHS and save lives, and for there to be a credible alternative Government, there needs to be an Opposition party that comes up with a credible alternative if it criticises Darzi.

In Manchester, the reorganisation of paediatric services is giving children safer, better care, but it appears that his party wants to overturn it. In Birmingham and Sandwell, the new hospital would not be there and patients would not be getting safer, better care without change, but his party opposes change in that area.</p>

The Conservative view seems to be that these issues are best kept secret and that they should not be revealed to the public until after the general election, which is outrageous. I applaud my hon.

Sixteen of the 18 options would see Kingston lose a significant service from that hospital. My hon.

My support for that polyclinic remains, and I also supported the changes to stroke and cardiac services that came from NHS London.

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para3"><a name="10030993000410">I was referring to the proposals for north-east London, which emerged only because my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) received a leaked letter from a clinician in the system. Again, the letter demonstrated what was going on but was kept from the public. It set out options, including the potential loss of A and E and maternity services at the Whittington hospital. The hospital is much loved and needed, and it serves one of the poorest communities in the country. The area has one of the lowest rates of car ownership in the country, yet it is proposed that those services should be lost. Again, my hon. Friend was right to get the matter into the public domain so that people can make their own judgments on the proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para4"><a name="10030993000411">The belief, certainly in north-east London, is that the proposals are not evidence- based, and that wrong assumptions have been made about the potential impact of the loss of an A and E department at the Whittington hospital. People believe that conclusions are being drawn that do not stand up to analysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para5"><a name="10030993000412">I turn now to the private finance initiative, which has imposed an enormous burden on the NHS in London.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is talking about north-east London, but a year and a half or two years ago Professor Alberti was called in to have a look at the process whereby the various PCTs in the area were going about the business of change. He was highly critical of the secrecy involved, and of the trusts' failure to tell the public exactly what was going on. The idea that the problems were driven by clinicians is absolutely not true.</p>

 I am very grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention. It appears that the PCTs have learned nothing from George Alberti's intervention a year ago, as the same secrecy continues to pervade the entire process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para6"><a name="10030993000415">As I was saying, I shall deal now with PFI. There have been 20 PFI schemes providing new facilities in London at a cost of £2.6 billion, but the repayments over the lifetime of those facilities will come to a staggering total of £16.7 billion. Those repayments have not been properly budgeted for, but they will bankrupt the NHS and in a sense drive the changes that we are debating today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para7"><a name="10030993000416">This year, PFI payments will amount to £250 million in London alone. By 2014, that will have risen to £400 million per year. That is forcing up overhead costs on trusts and squeezing the resources of other health services. It is also, as the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) said, distorting decision making about service changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para8"><a name="10030993000417">The proposals appear not to have taken sufficiently into account the pressure of rising case loads in London. Many London hospitals find that acute bed occupancy rates are approaching 100 per cent. In other words, throughout the year they are virtually entirely full. The BMA says that the 3.7 million attendances at accident and emergency departments reflect high levels of mobility and temporary residents often unregistered with GPs, who choose to go to their local A and E department because they have nowhere else to go. As the proposals are put forward, there is nothing else in place to reassure the public. It is dangerous to make assumptions about the ability to cut numbers going to hospital before new arrangements and facilities are put in place.</p>

 I find it very unconvincing when I hear a Tory Front Bencher speaking in favour of reducing health inequalities. When we came to power in 1997, each part of the country was supposed to be allocated health service funds that reflected the size, nature and health of their population, but the east end of London was getting 23 per cent. less than it was entitled to, and surprise, surprise, Tory Surrey was getting 23 per cent. more than it was entitled to. That is entirely typical of what the Tories have always done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para14"><a name="10030993000427">In my constituency, investment under the Labour Government has been quite dramatic. We have the new University College hospital, which I freely admit got under way when I was Health Secretary; and we have also had big improvements at the Royal Free hospital, which serves my area, and at Great Ormond Street hospital, which serves children from across the country. We have new health centres, with two in Kentish Town and one that has just reopened in Gospel Oak; most GP premises have been improved; and the survival rates and general performance in our area have massively improved because the buildings and equipment have at long last started to match the excellence of the staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para15"><a name="10030993000428">As part of that, there has been a lot of investment in the Whittington hospital. I can remember, when I was in opposition, going to the Whittington and pledging all sorts of things. As I believe in keeping pledges, those pledges have been kept, and a lot of extra money has been invested in the Whittington. I could not get firm figures from the hospital today, but as I understand it £27 million was invested in the new accident and emergency department, so my hon. Friends and I find it slightly bizarre-to say the least-that nameless, faceless people have suddenly appeared on the scene and decided to recommend that the A and E department, in which all that money has been invested, no longer function, and that instead people be diverted to the Royal Free and University College hospitals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para16"><a name="10030993000429">I checked this morning at University College hospital. It was designed for 60,000 A and E attendees, and it now has knocking on for 90,000, so Lord only knows where the 90,000 people who use the Whittington will go. Apparently, the explanation is that many would go to clinics-new health centres-in Islington. The only trouble is that they have not been built, and it will cost money to build them. So if the closure is being undertaken to save money, it is utterly stupid because it will involve spending money to substitute for the money that has already been spent at the Whittington.</p>

 The issue is not only the waste of money, because the Whittington A and E rumours, which are rife in our part of the world, are having a serious knock-on effect on the hospital in my half of the borough of Camden, namely the Royal Free, and that is producing anxiety among not only patients but staff. Surely we have not invested all that money in the national health service and its staff suddenly to make them feel that they are no longer wanted or useful.

estimates that between only 10 and 30 per cent. of the people who currently attend A and E could be properly attended to at one of the devolved clinics, as we might describe them. However, up to now the basis of the Darzi report has been that between 50 and 60 per cent. of people could be safely dealt with at such clinics, and I do not agree. I am simply not convinced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para17"><a name="10030993000432">The whole basis of the concentration of stroke provision and major trauma provision, which I strongly support, is that practice makes perfect, but apparently practice does not make perfect in A and E any more, because the people who have a lot of practice at a large A and E will be substituted by people who have a lot less practice at clinics in the community. So the closure does not make sense in terms of the practicalities or, indeed, the money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para18"><a name="10030993000433">The idea that there was widespread, successful consultation of Londoners over the whole Darzi thing is really preposterous. About 1,800 Londoners-and there are rather a lot of us-expressed support for the Darzi proposition, and about 1,700 said that they did not want it, so the view was far from unanimous even among those who were consulted. I find that outcome about as convincing as Lord Ashcroft's protestations about his tax status, and we all know what that indicated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para19"><a name="10030993000434">Unfortunately, these aspects are bringing into disrepute a great deal of the achievements that the Government have brought about in the years that we have been in office. At the meeting I went to, when we had to listen to the burblings of some of the people who are proposing what is happening at the Whittington, nothing much was said about improving clinical performance; it was all about saying, "Oh, we think we're going to be £500 million down." When they were pressed to explain how that was going to happen, they could not come up with any satisfactory explanation. I can only assume that they are absolutely convinced that there will be a Tory Government and that there will therefore be a £500 million-a-year reduction in the money that is available, because they could not possibly conclude that from anything that the Labour Government have been committed to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para21"><a name="10030993000436">In talking about A and E, I come back to the thing that I have been obsessed with for all the time that I have had an interest in this issue, and that goes back a very long way-if we want to make A and E departments more successful, let us put some GPs in there to deal with the folks who choose to turn up. People do not want to be told, even by clinicians, that they should not turn up at their local hospital. If they want to turn up for GP services, as well as strictly A and E provision, that should be fine by us, and it would be a proper response to the situation that we face.</p>

The people who take the decisions should carry the can, and the people who carry the can should take the decisions.</p>

 I never thought that I would stand up in the House and agree with the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson), particularly on health matters, but he made a very important point in his criticism of the Darzi proposals. Having spent millions of pounds on new hospitals in London, the Government now want to make a radical change in favour of treating a huge proportion of the people who currently go to the accident and emergency departments of those hospitals in polyclinics, which have not yet been built and which they propose to build during a period of financial difficulty. It is mad to behave in that way. It is in the same category as the Government's deciding to pay GPs a lot more to do less, and then having to pay them even more to do the things that they were originally supposed to do. All these financial and medical decisions by the Government seem to come from Alice in Wonderland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para23"><a name="10030993000439">I doubt whether one could find a worse example of what is wrong with the NHS in London than in looking at my own corner of the city-south-east London. There, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) has pointed out, we have the South London Healthcare NHS Trust, which was a shotgun marriage between three hospital trusts that had severe financial problems. It was set up with an accumulated deficit of £200 million, and was given an operating target for this year of a deficit of £29.7 million. Since we are near the end of the current financial year, that means that the accumulated deficit is now well over £200 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para24"><a name="10030993000440">To be fair to the Government, a new management structure was put in place with the creation of the new trust a year ago. Some members of the Government have accused the Conservatives of scaremongering, but I have not done so about the management of the new trust. Although criticisms by consultants, patients and voluntary organisations, such as the local involvement network, have come my way, I said to myself that I would hold back from criticising the management publicly. One should be a responsible Member of Parliament and recognise that the management of any such huge organisation need time to bed down. However, the fact is that we have now had 12 months and the results are extremely disappointing, as the hon. Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) may well agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="100309-0009.htm_para25"><a name="10030993000441">It is worrying, for example, that the operations director has already gone by mutual agreement. I now understand that the financial director is also going by mutual agreement, although I have not been able to check that. A new operations director is being put in directly from the Department of Health. As a former Health Minister, I know that means that the Department is worried about the new trust. There are clearly problems in its management.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 190</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para0"><a name="10030993000442">As I have indicated, this year's target for the operating deficit will almost certainly not be met. That is a problem, because with generous help from the other parts of London, there is a window of opportunity for the South London Healthcare NHS Trust to pay off its deficit, if it meets its operating targets. It seems as though that may not happen, and the crisis that we face in south-east London will therefore be even greater a year from now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para1"><a name="10030993000443">As far as I am concerned, there has been no real improvement in the trust's performance for patients since its inception. As Members know, it currently has a norovirus problem that has meant the shutdown of many wards and waiting lists rising. That is a difficulty that many hospitals have had to face, but nevertheless I do not see any improvements in performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para2"><a name="10030993000444">The origins of all that are quite clear. First, the Government have thrown money at the NHS in London, as elsewhere, with no idea of reform. The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) mentioned PFI, and he gave the overall statistics for London. In my area we have two hospitals, which now form part of the South London Healthcare NHS Trust. The construction cost of the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich was £96 million, but the taxpayer will have to repay £799 million. The new Princess Royal university hospital in Bromley will cost £118 million to construct, and the taxpayer will repay £780 million-seven times the construction cost. As Lord Warner, a former Minister in the Labour Government, has said, the NHS received more money than it knew what to do with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para3"><a name="10030993000445">Another problem has been top-down political management. Civitas, the consultancy, has said that market reforms have not worked as they should have done, because Whitehall is still exercising too much control. We have had endless and changing targets and endless changes in management. For a period of two or three years, the managing director of the Princess Royal university hospital was being changed every six months at considerable cost. Nobody ever gets sacked at the top level of the NHS. It is astonishing how people appear to perform badly and are removed, but then appear somewhere else in the NHS. No one ever suffers the consequences of poor performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para4"><a name="10030993000446">Finally, weak structures are part of the problem. Commissioning has not been valued as much as it should have been, and in many ways, as has already been said, it has been emasculated. Lord Warner-I quote from an article in <i> The Guardian</i>-has said:</p>
<a name="100309-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="10030993000496"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We had 300 PCTs to begin with. That was insanity...The first thing I did was to cut them down to 150. But I wanted to go further and cut the number to 50 or 60."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para5"><a name="10030993000447">He said, as <i> The Guardian </i>put it,</p>
<a name="100309-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="10030993000497"><ul><p class="tabletext">"that he was thwarted by the Labour backbenches, who feared they would lose vital services from their constituencies."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para6"><a name="10030993000448">What is the answer? Briefly, the Government must cease micro-managing. Instead, we need to create opportunities for individuals and companies inside and outside the NHS to come up with more effective solutions, and for the Government to act simply as a regulator. We need fewer targets and quangos; we need commissioning to be more professional; we need to encourage a diversity of providers and for groups of professionals, private charities and so forth to be brought into play; and we need more competition. I suspect that efficiency and better patient care will go together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para7"><a name="10030993000449">The tragedy is that all those things were under way when the Conservatives were in charge of the health service, when we made the split between provider and purchaser. That was the opportunity for those sorts of reform. The Government, including the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson), with whom I might disagree on this, set back the whole process of reform. It is a tragedy that 13 years have been largely wasted.</p>

 I am delighted that we are having this debate and to have the opportunity to put my views on the NHS in London on the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para8"><a name="10030993000453">I represent Islington, North, and most hon. Members who have contributed so far have mentioned the Whittington hospital in my constituency, as I will in a moment. However, the core of the debate is the question of the accountability of the NHS and how it operates. In London, the background is the Darzi report. Behind that, there are a series of associations-in my case, five north London boroughs have decided, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) has pointed out, that they must cut £500 million from their budget in the next five years. I keep asking where that figure comes from, but nobody can tell me. They say, "Well, it's a possibility," to which I ask, "A possibility of what, from where, by whom?" to which they reply, "We have to think to the future."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para9"><a name="10030993000454">We all have to think to the future, but I do so in terms of improving health care throughout my constituency, north London and the rest of our capital city. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend. When he was Health Secretary, he not only ensured large-scale investment in major hospital facilities, GP practices and all the rest of it, but put into operation the Black report, which was hidden by an earlier Conservative Government, and tackled health inequalities through health action zones and public health campaigns. There has been an improvement: life expectancy is greater; infant mortality and child obesity are lower; and a number of other things have improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para10"><a name="10030993000455">We have a long way to go, as everyone should be well aware. The population is increasing, and desperate inequalities still exist, as does very bad housing, so we need investment in health care across the piece. We do not need senior officials who lead shadowy existences to decide that in the long run, there must be a cut in health expenditure through our part of north London. My plea is on behalf of an awful lot of people who rely desperately on local health services and facilities, who do not have the alternative of private medicine-for them, it is the NHS or nothing, so we need the NHS to be the very best.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para11"><a name="10030993000456">Most speakers today, including my right hon. Friend, mentioned the future configuration of local A and E facilities across north London. As has been said, a proposal is lurking somewhere in the background of this debate. Eighty people-I do not know who they  <br>

are-are being regularly consulted on the future configuration of health care across north London, and they appear to have decided that the most important hospitals are University College hospital and the North Middlesex, and that they will therefore downgrade or reduce everything else. I find that repugnant and wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para12"><a name="10030993000457">When news of those proposals leaked out to us, I called two public meetings in my constituency. Three hundred people attended the first, and 350 the second, which does not include those who could not get in because the room was so full. We held a march and demonstration through Islington, and 5,000 people attended. They were not subject to scaremongering: they were there to show their support for their national health service, their local hospital and its A and E department. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, my right hon. Friends the Members for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) and for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy) and the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) and I were all there, as was every political party from the Revolutionary Communist party to the Conservative party. Opinion was unanimous in support for that casualty unit. I know that the Minister has heard us and understands what we are saying about this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para13"><a name="10030993000458">As a result of the march, I received a letter from the chief executive of NHS London, essentially telling me that I should not be so concerned. I read her letter with great care and was left even more concerned, because she talked about opening a hub at the Whittington hospital for north Islington, called a polysystem. I am not against GP-led health centres or improving primary care facilities. On the contrary, I am in favour of effective, efficient local GPs, but we should not close A and E departments. Casualty unit attendance figures in the north London area were 695,000 last year, of which 86,000 were at the Whittington. Do not close casualty units and do not cut our hospitals, and instead recognise that we conquer ill health and inequality by investment, not by cuts and closure. We conquer them by access, not by making services more complicated and less accessible.</p>

You are accountable for ensuring that the NWL Sector exhibits the right leadership to ensure that NWL's strategic plan is robust, to ensure the delivery of Healthcare for London at the pace that the changed economic context now demands.

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para19"><a name="10030993000465">The Government have undoubtedly put money into the NHS, but where has it gone? Like the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), I think that it has gone into the new structures and bureaucracy and not necessarily where people expect it to be. The NHS has become like a huge sponge, with water being poured in, the money being poured out, and only drips coming down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para20"><a name="10030993000466">I regret that the situation has arisen so near the election, because I do not want this to be a competition-it is not about that. I want to save my local hospital and services more than anybody else. The hon. Member for Islington, North talked about demonstrations and marches in his constituency and about the all-party support for them. In Hillingdon, there is nothing but unity among all the local Members of Parliament and the other parties there. This is about trying to preserve what we want for our constituents and fellow residents; it is not about trying to score party political points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para21"><a name="10030993000467">In A and E departments, members of staff do not hang around waiting for work to come in; they are overstretched as it is. If, as is the suggestion in north-west London, three hospitals are left with an A and E department, Hillingdon will be saved. Of course, I would be delighted were that the case. However, if only two are to remain, I am afraid that Hillingdon will go, according to the plan. If Hillingdon is saved, however, Ealing is on the list to go-and where will all those people currently going to Ealing go? Are they all suddenly going to pour into Hillingdon hospital? There is not the capacity-never mind the difficulties of actually getting there and the geography of it!</p>

It is doing an excellent job. It has never had a particular golden age. In 1967, I had to wait a very long time to have my wrist reset, because there had been a major accident. However, David McVittie, at Hillingdon hospital, has been putting a lot of time and investment into ensuring that services are improving. We had hoped that a new hospital would be built-it was talked about-on the RAF Uxbridge site. That dream has disappeared. We hoped then that Hillingdon hospital itself would be improved-that was talked about, too-but that idea seems to have gone now. There is also talk about having one polyclinic in each area, but where they might be has only been talked about. What about the people who do not have to go to A and E?

While we are talking about our own hospitals, we should be talking about mental health services. Twenty one per cent. of NHS mental health beds in London have been lost over the past four years. My message to the NHS and the Minister is stop fiddling around with the systems and concentrate on delivering the service that my constituents and I, and all Members of the House and their constituents, expect and deserve.</p>

 I want to tell a tale of two hospitals. Mitcham's Wilson hospital was endowed by a local benefactor, Sir Isaac Wilson, back in 1928. He specifically donated it for health purposes, but in the 1990s there was a Conservative Government. The public campaigned long and hard to keep this much loved cottage hospital open-but the Tories would not listen, and they closed it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para25"><a name="100309138000003">Now, however, there is a different Government, and later this month the Wilson hospital will reopen as a general practitioner-led health centre, open from 8 in the morning till 8 at night-the hours that patients want-365 days a year. However, that is just the first stage of the plan to improve the Wilson, and it will ultimately be a full care centre offering diagnostics, a variety of medical treatments, dentists and GPs, out-patient treatments, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, X-rays, electrocardiography, ultrasound, a baby clinic and even minor day surgery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para26"><a name="100309138000004">What is more, the Wilson is not just getting a care centre; it is going to reopen as a proper cottage hospital, with minor operations and more than 50 intermediate care beds for people recuperating from operations or in need of care that they cannot get at home. The first stage-our local GP-led health centre-opens on 31 March. The remainder of the hospital will be open by 2013. That is still three years away and subject to planning approval, but I want to commend Ministers, officials and NHS staff for all that they have done so far, and take this opportunity to encourage them to keep up their good work. We are delighted with our new GP-led health centre, but we want the rest as soon as we can have it. The Wilson is in one of the most deprived wards in the whole of south-west London, and will make an enormous difference to many people's lives.</p>

St. Helier opened in the 1930s to serve one of Europe's largest council estates, but by the 1990s it had become shabby, and in 1996 it became infamous when patients were left on trolleys in the corridor because there were no beds. If anybody wants a reminder of what a Tory Government means, it is patients dying in the corridor because there is no room in the hospital. St. Helier was at rock bottom, so NHS bosses under the previous Government developed plans to shut it and move its services across south London to Croydon. Things happen slowly in the NHS, but a process was set in motion, and eventually the local NHS proposed moving everything to Belmont, in the Surrey suburbs. However, when residents across the region were consulted, Belmont was the least favourite choice. St. Helier was the favourite choice.</p>

Unfortunately, as I am sure the Minister of State, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), would admit, things do not always run smoothly in an organisation as big as the NHS. There have been a few jolts along the way, but last year London's NHS finally approved the full plans for St. Helier hospital, and last month the Department of Health gave them the green light.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para29"><a name="100309138000007">I would like to thank my right hon. and learned Friend personally for his enormous help. He has repeatedly met me, as well as the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) and for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), who have been assiduously helpful themselves. He has been very hands-on, and has done his best to ensure that officials deliver the health service that people in Mitcham and Morden, Sutton and Carshalton all want. Now we just have to wait for the final rubber stamp from the Treasury. I thank Ministers for all their support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para30"><a name="100309138000008">I have invited my right hon. and learned Friend to meet my constituents to hear what they think about our local NHS. I am pleased to say that he has agreed to join us later this month. He is very welcome. In many ways he is the personification of the tale of two hospitals, but it is also a tale of two Governments. The first was a broken Government running a broken NHS, shutting a cottage hospital that had been built to help poor workers in south London and plotting to close a general hospital where people were dying on trolleys because they could not find beds-the worst instincts of a Conservative Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="100309-0010.htm_para31"><a name="100309138000009">Those were the worst of times, but that was the 1990s. Now it is 2010. Our broken health service is slowly being put back together under a Labour Government, with the Wilson reopening and St. Helier not only safe from closure, but likely to be completely rebuilt. It might be stretching the point to say that we are now in the best of times, but things are certainly a lot better than they were. I am proud of the progress that we have already made and hopeful about future progress. On behalf of my constituents, I would thank like to thank everyone who has supported our local NHS in the past 13 years.</p>

 I shall restrict my comments. I shall not be party political, nor shall I give a history lesson, because our constituents want and deserve more than cheap political point scoring, although it is unfortunate that this debate is happening at a time when a general election is to be held in a matter of a few weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="100309-0011.htm_para0"><a name="100309138000011">Let me start by talking about secrecy. Normally, the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes) and I would be called in to the primary care trust for a meeting to discuss any proposals, but surprisingly on this occasion the trust did not want us together; it wanted us separately. However, when we went in, we both faced the same panel-a panel of doctors and clinicians-telling us why it was better for our constituents not to have services at King George hospital, and how that would benefit them. We were told that things would be absolutely fine, but let me say this to those bureaucrats. After a public meeting with hundreds of people, which I, like the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), held, we too had a march involving all the parties. The hon. Member for Ilford, South and I, together with other hon. Members in the area, worked together for what is best for our constituents-not what is best for the political parties, but what is best for the people who put us here.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Before A and E, and maternity services, could be transferred from King George hospital, which would be a negative move for his constituents, additional space would have to be created at Queen's hospital, which is already at full capacity. That could be achieved only by moving some existing services elsewhere, but there is no suggestion of what those services might be or where they would be moved to.</p>

 My hon. Friend is perfectly right. The biggest problem in this whole exercise is that Queen's hospital cannot cope even now. There are many occasions on which it cannot take A and E patients, who are diverted back to King George hospital, so how cutting the services there could possibly benefit anybody I do not know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="100309-0011.htm_para2"><a name="100309138000017">We have also seen another major problem. We heard earlier about the NHS and rewards for failure. This House has heard me say before that the previous chief executive in the Barking, Havering and Redbridge trust got a substantial pay-off for working up one of the largest deficits in this country, totalling more than £100 million, which is why the current problems exist.</p>

I promise that I am not scaremongering, but lives will be lost, given the time that it would take for someone living in the west of my constituency-for instance, in Hainault, where I happen to live, or in Woodford or Woodford Bridge-to get to Queen's hospital in Romford. The proposals have to be stopped. That is why, whatever motion we have tabled, if it says, "We must halt this now," it is the right motion. We cannot have these ludicrous cuts. I have received more than 1,000 communications from my constituents. Surprisingly enough, not one has said, "We think it'd be a good idea to cut services at King George"-and that is true across the political spectrum; this has nothing to do with party politics or scaremongering. I have also received anonymous e-mails, but I am not even going to mention those because they were anonymous, and I do not know whether they were correct or not. However, I do know that many staff at the hospital are scared to speak their minds because they fear to lose their jobs. I understand and respect that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="100309-0011.htm_para4"><a name="100309138000019">I have one final point. At the public meeting that I held, I was told by the PCT and a doctor that if somebody had a heart attack outside King George hospital, they would be taken to another A and E unit. I have never heard anything so ludicrous. How could it possibly be better for anybody not to be assessed at the A and E unit closest to where they live? If we do not stop the proposals-not only the proposals for King George hospital, but those for hospitals across our area-we will be letting down the very people who elected us to this House last time, and who will or will not elect us here in a few weeks.

 I welcome this opportunity to debate health care in London, primarily because there has been a lack of transparency and debate about alleged NHS London plans for my local hospital, Ealing hospital, and for other hospital trusts across London. Leaked reports from NHS London have caused great concern among my constituents about the future of Ealing hospital and its A and E, maternity, children's and acute services. The local paper, the <i> Ealing Gazette</i>, has begun a campaign, along with the local community, to save our services at Ealing hospital, and I have pledged my support for that campaign.</p>

I have also had discussions and correspondence with NHS London and with the Secretary of State for Health. I should like to quote from the NHS integrated service plan for 2009 to 2014, which was drawn up by the north-west London commissioning partnership at the behest of NHS London. The following paragraph relates to the plans for Ealing hospital:</p>

All three Boards support this proposal. The provider services of NHS Brent are likely to join this organisation. This will promote an innovative locally based model of community provision. All involved acknowledge that this will, over time, reduce the level of acute services on the Ealing site and they will be transferred or tendered to other acute provider management   <br>

 My hon. Friend is making a characteristically powerful case, and I know how much he cares for, and has fought for, the A and E department at Ealing hospital. Does he agree that of all the boroughs he has mentioned, Ealing has the largest population-nearly 330,000-and that those people have an extraordinary range of health problems and inequalities that are almost unique within the sector? Does he also agree that, if this glorious amalgamation-this great mélange of trusts-should come together, all that is special and unique about Ealing would be lost, including, above all, the ability of Ealing hospital to attend to those special needs and demands?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="100309-0011.htm_para8"><a name="100309138000026">I recognise the need to develop more locally based primary care services at polyclinics, but they are as yet unbuilt and untried. Ealing hospital has approximately 100,000 A and E patients each year and, although many of those could be treated in a primary care setting, many could not, and those patients are dependent for their treatment-and, in some instances, their lives-on the acute services that are an integral part of the A and E department. With such large numbers visiting Ealing's A and E, which was originally designed to treat only 30,000 patients, we have to ask ourselves where they would all go if the A and E were to close.</p>

I live only five minutes away from it, and I am not planning on moving away from the area, so it will always be my local hospital. My children and grandchildren also see it as their local hospital. My grandchildren were born there, and my daughter-in-law received life-saving treatment there. Ealing hospital serves the majority of my constituents, many of whom are from ethnic minority groups and who do not have English as their first language. They are often disadvantaged, vulnerable and voiceless. They would have to travel much further if A and E and acute services were closed or downgraded at Ealing hospital. Their distinctive cultural and language needs are currently well met by the hospital, and I doubt that that would be the case elsewhere. Along with the consultants, I am also concerned for the safety of patients if there were no A and E and acute services at the heart of my community at Ealing hospital.</p>

 I particularly appreciate this opportunity to speak in the debate in defence of my local hospital, Kingston hospital. I am joined in my campaign by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey). We first learned of the risk to the hospital's accident and emergency and maternity departments towards the end of last year. We told NHS officials that we thought the plans were outrageous. Kingston's maternity department deals with nearly 6,000 births a year, and the A and E unit treats more than 100,000 patients a year. It is therefore busier than almost any other hospital that has been mentioned. We agreed that we would hold back from going public with our campaign until the documents had been published. However, we were told in January that the documents would be withheld until after the general election, so we went public with our campaign anyway.</p>

Those who did so are well aware, however, that, on 8 February, we put into the public arena the document that was leaked to us confirming everything that we had said about the threats to Kingston hospital. That document-the "South-West London Strategic Plan: private and confidential: final draft"-is now on our website. It lists the 18 options under consideration, nearly all of which, unfortunately, involve the loss of services at Kingston hospital.</p>

I turn to the Government and ask them to provide the information so that our local people can be fully engaged and involved in absolutely key and critical decisions at a time when decisions should be flexible and are formulated. I also turn to the Conservatives and ask why they are singling out south-west London as place for which they do not demand information and why they will not join in the defence of the hospital, because it is time that they did, for the sake of all our constituents.</p>

Perhaps, however, that should not the case in this instance, as we are all concerned about secrecy and plans that are being meted out without proper public consultation or clinical input. In Enfield, we can peer into and go beyond the world of Darzi and see what the real world could be like. We are, in a sense, the leaders of the pack when it comes to health care for London. Plans were put in place three years ago, which in many ways have been mirrored across London, so let us peer in and see what has happened in Enfield.</p>

We hear a lot in documents about wide consultation, but it did not reach the doors of many of my constituents or, indeed, those of my hon.

widespread concern and a lack of confidence. It gave a clue as to what the world would look like if the Darzi model were followed through, and people should be concerned. It is apparent that the call for a local-led solution was nowhere near the mark when it came to Enfield. This was a top-down model, prescribed from on high and greatly restricted in the options presented. It asked the questions to produce the answers that were wanted in order to justify the Secretary of State's decision in September 2008 to downgrade consultant-led A and E and maternity services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="100309-0012.htm_para1"><a name="100309138000048">Interestingly, if one had gone across the country at the time of the consultation, one would have seen a replica model of health care being followed through. The model had nothing to do with any particular input or variation in local need. There were similar campaigns on the Sussex coast-across Chichester and Worthing, for example. All the models were based on the same one that came from on high in Enfield.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="100309-0012.htm_para2"><a name="100309138000049">The same has been said elsewhere. Sir George Alberti came in as the troubleshooter to fix the problem. He also recognised the lack of public engagement and expressed concerns about the need for clinical engagement. Crucially, he said there was a need for pump-priming and bridge funding for the PCTs to ensure that their primary care services were in place before any of the secondary care changes were made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="100309-0012.htm_para3"><a name="100309138000050">Was there a bright new dawn in Enfield, which others could welcome and then follow down the same road? In the cold light of day in 2010, we see a primary care trust that is still strapped for cash and facing a historic debt of some £25 million. It is still struggling to get within a double-digit figure for its current debt, while the area still struggles to get any decent primary care. The poly-systems are hardly in place across the borough and we are left with the Secretary of State's decision to downgrade consultant-led A and E and maternity services. We have had some clarity about the situation, so we know that we are left with a 12-hour urgent care centre and at best a 24-hour doctor-led primary care service at Chase Farm hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="100309-0012.htm_para4"><a name="100309138000051">As in Islington and elsewhere, we had a march, with thousands of people participating, and I was joined by my hon. Friends the Member for Broxbourne and for Chipping Barnet and by the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) and the right hon. Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan). We were all together, campaigning to ensure that we retained our consultant-led A and E and maternity services. Thousands of people signed petitions; the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Enfield, North, Nick de Bois, led the campaign, presented the petition and worked extremely hard.</p>

Conservative Members are full square behind the need to recognise that there should be consultant-led care, but the champagne has been popped, regrettably, by the right hon. Lady at the door of the A and E unit. What was the celebration? A downgrade of our services. It is not possible to sit on both sides of the barricades in this argument; it is necessary to stand full square behind the people of Enfield, who do not want a downgrade of our services.</p>

asking why, given all the money that is going into the health service and given the rising demand, we are reducing access to accident and emergency services while increasing management of contracts and increasing waste.

The £500 million funding gap is raised, and there is the question of whether between one and three major acute hospitals-the North Middlesex or Barnet, for example-will retain a 24-hour A and E service. A document published by NHS London questions whether it would be safe for those local hospitals to retain their maternity units, despite the increasing birth rate and increasing demand.</p>

 The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) was doing so well until the end of his speech. This debate has to be slightly bigger than the ponderous party politics outlined by him then, and outlined earlier by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley). The notion that there is a land of milk and honey just waiting for the time when the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire takes over is palpable nonsense, and the hon. Gentleman knows it.</p>

There is a dilemma between the local and the strategic in London, which has been woefully neglected since the inception of the national health service. I would say-of course I would, as a suburban Member of Parliament-that for too long everything has been sucked into the centre, courtesy of the fancy and precious London teaching hospitals, which admittedly are wonderful, and to the detriment of the suburbs. That dilemma has still not been resolved, and sadly it has not been and will not be resolved by Boris Johnson, as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire intimated.</p>

roughly here, in 1998, during the passage of the Bill that became the Greater London Authority Act 1999, and said that if in 10 years' time the Greater London assembly and the Mayor had not evolved enough to take a significant and direct role in the strategic health concerns of London, the Act would prove to be a failure. For all the glossy little documents that Boris Johnson has produced, he has, as I have said, done nothing of any consequence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="100309-0012.htm_para11"><a name="100309138000061">If we are honest in a cross-party context, we must agree that the dilemma is between the strategic and the local. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate, who lamented what had happened to Chase Farm. Chase Farm matters to me as well, because it is linked with Barnet, and if Barnet health authority decides to do things at either Chase Farm or Barnet there will be consequences for Edgware hospital, which is 10 yards away on the other side of the Edgware road.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="100309-0012.htm_para12"><a name="100309138000062">Where does the local begin and where does it end? In January 1997 the Tories closed Edgware general hospital. They downgraded it, and left it with Barnet. It cannot be enough to make the local prevail over the strategic when people's health needs do not recognise borough boundaries in a nice convenient way.</p>

 A few months ago the Secretary of State signed off the controversial downgrade of Chase Farm that was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes), on the understanding, and on the basis of repeated promises, that Barnet would be upgraded to take the pressure and the extra patients. How can the right hon. Gentleman possibly justify the decision of NHS London to discuss downgrading Barnet after the promises made about Chase Farm?</p>

 The hon. Lady should listen. I am not justifying it at all. I am simply saying that what happens in one part of London has serious ramifications in another part of London that is apparently not particularly close to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="100309-0012.htm_para13"><a name="100309138000065">The key question is "If not this, then what?" Does there need to be a strategy review and overhaul of what is going on in London? I think that everyone would answer "Yes", but anyone who answers "No" is living in the past, because the real world moves on. However, when it comes to the question of whether the bureaucracy has the capacity and is properly equipped to deal with such an overhaul, I hesitate. Let me give an example. When the maternity service at Northwick Park hospital was reconfigured 10 or 12 years ago, it could not have been known that more than half the cases presenting to the service would be in the high-risk category, because that particular part of the population was not there then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="100309-0012.htm_para14"><a name="100309138000066">Where are the flexibility and responsiveness that would make it possible to deal with the dynamics of what is going on in London? Local needs cannot just mean PCTs. Unlike the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam), who has represented about three dozen parties and four constituencies-he is not in Chamber at present-I do not argue that there should be far fewer PCTs. There should be co-operation between PCTs. I believe-and here again I agree with the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire-that there are local dimensions in which public and preventive health should be provided all the more.</p>

Anyone who visits any other European country will find that most of the cases that present to A and E encounter nothing resembling the provision here, because people in such countries as Germany and Sweden are much more aware and much more educated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="100309-0012.htm_para16"><a name="100309138000068">If various different organisations such as trusts and PCTs are to deal with local health provision in this country, my one plea is that they should talk to each other. Apart from the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital, whose trust is separate from the PCT, there are no hospitals in my constituency. Edgware community hospital, 10 yards away on the other side of the Edgware road, is hugely important, but is run by Barnet. Just the other side of the Northwick Park roundabout is Northwick Park hospital, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner), which is run by Brent. In the middle is Harrow PCT. At present the PCT is doing some very good work looking into the possibility of a polyclinic and the reconfiguration of GP services in the east of the borough, which is long overdue. Barnet, meanwhile, is considering what provision for Edgware community hospital should be over the next 10 years. Are they talking to each other? Not enough.</p>

Is it talking to Harrow PCT about the configuration of GPs in the east of Harrow? Can the three together come up with a solution that has a degree of synergy? That is almost sub-strategic, but it is certainly supra-local.</p>

Simply talking-as I know Ministers are not-about things being driven top-down is equal bunkum. Where are the mechanisms that could get things right in the middle? I fear that they have not yet been developed. I think that the concern about sector-based and sometimes secretive solutions is partly due to the fact that no one in one part knows what those in the other part are doing. Of course there should be more openness, but there must also be a strategic review that takes local dimensions fully into account.</p>

 I am very mindful that others wish to speak, so I shall be brief. The Minister constantly refers to the way in which these are local initiatives, but it has been clear in the debates from the four quarters of London that a single blueprint is being pursued on these proposals. I have a great deal of admiration for the hon. Members for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) and for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) because of how they have ensured that this debate has the highest profile. However, I fear that we will pass round the black spot as it were, on this proposal because if they are successful in defending services at Kingston hospital, somewhere else in the sector will lose out. I have been impressed, in a way, with how NHS officials have spoken to me in dramatic terms, saying that I will kill or disable people if I oppose these proposals.

We must remember that Croydon has a large black and minority ethnic community, which faces particular health issues to do with diabetes and stroke. Reference has been made to the concentration of stroke resources at St. George's hospital, which we campaigned against in Croydon. With this proposal we again face the prospect of the removal of a great deal of specialisms from hospitals such as Mayday university hospital. This sort of downgrading, which is also proposed for St. Helier and Kingston hospitals, means that that they will become "local" hospitals. In essence, this proposal will turn Mayday university hospital into what the Croydon general was: it will become, in effect, a place for respite and recovery. When I said that this is a bit like having a university where the research professors have been sent 10 miles down the road, I was told that I need not worry because the consultants would visit one day a week. That was not a terribly reassuring briefing to receive on how these things will work.</p>

He raised the issue again and received reassurances from the Conservative Front-Bench team about it today. It has taken eight or nine years to get nowhere on that hospital, and that is an example of how polyclinic savings will not be delivered, because the place has just not been built yet. As for my constituency, people will have to go to a polyclinic in the centre of Croydon, sited on a slip road off a flyover. Let us try to imagine people having to go there in an emergency. They are not going to go on a bus. It will not be easy to deliver a baby on a slip road off a flyover. If there is a prospect of people being able to park, they will be competing in a town centre with residents who are already desperately competing for parking spaces. These are practical examples of how NHS officials-people who are making the decisions, and not democratically-have no understanding or sense of the real practicality of delivery.</p>

I congratulate the trust on its success in winning this key unit, which is part of a scheme projected to save 500 lives a year across London.

Today, NHS Brent is one of the two fastest improving PCTs in the country based on the Care Quality Commission performance ratings for 2008-09. It is a borough that recalls 19-hour waits on trolleys in A and E under the Conservatives, and it is meeting its targets on four-hour waiting lists. In particular, it has exceeded the 93 per cent. target for cancer waits of no longer than 14 days. Critically, this is about not only improved targets, but lives saved: mortality-not only for cancer but for cardiovascular disease- has vastly improved.</p>

It has already begun to work in this area and the Change4Life campaign that the Department has been running is extremely productive in this respect.

 I am sure that many people watching the debate will think that that time could have been better spent focused on what Members from all parties were saying. Indeed, as we have heard over the past few hours, concern has been expressed from both sides of the House about the process that is unfolding and about how our NHS services in London will be reconfigured over the coming months unless we halt this process. I hope that tonight's debate has given Ministers some cause for concern, because residents across London are absolutely furious that they are not being involved in this process in the way that they want to be.</p>

Even the Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon. and learned Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), when he was introducing the debate on behalf of the Government, admitted that Londoners put up with a worse health service than other parts of the country, in spite of the tireless work of NHS staff in our primary care trusts, GP surgeries and hospitals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="100309-0013.htm_para5"><a name="100309138000096">I hope that at the end of this debate Ministers will address some of the concerns that have been raised. Although in London we have some of the best hospitals in the country-and, indeed, even in the world-we also have, as we have heard, some of the worst health outcomes, with stroke, heart disease and cancer being particular causes of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="100309-0013.htm_para6"><a name="100309138000097">Health inequalities in London are complex. The London poverty profile shows that three quarters of the London boroughs with the highest rates of premature death are in inner London. The risk of premature death in Newham and Lambeth is 250 per 100,000 people, which is twice that in Kensington and Chelsea. There are also unequal levels of long-term illness, with east London disproportionately affected. The last census revealed that 15 per cent. of adults in Islington, Hackney, Newham and Barking and Dagenham suffered a long-standing illness-twice the level of such illness in Richmond and Kingston. It is perhaps no wonder that some of the Members representing those constituencies have taken the opportunity to flag up their concerns about the changes in health care provision that could be coming down the track for their constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="100309-0013.htm_para7"><a name="100309138000098">What have we had in response to that complex series of health care needs? We have a city-wide strategy from NHS London and now, as we have heard today, some specific plans are being worked up, apparently behind closed doors, by individual so-called NHS sectors. NHS London has predicted that its funding shortfall by 2017 could be £5 billion. On the back of that assessment have come some serious unfolding plans to reorganise services, shifting care away from acute hospital provision to community services and centralisation of specialist services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="100309-0013.htm_para8"><a name="100309138000099">Those far-reaching changes have raised the prospect that behind closed doors we could have plans for some of London's hospitals to be downgraded and even closed down. In all the proposals that seem to be being worked up, it is interesting to see that there does not seem to be much mention of the fact that management costs in the NHS have skyrocketed. There does not seem to be much mention of the fact that 15 per cent. of the estates owned by the NHS in London are either unoccupied or underutilised. I know that from personal experience, as the Putney hospital site in my constituency has been derelict for the past decade. The local primary care trust apparently has no ability to bring it into use for our local health care provision.</p>

 I think it would have a number of important differences. First, it would be led at a local level by GPs. The Minister has said that clinicians are discussing it among themselves, but we think that that is not good enough. Of course clinicians need to be involved, but so do GPs and, critically-this has come across in every speech made tonight-so do the public. People feel like they are going to be presented with a fait accompli when they have had no opportunity for input at an early stage. That is why we have had the debate  <br>

today-to start a proper debate that the public can be part of. If Ministers ignore that, they will be going down a very dangerous route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="100309-0013.htm_para10"><a name="100309138000103">Serious questions have been raised today about the reliability of the funding projections on which the reorganisation is based. The assumptions are questionable -they have even been questioned by the work of the King's Fund, for example, which seems to undermine whether the assumptions we have will actually work. Above all, it seems to be a financially driven process. We need a careful, considered assessment of London's health care needs and of how they will change over the coming years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="100309-0013.htm_para11"><a name="100309138000104">In particular, we have heard concerns about the fact that we will see patients transferred to community services when those services, or polysystems, as they are being called-more impenetrable language that the public can never understand-are not even necessarily in place. That is a real concern. We heard the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) about what has happened in his constituency, which flag up that we are right to be concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="100309-0013.htm_para12"><a name="100309138000105">I shall make progress, because I know that the Minister will want to answer some of the concerns that have been raised tonight. Of course, the other issue that has emerged is, as has just been mentioned by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), that the approach has been secretive. We have all urged our local NHS providers to be transparent with the public about the process. Whatever the Minister says, it is not being driven locally-it does not even seem to be driven clinically. The public seem to have no access to the debate that is going on in the inner recesses of the NHS, and they are deeply concerned about that. We need a different approach that is rooted in local communities and that involves GPs, clinicians and, critically, the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="100309-0013.htm_para13"><a name="100309138000106">The conclusion to the debate must be that the current process has been discredited and should therefore be halted. The assumptions regarding the solutions that have been worked up about moving services into the community are flawed financially, the focus is apparently on cutting front-line services rather than on challenging the massive growth of bureaucracy in the NHS that has occurred under Labour, and the public have no involvement in the process at the very time when they should be central to it. That simply is not good enough. As we have heard, there is simply no transparency. I take this opportunity to urge NHS London to start being transparent and to start communicating with the public on the ground in the communities who are so worried about what is going on. Instead, the Minister has tried to justify the process when he should be challenging it. There has almost been unanimity across the Chamber regarding our concerns about this process. I conclude by saying that we all have a chance tonight to represent those concerns on behalf of our constituents. If we do not take that chance, I am sure that our constituents will represent their own concerns about this issue at the ballot box.</p>

<meta name="Date" content="9 Mar 2010">

<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 212</b><br>
(Justine Greening) this evening. The case for change in London is undeniable. When Lord Darzi started the process of reviewing the NHS in the capital, London was consistently rated as the worst of the 10 strategic health authorities. Its rates were among the worst for mortality, waiting times, quality measures and patient experience. It is impossible to argue that that was an acceptable state of affairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="100309-0013.htm_para14"><a name="100309138000108">Much has been said about inequality in health tonight, particularly by the Conservative party. That is pleasing because I believe that until Labour came into government in 1997, the words "inequality in health" were not allowed to be uttered in the Department of Health. Londoners deserve, at the very least, the same chances and the same level of care and treatment that their family and friends in other parts of the country receive. That is what Healthcare for London is about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="100309-0013.htm_para15"><a name="100309138000109">The massive task of turning health care in London around is not led by politicians in Westminster, the Government or civil servants in Whitehall. It is all run by clinicians-doctors, nurses and other dedicated health care professionals on the ground-in close consultation with the communities they serve. The Healthcare for London framework for action was developed in response to that, and the case for change and the recommendations for responding to it were accepted by the public. Primary care trusts consulted on the case for change and received more than 5,000 responses. We had about 40,000 visitors in all to the website and to meetings and roadshows. The public were clearly in favour of our making a set of changes built on considerations of quality, safety, outcomes and patient experience. A joint London overview and scrutiny committee that represented all 33 boroughs was formed, and it agreed the proposals with recourse to the Secretary of State referral. That gives the proposals local legitimacy and means that we can be held to account for their delivery.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for setting out how the consultation took place. She, like me, will have worn out her shoes campaigning against many Tory cuts in the NHS. It is worth reminding the House that in the period between 1979 and 1997, 10 hospitals were closed in Greenwich. In comparison, a brand new community hospital is being opened in the heart of my constituency in 2011.</p>

 That has also to do with the calibre of the MP and what they can bring to an area. Certainly, when I worked in the health service under the Conservative party, Barney Hayhoe, who is now a Lord, was a Health Minister, but one thing that he could not have been accused of was selfishly looking after his own constituency's health needs. I spent most of my time working in a crumbling old workhouse.</p>

It is all the more important that we take this opportunity to raise the issue on the Floor of the House because, for reasons that I hope we will be able to set out fairly succinctly, there is an extraordinary set of circumstances, which gives rise to a couple of the most bizarre statutory instruments we have ever seen.</p>

 Indeed. It is extraordinary behaviour, and we can set out why. We make no bones about tabling a motion condemning in trenchant terms the attitude and behaviour of the Government towards restructuring in Norfolk and Devon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="100309-0014.htm_para5"><a name="100309151000007">It is worth reviewing a little of the background to the present situation. Hon. Members will recall that back in 2007 the then Secretary of State invited a number of local authorities to make bids for unitary status. The key point is that about 26 bids were received. It was made clear by the then Secretary of State that they were to be judged against five strict criteria, which have been the basis upon which all subsequent decisions have been taken. It was made clear that to be successful, bids would be expected to meet all five criteria. Particularly relevant to this case were the criteria of affordability and value for money.</p>

 I was going to address that point in a moment, but it seems appropriate to do so now, because I observed a very strange thing. I was trying to work out what had happened since 2007, when the same Government -albeit with a certain change of personnel-rejected those two unitary bids on the ground that Norwich and Exeter were not capable of meeting two of the three criteria.</p>

The Labour party has lost one third of its seats in those two cities. It has lost a parliamentary seat, and a certain injustice has been shown in this world, because I have not yet mentioned that there was also a proposal for Suffolk. It was thought that there should be reorganisation in Suffolk, too, but that has been shelved. The people of Suffolk are not to be treated to a partial unitary reorganisation in which an area is ripped out of the rest of the county-rather like bleeding chunks of Wagner, as Ernest Newman once described it-and separated off.</p>

All that demonstrates, however, is that, first, the Government have exceedingly inconsistent standards, and, secondly, there is rough justice in this Government. My hon. Friend was right to refer to the two most satisfied people, because if one is or was in the Cabinet, one gets a unitary authority, but if one is a mere Under-Secretary, all one gets is a talking shop.</p>

 My intervention follows the hon. Gentleman's answer to the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell). The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) stated that the Conservative Opposition, if they were in government, would never impose unitary government. Did I understand that right? Is he saying that if the Conservatives were in government and any district council opposed unitary status, there would never be unitary status? Would there never be any new unitary authorities if the Conservatives were in government?</p>

 We have made it quite clear that we oppose imposed unitary local government, and I restate that. We oppose it because, first, it is a very significant distraction, and, secondly, the benefits of joint working, shared services and more effective service delivery are being achieved in two-tier areas through collaboration between district councils. I shall develop that point later. It just so happens that the three counties under consideration all have advanced and effective means of shared service working, which the Government choose to disregard and rip up. I have been pretty clear about our position.</p>

The intention was that the strict criteria should be adhered to, and it was made quite clear that they had not been met. Since then, however, there has been a lengthy and protracted consultation, a number of judicial reviews, the Secretary of State sought advice from the boundary committee for England, which came up with some proposals that were clearly not palatable, and more consultation has taken place. Finally, the Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination, the right hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), who will open for the Government in this debate, said that she and the Secretary of State would move swiftly to come to a decision and resolve uncertainty. All I can say is that the decision has not resolved uncertainty in Suffolk, although it may at least have resolved uncertainty for two parliamentary candidates elsewhere in the country.</p>

They did not go ahead with the county-wide unitary structures that had, rightly or wrongly, been the preferred view of the boundary committee for England; they did not maintain the status quo, which had been ruled out but might have been an option; and they did not look at any other option. Instead, they decided to revert, suddenly and without any warning, to the two small city unitary proposals that had been ruled out before, leaving the remaining counties on a two-tier basis. It was a wholly new approach that had not been canvassed or significantly consulted on. That behaviour, coupled with, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says, the expenditure of public money, triggered another fairly unprecedented development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="100309-0015.htm_para2"><a name="100309151000030">It is worth saying why the permanent secretary felt obliged to do that-the background being that the Secretary of State and the Minister of State had to concede, as was apparent to anyone who looked at the evidence, that the proposals still did not meet the five criteria. Nothing had changed in that regard, but they had a new idea that there were now compelling grounds to permit departure from the criteria.

 My hon. Friend has asked a question to which I do not readily have the answer. However, I am told that there have only been about nine in the whole length of time that this Government have been in office since 1997, and this is the first such direction that has been asked for by the Department for Communities and Local Government or its predecessor bodies, so it is an almost unprecedented circumstance.</p>

 I could not agree more about the lack of understanding. The concerns that exist about the financial basis on which Ministers have made their case in relation to this, and in relation to other unitary reorganisations, have been reinforced by Professors Chisholm and Leach in their book, "Botched Business", which had already pretty comprehensively demolished the financial model that was used for previous unitary reorganisations, as alluded to by the hon. Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell). Writing recently in "Public Money and Management" magazine, Professor Chisholm points out that a careful analysis of the transition costs self-assessed by the new unitary authorities shows that they are £47 million out from the transition costs asserted by the Department. In all cases, they have turned out, with one or two exceptions, to be significantly higher, so the methodology adopted by the Department is demonstrated, by significant academic research, to be significantly flawed.</p>

 I was pretty amazed when I realised that the Minister had taken time out from her doubtless busy schedule to write that letter, at the very moment when I had assumed she would be carefully crafting her eloquent, reasoned, closely argued and evidence-based response to the debate. Instead, she decided to write to the local authorities in the two counties concerned urging them to do what, ironically, they are already doing. She extols the virtue of joint working, and she and I are at one on that. The irony is that the two counties, and indeed Suffolk, which remains in some kind of municipal limbo, are all local authorities with excellent records in joint working. I shall take this opportunity to give some examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="100309-0015.htm_para17"><a name="100309151000066">Norfolk has an excellent and detailed shared services agreement and its LEAPP programme-lead, engage, aspire, perform in partnership. In Devon there is the integrated Devon concept and a series of joint local strategic partnerships, joint chief executives and joint service provision-all the things that the right hon. Lady is urging them to do, they are already doing without any need to be told by her. There is a joint growth point between Exeter and East Devon councils, which is important for these purposes because of all the growth outside Exeter. In Suffolk there is a pathfinder scheme for joint working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="100309-0015.htm_para18"><a name="100309151000067">Those are not local authorities that require a lecture from the right hon. Lady about joint working. The letter says something about the Government's priorities, and indeed about their timing and public relations, but I do not suppose we should expect otherwise. It demonstrates that the Government have made, in the words of one response from Norfolk that I have seen, "a perverse decision". In the words of the Saffron Housing Trust-not a particularly political body, I suspect-it was "the least rational choice".</p>

 Actually, I have a great deal of respect for the pride that those cities have. They have their lord mayors, and I have been pleased to see some of the civic work that they do, as do the historic counties. A sensible balancing act has to be carried out. Pride is an important consideration, but so must be proper process and consistency with the Government's own criteria. With every respect, I do not remember pride being one of the five criteria. Perhaps when the Minister opens the Government's defence, she will tell me that that is a third compelling reason that she has managed to think of in between writing letters to local authorities up and down the country this afternoon.</p>

I regret to say that that is ultimately what we are talking about here-a sordid little gerrymander, carried out by Ministers to advance a narrow and sectional interest. They are flying against evidence and seeking to distort it when it does not suit them. When the rules get in their way, they seek unilaterally to change them. The Secretary of State has ignored all objective criteria and pushed ahead for one reason only: the sectional interests of the Labour party are put first.

It is bad for the inhabitants of the counties and cities involved, and bad because it creates a very serious constitutional precedent indeed. For that decision to be taken in the dying days of this Parliament is close indeed to as grave an abuse of office by Ministers as I have seen in many a long day. I am sorry to have to say this, because I have always regarded the Ministers involved as decent and reasonable people even though I disagree with them, but in my judgment, the authors of that decision should be utterly ashamed of it.</p>

that the alternative proposals for single county unitaries in Devon and Norfolk did not meet all the criteria. Having considered the original proposals for Exeter and Norwich afresh against the criteria, our assessment was the same as that of my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State in December 2007-namely, that they too did not meet all the criteria. Having made this assessment, we considered the merits of each proposal, giving careful consideration to the circumstances in which there were compelling reasons to depart from the presumption that proposals that meet all the criteria are implemented and those that do not are not implemented.</p>

<p><a name="st_o368"><a name="100309151000104"><a name="100309-0016.htm_spnew13"><a name="100309151000237"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b>
 I do not understand why, in the case that the Minister is talking about, she appears not to be concerned that the proposals departed from the criteria, when the decision that the Government have taken now also departs from the criteria for reasons that, far from being compelling, appear to be utterly spurious.</p>

<p><a name="st_o369"><a name="100309151000105"><a name="100309-0016.htm_spnew14"><a name="100309151000238"><b>Ms Winterton:</b>
 I am just coming to an explanation of that. We looked at the wider consideration of the merits of each proposal. The suggestion that this is somehow a new or novel procedure is not true. In December 2007, when the then Secretary of State took her statutory decisions, she approached them in the same way. She recognised that it was in principle open to her to conclude-on the basis of the information available to her-that all the criteria were not met, but there was none the less a good reason to implement the proposal, or conversely that all the criteria were met, but the proposal should not be implemented. In the event, she decided that, having regard to all the circumstances then prevailing, it was appropriate at that time to implement the nine proposals that met the criteria and not to implement those proposals that did not meet the criteria. This conclusion was made clear in the statement by the then Minister for Local Government on 5 December 2007, in which he expressly explained that the basis for those decisions was the Secretary of State's assessment of the proposals against the five criteria set out in the original invitation, which had the status of guidance under the 2007 Act, and to which councils should have had regard when making their proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="100309-0016.htm_para15"><a name="100309151000106">This approach to decision making was reflected in the Department's letters of 29 June and 7 December 2009 to councils in the affected areas. These letters made it clear that an assessment against the criteria, while central to our decision making, would not be the sole determinant as to whether a proposal was implemented. In contrast to the unitary proposals that we considered in 2007, we judged that the circumstances today for Exeter and Norwich are very different, as I shall explain. We concluded, when looking at the merits of the proposals in the round, that there were reasons-which we found compelling-why the unitary proposals should, despite not meeting all five criteria, be implemented, given the circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="100309-0016.htm_para16"><a name="100309151000107">In the case of Norwich, that was not least because when the Total Place approach is factored into consideration of service delivery, the outcomes for services in Norwich and Norfolk could be as good as, if not better than, the outcomes envisaged by the value-for-money services criteria.</p>

there are two separate human resources functions, two separate finance functions and two separate PR functions? People in planning are working entirely in parallel, and social services and social care overlap in a wide variety of ways.

 In the Minister's explanation of what is meant by Total Place, she talked about local government working alongside the health service.

 Under our proposals, implementing a unitary Exeter and Norwich will cost £400,000 over five years, but thereafter there will be a saving of £6.5 million a year.

For example, while recognising that the Exeter proposal did not meet the affordability criterion, representations were made to us that the proposal should be implemented-this goes back to my earlier point-because Exeter city council was the driving force in the area, providing coherent strategic leadership on urban needs, growth and development, and that the two-tier system did not allow urban residents' views and political preferences to be heard at county level.</p>

In the meetings that right hon. and hon. Members attended, we were told over and over again, "Please take a decision quickly on this, so that there is an end to uncertainty."</p>

We did not accept any implication that the public interest lies with adopting the cheapest option across all three counties. We adopted the approach whereby we carefully assessed each proposal against the five criteria. In all circumstances we gave careful consideration to whether there were compelling reasons to depart from the presumption that proposals that meet the criteria are implemented and that those that do not are not.</p>

 The right hon. Lady talks about the cheapest option, but that will lead to pressure on council budgets. Representations were made to her Department that such budgetary pressures would lead to an inability to employ staff of the necessary quality, because of being unable to pay for higher grade staff that other authorities can pay for. Exeter will have exactly the same problem that other small authorities have had, in relation to having the right calibre of staff to undertake the necessary functions. This decision is not going to do Exeter a service; it will do it a disservice.</p>

Members: "And some evidence."] Absolutely. We need to hear the evidence for why these proposals had to be brought forward at this juncture and rammed through before the general election. Sadly, however, I do not think that we are any further forward than we were at the conclusion of the proceedings in Westminster Hall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="100309-0017.htm_para8"><a name="100309157000002">As the Minister rightly said, this has been a lengthy process, but the problem is that throughout it, the goalposts have continually been moved. It started with a tight fixed time scale, and other parts of the country wished to participate in the process at that stage. Bids from those areas therefore came forward quite rapidly, but they might have been of a different nature if there had been more time to consider which proposals were most appropriate. Those areas were under the impression that that was the only game in town, however. It then transpired that that was not the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="100309-0017.htm_para9"><a name="100309157000003">The next process entailed the boundary committee for England being asked to get involved, if the Government were unhappy with the bids. The boundary committee then looked at the evidence and came up with proposals for unitary counties, with which no one in the counties concerned was happy. There really was not a huge argument for unitary authorities in those areas.</p>

 The process was flawed right from the beginning. Four out of every 10 homes in the county of Devonshire were not involved in the process, because the people who live in Plymouth and Torbay were not allowed a say, even though the proposals will have an impact on them.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. This is the problem with the process. The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) talked about the arguments for and against unitary authorities, and he was right to say that people take different views. In my view, there is a strong case for unitary government where the boundaries make sense. However, it is ludicrous for the boundary committee-which was not involved at the start of the process; that was something that the Government hit upon halfway through-to draw lines round parts of an area and say that they should not be included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="100309-0017.htm_para10"><a name="100309157000006">We should look at the case of Torbay in passing, because many people would describe it as a unitary authority that was bound to fail, because it is quite small and tightly drawn. It is difficult, under any administration, for a small unitary to deliver its services effectively, for all the reasons that hon. Members will no doubt wish to talk about tonight.</p>

 If we look at Torbay or Devon, and officers working for one or the other, we see that they can work for either a small unitary authority or for a very large county authority. Which does my hon.

My hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) said publicly at the beginning of this process that he felt that this would be a way forward for Norfolk. If people across Norfolk had had the opportunity to make proposals with the prospect of gaining some measure of consensus, this might well have been an entirely different exercise.</p>

Will the hon. Gentleman support them in that?

For anyone active in opposition, in government or seeking to get there, one has to look at all the evidence relating to the case. There are preferences in certain local areas and parts of counties for particular proposals, as people feel a great loyalty to the institutions to which they are elected. That is one consideration, but far more importantly, we must judge how effective any unitary authority created within these boundaries would be.

 My hon. Friend's answer to the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) was perfect. The reason why I put forward the case for having a constitutional convention was that I could see a Stalinist process emerging that would completely ignore the people of Norfolk. I thought that there would no process to engage people about the future of local government for our county. I am not instinctively against unitary government at all; I think that it makes a lot of sense in many ways. The problem is that the people of Norfolk have been ignored in this process, which is why it caused outrage.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that contribution.

 If the hon. Gentleman had listened to what I said earlier, he might not have risked returning to the issue of splits in his own party over these issues.

 I must respond to the outrageous goading by the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon), whom I would almost call my hon. Friend. The Conservative county group, which supported a unitary Norfolk, was opposed by Tories in district councils across the county.

different parts of counties are bound to take different views. It would have been more helpful if, at the start of the process, everyone in the areas concerned had been allowed to discuss the issues through a constitutional convention.

 The hon. Gentleman mentioned division within parties. He will know that the Labour leader of Devon county council, Saxon Spence, has said that the system is unworkable in Exeter. Indeed, even some Conservative members of Exeter city council who are in favour of unitary government in principle recognise that this is not the time for it because of the changed economic circumstances, and because they see it as a party political move by the Labour party for the benefit of the right hon.

 The hon. Gentleman was dangerously close to saying that they were disunited on every other issue. We have had quite a debate already, and the issues that seem to be resolved are that unitary authorities on the scale proposed will have real difficulty in delivering services effectively, and that there is a huge question mark over the process that has been followed. Local people in those areas, regardless of what their views may have been at the beginning of the process, will feel that they have been served badly by that process, which has been done to them, as opposed to being one in which they have been engaged.</p>

We understand that although we made an excellent case-each of us had the support of all the parties within each council and of a very large proportion of the population in each council area-at the last minute the proposal was rejected largely because of the principled, or unprincipled, intervention of the then Member for Witney.</p>

There will always be political considerations and it ill behoves Conservative Members to pretend that it happens only under Labour Governments and never happened under Conservative Governments.

There is a balance to be struck between democracy, localism and community identity, and cost.

I have a letter dated 2 March, which is not very long ago, signed by the leader of the Conservative group and the Conservative chairman of scrutiny resources of Exeter city council. It makes it quite clear:</p>
<a name="100309-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="100309157000107"><ul><p class="tabletext">"An independent Exeter, with its own government, elected by and in touch with its own people, can make such decisions much more successfully. The city's voters will enjoy a much clearer idea of where responsibility lies and who to go to for help and advice.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="100309-0018.htm_para9"><a name="100309157000042">That is the view of local Conservative councillors on Exeter city council. It is also the view of the other groups on Exeter city council and I am surprised that Opposition Members have been laughing at that and belittling the views of their colleagues in the Conservative party, who are standing up for their city of Exeter.</p>

 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman can tell me, but I am talking about Exeter. He is talking about a county council that is seeking to impose its views on the city. He is belittling the views, published in the local newspaper in Exeter, of two Conservative Members of Exeter city council. He is in danger of suggesting that those Conservative councillors are writing one thing in their local paper and saying another in private to other Conservative members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="100309-0018.htm_para10"><a name="100309157000045">On unitary authorities in general, I have always been a supporter of unitary authorities, including when I was the leader of Oxford city council. I am even more strongly in favour of them now that I am a Member of Parliament for Milton Keynes because I have seen the huge difference that it has made to Milton Keynes to have a unitary authority and not be part of Buckinghamshire, which never looked after the interests of Milton Keynes, which has a wholly different population to the rest of Buckinghamshire with a wholly different culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="100309-0018.htm_para11"><a name="100309157000046">Cost considerations are important, but the huge benefits to Milton Keynes and other unitary cities of having councils that focus singly on the issues of those urban areas, that are clearly accountable to the populations of those areas and that work with other service providers in those areas override mere cost considerations. I absolutely understand why councillors in Exeter and the majority of councillors in Norwich want unitary status. Unlike Conservative Members, I believe that those cities would benefit enormously from that focus if they were to get unitary status, and I do not think that the surrounding counties would be impoverished at all. Buckinghamshire is much happier without Milton Keynes, just as we are happier not to be part of it, and I think that the same would be the case in Exeter, Devon, Norwich and Norfolk.</p>

First, there will be disruption and many services will be duplicated. Also, the financial criteria do not seem to add up. The fact that the House of Lords Merits Committee attempted to get further details and that the Department was unable to provide them stacks that up. The process has been a disgrace from the very beginning, and Ministers have finally produced the orders in desperation, but it is wrong to go ahead with them just before a general election. The Government have no manifesto claim on this issue at all. I suspect that the majority of people in Norfolk will judge the change on whether it delivers better quality services and whether their council tax goes up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="100309-0018.htm_para14"><a name="100309157000052">In an intervention on the Minister, which she kindly took, I said that the argument for a unitary Norwich would be strengthened if it were a five-star council-if it were Norfolk county council-but, sadly for the people of Norwich, it is not. It has always struggled. It has had poor leadership, it has not been able to manage its accounts and it has had all kinds of major problems. I honestly cannot see that a Norfolk unitary authority will be the engine to drive forward any form of future economic expansion for Norfolk. If anything, in fact, past criteria show that it will be a sheet anchor and that it will have an immediate impact on my constituents.</p>

The Minister and her colleagues have made great play of the fact that the permanent secretary is there only as an adviser but, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) said, he is actually the accounting officer. There is ministerial responsibility to consider. The whole issue should be referred to the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee, and Ministers should be held responsible-both personally and financially-for these decisions. What has happened has been shown, by both the permanent secretary and the Merits Committee, to have got close to breaking the law. I hope that Ministers will be held personally responsible. I also hope, in the event of a change of Government, that future Ministers will look into this matter and make certain that those people are held responsible.</p>

might be some future land grab. I say that that is a matter for the future, and that if his party were fortunate enough to be in office it could see the problem off at any time. In all seriousness, I believe that the case for damage being done elsewhere has not been strongly made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="100309-0019.htm_para1"><a name="100309157000057">The Conservatives have argued the case for unitary authorities since 1986, when the Conservative Government abolished the Greater London Council, the Inner London Education Authority and the six metropolitan county councils, and created 68 new urban unitaries. In 1994, the Conservatives did the same thing again in Scotland and Wales, and then in England the Banham commissioners -to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) referred-broke down counties such as Avon, Humberside, Hereford and Worcester, and Berkshire into smaller unitaries. I am glad to say that, from 2008, this Government have taken the process forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="100309-0019.htm_para2"><a name="100309157000058">In all those cases, the key point that is not accepted by the Opposition is that new authorities were created, with new councillors and officers to deal with the new situation. That was the moment for improvement. Of course, there were historic issues, and by no stretch of the imagination do I seek to defend all that happened, but that new situation is what we are debating this evening. As a result of the changes, many unitary authorities were created that were significantly smaller than Norwich-I will not list them all now, but they include Hartlepool, Darlington and Bracknell Forest-and that leads me to believe that it would be entirely possible to establish an effective new authority for Norwich.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="100309-0019.htm_para3"><a name="100309157000059">In summary, for 20 years there has been a strong and continuing tide towards unitary local government. The quality has been good, and the move has been supported by the Conservative as well as the Labour party. Of course there have been many local issues-some of them bitter-as private power bases have been dismantled and uncomfortable, but necessary efficiency changes driven through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="100309-0019.htm_para4"><a name="100309157000060">I was interested in the remarks by the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) in that regard. I do not want to misinterpret him, but he made it very clear that, if he were in office, he would propose no new unitaries if they had to be imposed against the wishes of other people. I take that to be a commitment that a future Conservative Government would never put in place a unitary Norfolk county council if there were opposition from districts in Norfolk. I also noted that he made no commitment to overturn in future any decision that had been made.</p>

 The Audit Commission has described Norwich county council's financial management as not fit for purpose. Given that, I cannot understand how a unitary Norwich could be the engine-what the Secretary of State called the potent force-for anything.</p>

 For three reasons. First, as I said, it will be a new council-that is important-all-out elected in 2011, with new chief officers and a new situation. Secondly, I believe that there will be genuine economies in various areas as a result of a unitary authority with services working together. Thirdly, the performance of the city council over recent years has been improving significantly from a very bad position, as the hon. Gentleman and others have rightly identified. The case for unitaries is powerful.</p>

 I am glad the hon. Gentleman has made that clear. I thought that with great subtlety he had ducked the point and not carried it through. I thought there had been a shift of policy, so I am glad he has clarified that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="100309-0019.htm_para5"><a name="100309157000065">The reason for unitary local government is that it is much more efficient than two-tier government. It is far more effectively co-ordinated and coherent. The value for money that it offers is far higher, the costs are lower, and the decisions taken by unitary local government are more transparent and much closer to the citizen. We can see the reason for that in Norwich today with the decisions being taken by the county council. The desire for unitary status has been massively increased, even in recent months, by a number of bad and irresponsible decisions taken by the newly elected Tory county council in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="100309-0019.htm_para6"><a name="100309157000066">First, the county council has decided to close two important social facilities for the elderly, the Essex rooms and the Silver rooms. It has no idea what commitment to give to support the frightened users of those services or what to do with the facilities. It is in an absurd position, which is so serious that the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Chloe Smith) says that she opposes the council's proposals-she has said that publicly-because those proposals come from people who know nothing whatsoever about Norwich.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="100309-0019.htm_para7"><a name="100309157000067">Secondly, the county council has decided to reduce the amount of money that it gives to urban schools, including in Norwich, which do not fit in with its county-wide priorities, because it is not concerned. Thirdly, unbelievably, the council has decided to turn off the street lights throughout my constituency between midnight and 5 am, on the grounds that what is all right for small rural villages is also okay for major urban centres. It is a ludicrous decision. It is no surprise that the decision is spreading fear across my constituency. Even my Tory opponent, Councillor Anthony Little, has started distributing leaflets expressing his concern, as he misleadingly implies that that has been a decision of the Labour city council rather than of the Conservative county council, because it is such a bad decision.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman may be aware that the county council is not doing as he has just suggested. As my hon. Friends have mentioned, that is rather more a spiel than a point.

The cost in terms of the paralysis in decision making, the diversion of management time and the judicial challenges involves money that could have been spent on local services-on the very services that the right hon.

Norwich city council is still dysfunctional; it is financially incontinent, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) pointed out; its accounts have not been properly signed off; and it has not had a clean bill of health from the Audit Commission. The right hon.

It has never been pro-enterprise, pro-jobs or pro-initiative, and for the Minister to say that something has dramatically changed since the original boundary committee report, and now she is absolutely convinced that this is the one council that can drive the jobs and enterprise agenda, is absolutely staggering. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) pointed out, the Department's permanent secretary, who after all is the accounting officer as well, clearly made the point that the argument in terms of jobs and the enterprise initiative is sparse and hollow.</p>

They want a county council that is able to deliver top-quality services. This is a beacon council-one of the very best in the country-that is delivering top-quality services in conjunction with the two-tier system. I also have a top-quality borough council in King's Lynn in west Norfolk. The status quo is working well, although it can work better, of course, through more partnerships and joint enterprises between councils.</p>

 I am 100 per cent. behind unitary authorities. Indeed, I am envious of the position that Norwich finds itself in of being offered the opportunity to have unitary status. My hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard) and I were fully supportive of a unitary authority for Great Yarmouth and Waveney, but that was not to be the case. We held that position some 13 or 14 years ago, when my hon. Friend and I were leaders of those respective councils and we were told, under the Conservative Administration, to look positively towards a unitary authority in which both those authorities would come together. We have been actively seeking the opportunity to take that forward, but have been prevented from doing so.</p>

However, we were let down very badly on the question of why Great Yarmouth and Waveney were unacceptable as a unitary authority. The boundary committee said that both local authorities were weak in political leadership and financial management. Opposition Members have claimed that that is so in Norwich, South. I ask the Minister to respond on the opportunities that there may well be to open up the matter again following the election of a Labour Government at the next election.</p>

Member for South-West Norfolk (Christopher Fraser), have said that Norfolk county council is delivering good services. However, the history in Great Yarmouth means that I differ from that point of view. Five or six years ago, the council closed village libraries in my constituency, despite opposition from the public and Conservatives on the local authority. It is trying to downgrade Gorleston fire station by taking away the retained firemen and replacing them with a crew from Yarmouth fire station. That is an absolute disgrace. Political opponents are trying to make out that it is a plan by the Labour Government, yet it is down to the fire committee of Norfolk county council.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a valuable point about value for money. I do not believe that the situation that she describes is the case. I have a fear for the future, which is that a Norfolk without Norwich will leave us somewhat devoid of democratic accountability. I am concerned that we will be left with the two-tier system in the rest of the county council area, which will still fail to deliver services in my area. That said, I firmly believe in the concept of unitary authorities as the way forward.</p>

I accept that the boundary committee has taken decisions that could be questioned. I have suggested to it on several occasions that a unitary authority in my constituency would have worked extremely well, but we have to move on from that. I support the concept that Norwich deserves unitary status, and I believe that the rest of Norfolk should move on and work towards unitary authorities in the rest of the county.</p>

 The Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination said that the Secretary of State had concluded that it is in the best interests of the people of Norfolk to go with this proposal. I regard that as high-handed arrogance of the worst sort, particularly as the people of Norfolk have had no opportunity at all to express our view through the entire process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="100309-0019.htm_para24"><a name="100309157000095">To take up the point made by the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke), I acknowledge that there are strongly held views on both sides and that some people genuinely argue with some passion for a unitary Norwich. I have no objection to the principle of unitary local government, although I have to correct one thing that the right hon. Gentleman and the Chairman of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), said. They argued that there is overwhelming evidence that unitary local government always produces good results; it does not. The Audit Commission tells us that the evidence is mixed. Some unitary authorities have worked very well and others have not, and the most important factor is the size of the local authority, whether it is unitary or two-tier. Larger local authorities tend to perform better than smaller ones, which is the concern in the case of Norwich.</p>

to this point has been scandalous, and it has been the most appalling waste of public money. That is partly because of the evidence-building exercise by a body that the Government created to conduct the process, but we must also take into account the money spent on lobbyists by councils on both sides of the debate and on lawyers in legal actions and judicial reviews. All that money-millions of pounds-should have been spent on delivering services to vulnerable people in Norfolk at a time when services in local government are under intense strain because of the state of public finances. It is a disgrace, and the Government should be condemned for it.</p>

 One does what one believes in. I have a strongly held view that the decision is wrong and that it is not based on evidence. It would therefore be utterly irresponsible for me, as a parliamentarian, to support the proposal, and I have no hesitation in opposing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="100309-0020.htm_para1"><a name="100309157000099">I argued at the beginning not that we should sit on the fence, as the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) outrageously suggested, but that we should build an agreed way forward for the future of local government, and there is a genuine case for people and civic society in Norfolk contributing to the process in a proper way over a reasonable period. However, the Government were not interested in that. The process that they have pursued is designed to impose change from on high. I appreciate that decisions must be reached, but the process did not involve people locally at all. Excluding the public from the process is utterly outrageous.</p>

Only 3 per cent. of respondents to the consultation supported the case for a unitary Norwich, and two thirds of voluntary organisations opposed the original proposals for a unitary Norwich, which came from Norwich city council, as did the majority of businesses, a substantial number of town and parish councils, most members of the public, and seven out of eight councils in Norfolk. There is no consensus in support of the proposal.</p>

health, social care and children's services. That was a good thing, and it meant better joint working between social services and the NHS. Three years later, as so often happens with this Government, we are moving on again, destroying the arrangement that had been established and creating two organisations to deliver adult social care in Norfolk and two to deliver children's services.</p>

 I wish to home in on the two compelling reasons about which we have heard so much in the debate on this important issue, although the Government have not disclosed what evidence lies behind those compelling reasons. The reason why Ministers felt able to depart from the criteria-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It is very appropriate that as I am about to speak about the situation in Exeter, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the right hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw) should grace us with his presence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="100309-0020.htm_para7"><a name="1003103000012">The first reason given by the Minister of State is economic regeneration, because, she claims, a unitary Exeter would be a far more potent force for delivering positive outcomes, both for the city and more widely, than the status quo two-tier local government. What is the evidence for that? I asked the Minister that question in an intervention, and she said that when the Exeter city councillors came to see her, they made a very good presentation. But that is not evidence to support the proposition that a unitary Exeter would be better at attracting inward investment and economic regeneration than the situation that has prevailed for many years and has been astonishingly successful over the last few years-the two-tier system of Devon county council and district councils working alongside it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="100309-0020.htm_para8"><a name="1003103000013">I have some experience in this area, because much of the future development land for Exeter lies outside the city boundaries, and in my constituency there is a place called Langage, which is a significant growth point for Plymouth. It is currently virgin land, but it is intended that factories and commercial buildings will be built, creating many thousands of jobs and employing many of my constituents. That site is within Devon county  <br>

council's area and on South Hams district council land, but it is a growth point for Plymouth. I have attended many meetings with the regional development agency, someone from South Hams, someone from Devon and someone from Plymouth, all trying to reach agreement on the development of that land. As it is intended to be the site for much of Plymouth's growth, it would be better if that land were inside Plymouth city's boundary. My point is that it is much easier to try to make decisions when fewer local authorities are involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="100309-0020.htm_para9"><a name="1003103000014">The Minister proposes that Exeter should have not two authorities-the county and Exeter district-making decisions, but three local authorities, just as we have on the outskirts of Plymouth. Those will be the unitary Exeter council, Devon county council and whichever district council covers the area. How can that be a more potent force in attracting inward investment and economic regeneration? It simply does not make sense, and it is definitely not a compelling reason. Instead, it is a blind leap of faith.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="100309-0020.htm_para10"><a name="1003103000015">We have also heard much about the second so-called compelling reason. The Minister has told us that a unitary Exeter could open the way to improvements in the quality of public services, and she places great store on the whole concept of Total Place. As we understand it, Total Place is all about different agencies and Departments-health, police and local authorities-working together to deliver services to the local community. It is about joined-up thinking, joined-up Government and joined-up delivery of services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="100309-0020.htm_para11"><a name="1003103000016">However, the Minister is now claiming that that can be better achieved by a unitary council, which seems to defeat the purpose of Total Place. If the police, the health authority, councils and other agencies can work together, so can a county council and a district council. It is all part of joined-up thinking and the delivery of services. Citing Total Place as another reason why this decision has been taken in the face of the five prevailing criteria does not make sense. The Minister has gone against the independent boundary committee, against her predecessor's judgment and against the advice of her permanent secretary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="100309-0020.htm_para12"><a name="1003103000017">No wonder the permanent secretary has written such a strong letter, which was read out earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill). It is couched in civil service-speak, but those of us who have been Ministers know exactly what the permanent secretary is saying to the Secretary of State. He is saying, "Are you out of your mind? Do not do this, because it will be a disaster. If you proceed, you must instruct me in writing so that I have a get-out when it goes belly up, which it will." He is saying, "Don't do this. You're making a huge mistake." We have asked about the evidence, but answer came there none.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="100309-0020.htm_para13"><a name="1003103000018">It is instructive and useful to look at what has happened in the rest of Devon and Cornwall in the transition to unitary authority government. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) made a few comments the other day, and in part she is right: it has taken time for Plymouth to settle down as a unitary authority-possibly five years. During those five years, a lot of taxpayers' money was wasted. It is fair to say that it has now settled down as a unitary authority, and is improving and giving good value for money. Torbay is also improving, but it has had its challenges. One reason why it has not really prospered is  <br>

that, for a unitary authority, it is very much on the small side. Yet Torbay is larger than Exeter, and there is no guarantee that Exeter can deliver the services. Cornwall has recently become a unitary authority, but it is taking a great deal of time to settle down, and the cost was far higher than was ever anticipated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="100309-0020.htm_para14"><a name="1003103000019">I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett), in her winding-up speech, will address a point that the Minister did not mention earlier. It is commonly accepted that the transition to a unitary authority in Exeter, if it goes ahead, will cost £25 million. Where will that money come from? It is certainly not in the current coffers of Exeter city council. The proposal is not viable, and flies in the face of common sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="100309-0020.htm_para15"><a name="1003103000020">Then we come to another point. This decision will not just affect the people of Exeter; it will profoundly affect the people of the rest of Devon. I cannot imagine a Devon county council without its county town-it is like ripping the beating heart out of a living body. It is difficult to anticipate how it will continue to function, and Devon county council estimates that it will cost every council tax payer in Devon £200 per annum more-simply to appease the Government's strange desire to bring about this outcome. It will affect not only the people of Exeter but the people of Devon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="100309-0020.htm_para16"><a name="1003103000021">The Minister might say, "You all came to see us to say that you don't want unitary authorities in Devon. Okay, but what is the right way forward?" The right way forward is staring us all in the face: co-operation between Devon county council and the district councils, enhanced two-tier status, the sharing of services, the reduction of overheads and working together in partnership, which is happening more and more every year. Devon is becoming an exemplar of how councils can operate together. The Government would have been well advised to leave this all alone. I hope that this proposal will be rejected in another place-and if it is not, I hope that the law courts will throw it out.</p>

The growth is planned to the east of the M5 in my constituency, in Cranbook, a new community of at least 3,000 dwellings, which will include a 30-hectare business park-Skypark-a 25-hectare science park, an inter-modal freight terminal, the expansion of Exeter international airport and a further 500 dwellings in East Devon, an area that covers 315 square miles, and not in Exeter, a city covering 18.5 square miles.</p>

Saxon Spence has said in evidence that there is effectively no way that Exeter can be set up as a unitary without central Government support. If the money is available to set up an Exeter unitary, and if we accept that central Government support will be needed, that means, ergo, that there is Government money around somewhere. As a Devon Member of Parliament who is satisfied with the status quo, please may I bid for that money, for my hard-pressed social services, for the survival of Bicton college, the only land-based agricultural college in the south-west, for the potholes in our roads, so that people can get about, or for capping council tax, which our hard-pressed pensioners are finding it increasingly difficult to pay?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="100309-0020.htm_para25"><a name="1003103000031">That is not just my view: if Ministers talked to anybody representing a constituency in Devon, from any party other than the Government party, or to any Member of Parliament representing a Norfolk seat, I suspect that they would say the same.

Otherwise, why are we in the worst recession that any of us has ever seen or is ever likely to see in our lifetime? At the moment, there is no money to waste on Government schemes to shore up the political careers of two Ministers-or rather, one ex-Minister and one soon-to-be ex-Minister. This proposal should have no place. The Government have run out of time, and it will be a disgrace if they force it through. I pray that when the election eventually comes, the people of Devon will recognise it for what it is.</p>

In case anyone missed his contribution, I must tell them that his dividing lines are probably visible with the naked eye from space. The great majority of my constituents in Norwich, North oppose the proposal. I have barely heard a single positive case being made for it in the street by a citizen of either Norwich city or the Broadland areas that I represent. That is probably on the ground of cost, as well as on the serious grounds of the capability of Norwich city council-of which more in a second-and the lack of democratic consultation on the changes. I agree with the comments made by many hon. Members on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="100309-0021.htm_para1"><a name="1003103000036">I will limit myself to two points. I shall make a swift point about the double-think surrounding the lack of regard for local people's views during the Government's shambles of a journey to get to this stage. Secondly, I shall examine in slightly more depth the capability of the existing city council to act as a preparing authority and a future guardian for education, social services, and the many other services that others have highlighted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="100309-0021.htm_para2"><a name="1003103000037">On consultation, the Government have ignored the Department for Communities and Local Government's accounting officer. They have also ignored the boundary committee. They have ignored the people, because only 3 per cent. of those who took part in the only consultation available want this proposal for a unitary authority for Norwich on the existing boundaries. They have also ignored hon. Members in this House and in the other place. The point is, however, that they believe that they have consulted and gained support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="100309-0021.htm_para3"><a name="1003103000038">I shall give the House one example of that before I move on to my second point. From the Secretary of State's answer to my question at oral questions this afternoon, I learned that the Government have "an indication of support in key places". What is that based on? According to the Secretary of State, it is based on the support of three out of four political parties on Norwich city council, the ambitious authority itself. That is not a broad cross-section of support. As Norwich city council would like to suggest, the proposal has "a strong broad cross-section of support", but that is not the same thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="100309-0021.htm_para4"><a name="1003103000039">The truth is that this Government have failed to hold any kind of individual consultation on the orders for Norwich. The one to which they have had access, conducted by the boundary committee, shows a tiny 3 per cent. in favour of the proposed decision, with 85 per cent. in favour of retaining the status quo-and my constituents agree with that. The huge majority of those constituents who have expressed a view to me have very little faith in the proposed changes delivering anything other than a political fix.</p>

 As we have heard, the history of changing the boundaries and structures of local authorities is long and intricate, but the restructuring in Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk began life back in 2007. As events and tonight's debate have shown, the Government's handling of these proposals has been utterly shambolic and disingenuous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="100309-0021.htm_para12"><a name="1003103000052">We have all heard how councils were asked to make proposals for the formation of unitary government, subject to five criteria that Ministers themselves set. By 2007, the Secretary of State had expressed the view that the unitary proposals for Norwich, Exeter and Ipswich were unlikely to meet all those criteria, but that alternative unitary proposals might. At that point, proposals were referred to the boundary committee. Following legal challenges and delays, as we heard, the boundary committee finally ruled at the end of last year that the city unitary proposals should not be implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="100309-0021.htm_para13"><a name="1003103000053">That was not good enough, and Ministers nevertheless chose to press ahead with their city unitary proposals, totally ignoring the boundary committee and what it had said about Norwich and Exeter. Ministers even admit that the city unitary proposals failed to meet the established criteria that they themselves had set for granting unitary status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="100309-0021.htm_para14"><a name="1003103000054">Ministers have argued that additional economic benefits and public service improvements through Total Place would result from the unitary status that they wanted Norwich and Exeter to have. I shall deal with the credibility of those claims shortly, but the simple fact is that Ministers changed the rules governing their own criteria halfway through their game. They may claim that those criteria were not legal requirements set in stone, but they were certainly widely perceived as the basis on which unitary decisions would be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="100309-0021.htm_para15"><a name="1003103000055">As we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill), the Department's permanent secretary said in his letter to the Secretary of State:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="100309-0021.htm_para16"><a name="1003103000056">The Government ignored that. They are now also subject to legal challenges to the proposals from the county councils involved, and the permanent secretary believes that there is a "very high" chance that judicial review proceedings would be successful. As we have heard, the Government's handling of the process has been appalling. An additional question is whether there was any valid case for unitary proposals for Exeter and Norwich, and there is overwhelming evidence that that was never the case.</p>

Norfolk county councils criticised the claims about value-for-money savings, also citing a lack of evidence. The money spent on this process could have been channelled into front-line services for the communities affected. It seems that everyone apart from Ministers is unconvinced of the existence of any value-for-money benefits from the unitary proposals for Norwich and Exeter.</p>

Both the permanent secretary and the House of Lords Merits Committee felt that there was a distinct lack of evidence for that claim. As we heard from Members representing seats in Norfolk and Norwich, communities there are fundamentally worried about what will happen to their local services if the plan goes ahead. We heard an excellent speech from my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Chloe Smith).

They have ignored the boundary committee, they have ignored the House of Lords Merits Committee, they have ignored their own criteria, they have ignored their own permanent secretary, they have ignored Members of this House, and, most of all, they have ignored members of the public. That is a totally unacceptable way of going about the business of government. The Minister talked about the duty and rights of government, but this Prime Minister has no mandate.

and Exeter. People in those proud and ancient cities want, and have wanted for almost half a century, the right to control their own affairs. These proposals are localism carried to its logical conclusion, and I am sorry that Opposition Members cannot see that. Many seem to feel that there is an element of force in the proposals. The hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson) referred to their being rammed through, thus completely ignoring the fact that the boundary committee only reported to the Secretary of State on 23 December, two years after the process had started in 2007. He also ignored the fact that the delay has not been caused by the Government but by expensive and lengthy litigation on the ground, which has led to the timing of the Secretary of State's decision.</p>

We heard from the Opposition that the Labour leader of Devon county council is opposed to unitary change.

 I am delighted to have this opportunity to address the House on the subject of business rates as they relate to petrol filling stations. The issue is threatening communities up and down the country, particularly in rural areas. It may be hard at first sight to understand why, and I hope during the debate to make it crystal clear what a damaging proposal the Government are putting forward and the impact that it will have. It will not be apparent immediately, but it is a classic poison pill from this Government for the next Government to inherit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="100309-0022.htm_para16"><a name="1003103001027">I welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett), who has made herself and her officials available to me and members of the trade associations concerned about the matter in recent weeks. I have to confess that I am a little disappointed that the Economic Secretary to the Treasury is not here to respond, because it is he who has responded to the many letters from MPs on the subject and who has direct responsibility for the Valuation Office Agency, which is the Government agency that is handling the implementation of the business rates revaluation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="100309-0022.htm_para17"><a name="1003103001028">The revaluation takes place every five years and is proving particularly controversial across many sectors this year, not least because the evidence base on which it is being introduced reflects the market conditions prevailing in April 2008-a peak within the commercial property cycle. The revaluation is happening to businesses that are reeling from the twin effects of the recession and the coldest winter in 31 years, which have a direct bearing on petrol filling stations. The Government's arguments about providing real help to business would be more convincing if they were willing to take a pragmatic decision and postpone the revaluation exercise in its entirety because of those problems.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on leading on this subject, which is of exceptional importance to my constituents, particularly David Griffiths, who has seen his business rates go from just over £4,500 to £26,000. My hon. Friend will know that having a car in a rural area is not a luxury; it is a necessity. If our constituents cannot get any petrol, how on earth will they be able to go about their daily lives? I hope that he will get some sensible answers from the Minister, because this is going to be a disaster for rural communities.</p>

 I am one of my hon. Friend's constituents, and I am glad that he mentions that petrol station, because it was the one that first brought that matter to my attention. It is my local petrol station and the only one within a 10-mile radius on the Shropshire, Herefordshire and Powys borders. If it were to close, it would have a very damaging effect on the rural residents who rely on their motor vehicles to get about, because there is very little public transport along the borders in that remote part of the countryside.</p>

find out whether it was an isolated case or a widespread consequence of the revaluation. Eight of the 15 filling stations responded, and half of those-four-indicated that they were looking at increases of between 58 and 250 per cent. in their rateable values. All four said that if that went through, they would have to cut jobs. Two said that they would have to cease selling fuel, and two said that it would put them out of business. The fact that 25 per cent. of the petrol stations in my constituency were likely to cease selling fuel was so significant that I decided to take an interest in the issue, hence my meetings with the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para1"><a name="1003103001032">The problem is not isolated in rural Shropshire; it is having an impact right across the country. It follows closures of filling stations throughout the past 13 years under this Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_o475"><a name="1003103001033"><a name="100309-0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="1003103002010"><b>Mr. Stephen Crabb (Preseli Pembrokeshire) (Con):</b>
 My hon. Friend is making a powerful case on behalf of rural filling stations. Is he aware that in my constituency in Wales, I have come across filling stations that are looking at business rates increases of more than 300 per cent., and that no transitional rate relief is available to them? As a consequence, numerous filling stations are considering closure in the next few months.</p>

<p><a name="st_o476"><a name="1003103001034"><a name="100309-0023.htm_spnew1"><a name="1003103002011"><b>Mr. Dunne:</b>
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and I was going to come on to the lack of transitional relief in Wales. More than 111 petrol filling stations in Wales have closed in the past five years. The Welsh Assembly intends to follow the flawed revaluation methodology that I shall come on to in a moment, and it has not agreed any transitional relief, unlike the situation in England. That will pose a particular risk to the remaining 572 petrol stations in Wales, of which 206 are in rural areas and are especially at risk. One of those stations faces an increase in its rateable value not of 300 per cent., as in my hon. Friend's example, but of 725 per cent., which is the largest increase for any petrol station in the United Kingdom. It would be hard to conceive of a Government introducing such a measure while claiming to be providing help to business. Clearly, businesses will have to close if they face that kind of increase.</p>

<p><a name="st_o477"><a name="1003103001035"><a name="100309-0023.htm_spnew2"><a name="1003103002012"><b>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold) (Con):</b>
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on raising this very important subject. As I am sure he is aware, petrol stations are unique in that their business rates are calculated not only on the basis of rental value, but on top of that, on assessments of their turnover. That is one reason why they are facing such huge increases. Petrol stations are the only property class that I know of that is assessed in that way. Does my hon. Friend agree that that is grossly unfair? It is grossly unfair on small petrol stations, particularly in rural areas, which are closing as a result. That will mean that there is even less competition, which will mean that prices for our rural constituents will rise.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. He has pre-empted remarks that I was going to make about the palpable lack of equity across the retail estate. It makes no sense at all that a convenience store operating on a forecourt faces a rateable value calculation based on turnover when the convenience store around the corner in the local town or village faces a rateable value calculated only on the size of the premises. The difference  <br>

is acute-it can mean paying 10 times the amount in rates. I have seen evidence of that, and it is not unusual. Ministers have received letters from hon. Members on both sides of the House to draw that problem to their attention and to ask them for justification, of which, I regret to say, there is none.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para2"><a name="1003103001037">I return to my explanation of the decline in filling stations in the UK since 1997. There were some 5,230 fewer filling stations in the UK at the end of 2009 than at the end of 1997. There are 37 per cent. fewer places to fill up with petrol in England, 39 per cent. fewer in Wales and 22 per cent. fewer in Scotland, or some 250 stations. The pace of those closures has accelerated. In the past five years alone in the west midlands, 30 per cent. of rural petrol stations have closed, which is twice the rate of closure in urban areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para3"><a name="1003103001038">Having presided over a dramatic decline in petrol stations throughout the country, the Government have decided to single out the sector for special treatment at the hands of the VOA. For reasons that it has not tried to justify at any point, the VOA has decided to change the methodology for business rates calculations for each of the three different activities that take place on a petrol station forecourt. The VOA is applying that methodology in England and Wales, and assessors in Scotland intend to introduce a new methodology for calculating business rates, but what that will be is entirely opaque at the moment. I shall therefore focus mostly on what is happening in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para4"><a name="1003103001039">Before I go into the details of the problems with the methodology, I should say that we are currently facing a spike in petrol prices, which are at record levels. Last weekend, I filled up my vehicle with unleaded petrol and paid 120p a litre. As hon. Members will recall, the last time we paid that much, the hauliers, feeling that their businesses were not viable at that price, threatened to block fuel refineries. Of the 120p a litre we pay today, a 5p increase in February resulted directly from the currency devaluation that we have experienced in the past couple of months, but a further 7p is a consequence of Government increases in duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para5"><a name="1003103001040">We had the 2p increase last autumn from the escalator. We had the increase in VAT from 15 per cent. to 17.5 per cent. which added almost 3p a litre to the cost of petrol. Another 1p is going on as a result of the biofuel duty rebate being phased out, and another 1p will go on next month, again as a result of the fuel duty escalator. When those increases are added to the currency changes, it is a 12p increase that is extraneous to the value of oil in the marketplace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para6"><a name="1003103001041">In responses to Members of Parliament, the Government have tried to justify the change in methodology on the basis that-and I quote the Minister:</p>
<a name="100309-0023.htm_brev0"><a name="1003103001059"><ul><p class="tabletext">"In the last 5 years, alongside rising petrol prices and increasing turnover, the rent paid on many petrol filling stations has grown. It is only fair to all rate payers if this is reflected in rate bills."-[<i> Official Report</i>, 20 January 2010; Vol. 504, c. 384W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para7"><a name="1003103001042">That argument is being used by the VOA to justify an increase in rates. But there is little evidence for that increase in rental value because of the structure of the market, although Ministers and the VOA seem to have difficulty in comprehending that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para8"><a name="1003103001043">There are now fewer than 9,000 petrol stations in the UK. Roughly 2,000 of those are owned and operated by the major oil companies. Some 1,000 are owned and  <br>

operated by supermarkets. That leaves about 6,000 that are operated by independents. The rental evidence on which the VOA is relying amounts to some 70 cases that it feels are representative of independent fuel stations. That is less than 1 per cent. of the total of petrol stations and is not a representative sample. The trade associations have not even had an opportunity to assess whether it is a representative sample, even on an anonymised basis to respect commercial confidentiality. One reason why the trade associations argue that it is not representative is that most of the independent filling stations are owner-occupied, so rental premises infrequently come up for renewal or review. When such premises do come up for renewal, a goodwill value is included within the rental value, which is standard practice in the industry but is completely ignored by the VOA. That is why basing all the arguments on rental evidence is fundamentally flawed and I urge the Minister to press the VOA to justify that approach, which does not stand up to independent scrutiny. When the results of the revaluation are challenged in rating appeals, which seems inevitable in view of the scale of the increases, it will be on thin ice when trying to justify the changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para9"><a name="1003103001044">The valuation methodology is flawed. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) has said, turnover is being used as the primary criterion for calculating rateable value. That approach was introduced in the 2005 valuation, and it has subsequently been further distorted by the 2010 revaluation methodology, which assumes an increased margin on fuel sales. That fails to take into account changing market dynamics, whereby the growth of low-cost supermarket fuel outlets has depressed the profit margins of independent retailers, which has forced them to diversify to stay in business. They have tended to convert their original kiosks into convenience stores. More and more of the space on the forecourt has been made over to convenience stores, because the margins available to the independent sector from selling fuel are substantially lower than they are for the supermarkets or major oil companies. That point is ignored by the VOA when it makes its calculations. It also ignores the fact that the margins on unleaded and diesel differ substantially. I have received evidence suggesting that the margins on unleaded petrol for a typical independent business are roughly double that on diesel, and yet the average for the entire industry is taken by the VOA as appropriate, when clearly it is not. That is another matter that will come out in the rating appeals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para10"><a name="1003106000002">The average rateable margin from fuel throughput estimated by the VOA is therefore much too high for independent operators, who not only suffer from a lack of purchasing power without any economies of scale, but incur much higher credit costs from suppliers, and higher costs of fuel cards from customers, both of which are not suffered by oil majors or supermarket competitors. It also fails to take into account the higher marketing and distribution costs that independent operators have to pay the oil companies to receive their fuel. That particularly applies in the more peripheral parts of the country, because it obviously costs more to take the fuel longer distances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para11"><a name="1003106000003">As a result, businesses have tended to diversify, as I have said, into two areas-car washes and convenience stores. The VOA decided in 2010 to change the basis  <br>

<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>9 Mar 2010 : Column 276</b><br>
for calculating rates on car washes. In 2005 that became a percentage of turnover, and was based on a banding system averaging 16 per cent. of turnover across the industry. The VOA has decided that that should be increased to 20 per cent., without a banding system. It has increased arbitrarily, and without justification, the percentage of turnover to which rates should apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para12"><a name="1003106000004">Car wash businesses are regulated, so have the added cost of compliance with environmental legislation, but their competitors down the road, operating hand car washes-often in supermarket car parks and other places-are not regulated or subject to rates, which means that they can undercut the car wash businesses on the forecourts. Consequently, car wash revenues have declined in recent years as the hand car washes have proliferated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para13"><a name="1003106000005">The second area of diversification has been convenience stores, on which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold made clear, turnover is the basis of calculation. There is no reflection of the size of the premises in the 2010 revaluation. Instead, the calculation is based on increasing bands of turnover, capped at £2 million. Of course, that is of considerable benefit to supermarkets with petrol stations adjacent to their car parks, because invariably their turnover is much higher than £2 million, which means that they are not subject to the same rates. They have a protection not available to small independent businesses. The valuation based on turnover gives rise to rateable values much higher than those applying to other convenience stores trading around the corner, which are subject to valuation based on area. The VOA has made no attempts to justify those changes in its methodologies, and is relying entirely on evidence that, as I have said already, is not representative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para14"><a name="1003106000006">I now turn to the impact of the changes. In answer to a parliamentary question from my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford), the Government admitted that more than 3,000 petrol filling stations in England-a third of the total-are facing an increase in their rateable values of more than 50 per cent. Half of them, 1,510, to be precise, are facing increases of more than 100 per cent.-double the rateable value-this year. I have come across one business facing an increase of 450 per cent., and I have referred to another in Wales that is facing an increase of 725 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para15"><a name="1003106000007">The significance in my constituency, as I have said, is that several operators in rural areas are likely to cease selling fuel. Some of them, including my own local garage, which was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin), regard the sale of fuel as a social service for the community. Mine is hardly making money out of it, but providing the service to attract people to the shop. It is a long-standing activity that the proprietor recognises is vital to the local area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para16"><a name="1003106000008">The Valuation Office Agency is beginning to realise that a problem is brewing, and not just in the level of appeals. It is also aware that the situation will lead to significant closures. In fact, the official from the VOA in the west midlands has told one proprietor in my area that if the revaluation goes through, the economically logical conclusion would be to stop selling fuel. Not only would that lead to a significant reduction in the Government's income from rates based on fuel sales, but the rates on the residual shop businesses would revert to a normal area basis, and therefore be significantly lower, which would be self-defeating for the VOA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para17"><a name="1003106000009">Another petrol station-this is my final point-has already had an approach from the VOA to halve its proposed increase. Will the Minister say whether that is an isolated case? Does the VOA know that it has made a mistake, and is it therefore seeking to negotiate deals? If so, how many deals is it negotiating? Does the Minister accept that that is a methodology that has to change?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para18"><a name="1003106000010">Having said that that was my final point, I have one more point to make, picking up on the point about transitional relief-if you will indulge me, Mr. Speaker. The Minister and the VOA are hiding behind transitional relief. They have put a cap of 11 per cent. on the increase in the cash cost of rates to businesses, but we have examples of petrol stations facing much larger increases in the first year, and it is no coincidence that transitional relief applies in this, an election year. The escalation of rateable value increases kicks in faster in subsequent years, with increases of 25 per cent. a year in the final two years of the five-year transitional scheme-a legacy that is a classic Gordon Brown poison pill for an incoming Government. The large tax rises will occur in two to four years, so closures are most likely to fall on the next Government's watch.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) on securing this evening's debate, and thank him for raising some important points about how petrol filling stations are rated and the methodology behind that rating, particularly as part of the rating revaluation for 2010. I also thank the hon. Members for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) and for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) for raising other points, which I have noted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para19"><a name="1003106000012">As the hon. Member for Ludlow knows, the detail of how petrol filling stations are rated is extremely complex, so if he will permit me, I should like to run through how the business rates system, and revaluations, operate. The business rates system, which has been in its current form since 1990, is designed to ensure that the burden of this tax is equitably distributed across all non-domestic ratepayers. It is estimated that business rates will raise £21 billion in 2009-10. All that revenue goes back to fund local government services such as education, planning and transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para20"><a name="1003106000013">Business rates are a tax on property that is capable of beneficial occupation, and they are mainly based on the hypothetical rent that a property could attract at a specific point in time. In this year's revaluation, that point in time is a problem. The better the location, or the better the amenities that a property provides, the greater the rent that it could attract. That is reflected in the increased rates that a business is liable to pay. As the hon. Gentleman knows well, the calculation of business rates liability is based on the rateable value multiplied by a figure linked to annual inflation based on the retail prices index, which is negative for 2010-11; that reduces rates liabilities somewhat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para21"><a name="1003106000014">The hon. Gentleman asked why we did not defer the revaluation, but regular revaluations are an important part of the rating system, as they help to maintain fairness by rebalancing the burden within the overall envelope. If we were to defer the revaluation, as he has  <br>

suggested, that would hit some businesses that are doing much less well. It is a redistribution, and I do understand that it will involve winners and losers. The hon. Gentleman has spoken eloquently tonight about some of the losers. The next revaluation will take effect from 1 April 2010, and it will be based on rental values at 1 April 2008. The property market has changed a great deal since April 2008, but the multiplier has been brought down to its lowest level in 17 years to try to iron that out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para22"><a name="1003106000015">Rates liability and rateable value are not the same thing, as the hon. Gentleman knows. Rateable values can rise, but rates liability is capped by the transitional relief scheme, which, despite what he says, is not a Gordon Brown scheme. It is built in. The scheme-which, sadly, is not available in Wales-has been built in to try to cap the rises, which can be steep in the areas where there are losers; they are not particularly steep in the areas where there are winners. Smaller businesses will see their rates capped at 3.5 per cent., and larger businesses at 11 per cent. That relief will help about 500,000 business properties with their rates liabilities in 2010-11.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will not. I have only three minutes left, and I am worried that I will not fit everything in. I apologise, especially as I am already a disappointment for not being a Treasury Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para23"><a name="1003106000018">On petrol filling stations, I understand exactly the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Ludlow about the Valuation Office Agency's methodology, and I will explore that matter in more detail with the Treasury, and perhaps with the hon. Gentleman himself. It is important to note that the Valuation Office Agency does not set the method, but follows industry practices. It has engaged with bodies such as the United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association to gain a better understanding of the petrol filling station market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para24"><a name="1003106000019">The Valuation Office Agency examined 1,300 rents for petrol filling stations. Although some of those rents were from oil companies and sites run by hypermarkets, many related to independent and rural sites. The agency has analysed the information on rents by reference to the throughput found at petrol stations. I should like to tell the hon. Member for Cotswold that throughput is used because we believe that it is a better guide to value than size, and this is the practice of the petrol filling station market. This approach is not new, and it reflects actual practice in the market when private sector surveyors negotiate rents for petrol filling stations. Some petrol filling stations will face increases in rateable values, thanks to rises in rents. However, the revaluation will also ensure that 960 petrol filling stations will receive reductions in their rates liabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="100309-0023.htm_para25"><a name="1003106000020">It is right that the Valuation Office Agency should assess rateable values independently, because that maintains fairness and transparency in the rating system. That is why Ministers do not intervene. There is an appeals system which provides the appropriate avenue for any sector-</p>
