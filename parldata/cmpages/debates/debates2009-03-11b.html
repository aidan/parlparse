 The manufacturing industry in the UK has taken a very hard hit in the recession, and that is perhaps even more true of Wales. Is the Secretary of State aware of the concerns of many in the manufacturing work force in Wales who work for foreign companies that there may be plans to offshore employment? Examples of such companies include Toyota in north Wales and Corus in south Wales; Corus has a plant in the Netherlands. What discussion has he had with other Ministers, and with the Welsh Assembly, to ensure that that does not happen?</p>

I have also discussed the issue of Corus with the chief executive of Corus. The point that the hon.

In my constituency, for example, thousands of people work for car component manufacturers that are American-owned, and so far, so good. Obviously, they are feeling the pinch, like all manufacturing companies, and particularly those in the automotive industry, but I very much take her point on board.</p>

 Yes. My hon. Friend is of course a distinguished member of the Treasury Committee, and he makes a valid point. The issue of information is very important. The &#147;Real help now&#148; information is available on all Government websites, and on the websites of the devolved Administrations, including the Welsh Assembly Government, but more work is necessary, particularly locally. Most local authorities in Wales are now organising economic summits in their areas. There was one in my area on Friday, for example, and I know that there is to be a summit in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. Information is best disseminated at the most local level, but I very much take the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger) makes.</p>

What plans does the Secretary of State have to make sure that the manufacturing skills gap does not widen in Montgomeryshire, and is there potential to divert money specifically into the manufacturing base in mid-Wales, so that we can replace the jobs that we are losing with green jobs in the green economy, which provides both manufacturing opportunities and sustainable economic activity for the longer term?</p>

 Yes, and that is certainly a priority of the United Kingdom Government, and of the Welsh Assembly Government, too. It is important that the hon. Gentleman and other Members who represent Welsh constituencies are aware of the various schemes available to businesses in Wales, particularly the ProAct scheme. It is unique to Wales and is very effective. Some 75 applications have now been processed, and 66 of them are from the automotive industry. Ten have been accepted. That represents nearly 6,000 workers, so it is a very real scheme, and it means that real money goes to help businesses such as the one that the hon. Gentleman described. I take the point that he makes about the green industry; that is a priority for both Governments.</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend take no lessons from Conservative Members on the impact of the global credit crunch on manufacturing in Wales?

It is most important to understand that we cannot simply sit back and do nothing. The Labour Government here, and a Labour-led coalition in Cardiff, are actually being positive about the help that we can give businesses in Wales. That is something that we did not see before, and I fear that we are not seeing that from the Conservative Opposition now.</p>

It is important for small businesses that lending starts again. It is also important to understand that banks still have to make commercial decisions. One of the reasons for the mess that we are in at the moment is that banks made the wrong decisions about risk or there was a lack of acknowledgement of risk. There are businesses in Wales that are viable and good and that deserve help.

I saw for myself last week that young people are being prepared well for the workplace and given good IT skills.

 That is the point, of course. We cannot forget about training and education for the future, for when we come out of the downturn. The initiative at Oakdale is a very good one. I will certainly commend it to the First Minister when I next meet him. It is important that we have a properly trained work force, and our colleges and schools in Wales play a hugely important role in that respect.</p>

 There is time for rhetoric and there is time for people to pull together to help those who are out of work in Wales. I have not the slightest doubt that the economic summits that we have held&#151;there is one to be held in a few weeks in Swansea&#151;have done a remarkably good job in bringing together from business, industry, the trade union movement and elsewhere all the expertise that we can gather in Wales. It is true to say that it will take time for some of those schemes to start working, but some have already started working. The figures that I have just given the House with regard to ProAct are a good example of that. At least we are trying. I fear that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party has no ideas at all about how to get us out of the recession. It is much better for small businesses, industry and commerce in Wales to know that both Governments are trying to help them, as opposed to his party, which has said absolutely nothing.</p>

 I do not recognise the problems of small businesses in Wales to which the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) referred. The Secretary of State has rightly referred to the &#163;48 million ProAct scheme; there is also the &#163;35 million ReAct scheme to retrain and assist people facing redundancy. Furthermore, there is the &#163;20 million apprenticeship scheme for reskilling young people and the extra business rates relief, which now assists approximately 55,000 small businesses in Wales.

 I am happy to say well done to the Deputy First Minister and the First Minister in Wales for the work that the Assembly Government have done. The reality is that individual people and businesses have been helped by those schemes. For example, there is Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs Time to Pay scheme, under which taxation is deferred. Some 2,600 firms in Wales benefit from that; &#163;38 million has been deferred so that they can. There are other schemes as well.

 I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the Government remain firmly committed to producing Welsh language certificates, and the General Register Office is exploring the best way to do that. I am happy to take forward discussions with the Home Office to find the best solution, but it is not a simple matter. It is not a question of introducing a Bill; we have to explore the best possible way. I reiterate that we are firmly committed to pursuing that path.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes a good point. The digital inclusion agenda must include the measures he talks about. He referred to e-Crime Wales, and it is holding a series of business breakfasts around Wales in February and March this year, to keep businesses up to date with the latest threats, and to tell them what steps they can take to minimise the risks of the damaging effects of e-crime. Moreover, e-Crime Wales has produced a number of extremely useful fact sheets on its website for business and individuals. All of that clearly shows that we are firmly committed to developing this agenda for the safety of everyone.</p>

 The fact of the matter is, of course, that there is no reduction in front-line policing. Of course there are efficiency measures taking shape, and bureaucracy is being reduced, but we are seeing better front-line policing throughout the length and breadth of Wales.

The Real IRA and Continuity IRA have claimed credit for the killings in a way that is sickening, and they seem not to be able to distinguish between the needs of the armed services and civilians. Calling civilians &#147;collaborators&#148; was totally despicable. We will do everything in our power to track down these killers, but we will also do everything in our power to support the police and the armed forces.</p>

I believe that the country wishes the homecoming parades that are going on in Watford, Windsor and Bolton to go ahead without interruption.

It is right for the Attorney-General to see whether a crime has been committed, but is it not also important that the Prime Minister is satisfied that Britain has throughout acted with moral authority&#151;over and above the question of whether a crime has been committed?

 Let me say right at the outset that this Government unreservedly condemn the use of torture. Under no circumstances will we participate in, encourage or condone the use of torture for any purpose. Where allegations are made about torture, I have instructed that they must be properly examined&#151;including, if necessary, by the courts. The Attorney-General is looking at the very specific allegations in this case. If there is evidence, it will be referred to the police, who will conduct a criminal inquiry.

Surely we need to look at what procedures and processes are in place to ensure that Britain cannot knowingly, or unknowingly, be implicated in torture.

The Committee will continue to look at these matters because that is the statutory role given to it. At the same time, the Attorney-General will look at all the details, and I have made it clear that there is a next stage. If any evidence is found that should lead to a police investigation, it will be referred to the police, and if they decide to proceed a criminal investigation will be carried out.

The Attorney-General is, quite rightly, looking at whether a crime has been committed, but is not really looking at our moral authority and whether it has been maintained.

All leaders attended: all leaders said they were determined to root out violence; all leaders said that it was important to help the police in their task; and there was a unity of purpose, which is now reflected, I believe, in the peaceful and dignified marches in Northern Ireland today, to show that the whole of the public want to see an end to violence. My hon. Friend is absolutely right that those who gave their lives are true patriots, and we will never forget them; they are in our memories for ever.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. As you are aware, the preventing violent extremism pathfinder fund distributes more than &#163;70 million of public money to local authorities. Last year, after a delay of some six months, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government was persuaded to place in the Library details of how that fund was being spent for that year. Earlier this year, I wrote to the Secretary of State to ask her to place in the Library the corresponding details for this year. I received no reply. After a written question, I received a reply studiously ignoring the request I had made. This morning, I phoned the Secretary of State&#146;s private office and was told that the Department may&#151;I stress &#147;may&#148;&#151;no longer holds these financial details for this year at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para0"><a name="09031165000155">My point of order is as follows. Either the Department no longer holds the details of where a substantial tranche of &#163;70 million-worth of public money is going, which is a scandal, or it is refusing to place in the Library details of where that money is going, which, frankly, is no less scandalous in relation to information that Members of this House and members of the public have the right to see. What can you do, Mr. Speaker, to assist Members of this House in obtaining access to information that they have a right to know?</p>

 It is up to Ministers as to how they answer parliamentary questions. I will look into the matter the hon. Gentleman raises, and I will get back to him. I thank him for raising it.</p>

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I want to point out my concern, which I hope is shared by the House, that it seems easier to get information from the Government through freedom of information requests, which would work for my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), than through written questions. That is a very worrying development.</p>

 It would certainly worry me. When parliamentarians seek information through parliamentary questions that is all-important and they should be a priority for any Minister.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09031165000161">The Bill has cross-party support and I am grateful to my co-sponsors for their support. Organisations representing retailers, including the British Retail Consortium, the Association of Convenience Stores and the Federation of Small Businesses, are supportive of the work that I am doing and welcome the Bill. I am delighted that the Magistrates Association also supports the Bill and that the Justice Secretary has taken the opportunity to meet many of the organisations concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09031165000162">Crimes against business cost the UK economy &#163;19 billion every year according to the British Chambers of Commerce. The cost to small business of shoplifting alone in the past 12 months ran to &#163;1 billion according to the Federation of Small Businesses. In 2007-08, more than 290,000 incidents of shop theft were recorded, and, of course, there might have been many more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09031165000163">By introducing the Bill, I am seeking to amend police guidelines to ensure that penalty notices for disorder or fines are limited to first-time offences and to ensure that the guidelines state that penalty notices for disorder should be issued only in a police station and that victims of shop theft should be consulted on the appropriate action to be taken by the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09031165000164">Secondly, I am seeking to improve the police database to ensure that all recent shop theft offences are entered on the national computer system for ease of reference across the police forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09031165000165">Thirdly, I am seeking to amend sentencing guidelines to give greater flexibility in tackling persistent offenders and to check that offenders are able to pay, as well as to ensure that when offences fuel a drug or drinks habit, the offender appears before the court so that they can receive proper treatment and rehabilitation. The Magistrates Association has noted</p>
<a name="90311-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="09031165002394"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;from dealing with such offences over many years that most offenders are driven to theft because of poor budgeting and lack of support or abuse of alcohol and/or drugs. The use of a fixed penalty only serves to cause even greater financial hardship and in no way tackles the underlying cause of the offending behaviour. If the matter is put before a court then magistrates have the discretion to impose a penalty that would address the causes of the offending and help in reducing such crimes, which have a significant impact on society.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09031165000166">Furthermore, the association states:</p>
<a name="90311-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="09031165002395"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are concerned about the inappropriate use of Fixed Penalty Notices and even more so when we hear that over 50 per cent. are not paid and then registered for court action. As we said earlier, FPNs do not really address the underlying causes of offending and so do not make any contribution to reducing offending behaviour.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09031165000167">Shop theft is not recognised as a serious offence. Retailers are often not consulted before fines are issued and the police do not always liaise with the victims of  <br>

the crime. The police are switching from cautions and prosecutions to the increasing use of penalty notices for disorder and fines. The police find penalty notices for disorder attractive as they reduce paperwork and free up police time, but from the retailers&#146; point of view, as the victims of the crime, PNDs do not match the value of goods stolen. The average value of goods stolen is &#163;149, but the initial fine that is incurred is &#163;80, with a penalty of only a further &#163;40 if that is not paid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09031165000168">More worryingly, 50 per cent. of all fixed penalty notice fines go unpaid. The Magistrates Association believes that such notices simply do not address the underlying causes of offending, and that they make no contribution to reducing offending behaviour&#151;surely the object of any legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09031165000169">In my view, the Government are not being tough on crime or on the causes of crime. I believe that the punishment should fit the crime, and that is why I want to restrict penalty notices for disorder to first-time offences of shop theft, where the goods stolen are limited in value. Again, a PND would be issued only after consultation with the victim of the crime&#151;that is, the shopkeeper or shop owner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09031165000170">When a community sentence is issued after persistent or aggravated offences of shop theft have allowed a case to go before the court, that sentence must be seen to be served in full. When shop theft is deemed to fuel a drug or drink habit, the court should be allowed to analyse and treat the underlying causes, and a programme of rehabilitation should be issued, where appropriate. That means that a package of measures should be put in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09031165000171">Penalty notices for disorder were introduced by the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. Shoplifting was introduced as an offence that attracted a PND in 2004. The notices are regarded as an alternative way to deal with low-level offending because they deliver swift, simple and effective justice and also carry a deterrent effect. A crime report is always required for the offence of retail theft.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09031165000172">A notice may be issued provided that a police officer has reason to believe that a person has committed an offence, and that the officer has sufficient evidence to support a successful prosecution. Sufficient evidence may be based solely on reliable witness testimony. The amount levied by such a notice is specified by the Secretary of State and must not exceed a quarter of the maximum fine on conviction for the offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09031165000173">Notices can be issued for the higher sums of &#163;200 or &#163;500 only in exceptional circumstances, and notices for theft would usually be issued only when goods have  <br>

been recovered. As I said earlier, the penalty notices carry a fine of only &#163;80. If the notice is paid within 21 days, it does not result in a criminal record. Originally, the notices were intended for low-level, usually first-time, offending and were not considered appropriate for those who offend repeatedly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09031165000174">The British Retail Consortium believes that, in addition to losing &#163;1 billion to retail crime every year, firms must invest &#163;1.4 billion in crime prevention measures, such as installing CCTV cameras and shutters. They also incur higher insurance premiums. Given that there could be job losses to cover those additional costs, the wider community definitely suffers from this crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09031165000175">Since 1998-99, the number of recorded offences of shoplifting has averaged an astonishing 295,000 each year. That is equivalent to nearly 6,000 offences a week. Since 2004, the use of penalty notices has become increasingly widespread. In 2004, 1.8 per cent. of shoplifting cases attracted a penalty notice, but that proportion had risen to 27 per cent. by 2006. In fact, from 2002 to 2007, there was a 27 per cent. decrease in the number of people prosecuted for theft from shops. The use of penalty notices is replacing court sentences as a means of combating retail theft, but I believe that the current system is simply not working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09031165000176">The use of the notices means that shoplifters are treated in the same way as people who leave litter in a public place, or who are prosecuted for a parking offence. The penalty for stealing up to &#163;100 of goods is too modest, and I believe that it should be more severe. Forty five per cent. of businesses state that crime costs them more than &#163;5,000 each year, and that is a heavy price for small firms to pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para18"><a name="09031165000177">It gives me great pleasure to present this Bill to the House. I hope that the Government will look wisely and supportively on my three modest calls for action&#151;that the police computer be amended so that all multiple and persistent offences are entered into it, that the guidelines for the police be amended so that only first-time offences attract a penalty notice fine, and that the sentencing guidelines be modestly amended to allow such cases to be referred to the court, especially when there are underlying causes.</p>

 My hon. Friends and I are concerned about the programme motion because, although the Bill is insubstantial in volume, it could have an enormous impact on businesses in the United Kingdom. It could impose a burden of up to &#163;600 million a year on businesses, even though business rates have already increased by 5 per cent. this year and there is a prospect of a further revaluation using a multiplier that is now out of date in the light of the changed economic circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para25"><a name="09031165000185">Although the Bill has been through a careful and constructive Committee stage, it raises a number of technical issues, and I notice that two significant new clauses have been tabled for discussion today&#151;one by the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson) and the other by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford). They both raise issues that deserve serious consideration. In fairness, during the course of the Bill&#146;s consideration in Committee, the Minister said that he would look at some of those issues, in particular the question of the property owner levy in business improvement districts, which is the subject of the new clause tabled by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, and the issue of business&#146;s involvement in the delivery and oversight of the business rate supplements project, which I and other hon. Members raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para26"><a name="09031165000186">We have not yet received an inkling of the Government&#146;s thinking on those matters, although I am sure that it will emerge in the debate today. However, given that the House is not overburdened with business at the moment, it might have been better to devise a programme motion that allowed for more reflection on those issues, so that we could consider whether, if my hon. Friends and I are unsuccessful in winning our principal point of opposition to the Bill, we could at least do more to ameliorate any unforeseen and perverse impacts on certain sectors of the business community. For that reason, we shall seek to oppose the programme motion.</p>

 I share the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill). There is also a general point to be made here. How much longer will the Government go on with this absurd process of guillotining and timetabling every Bill? Under previous Governments of both parties, most Bills went through this House without any guillotine whatever. They went through in the time that the House felt they needed.  <br>

<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 302</b><br>
Sometimes we needed less time than the Government might have thought, and sometimes we needed more. Governments of both parties accommodated the wish and will of the House on the ground that this is the democratic Chamber, and the place in which we ought to be able to talk sensibly about a Bill for as long as it takes to deal with any problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para27"><a name="09031165000188">This is a particularly nasty and spiteful little Bill. It will impose up to &#163;600 million of taxation on business at a time when business is running out of money and when the grotesque mismanagement of the money supply and the banking system in this country by the Government and their regulators has left business in a very weak position. Now we see them back for third helpings wanting up to &#163;600 million more out of businesses&#146; coffers at a time when they are having to worry about how they pay the gas bill or the staff wages, or keep in business at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para28"><a name="09031165000189">I do not know for how long the House would like to discuss the Bill, but I do not understand why the Government cannot let us discuss it for as long as we think it should take. They may get a pleasant surprise; some of its stages may take less time than they have laid down in their motion. However, surely the least that they could do in the circumstances would be to give us the freedom to express ourselves and to have the debate that we want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para29"><a name="09031165000190">This is a revenue-raising Bill. This great House of Commons built its democratic strength on being able to challenge how much money was raised and how it was spent. It is doing a dreadful job of that at the moment. Huge sums of money go through without our having the opportunity to discuss and challenge them in the normal way, as we saw with this week&#146;s &#163;20 billion supplementary estimate, which was not even down on the Order Paper for debate and went through on the nod. This &#163;600 million should not go through on the Government&#146;s timetable but according to the will of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="90311-0004.htm_para30"><a name="09031165000191">I urge the Minister, at this late stage, to do the decent thing by withdrawing the guillotine motion and letting us discuss this properly. If it takes longer than until 7 o&#146;clock tonight, what is the problem? We are paid to do our job. I am happy to stay here a bit later if there are lots of colleagues with sensible points to make, so why are the Government not willing? Why will they not do the decent thing?</p>

 I entirely agree with the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill). Those who have been following our debates on the Bill closely are likely to be those who will be affected by it, including the representative organisations that have taken the trouble to contact hon. Members and talk to us. However, many of the businesses that will be affected probably do not yet understand how big an impact this might have on them. As we heard from the right hon. Member for Wokingham, there are huge pressures on business at the moment, and the issues on which business people will rightly be concentrating are staying in business, managing to get the finance that they need from banks, and so on. Liberal Democrat Members are certainly willing to explore the issue,  <br>

Members feel that they need more time to tease out the issues and explore them in more detail, they should have that time. This legislation is potentially very serious in terms of the extra burden that it could place on businesses without their having the opportunity to comment on it in their local area. That is why I share the concerns that have been raised about the nature of motion before us.</p>

We had the opportunity to carry out a pretty full analysis of what the Bill was about. However, I endorse the words of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood). He did not serve on the Committee, but he recognises the Bill&#146;s huge importance to the financing of large-scale infrastructure projects; I suspect that it will even go beyond that. That will affect our constituents throughout the UK, not least because much of this money will be raised through a supplementary charge on local businesses during difficult times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="90311-0005.htm_para0"><a name="09031165000195">It is regrettable that these constraints have been imposed by business managers; I accept that the Minister may not necessarily be directly to blame. Given that other elements of our business have fallen away quite easily, and that may well apply to much of the work in the next week or two, given what is likely to be dealt with, it is surprising that this did not warrant a full day&#146;s debate instead of being truncated to four hours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="90311-0005.htm_para1"><a name="09031165000196">Given that the motion is likely to go to a vote, the danger is that the longer I and colleagues speak in this debate, the more we reduce the amount of time available for proper scrutiny, and there are important matters to be debated later on. This is regrettable. I hope that even if the Minister decides not to take on board our concerns at this juncture, he will at least consider them and ensure that when we discuss such crucial Bills in the future involving tax-raising we can deal with them properly.</p>

<p><a name="st_o101"><a name="09031165000197"><a name="90311-0005.htm_spnew1"><a name="09031165002572"><b>Mr. Redwood:</b>
 Is this not an unreasonable pressure to place on us? There is nothing wrong with debating whether the House should receive this summary treatment or be given a proper length of time for consideration, but why should that be taken out of the time spent on the Bill? It is absolutely outrageous. This is all part of the thuggery of this Government&#146;s approach towards the House of Commons. They will not let us have time to discuss anything: they say, &#147;If you discuss A, you can&#146;t discuss B.&#148; They need to get used to democracy.</p>

 I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend&#146;s every word. I only hope that there are not too many hostages to fortune for a future Conservative Government and that we will ensure we do not go down this path when these matters arise.</p>

 This programme motion surprises me. We hear many fine words from the Government about the importance of small and medium-sized businesses, but see little action. We have talked a lot about giving money to that sector through the banks, but it is not getting through, and we still do not get a reaction from the Government that suggests they really understand that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="90311-0005.htm_para3"><a name="09031165000201">However, that is not what we are discussing. We are talking about loading more financial burdens on to small and medium-sized businesses from April 2010. I bet you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that many local authorities will jump on this bandwagon, not least because they consider that they have been starved of cash over recent years and see this as an opportunity to do a little more than they have been able to hitherto. I suppose that that could be considered a good thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="90311-0005.htm_para4"><a name="09031165000202">The Minister will know how many business organisations have objected to this measure. He will know how much they fear the role of local government in extracting more money from them.</p>

 I will be delighted to answer that if I can get into the mindset of the Government, which is difficult. I would have thought that they would not want this motion because they wanted to make it clear to the business communities affected that they wanted it to be fully debated. The eyes of the business community are on us at this moment. That community is very aware of the Bill and deeply concerned about it. It has made representations in sizeable numbers and of sizeable length. I would have thought that the Government were concerned about that particular constituency, as they are opinion formers who talk to the electorate and come into contact with them all the time. I would have thought that, with an election looming, the Government may feel that that was a good reason to want to prove that they were being fair to small business. The fact is, however, that they are not being fair to small business, because they are not providing the opportunity to have this measure fully and properly debated without the constraints of a programme motion. That is why I am surprised by the motion. I hope that the Government will reconsider at this last moment and withdraw it.</p>

 I quite understand why the hon.

get on to them. He was right to say that the Bill has been well debated so far, so let me remind him of something as he tries to argue for more time this afternoon than the Government have proposed. I say this to the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson), too, who accuses the Government of undue haste. We had three very good evidence sessions, as the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) said. We then agreed to hold six scrutiny sessions. We finished early on the fifth, and we did not need the sixth. The Bill was, as the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst said, well debated and properly scrutinised in the Public Bill Committee.</p>

 As we heard in the previous debate, the Bill is attracting increasing attention from business people throughout the country whose business may be affected, should the local authority or a group of local authorities in their area choose to opt for the mechanism set out in the Bill in order to fund a local infrastructure project. Although I said on Second Reading that my party is not opposed to the principle of a business contribution to important infrastructure projects, we believe that safeguards are needed so that the businesses affected feel that they have an input, first, into the proposal being drawn up, and secondly, into whether the proposal meets with approval, as we shall discuss later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="90311-0005.htm_para11"><a name="09031165000660">Businesses and organisations that I have spoken to felt that the business improvement districts process was valuable because it enabled the continuing engagement of the business community in the delivery of a project, so that businesses can be reassured that the project is proceeding to schedule and in the way originally envisaged, and so that they can make a contribution to delivery through their experience in delivering similar projects in the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="90311-0005.htm_para12"><a name="09031165000661">The new clause would set up a project delivery board as a mechanism for businesses that were making a contribution through business rate supplement, local authority representatives and others appointed to the board to enable them to come together to ensure that there was adequate oversight of the project as progressed. The positive relations that, hopefully, would have been fostered during the putting together of the prospectus would continue, increasing opportunities for joint working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="90311-0005.htm_para13"><a name="09031165000662">As we heard in Committee, many hon. Members consider it important to put on the record that relationships between local authorities and the business community are much better now than they have been in the past. I know that the Minister and his colleagues have used that point to argue that the ballot is not necessary in all circumstances.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman and the Minister have both said that the relationship between businesses and local authorities is profound, particularly in the case of high- profile business regeneration in our inner cities, but does the hon. Gentleman not have some concerns that the third element, the residential population, especially in our bigger cities, has often been left out? How would he try to ensure that there was input from residential communities whose vibrancy is an important part of ensuring that such initiatives are maintained, particularly in our inner-city areas, where they are most likely to take place?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises a good point. In his constituency there is an organisation that represents a small residential community which does not participate as strongly in elections to that body as does the business community represented in the Corporation of London, although I note from the press that that may change and that there are moves afoot for residents to mount more of a challenge at the next elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para0"><a name="09031165000665">From my party&#146;s perspective, the important thing is that local authorities represent the residential community.

the board. It is the levying authority or part of the group of levying authorities and will have consulted its electorate and been elected on a platform to deliver projects such as those that may be proposed. That is a safeguard, but schedule 1 also sets out that a third of the board could be appointed by the levying authority so, for example, if the project was specifically relevant to an area where there was an active residents association, I can see no reason why someone from that association could not be co-opted to the board to represent the voice of the residents, as the hon. Gentleman suggests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para1"><a name="09031165000666">As I was saying, it is necessary to reassure the business community that its voice matters not just in putting together the proposal and signing up to it, but in the ongoing delivery of it. The board would be an additional means of fostering positive relations between local authorities and the local business community. Those relationships are undoubtedly much stronger, but the fact that all hon. Members have been lobbied by business organisations about the Bill proves that there are still issues to be overcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para2"><a name="09031165000667">One of the matters raised time and again by businesses is, sadly, concerns about the delivery of certain local projects. The new clause would help to reassure businesses that its voice would be heard and would be central to the delivery of the BID. If the business community had any concerns about business rate supplements being levied for purposes not entirely set out in the prospectus&#151;I am sure the Minister will tell me that that is not possible and that there are safeguards in place to protect against that&#151;it would be reassured by having its representatives at the heart of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para3"><a name="09031165000668">In the debate on the programme motion, we heard from the Minister that we had excellent evidence sessions. He is right. Hon. Members in all parts of the Committee agreed that one of the most important contributions was that of Dr. Julie Grail from British BIDs. In her evidence to us at our second sitting on Tuesday 20 January she said:</p>
<a name="90311-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="09031165002400"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;With regard to the business rate supplement, we have heard a lot today about concern with the ballot...it is not just about the ballot... it is about managing the relationship going forward. One huge value that we have seen coming out of BIDs is that it has truly brought together local government and the business community. A danger about the business rates supplement is that it could rip it apart again.&#148;<i> &#151;&#151;</i>[<i> Official Report, Business Rate Supplements Public Bill Committee, </i>20 January 2009; c. 46, Q199.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para4"><a name="09031165000669">Of course, that is not the intention, but there clearly are concerns in the business community about that. We have a model in BIDs showing how positive relationships can be fostered and can deliver projects that respond to local need and ensure that everybody has a say in their ongoing management. If there was that model and it was successful for the local sorts of projects that bids deliver, we could adapt it to cover some of the bigger schemes that affect a wider area and which, it is hoped, the BRS could play a part in delivering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para5"><a name="09031165000670">According to the evidence from the head of the CBI&#146;s property group, if the business community were not consulted about a scheme, there would be considerable business unrest. The CBI stressed that it was imperative that businesses got the opportunity to work with local authorities to deliver real economic benefit to an area. A project delivery board would be exactly such an opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para6"><a name="09031165000671">As I said, the new schedule sets out in a little more detail our initial thoughts about how the project delivery board might be formed and how it might operate. One concern that I am sure we all share is that we could create a body that does the same as other bodies, and duplicates&#151;with all the waste of officers&#146; and business people&#146;s valuable time and the costs that that would involve. We have therefore, for example, said that board members should not get any form of salary. That is the tone that we are trying to set: the board would be focused on delivery and would not necessarily have to meet regularly. It would, however, be a mechanism to ensure that everybody was involved in delivering what I hope would be exciting projects that would greatly improve areas, with benefits for residents and the business community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para7"><a name="09031165000672">Amendment 1 seeks to remove clause 19, which deals with when a levying authority has not given notice to a billing authority before the start of the financial year. The issue came up briefly in Committee. There is concern that billing authorities might have to respond very quickly. That could be an extra burden on them and cause problems for businesses and local authorities as they react. The amendment is to test the Minister&#146;s view on the issue. Surely things should be done in good time for the billing authority&#151;in other words, by the start of the financial year so that the bills can go out together and there is no need for supplementary billing or recall of any bills. The business community would certainly welcome that. I am sure that the billing authorities, as distinct from the levying authorities, would also welcome it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para8"><a name="09031165000673">I am sure that the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) will correct me if I am wrong about his amendment 16, which seeks to define and contain how money raised by the BRS is spent and to make sure that that happens according to the prospectus and that there is no prospect of its being used for other purposes. Furthermore, if a governing body were set up along the lines that I set out in new clause 1, the amendment says that the business community should be involved and sets out how that should happen. Amendment 16 is on lines similar to those of new clause 1, although I think that our new clause, which sets up a project delivery board, is a clearer and, I hope, more defined way of doing things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para9"><a name="09031165000674">New clause 1 would improve the Bill in respect of the crucial element of business involvement. There is support in the country for the concept of a business rate supplement delivering an important local project, as long as everybody is clear about what the money is being spent on and everybody is signed up and willing to participate and has a continuing voice in the delivery of the project. I look forward to what the Minister has to say on the new clause, but I should say that I am minded to press it to a vote, should the Minister not agree to it.</p>

 I have much sympathy with many of the remarks of the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson). We debated the issue in detail in Committee and it goes to the heart of how we make the Bill work. My hon. Friends and I make no bones about our position on the Bill in principle: we think it a mistake to use the Bill to impose burdens on businesses, with the exception of Crossrail, in the current climate. That said, if the numbers are against us,  <br>

let us see what can be done to make the arrangement work better. That is why we are interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para10"><a name="09031165000676">In Committee, I thought that the Government were not uninterested either; the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan), replied in a constructive way, saying that he and his officials would consider the issue. The hon. Member for North Cornwall referred to the powerful evidence of Dr. Grail, whom Committee members from all parties regarded as one of the most impressive of a strong team of witnesses. I hope that the Department will find a way of taking the issue on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para11"><a name="09031165000677">Furthermore, there is logic to the proposals, which go right the way back to the Lyons review, which was one of the drivers of the original proposal. It made a point about the importance of securing legitimacy and support from the business community. That works in two ways. The first, to which we shall come later, is the opportunity for businesses to have a genuine say by means of a ballot. The second, every bit as important, is the thought that even if there is a ballot&#151;and I hope that there will be&#151;things should not just stop there. Business has to have an ongoing involvement. There is a compelling logic to that; businesses have perhaps the largest stake in the success of a BRS scheme. They are ultimately the potential beneficiaries, but they are footing the bill at the same time. Furthermore, they are likely to have local and sectoral knowledge to bring to the discussion.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that if something was going wrong with a project, the local businesses, because of their nature, would be the first to realise it? Involving local businesses could benefit the project.</p>

 I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend, who makes a powerful point. I was a member of a local authority for 16 years and I worked well with excellent local authority officers. However, the fact is that the business man can bring an additional dimension that neither I as an elected member nor the officers were always in a position to bring. If the BRS or business improvement districts are to work on the basis of genuine collaboration between the local authority as a governing body and the business community, having that ongoing and structurally assured involvement is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para12"><a name="09031165000680">Often the business person will spot something because of the nature of the culture that they are in; it might not be spotted by the elected officers who work in the administrative culture. That hugely powerful point should be taken on board. That is why we tabled amendment 16, which covers much the same ground as new clause 1, although there is an additional factor that I shall come to. Like the approach adopted by the hon. Member for North Cornwall, my approach will be influenced by what Ministers say they have been able to do to take the issue forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para13"><a name="09031165000681">The point of difference between me and the hon. Gentleman is that his new clause might be a little too prescriptive in specifying the form of delivery vehicle that there must be. In some cases, the project delivery board might be the right vehicle; I can, however, think of some BRS schemes for which it might not be appropriate. That is why, both here and in Committee, I have deliberately cast my amendment in broader terms so that before a  <br>

decision is made&#151;and before the businesses vote, as I hope they would&#151;the prospectus will set out how that ongoing involvement will take place. That will vary and should have the opportunity to do so, according to the nature of the scheme and the scale, place and sector involved. The point is that the information should be set out before the die is cast and the commitment to the BRS scheme is made. Sometimes, it may be done along the lines of the delivery board model, but not always, which is why I would like greater flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para14"><a name="09031165000682">The other matter that I have added to the original amendment that I tabled in Committee relates to strengthening the requirements on the provision of financial information&#151;an issue that became apparent during the evidence given to the Committee by several people. That provision would introduce an obligation to spell out clearly the moneys that are to be raised in pursuance of the BRS, and what they will be expended on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para15"><a name="09031165000683">There was some debate in Committee about the definition of the purposes that BRS could be used for. We debated whether it was appropriate to go down the route of defining by exception, which is more or less the scheme adopted in the Bill. It says that the BRS cannot be used for X, Y or Z&#151;broadly, other types of local service&#151;but is otherwise silent about its application. The view of the bulk of the business community is that we should specify the categories of project that the moneys can be used for. The amendment would attempt to offer a middle way, and if we believe in localism and a ballot on such matters, the prospectus should set out exactly how people will be told, before they decide, what money is being raised and what it will be expended upon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para16"><a name="09031165000684">An ongoing, iterative process would be involved so that, unlike the current arrangement, it would not just be a question of giving a broad-brush outline of what the project would be, and how much the overall budget would be, including certain other budget heads. I am talking about a more iterative process&#151;almost a report back&#151;to keep in touch with the community on what the money had been spent on so far, and what had been raised. It is like the requirement on the board of a company to produce annual accounts. There would be an obligation to provide regular updating, which is in everybody&#146;s interest, not least the proponents of the BRS scheme because it is desirable to have the confidence of the business community, and of council tax payers and residents.</p>

Friend the Minister, dare I say it, took a different view in a number of areas about trusting local government and giving it some say in decisions. It is fine to legislate, and there must be safeguards; one of the safeguards in the Bill is that the Secretary of State can intervene if the procedures laid down in it are not being followed.</p>

I believe that the new clause is over-prescriptive, and we should trust local government more. In these difficult economic times, I do not believe for one moment that local government will do something stupid such as putting businesses and jobs at risk in its own area.

 I was at great pains to say earlier that the relationship between business and local government has improved hugely over the past couple of decades, and that is absolutely right&#151;I remember the hon. Gentleman making that point in Committee. However, we heard evidence in Committee from organisations such as British BIDs to say that the business improvement districts process, through continuing such engagement in a more formalised and recognised way, has been a positive step. The new clause seeks a similar mechanism for the BRS. Although there is a positive relationship in general, when we are talking specifically about an extra levy of cash on business for a specific project, business organisations, and BIDs, which represent everyone involved in those processes, feel that that is a positive model to use.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. Why should we do that? In most areas&#151;not every area&#151;these forums already exist, or such co-operation is taking place, so I do not accept what he says. I genuinely believe that we would be telling local government how best to run its local area. I strongly feel that local government should be given the freedom to get on and deliver what is important, working with all the partners in the local area to deliver the sort of improvements that we all want.</p>

 The Minister will be aware from previous debates on this matter that I have perhaps a little more sympathy than one or two of my colleagues for the whole principle of business rate supplements. This is not the ideal year for the Bill. Had it been introduced a few years ago, those in my party might not have had the many understandable concerns that we have expressed, representing business interests, given the real financial and economic problems that are facing our businesses.</p>

Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) in speaking to amendment 16, so I must express some opposition to the comments made by the hon. Member for Halton (Derek Twigg). I worry that the credibility of BRS schemes is crucial. There is a risk of such schemes, particularly the longer ones, seeming to be at quite a distance from the local authority. During what might be a 10 or 12-year scheme&#151;a bigger type of regeneration project perhaps&#151;a range of different councillors may be involved. A certain political party will be in office when a BRS scheme is put into place, and by the time it comes to fruition a different one might be in office. It is therefore all the more important that we have an ongoing input from business in the way that we have set out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90311-0006.htm_para22"><a name="09031165000696">I agree with a number of the comments that have been made, although I have some sympathy with what the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson) proposed. The notion of having a project delivery board, in the way he sets out, would be over-prescriptive and highly unwieldy. It would detract from what we are trying to achieve. The hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I consider the proposal in the context of Crossrail. How on earth could we have a project delivery board that would avoid being anything more than an extra layer of bureaucracy that left us open to a lot of confusion, if it were given a project of such size that it took into account the views of people from 33 different boroughs?</p>

 I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman is exploring the matter and supports us on the general concept, although I appreciate that he is unhappy with some of the details of the new clause. We have been at pains throughout the process to point out that there is a distinction between Crossrail and projects in the rest of the country. Indeed, his own party has sought to do that as well. Although I believe that a mechanism could be found to ensure that local government and the business community in London are represented, we need to consider closely how the system will operate in other areas. We are considering a specific case in London, but the Bill may well be applied across the whole country.</p>

I believe that we will return to that matter in other debates this afternoon. It is crucial that we draw a firm distinction between the two. My biggest fear is that by putting the Bill on the statute book, we will allow it to be used for small infrastructure projects that should be covered not by a BRS but by BID-type schemes. A BID works by being highly localised and highly focused, and by working for businesses that, as in my constituency, are often within a couple of roads or a small number of blocks of each other. Those schemes work extremely well, and having some sort of delivery board mechanism makes sense in the context of a highly localised scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09031165000700">My concern, which is implicit in all the amendments in this group, is that no local authority should be able to say, &#147;Right, we&#146;ve now got our BRS scheme through and we do not need to bother with worrying about the concerns of business or anybody else for the next 10 or 12 years&#148;, or however long the project takes. That would be wrong, which is why I support amendment 16. Equally, we should avoid highly prescriptive man-management that would only provide a further level of bureaucracy and confusion. I hope that the Government will give some thought here and in another place to finding a way to ensure that the credibility of BRS schemes is maintained. I know that we will come on to ballots later this afternoon, but my biggest concern is that without some safeguard for business, there is a real risk that credibility will be undermined and the system will simply be seen as another opportunity for a cash-grab from the Government, rather than used for a specific purpose that benefits a business community in infrastructure terms.</p>

 I see the need for something that will satisfy the business community that a project is worthy and well managed, but I share the concerns of those who believe that imposing a board in every case might be difficult, inappropriate or unnecessarily bureaucratic. Under the terms of new clause 1, it is difficult to know who from the private sector side would want to volunteer to sit on such a board. We learn from new schedule 1 that there would be no remuneration, and we can imagine that in some cases the meetings would be long and frequent.</p>

went wrong. Would it be a board in the legal sense, on which a director sits only if he is aware that serious legal duties and requirements are placed on him, and aware of what provision is to be made for officer insurance, professional indemnity and all the other things that anyone placed in that position of trust deals with? If so, that would represent a labour due imposed on top of the cash charge that the business community will be invited to expend. It is bad enough that a company will have to pay the tax, but worse for it to be told that it must put up some people to sit on the supervising board so as not to make an even bigger mess of the scheme. That would mean that they were invited to give of their time free, on top of having to give their money to the project in question. I see certain difficulties in that.</p>

become unpopular. It might make itself unpopular by proposing one of the supplementary levies provided for in the Bill, no doubt on top of a large council tax increase at the capping threshold. Yet under the new schedule, local authorities would not just be given the power to have a third of the representatives and to choose the third who are perhaps intended to be more independent, although that is not stated. They would be given the power to choose the whole lot.</p>

The local authority would have every right to say, &#147;No, we&#146;re not having them. We would rather have some friendly, helpful people who are of our political disposition or agree with us about this project&#148;, so that there would be no grit in the oyster and no challenge to how the project was going ahead. The new schedule reveals a weak system, which in certain circumstances would prevent the board from acting as an accountable body with control over costs and responsibility for better project management. If a local authority were determined to drive something through, against the interests of its electorate, it could do so. That is a great weakness in the system that is suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09031165000714">I therefore have more sympathy with the more wide-ranging amendment 16, in which my hon.

We are here, even at such a late stage in the Bill&#146;s progress, to tell the Government that there is a genuine problem of accountability. The system is unsatisfactory anyway, in that it enables the imposition of big levies on local communities in times of stress. If there is no proper system for engaging them and getting them to believe that a project is well run and that the expenditure is properly controlled, that makes matters far worse.

identified and for others with which I shall not delay House. Perhaps amendment 16 provides a way forward if the Government are willing, and if they are prepared to produce regulations to give some accountability under the law.</p>

 We have now moved beyond the programme motion debate and back to the serious scrutiny that has been characteristic of the way in which all hon. Members who have been involved with the Bill have dealt with it. I shall try to respond in kind. I want to encourage the hon. Members for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson) and for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) to feel that they do not need to press either the new clause or the amendment that they respectively tabled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para14"><a name="09031165000717">Let me start by looking for common ground. I agree that it is important for businesses to feel confident about the running of any project to which the business rate supplement contributes a funding stream. It is also important that they are kept informed of a project&#146;s progress and of the costs that are incurred in running it. However, new clause 1 would over-centralise and is too prescriptive, as other hon. Members have pointed out. I intend to achieve the same end through much more flexible means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para15"><a name="09031165000718">I urge the hon. Member for North Cornwall to consider that, if the duty on levying authorities to set up a body to oversee the delivery of any project that was funded or part funded by a business rate supplement existed&#151;even if that supplement were a small element of a much larger funding package, which would inevitably have its own governance arrangements&#151;the authority would still need to establish a project delivery board such as he has described. Although I am with the hon. Gentleman in principle, a moment&#146;s pause suggests that, in practice, the new clause would be too prescriptive. It may not work in all circumstances, and the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) rightly asked whether we could imagine it working for the arrangements that are properly in place for Crossrail. The new clause is likely to blur the lines of accountability and could lead to less rather than more effective management of the delivery of any project linked to the business rate supplement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para16"><a name="09031165000719">The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) made an important point about the new clause. It specifies that the board should be a &#147;body corporate&#148;, which has implications for those who would sit on a board. They may face the possibility of being legally liable and responsible for a project over which they have relatively little direct control. Ultimately, responsibility for such a project must rest with those who are put there to take it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para17"><a name="09031165000720">My preference is in keeping with the arguments that my hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Derek Twigg) presented. The levying authorities, clearly with wide local consultation, are best placed to determine the appropriate governance for a project. It is neither easy nor appropriate to specify that centrally. It should certainly not be done in of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para18"><a name="09031165000721">Amendment 16 attempts to introduce a similar provision more flexibly. As the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst said, the delivery board model may not always be appropriate. He wants to ensure that the business rate supplement prospectus makes it clear how  <br>

those paying it can expect to be informed, especially about the amount of revenue that has been raised and how it is being spent. The Bill already provides for that. Paragraph 11 of schedule 1 requires levying authorities to make clear in their prospectus the way in which those liable for the supplement will be informed about the expenditure incurred on a BRS project. It also requires the authorities to set out how they will provide updates on the work until its completion. In other words, levying authorities will not be able to keep in the dark businesses that pay the business rate supplement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para19"><a name="09031165000722">Let me be clear and, by doing so, attempt to be helpful. We also expect levying authorities to consider how they will involve businesses in running any project that is funded or part funded by a business rate supplement. Indeed, in the draft statutory guidance that is out for consultation, we have made it clear that authorities should consider how they can involve businesses over and above the specific statutory consultation. Consultation on the draft statutory guidance closes on 17 April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para20"><a name="09031165000723">Amendment 16 is also too prescriptive. The message in the guidance is clear to authorities: it is important to ensure that those who pay the business rate supplement are informed and involved in running a BRS project. It also gives authorities the scope to determine what is appropriate given the nature of the project and the needs of the local community as well as the desire of local businesses to get involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para21"><a name="09031165000724">As I said in Committee, consultation on the statutory guidance is under way and we have put down markers in it.

 I am grateful for the spirit in which the Minister has approached the matter. I do not seek to be needlessly prescriptive and I am grateful for his comments on paragraph 11. I understand the intention behind his point about the statutory guidance, which is out for consultation, but what is the sanction if a levying authority does not come up with the goods under that guidance? We must give the business community some assurance that there is a fall-back and a sanction.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has a good memory and I am surprised that he has overlooked our detailed discussion in Committee about the provisions that set out the range of sanctions. Ultimately, the Secretary of State has the power to suspend a business rate supplement. Before that point, there is range of other potential interventions and sanctions, which we discussed.</p>

 The Minister is generous, as always, in giving way. His response may help us crystallise our thinking about what we do. Does he envisage a position whereby the draft statutory guidance, once it is issued&#151;I do not know what his time frame is or how it will fit in with considerations in another place&#151;will set out how the business community is to be involved before a decision is made? I do not want to be unduly prescriptive, but does he understand that moving in and using sanctions is to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted? We want an assurance that people will be informed before they make a decision about a BRS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para23"><a name="09031165000730">The hon. Member for North Cornwall said that he was testing my view with amendment 1, which would mean that levying authorities in two-tier areas would be able to levy a business rate supplement or vary one only from the beginning of any billing round in April each year. It will certainly be more efficient for billing authorities to collect the supplement at the same time as they collect business rates. That is why we want to encourage, as we are doing, any authorities to collect the supplement in order to do just that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para24"><a name="09031165000731">As the impact assessment that accompanies the Bill says, and as I explained in Committee, when the business rate supplement is collected as part of the annual billing round, the Bill provides for the costs of that collection to be met from the revenues of the business rate supplement. When the business rate supplement is collected as a separate exercise, the costs of collection would have to be met by the levying authority. There is therefore a clear financial disincentive to do anything other than make the collection part of the annual billing round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para25"><a name="09031165000732">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal is unnecessarily restrictive&#151;he is nodding, which I hope means that he would accept the general argument and not press amendment 1 to a vote. The risk is that if there were a minor delay&#151;say, a month&#151;in a project for any reason, including any reason not connected with the BRS, amendment 1 would require a whole year&#146;s delay before that project with the BRS element could get up and running. That is unduly inflexible and gives undue weight to administrative processes rather than to the proper delivery of the projects concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="90311-0007.htm_para26"><a name="09031165000733">In summary, hon. Members have ably made their arguments this afternoon. I hope that they will allow us to consider those arguments as part of the current consultation on the statutory guidance. We are concerned about the credibility of any BRS-supported project, as the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster urged that we should be, as well as about the delivery of those projects. The guidance is clear and so is our aim through that guidance. Our approach is more flexible than that proposed either by new clause 1 or amendment 16. It allows for arrangements that will properly inform and involve the business community, and BRS payers in particular. Our approach will also mean that any proper arrangements can suit the area, the project and the BRS scheme concerned. I hope that the hon. Members for North Cornwall and for Bromley and Chislehurst will not need to press their amendments to a Division.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="90311-0008.htm_para0"><a name="09031165000735">I am also grateful to hear the Minister&#146;s determination to ensure that wherever such a project goes forward, the business community will have a role in its ongoing delivery and in the oversight of it. As the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) said, the intention behind amendment 16 is to ensure that that is the case. However, I have noticed a tendency in other Bills for things to be left to be clarified later. Although I sadly do not have the resources at my disposal that the Minister does to test every thought that I have and to ensure that everything is drafted as it should be, I wanted new clause 1 to make the Bill more prescriptive and say that there must be a body that formalises the business involvement in an ongoing relationship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90311-0008.htm_para1"><a name="09031165000736">I was also seeking to look at how the BIDs model works. The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) is absolutely right that BIDs and the BRS will do different things in different places. However, as models for delivery, they provide us with a starting point. I am seeking to press for such a vehicle with new clause 1. The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) was keen to pick holes in new clause 1 and to look for areas of disagreement. However, I welcome the fact that he and all other Conservatives Members who have spoken are keen that there should be a safeguard for businesses, so that they can be confident that they have a role to play.</p>

<p><a name="st_o132"><a name="09031165000737"><a name="90311-0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="09031165003042"><b>Mr. Redwood:</b>
 I was not trying to pick holes in new clause 1; I was trying to say that we need a structure that will work. That is what we are groping towards, but it is a pity that the Minister did not tell us whether the schemes would normally be local authority-run schemes or private finance initiative or public-private partnership-type schemes. However, we have to build on whatever command structure is in place and have accountability and representation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o133"><a name="09031165000738"><a name="90311-0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="09031165003043"><b>Dan Rogerson:</b>
 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that clarification. However, I am concerned that amendment 16 may not be quite as reassuring to the business community, in that it still puts the onus on the local authority to come up with the means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="90311-0008.htm_para2"><a name="09031165000739">The right hon. Gentleman talked about the proportion of business people on the body proposed by new clause 1 being only a third. However, the project delivery board would look at the oversight of the whole project. The BRS is part of the finance package, so it would be unfair for the business community to form all or half of that body if its funding was less than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="90311-0008.htm_para3"><a name="09031165000740">Were new clause 1 to be added to the Bill, it might require some clarification, perhaps through discussions in another place. I am seeking to get something in the Bill that sets out clearly that the business community will have a role in the ongoing discussions on how a project is delivered. We are talking about a long-term commitment, and the right hon. Gentleman said that it was unfair to expect the business community to take on that commitment. I have spoken to business organisations&#151;for example, when looking at BIDs and other systems&#151;and it is clear that they can usually find a way through their representative bodies to ensure that the business community&#146;s voice is heard.</p>

Given that that sanction will be used only in rare circumstances, there is nothing that gives me huge confidence that there will be a systematic way for the business voice to be heard in the ongoing management of a project.</p>

 New clause 2 concerns the interface between business rate supplements and business improvement districts. Although both relate to the promotion of the local economy, BIDs are different from BRSs in a number of respects, as the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) pointed out. In Committee we examined the differences between the two, highlighting the degree to which the BRS is more likely to support larger-scale, longer-term investment&#151;including infrastructure&#151;whereas BIDs have focused primarily on short-term improvements to enhance the attractiveness, commercial success and security of retail and commercial areas. However, there are similarities. Both are based on the principle of partnership between local authorities and business to promote the local economy. Both involve a levy on the ratepayer&#151;who is the occupier rather than the owner of the property&#151;on top of the normal business rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90311-0008.htm_para10"><a name="09031165001076">As the Minister responsible for overseeing the introduction of BIDs some six or seven years ago, I am naturally pleased that they have proved to be a success, particularly because&#151;this is another feature common to both BIDs and BRSs&#151;they were not uniformly welcomed when we introduced them. I recall the Opposition&#146;s hostility when we debated the local Government Act 2003. I hope that, just as with the passage of time they have come to recognise that their opposition to BIDs was misplaced, they will come to see over the passage of time that their current opposition to the BRS is also misguided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="90311-0008.htm_para11"><a name="09031165001077">Over those six years, there has been a significant growth in the number of BIDs and in their contribution to improving the economic performance of commercial areas in towns and cities all over the country. Dr. Julie Grail is the chief executive of British BIDs, the umbrella body for BIDs throughout the country. During one of our evidence sessions at the beginning of the Bill&#146;s Committee stage&#151;I join the Members who have rightly emphasised the value of those sessions&#151;she told us that 76 BIDs were now operating throughout the country, nearly 20 of them in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="90311-0008.htm_para12"><a name="09031165001078">BIDs can be set up only after a yes vote on a dual-key basis by all the businesses that will be liable for the levy. They are also subject to periodic renewal ballots. The key issue that prompted the new clause was the fact that 14 existing London BIDs are due to be subject to such ballots within the next two years. At precisely the same time, business rate payers will begin to face the business rate supplement for Crossrail. Not surprisingly, Dr. Grail and many others who have been involved in the successful development of BIDs fear that when confronted with both the BRS for Crossrail and the ongoing cost of supporting their local BID, some business rate payers, particularly in difficult economic circumstances, will conclude that they cannot afford to continue to support the BID.</p>

<p><a name="st_o137"><a name="09031165001079"><a name="90311-0008.htm_spnew5"><a name="09031165003368"><b>Angela Watkinson (Upminster) (Con):</b>
 How can participating businesses agreeing to the establishment of a business improvement district know the extent of their future liability?</p>

 One of the arrangements that has applied throughout the evolution of BIDs is a proper procedure for defining the objectives of a BID and the level of contribution that will be expected before the proposition is put to a vote, so that when business rate payers come to vote, they will know whether they are receiving value for money. That is a well-established arrangement, and all who are experienced in the way BIDs have operated know that it has proved successful. When businesses feel that a BID will enhance the value of their area, they are likely to vote yes&#151;and, as Dr. Grail pointed out, they have done so in 76 areas.</p>

It is entirely up to the BID body itself to decide on its programme. However, that programme must be set out in advance of the first ballot, and when it is due for renewal the BID will be required to set out its programme for the following year. There is a well-established procedure enabling the parties invited to contribute to BIDs to know what they would be getting, and to say either yes or no to it in a ballot.</p>

That, in my view, would be a very unfortunate consequence. The purpose of my new clause is to find a solution that does not pit BIDs against BRSs, or put either at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="90311-0008.htm_para15"><a name="09031165001085">The new clause addresses the problem by returning to an issue that has been debated long and hard since BIDs were first introduced: the contribution that might be made by property owners in bid areas to support activity from which they stand to benefit considerably. The BID model was originally developed in north America, where the contributions from the business side come from property owners rather than occupiers. In adapting the model to United Kingdom circumstances, in which business rates are levied on occupiers, we concluded that the BID levy should also apply to occupiers. However strong the argument was for imposing the levy on landowners&#151;and we received forceful representations from many quarters, including property owners who felt that that was right and equitable&#151;it would have required the establishment of a wholly new register of commercial property ownership throughout the country so that property owners could be balloted in the first place and the local authority could subsequently impose the levy, assuming that there was a positive vote. Not only would that have imposed significant cost burdens on local authorities, but it would have been a major bureaucratic exercise and, crucially, delayed the implementation of the BID scheme. At the time, there was a real appetite among the business community, town centre managers and many others to get a move on with BIDs to ensure that the benefits that many saw would come from the establishment of BIDs could be achieved.</p>

 I understand the thrust of the new clause and I have some sympathy with it. However, my concern is twofold. First, if the property owner is liable for the BID, at the next lease review is not the cost likely to be placed on the lease? The business user is therefore likely to face the cost anyway. Secondly, how does this relate to accounting? If there is a BID in one town but not in another, the cost may increase in one town but not in another. However, competition between the two may be keen.</p>

costs being passed from one to the other. In addition, the concept of a BID is entirely compatible with the concept of local democracy. Local communities should be free to decide to do things that they think will enhance their area. Obviously, they will take account of the competition issue. If the businesses in one area do not think it will be to their benefit, they will not vote for it. It is entirely a matter for local decision, and in this case the vote comes from the local business community.</p>

 I am sure the right hon. Gentleman agrees that one of the most important tenets of any tax, to make it as efficient as possible, is certainty. Presumably that was one of the issues when six years ago it was determined that BIDs would not go down the route of a levy on property owners. How much evidence is there on the certainty of property ownership? Often it will be difficult to get the money from offshore companies. In introducing the new clause, has he given any thought to how that problem can be overcome?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises a pertinent point. I am going to address that in detail later in my speech, so if he will bear with me, I will come back to the point, which is relevant and has exercised people. I should stress at this stage that it was not so much a problem of certainty that deterred us from introducing a property owners levy as a basis for BIDs when BIDs were introduced. The obstacle was the cost and time involved in creating a register throughout the country, which would have been necessary, when there was no certainty that BIDs would receive positive votes anywhere. There could have been a lot of abortive cost. Now we are in a different situation, as I will explain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90311-0009.htm_para0"><a name="09031165001090">The Government took the decision, and I do not in any way resile from it, in 2002-03 to proceed with the BIDs on the basis of an occupier levy that could be easily and quickly implemented on the basis of the existing business rates register. At the same time we encouraged the concept of voluntary contributions from property owners to supplement the levy on occupiers, so as to spread the burden and ensure that owners had an involvement and were not excluded from the BID. That has worked reasonably well in a number of BID areas, but not everywhere. It has worked to a considerable degree in key retail locations such as London&#146;s West End, in the area including Regent street, Oxford street and Bond street, which has a BID: the New West End Company, which has been very successful. It has an annual BID levy income of &#163;2.5 million from property occupiers, but it receives an additional &#163;900,000 a year in voluntary contributions from property owners, so the contributions from owners represent about 36 per cent. of the levy income.</p>

 It is probably worth making the case that there is one very large landowner in that area: the Crown Estate. Under the scheme that the right hon.

We had that meeting and I am grateful to him for making that opportunity available. It was a constructive discussion. Dame Judith highlighted a number of weaknesses with the voluntary contribution system. First, it is unstable and unpredictable. Whereas the BID levy is fixed for the full five-year duration of the BID before it comes up for renewal, voluntary contributions can be cut off at any time. Given the significance of the sums&#151;&#163;900,000 a year in the case of the New West End Company&#151;that makes forward planning and budgeting much more difficult.</p>

He must be aware that, were we to lose confidence and cancel Crossrail, which would be the implication of not proceeding with the Bill, that would have a devastating long-term impact on London's reputation and its economic viability.

Thirdly, there is growing resentment among the owners who are making voluntary contributions at what they rightly see as freeloading by other property owners in the BID area who get the benefit of the work of the BID without having to make any contribution. For all those reasons, there is a strong case for revisiting the option of introducing a property owner levy in BID areas.

BIDs were introduced, the new clause would apply only in very limited circumstances: first, in areas where BIDs have already been established; and secondly, in areas where a business rate supplement has been introduced. In effect, therefore, the new clause, if it is accepted, will apply only in the early years of business rate supplement within the London area, where there is the only BRS scheme that is likely to be ready to start from 1 April 2010. Even when BRS is picked up in other parts of the country, the provision will apply only in those areas where there is both a BID already in existence and where the BRS scheme is to be applied.</p>

In other words, there must be a double-key ballot: a majority vote among the property occupiers and, for the owners levy, the majority of owners voting yes along with the majority of rateable value. Essentially, there has to be support from both large and small-scale occupiers or owners to ensure success. One cannot simply load a cost on to others. That safeguard has worked well in the case of BIDs, and the new clause provides that that should be applied equally in the case of the owner levy.</p>

It should not be required to do that. In my view, it should be equally permissive, with separate ballots to be held of owners and occupiers. Dr. Julie Grail has given evidence, to which I shall refer, from Scotland to demonstrate why flexibility is probably a good thing, but if there is a decision to apportion the cost between the two, the proposition will be put to both the owners and the occupiers that they should meet a set percentage of the agreed budget, which will be set in advance.

 I must apologise to the hon. Gentleman. This is complex territory and I am probably not explaining it as well as I should. The apportionment is purely in relation to the contributions to the BID. The business rate supplement&#151;the main purpose of the Bill&#151;would apply only to occupiers. There is no provision for the business rate supplement to apply to owners. My new clause would not change that. It applies only, as I thought I had stressed, to those areas where there are existing BIDs, in which it would be open to the BID board to work with the levying authority. I would hope that the two would work closely together; one of the lessons of BIDs is that close co-operation is crucial to their success. If the board were to propose an apportionment between the element of the BID that would be paid by the occupier and the element that would be paid by the owner, it would be free to do so.</p>

There will be some BID areas where the renewal ballot is perhaps not due for three, four or more years. The New West End Company only just had a successful renewal ballot at the end of last year. Therefore, there will be a period of almost five years before it is time for another ballot. If the new clause were accepted, there would be an option to set an owners levy within an area where there is an existing BID&#151;the New West End Company is one&#151;and where the business rate supplement is coming in. It might be decided that it was sensible to introduce an owners levy as well as the existing BID. It is right that there should be the flexibility to do that rather than saying that the board has to wait until the end of the current BID period, when there would then be the relevant apportionment and a proposal. It is purely a practical measure to allow a degree of flexibility.</p>

I would expect it to be used to offset the contribution of occupiers; in other words, the extra contribution from owners would offset the liability of the occupiers, which would reduce their contribution and make it less burdensome to meet the additional demand of the business rate supplement.

 I have already made it clear that this provision will apply only in areas where there is an existing BID, and where business rate supplement is proposed. Those are the two areas that are covered.

Therefore, the range of business ownerships that have to be identified will be less, and the risk of serious problems arising will also be less.

Let me say to him at this point that I am a fan of BIDs, as I have said both on previous occasions and in a commission I had the privilege to head-up for my party. Does he fear the concept of BIDs becoming less attractive because of this double whammy of costs, albeit split between property owners and property occupiers?</p>

 By definition, yes, because, as I have said, I think that there is the possibility of existing BIDs failing to get support in renewal ballots because of the imposition of BRS. It is precisely because of that that I believe it is right to address the long-standing problem of property owners not having had any liability to contribute towards BIDs. I believe that this proposal addresses that problem in a practical way, and that it will make it possible for people to see the case for continuing to support BIDs, albeit the occupiers will be contributing less because the owners will be contributing more as well as meeting the business rate supplement. I believe that, for all these reasons, there are very strong arguments in favour of the approach I advocate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="90311-0009.htm_para12"><a name="09031165001118">I have also been struck by the amount of support I have had from a very wide range of organisations. There is strong business backing for the introduction of a property owners levy. The British Property Federation has been closely involved in the preparation of the new clause, and it made clear the degree of both its support and business support for this approach at the meeting that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government arranged a week ago. It is not every day that business welcomes the introduction of a financial levy, and the fact that business and owners&#146; representatives were saying they welcomed this and thought it was the right way forward for BIDs is doubly telling.</p>

Currently, they are exempt from paying any BID levy. Many property owners have contributed voluntarily to BIDs. Other property owners benefit from the activities of BIDs but do not contribute to them. The Bill represents an opportunity to rectify this imbalance. Also this measure would be a helpful way of ameliorating the impact of the BRS on BIDs by spreading the levy across a wider pool of payers.&#148;</p>

Members will understand from my presentation, which has gone on for too long already&#151;this is complex territory. On reflection, I came to the conclusion that the Mayor&#146;s letter probably owed quite a lot to the input of his chief of staff, the former leader of Westminster city council, who is not only an expert on local government, but was the leader of the council which has, I think, the largest number of BIDs of any authority in the country. Therefore, he is fairly expert in this matter.</p>

 I have been following the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks to the best of my ability. When business owners are consulted about a new BID proposal, do they have to give a unanimously positive response, or does there need to be a positive response from a certain proportion of those approached? What does &#147;majority&#148; mean, if there is to be a majority vote? If the proportions are 49 per cent. to 51 per cent. will the scheme go ahead?</p>

 The procedure is the same as the one that applies to the property occupiers ballot. There has to be a numerical majority among the occupiers in the areas who will be liable to the levy and there has to be a majority according to the rateable value, too. It is a double key ballot that requires a majority on both counts before the levy can be imposed. That has worked extremely well with BIDs and it is strongly recommended by the business interests that are supporting the new clause as a similar safeguard for property owners to that which exists for property occupiers.</p>

hon. Friend the Minister, if he is unable to accept it here and now, will be able to give us assurances that the Government will be prepared to amend the Bill in the other place to give effect to the intentions of the clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="90311-0010.htm_para3"><a name="09031165001125">I accept entirely that details are needed about how the ballot and the dual-key safeguards will apply in practice. Complex issues will need to be clarified before the property owner levy can be introduced. We touched on several of those issues in the meeting that my right hon. Friend the Minister set up last week with the interested parties from BIDs and the British Property Federation. Dr. Julie Grail of British BIDs has prepared a very helpful paper on the subject. I accept her judgment that none of the details is a show-stopper and I feel confident that they can be dealt with in regulations to avoid any delay in incorporating the principle of a permissive property owner levy in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90311-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09031165001126">We also have the experience of Scotland, where a property owner levy has been implemented as an option as part of the BIDs scheme. As British BIDs has pointed out, only two of the Scottish BIDs have chosen to apportion the levy between owners and occupiers, which reinforces the case for allowing the greatest flexibility in how the scheme is implemented area by area.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon.

Like hon. Members from all parties, I am grateful for the care that he has taken to outline the issue. It is necessarily complex and somewhat technical and, ironically, it is a good demonstration of how regrettable it is that we are constrained by the programme motion that was passed earlier. This one element of the Bill will take up a considerable part of Report, but that is necessary so we can get our heads around the detail.</p>

This issue was flagged up to the Government at an early stage and they need to address it: how will we deal with the potential interaction of BIDs and the BRS in a way that does not place an undue burden on businesses? Some of us would perhaps not start from this point, but if we have that interaction we need at the very least to try to ameliorate the situation to the greatest possible degree. That is the issue that I want to see addressed.</p>

There is a lot more detail that we probably need to explore, and that might need to be done elsewhere, but I hope that the Government will respond seriously to the proposal.

through the total revenue take being increased through the back door or through some failure to pass on in practice, regardless of any good intentions, the offset of the owner levy to ameliorate and reduce the bid that comes down to the occupiers. If those concerns can be met, the proposal warrants consideration.</p>

 Is that not the danger? In this climate, when there will be very little private finance for such schemes, will it not be very tempting for the BID organisations to say, &#147;We can find another bunch of people and companies that have to pay too&#148; and to simply ask for more money from the levy because they will get less money from elsewhere?</p>

 That is precisely the risk. It concerns me with regard not only to the new clause but to the Bill in general. Local authorities as well the promoting bodies of BIDs will be tempted always to go down that route. It might be possible, with good will and work from all parties, for a solution to be found. I get the impression that the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich will not press his proposal to a vote today, but I hope that what I have said is of some help in concentrating minds on finding a way forward.</p>

 Does my hon.

Like my hon. Friend, I am a great supporter of BIDs.</p>

 My hon. Friend highlights one of the conundrums that the Government have created in their handling of this matter. I am prepared to learn from experience and see the advantage of BIDs. Given that we have a ballot for BIDs but do not have a guaranteed ballot for the BRS, the accumulation of the BRS plus BIDs plus other costs will ratchet up a fear factor and will also cause businesses to wonder where they can take some steps to cut costs, and because they cannot vote against the BRS they will vote against the BID. That will be a shame, because the BID will often be a desirable and worthwhile project. I think that the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich takes that point on board and we are all looking for a means to prevent that from happening. Perhaps it is work in progress at the moment, but that is why I have made sympathetic noises without committing to the detail. Avoiding the perverse incentive mentioned by my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90311-0010.htm_para9"><a name="09031165001137">As was said at the beginning of the debate, there has been a conflict in the minds of business people who have been asked to consider whether they should support an ongoing BID in their area or whether they should be part of putting together a new BID when there is the prospect&#151;as there is in London&#151;of a supplementary business rate being levied, too. It has been clear to me from discussions that I have had with representative business organisations that the sort of approach that the right hon. Gentleman wants to take and that he is encouraging the Government to adopt represents a way forward. The British Property Federation, the representative organisation of the people whom right hon. and hon. Members are seeking to protect&#151;that is, property owners&#151;has been keen to point out that it supports this way forward. That reassures me, as I am sure it does other Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90311-0010.htm_para10"><a name="09031165001138">Inevitably, because we are not talking about legislation to revisit BIDs and widen their scope, the new clause is limited in scope. Therefore, I return to what I said in my earlier intervention on the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich: the proposal does not allow us to address the formation of new bids. As a result, there is a disincentive for a BID to be successful in the ballot and that would be unfortunate for the areas involved if they are also facing the prospect of a BRS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="90311-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09031165001139">When the Minister responds, I hope that he will explore these matters in more detail. Although my party supports the concept of a supplementary business rate where a ballot has been held to determine local approval&#151;an issue to which I hope to return in respect of a later set of amendments&#151;we would regret anything that called into question the benefits of a positive BID process, which will help a local area&#146;s residents generally, as well as its visitors, business community and property owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90311-0010.htm_para12"><a name="09031165001140">For those reasons, my party supports what the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich is trying to do.

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90311-0010.htm_para13"><a name="09031165001142">I think that the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich is trying to paper over some cracks with this proposal. As a Minister, he was the architect and sponsor of the BIDs scheme, which has met with quite a lot of approval in the places that it has affected. It has been used in areas with councils of different political persuasions, often to good effect. However, he sees the danger that the supplementary levy will hit exactly the same people who are financing the BIDs scheme, at a time when the world has changed dramatically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="90311-0010.htm_para14"><a name="09031165001143">I am afraid that the Minister has to deal with the very important point that all these schemes&#151;the BIDs idea, the supplementary levy and some of the other ideas that the Government have floated and not proceeded with&#151;rested on the heroic assumptions that rents and property values would go up and that most properties would find tenants very easily. The idea was to try to capture, for the public sector and the common weal, some of the enhanced value that the private sector seems to create so easily. The aim, through the variation of levies and betterment charges and so on, was that some of the gain could be shared, as well as to provide public infrastructure and support to the glamorous private sector developments that were going ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="90311-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09031165001144">This is not the place to debate all that again. Indeed, I do not think that we can have that sort of debate any more anyway, because that is no longer what the real world is like. In today&#146;s real world, there will be fewer tenants and more void properties. Rentals are falling and could fall a lot further, while commercial property values have fallen some 30 per cent. from their peak and many experts feel that they will fall further. That is not a good background for doubling charges, and the proposed scheme looks like one that might have been designed by a firm called Clobber and Clobber. That is, an area is clobbered first of all with a BID, and then again with the supplementary levy.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is making his case very powerfully, and he is right to say that there was a sense that things would go from good to even better over the years ahead. However, does he agree that there is at least some mileage in the notion of value capture? Although I think that it is right for Opposition Members to stand up for our much-beleaguered business sector just now, does he accept that there is a risk that we are failing to put in place something that could be of use in the upturn? Provided that there are the safeguards that we have discussed, especially in relation to balloting, might not an idea such as the business rate supplement be the right way to find elements of the funding that will be needed as the economy moves out of recession, not least because of the value capture to which he and I have referred? I must add that I probably share his fears that the recession and downturn are likely to be part of the economic tableau before us for quite some time to come.</p>

levy. He has rightly seen that introducing the levy in the same area as a BID would amount to a double whammy, or something from Clobber and Clobber, as I have just described it. He has rightly asked himself, &#147;How do I ameliorate that?&#148; He has produced a positive suggestion, but within a framework in which the Government wish to take the risk of upping the tax burden in these difficult areas at a time when the business community is flat on its back.</p>

His suggestion has the agreement of most property owners, although quite a lot of important ones do not necessarily support it. In his ideal world, the tenants would have an abated total cost. They would still have a much bigger total cost, because they would have to pay the supplement imposed by the Bill as well as the BID, but there would be an abatement.</p>

Before I could possibly support the proposal, however, I would need to be satisfied that there would not be leakage in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst suggested. My understanding is that a lot of local authorities, as soon as they see another group of people liable to pay a levy, will not decide that that allows them to cut the levy paid by someone else. Instead, they will think, &#147;Whoopee! We can have a bigger levy! We have broadened the tax base and so we can have a bigger scheme.&#148;</p>

However, we now discover that the private sector banks have been largely nationalised and cannot make the money available, and that the private sector players no longer have the profits to do so. As a result, we have to make good the shortfall&#151;the amount that the private sector can no longer provide&#151;out of public moneys. What a good idea the right hon.

However, at the risk of starting another debate about his view of how local government operates&#151;as opposed to the one expressed by other hon. Members, especially the hon. Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)&#151;I venture to suggest that the BID process is slightly different. The organisations operating the BID, which would therefore decide how an offset would work, include bodies apart from just the local authority. As the right hon.

Gentleman will accept that the local authority often starts with an important role in a BID organisation, or comes to play such a role, because it has the necessary public funding and staff. Local authorities in that situation are in some ways the continuity people. When the private sector is in a state of financial haemorrhage and collapse, it loses time, confidence, money and power in the BID organisations. Proportionally, the power and confidence of the public sector rises, and that is what is happening very visibly at the moment.</p>

 When the BIDs were introduced, some people in the business community expressed the fear that local authorities would simply substitute business contributions for their expenditure. I am pleased to say that actual practice on the ground has shown the business community to be pretty canny, on the whole. Its members vote in favour of BIDs only when they have been reassured by the local authority that it will continue and in some cases enhance its contributions to those areas. I would expect there to be a similar positive and constructive dialogue between the two parties in the context of the owners levy that I am proposing.</p>

 I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman is right; he has more experience of BIDs than I do. There are many examples of such good practice, but I think that he would concede that what I am saying is possible. I am not saying that it would be a typical experience; I am sure that there will still be many good BIDs and that the business communities will stay fully engaged in many places, but he should not underestimate how much stuffing is being knocked out of the business community by the day-to-day pressures on cash flow, the collapse of turnover and the difficulty in getting access to banking facilities. That is sometimes going to make even the best of intentions among the business community difficult to carry through. Businesses simply will not have the time to do these things, let alone the cash, or the intellectual self-confidence, given the recent very destructive few months, which have hit them badly.</p>

 I want to elaborate a little on what I said in an earlier intervention, and I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to this point. Let us take Ilford as a prime example in relation to these measures. A BID scheme has been proposed, and Crossrail will also be coming to, and bringing great benefit to, Ilford. I fully support both projects, but some members of the community might not understand these proposals. They were eloquently explained by the right hon.

 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) for tabling this new clause. I pay tribute to him for the way in which he has prepared his case and pursued it, and not least for the way in which he has marshalled an impressively wide range of support for his proposal.

Friend&#146;s essential role in introducing the legislation that enabled business improvement districts to be established. Despite the reservations of some Opposition Members at that time, we have now had several years&#146; experience of BIDs. There are more than 70 up and running in different parts of the country and I am happy to say that there is now all-party support for them, both here and in local government. The last thing we want to do is to undermine BIDs through the introduction of the BRS. The Bill enables authorities introducing a BRS to offset a BID liability against the BRS. This approach was based on our overall approach to the BRS. BRS is a new discretionary power for authorities to use, and it is consistent to allow the authorities to decide whether to use an automatic offset for BID payments, according to the needs of their area.</p>

Even the chief executive of British BIDs, Dr. Julie Grail, made it clear that she was not necessarily advocating them. In our debates about offsetting, and in our general debates about the value of BIDs, it has become clear that offsetting might not be the only solution. It is also clear that there is some merit in involving property owners in business improvement districts on more than a voluntary basis. That case has been made again, in great detail, by my right hon. Friend this afternoon, and it is backed not only by BIDs but by leading organisations representing property owners, including the British Property Federation. It is also supported by the operation of exactly this arrangement in two areas of Scotland, where property owners are involved in BIDs in this way.</p>

 We return now to the issue that has been fairly central to some of the earlier discussion of the Bill&#151;its extent. My amendment replicates one that gave rise to a major debate in Committee. We contend that in the current circumstances the introduction of a nationwide power to levy what is calculated, on any view, to be the better part of a &#163;600 million potential tax burden on businesses is inappropriate and likely to be damaging to the overall interests of the economy. This is not to do with the overall intellectual arguments for or against business rate supplements; the fact is that often in politics practical timing is a key consideration. For reasons that were well rehearsed on Second Reading and in Committee, we believe that there is a real risk that local authorities will feel pressured to resort to this as a means of raising funding right across the board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="90311-0011.htm_para16"><a name="09031165001178">An exception to that relates to the Crossrail project in London. The amendment would limit the scope of the Bill to London&#151;to the Greater London Authority, the top-tier authority, which it is proposed, together with its functional bodies, will carry out the Crossrail project. The amendment would limit the scope to Crossrail because the Mayor of London, who was prayed in aid in the debate on an earlier group of amendments, has made it clear that although he wishes to be given the power to levy a supplementary business rate in relation to Crossrail, he does not intend to use it other than for Crossrail, purely on the basis of saying, &#147;Let&#146;s get Crossrail going.&#148;</p>

However, there are differences between the Crossrail project and a nationwide roll-out of the scheme.</p>

 I would be grateful if the hon.

 The answer is, in fact, none of those things, as the hon. Lady might have discerned. Crossrail is a project where the funding package was agreed before the delivery of this Bill. There is a political consensus on Crossrail in London because the funding package, including the proposal to levy a supplementary business rate to fund an element of it, was announced back in October 2007 in advance of the last London  <br>

mayoral elections. It was well debated and well aired in London, where there was a clear consensus of view that it was a desirable way ahead. All the principal candidates in London had stood on the platform of supporting Crossrail and the funding package&#151;certainly the candidates from all three major parties, and I think the Greens as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90311-0011.htm_para18"><a name="09031165001182">First, then, the proposal was well established. Secondly&#151;let us be practical about these things&#151;the deal was done, and unpicking the funding package would put the project at risk, and I do not intend to do anything that would put it at risk. That is a world away from taking a specific done deal, as the Government have done through this Bill instead of enacting a simple Crossrail enabling or financing Bill to deal with that one project and using that as an opportunity to roll out a nationwide project by stealth. That raises the prospect of significant increases in the tax burden on authorities that have nothing to do with Crossrail and are in different circumstances, and where some of the other tests that should apply to ensure that there is sign-up do not as yet apply.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will be aware, because he has referred to this already, that the genesis of the business rate supplement was in the Lyons review. When Sir Michael Lyons considered this, he was well aware of Crossrail. He did not recommend that this should be a specific funding mechanism solely for Crossrail, he recommended but that a business rate supplement should be available throughout the country. Why is the hon. Gentleman departing from Sir Michael Lyons&#146;s recommendation?</p>

 Because in the current circumstances it would be wrong to do so. I will adopt, if the right hon. Gentleman likes, a classically Keynesian argument&#151;when the facts change, I change my opinion; that was the view of John Maynard Keynes. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) set out the facts very eloquently. It is not realistic, in the current economic climate, to place further tax burdens on businesses save in the most exceptional circumstances. I am prepared to regard Crossrail as an exceptional circumstance because of its national impact and the fact that there has been very significant debate beforehand. That does not apply elsewhere. For the reasons that have been well set out by my right hon. and hon. Friends, the inevitable cost pressures placed on local authorities in the current climate mean that this will be used as an additional form of revenue-raising regardless of the economic needs, and nobody desires that. That is why virtually all the business organisations have real concerns at the roll-out of a nationwide project as opposed to Crossrail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90311-0011.htm_para19"><a name="09031165001185">The simple fact is that the world has moved on since it was thought that one could move fairly readily into the type of scheme that we are talking about. Under certain, different circumstances, and if carefully rehearsed, the scheme might be deliverable, but at the moment, if we embarked on a broad roll-out, it would, in our judgment, send exactly the wrong signals for business confidence. In the case of Crossrail, the issues are well rehearsed, and have been dealt with well.</p>

Notwithstanding the fact that he has had reassurances from the Mayor of London that the power would not be used for any project other than Crossrail, is there not some concern on our side that central Government may decide, on the basis that London is included in the Bill and everywhere else is not, that no big infrastructure projects whatever will be funded by central Government? Might there not be an expectation that the funding would have to come from those powers? Perhaps, therefore, we ought to be even more specific about the fact that the powers relate to one specific project, rather than to one geographical area.</p>

 That point may be taken up elsewhere. My hon. Friend highlights an issue that underlines the fact that right, across the piece and in a number of areas, there has been a shifting of burdens from central Government to local government in one form or another. There may sometimes be arguments for that, but let us be honest about it. What we are really seeing is the potential for economic development moneys to be moved away from the central Exchequer to local residents and businesses.</p>

Friend&#146;s point is reinforced by an interesting juxtaposition, which is perhaps wholly coincidental, although I do not think so. The Bill proposes giving local authorities right across the country the power to raise revenue from business for economic development purposes, and at the same time there has been a massive cut to the funding made available by central Government for the local authority business growth incentive scheme, which has been absolutely emasculated. It is interesting that the Treasury took away that money. The inevitable unwritten message was: &#147;Sorry, local authorities; if you want those schemes to go ahead, you&#146;ll have to raise the money from your businesses, rather than getting it from us.&#148; That is ultimately a stealth tax, yet again.</p>

 Does my hon.

Does my hon. Friend not agree that that only goes to show that the issue had nothing to do with party politics? The view was taken across the board.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. There were moments when the previous Mayor of London had flashes of insight with which I agreed. He genuinely attempted to hold his hand out to the business community. He was right to say that Crossrail was a one-off; it is a one-off, because of its scale and complexity, the sums that have to be raised, and its implications.

It gives a power to impose tax, but that is coupled with a reduction in central Government funding. It is a nudge, nudge, wink, wink suggestion whereby Government are saying to local government, &#147;We can&#146;t provide funding any more because, thanks to the current Prime Minister, the national coffers are empty. You instead impose the cost of these desirable projects on to your businesses and your residents.&#148; That is what it is about, and that is why Labour Members protest so much&#151;they know that they have been found out.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right, as ever. I note his long service in local government and the practical job that he did as portfolio-holder for finance in his county council, when he attempted to deliver value for money for people in Northamptonshire.

 Very easily. I did not use the word &#147;cap&#148;. I said that what was required was a guarantee that the offset would be translated in practice. That is a very different concept, as the right hon. Gentleman knows.</p>

 It was a good try by the right hon. Gentleman, as well, but it did not quite come off. The simple fact is that those are two different concepts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90311-0012.htm_para0"><a name="09031165001204">The Government have chosen to use a settled agreement in relation to one part of the country to impose burdens which, in the current financial climate&#151;that point must be emphasised&#151;have the potential to do real damage, rather than doing good. The Government did not necessarily mean that to happen, but it is a consequence of the financial mess that the Government are in nationally that they seek to transfer those burdens, and it would be a classic example of the law of unintended consequences that arises with so much legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="90311-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09031165001205">We want Crossrail to proceed. The best means to do that would have been to separate that off so that we could have had a separate debate on a more timely and relaxed basis about the appropriateness of rolling out BRS as a concept elsewhere in the country. That would have given us more time to consider the serious issues that the right hon. Gentleman raised, to which I hope we will still return. Nothing that has happened since has changed my view. That approach would have enabled Crossrail to proceed on a discrete and timely basis. I hope that we will take the amendment forward.</p>

 I hugely enjoyed the speech made by the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) as he tried to dance around the reason for his party&#146;s line on this issue. The Conservatives are finding it difficult to keep a straight face. As we all know, this is about the fact that Boris Johnson is the Tory Mayor of London, that London is of vast importance to the Tories&#151;it is also vastly important to us, of course&#151;and that they do not want to risk a ballot in case it went wrong for them. I do not think that it would, but they do not want to take the risk, because they could be seen as the people who scuppered Crossrail, which I accept is of immense importance to London and to the nation as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90311-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09031165001207">As the Minister who introduced Crossrail to the House, I was convinced of the argument for it. Obviously, it involves a significant amount of money. We would like more of that money up in the north, but I accept the reason for it. Like the hon. Gentleman, I am proud of my time as a councillor: I spent 16 years as one on my local authority. I appreciate that time and how it has influenced what I have done in Parliament. However, there is a clear bias here: it is okay for London, but not for the north. The argument seems to be that no scheme elsewhere in the country&#151;I speak particularly from the point of view of the north-west&#151;could qualify for such an exemption because it would not be on the scale of Crossrail. I find that argument bizarre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90311-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09031165001208">The other argument is that things are too far down the road for them to change, that all the work has been done before and that there should therefore not be a ballot. That cuts no ice with me. I do not understand the argument, because it clearly does not stack up. I come back to the point that the issue is that there is a Tory Mayor and that the scheme is so crucial that the Conservatives do not want any risk to it. They are therefore prepared to forgo the principle for which they have been arguing in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="st_o205"><a name="09031165002206"><a name="90311-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="09031165004410"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Michael Lord):</b>

 I welcome the degree of interest in the Third Reading expressed by those on the Government Benches. The level of serious scrutiny given to the Bill by Members from all parties is very welcome and is important to the House. We have benefited from the contributions of Members representing areas in the north and the south, Members representing both rural and urban constituencies and, indeed, those from London and from well beyond it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="90311-0013.htm_para4"><a name="09031165002208">The Bill introduces a discretionary power for upper-level local authorities and, in London, the Greater London Authority to levy a limited supplement to the business rate to fund projects intended to promote economic development. We are not imposing a new business tax; we are introducing a new power to allow local authorities&#151;with serious safeguards for business&#151;to raise some of the money that they need to boost their local economies. London is a leading example of that principle, and of the purpose of the new power. The business rate supplement in London will enable the Mayor to make good his commitment to an essential part of the funding package and allow Crossrail to go ahead. It will boost recovery in this part of the country and long-term growth in London.</p>

 I have only just begun my speech, but I will give way.</p>

<p><a name="st_o209"><a name="09031165002211"><a name="90311-0013.htm_spnew5"><a name="09031165004414"><b>Angela Watkinson:</b>
 That is generous of the Minister. I wanted to comment specifically on what he has just said about London. As he will know, the circumstances of the 32 London boroughs vary enormously. I am sure that outer- London borough councils such as Havering&#151;which has received a central Government grant of &#163;240 per head, compared with the average of &#163;526 per head&#151;will be tempted by the prospect of raising additional funds through the supplementary rate. The financial circumstances of such councils are very different from the circumstances of the councils in the west end of London to which the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) referred earlier, with their prosperous businesses. The outer-London boroughs tend to contain very small businesses.</p>

<p><a name="st_o210"><a name="09031165002212"><a name="90311-0013.htm_spnew6"><a name="09031165004415"><b>John Healey:</b>
 The hon. Lady is right to say that the circumstances of the London boroughs vary, but she may have missed what I said immediately before I gave way to her. In London, the authority with the power to levy the business rate supplement will be the GLA, not the London borough councils. This will not be a choice, or a power, that is exercisable by the hon. Lady&#146;s own London borough council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90311-0013.htm_para5"><a name="09031165002213">I recognise that the present difficult economic period makes it much harder for the House to deal with legislation of this kind, but it should also be recognised that, during such difficult financial times, there is a risk that investment and major projects will be sidelined because of short-term concerns. There is also a risk that we will retreat to a centralism that removes local discretion and flexibility, particularly when tough choices need to be made. Furthermore, there is a risk that we will not establish the powers and policies relating to skills, regeneration and worklessness that will be necessary both to see us through the current downturn and, more important, to enable us to make the most of the upturn that will follow.</p>

 Opposition Members have made the important point that businesses are under considerable pressure and stress and strain at present. We all know that that is the case because of what we see in our constituencies and the figures that we see in the newspapers every day. However&#151;this is a point that I made repeatedly in Committee&#151;are not local authorities an important part of the solution, and are they not also under great pressure in having to meet the extra demands being made of them? They are well aware of the pressures on business, and they are providing additional services to help people. It should be recognised that, because of the stresses and strains that they are experiencing, local authorities want to work in partnership with business rather than imposing extra burdens on it.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. He has made the same point at several stages during the Bill&#146;s progress. However, the Bill builds on a strong existing working relationship between local authorities and local businesses. My hon. Friend may recall that during one of the evidence sessions the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, David Frost, told us that</p>
<a name="90311-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="09031165002407"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;relationships between chambers of commerce and local authorities are extraordinarily strong&#148;.</p>

Such projects can contribute to the economic recovery and, more important, to the future long-term growth of areas, but it will take time for them to develop. If we are to channel investment to support the upturn and the success that will follow it, we need to make preparations now. Difficult as it is for the House to deal with the Bill at this time, it is part of the foundation for that upturn.</p>

Local authorities will work with their local businesses to create projects and to examine whether the BRS may form part of the funding for those. As I have said, that will build on the strong relationships between local authorities and local businesses.</p>

 We had a thorough discussion in Committee, but I still have a question about eligibility to vote on BRS schemes and whether the regulations might give local authorities flexibility to allow businesses that actually pay rates to participate, rather than those that are simply liable to pay a charge. On Second Reading, I used the example of a local Conservative councillor who operates three public houses in Newcastle-under-Lyme and who, over six years, has avoided paying business rates. He has not been disciplined in any way. The council does not respond to freedom of information requests but it has confirmed to me that, yet again, his businesses are substantially in arrears. Quite apart from the fact that an elected representative should set an example, my question is whether, in those circumstances, the regulations might give local authorities the discretion to say &#147;You will not be able to participate and therefore influence a BRS scheme if you do not pay your business rates.&#148;</p>

 Action by any business tax payer deliberately to avoid payment of the business taxes that they are legally liable to pay is a disgrace. When they fail to pay the taxes they are legally liable to pay, others have to make good that shortfall. Therefore, by doing that, they are spreading the burden of taxation on to others who can and will pay, rather than those who can pay but will not.</p>

We have built into the Bill a series of safeguards for business. For example, no business with a rateable value of less than &#163;50,000 will be liable for a BRS. Any local authority that is looking to introduce a BRS can make that threshold higher and more generous still. There is also a requirement for statutory consultation with all affected business rate payers and ballots will be held if a BRS exceeds more than a third of the total cost of a project. Any authority that may levy a BRS also has the discretion to introduce a taper above the &#163;50,000 threshold and to phase in a BRS over a number of years. In addition, if it thinks it appropriate, it has the discretion to exempt empty properties from a BRS.</p>

 The Minister is generous in giving way and it is appreciated. He referred to the &#163;50,000 rateable value limit, but the Bill does not come into effect until April 2010, by which time we should have had a revaluation. I wonder whether he will give hope to small businesses by saying today that he would be willing to look at that figure, because if he does not, many more small businesses could be brought into the net.</p>

 In effect, nine out of 10 businesses fall below a rateable value threshold of &#163;50,000. If the hon. Gentleman has small businesses in mind, it is highly likely that they will be below rather than above that threshold. There is merit in consistency. We have set the minimum threshold at &#163;50,000 and have been consistent on that. We are allowing local levying authorities to set a higher threshold if they wish and if the terms of the scheme suggest that that is right. Once that is in place and operating, there may be a case for looking at how it is working, including the question of the threshold. But it is important to be able to get this in place with a degree of certainty so that businesses can look ahead and know whether or not they are likely to be liable to pay the business rate supplement if, indeed, one is proposed for their area.</p>

 The Minister cannot tell me what the average rateable value will be and we know that the revaluation will be based on the peak property prices in early 2008. Also, rateable values descend as we move out from town centres. Many independent retail businesses in valuable properties in town centres are struggling to survive at the moment, so the level of the rateable value threshold is vital to them.</p>

 I was reminded of the earlier observations by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) about the insidiousness of timetable motions.

As always, it has been a pleasure for Front-Bench Members on both sides to interact on the Bill. That said, we remain unpersuaded that the particular situation of Crossrail justifies the roll-out of a power&#151;albeit a discretionary one&#151;elsewhere in the country. The particular economic circumstances make that especially inappropriate at this time.

combination with the other burdens on business: the possibility of community infrastructure levies; in some local authorities, the possibility of congestion charging; and the possibility of workplace parking levies, which have to be taken into account in relation to BID levies. All of those together can create a potentially threatening mixture of burdens for firms in a difficult time. That is why we have concerns about the timing of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90311-0013.htm_para13"><a name="09031165002229">I am not at all against giving local authorities incentives to assist in the generation of economic development. That is why I think it is ironic that we are introducing this discretionary power to charge businesses more at the same time as the Government have reduced drastically the funding available to the local authority business growth incentive scheme. That juxtaposition causes many of us to be very cynical about the ultimate motivation, particularly behind the Treasury&#146;s approach to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90311-0013.htm_para14"><a name="09031165002230">Many businesses are struggling at present, and there are missed opportunities in that this Bill could have embraced measures to try to improve their situation. If there is to be a discretionary power to levy a business rate supplement, why not also use the Bill as an opportunity to give a discretionary power to levy a business rate discount? That would have won support in all parts of the House, and I am sad that that opportunity to bring some relief in areas of difficulty was not taken.</p>

Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) pointed out, it is a pity, too, that opportunities have not been taken to address problems arising from a possible revaluation that may be based on data that are significantly out of date and out of alignment with the current and future economic situation. It would also have been useful if we had taken the opportunity to make small business rate relief automatic, and taken on board the proposals in the private Member&#146;s Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), especially as when the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan), replied to it on Friday, what he said suggested there was some sympathy for it. There is a sadness, therefore, in that this Bill could have done much more to address the needs of small businesses, but it instead focused on the national roll-out of a scheme that we do not think is appropriate for current circumstances.</p>

I note in particular the new clause of the right hon.

Sadly, however, given the time restriction, we were not able to have a debate about ballots, which is where we part company with the Government, as the Minister knows, because we believe that a ballot should be held in all circumstances.</p>

However, we believe that local businesses ought to have more to say through a ballot and that they ought to have greater involvement in the administration of a project through whatever means the Government come up with. Of course, I should put on record the fact that my party supports Crossrail, although that has been almost a separate debate. For that reason, as well as because of our agreement with the principle behind the Bill, even if we have grave doubts about its operation in its current form, we will not oppose it at this stage and we will allow our noble Friends further to consider it.</p>

 I want to make a brief speech to finish what I was saying before the last vote. First, I completely support what my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench have said. They have been extremely good at listening to the arguments, taking on board the concerns, ensuring that there are safeguards in the Bill and listening to ideas about how they can further those safeguards. I congratulate them on that.</p>

I listened to what the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce and other business representatives had to say in the Committee hearings and they made some strong points, but I was left with a disappointing overall view that we still do not trust local government. My experience on the ground does not match up with that. In my area I see a great deal of partnership working and working together to try to deal with the issues that challenge businesses and local communities, and I know that that happens in other areas, too.</p>

That means that the local authorities, with business and the wider community, should work together. I am arguing that local government has come a long way. It often takes the lead in regeneration and economic development and I am disappointed that the Opposition do not trust it. We should put more trust in it, given its track record and the enormous strides that it has made in economic development. Of course, the power is an enabling power. We are not saying that local government has to do anything and that is crucial to remember.</p>

I do not support a veto. I believe that what my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government said provides plenty of safeguards. Local government is vibrant and it has taken the lead in some difficult times. It is under additional pressures today, and I believe that it will do the right thing and work with business to bring forward the best possible schemes, which are sensible and logical, to help their areas.</p>

The notion of marching thugs to cash points was revised after only a few days to a recognition that the proper response had to be based on a fixed-penalty notice regime. Now, however, penalty notices do not apply simply to disorder. One would think that there was a clue in the title&#151;after all, they are penalty notices for disorder&#151;but the notices have been expanded to cover offences that go beyond what we would traditionally call disorder. They now apply to theft and other offences, including the possession of cannabis. It is the latter offence that is the main focus of this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90311-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09031165002252">The list of offences covered by notices could well have been longer than the one in part 1 of the schedule to the order. The Government originally intended to add 21 further offences, including making off without payment and taxi touting. Was it that the Government changed the list only after careful consideration, to leave us eventually with the revised order now before us? No, it was not: the list was revised only after an uproar from representative associations that had not been consulted properly. I understand that there was also a conversation between the Justice Secretary and the Mayor of London the weekend before the order was due to be considered in Committee. It was those steps that led the Government to think again.</p>

I draw the circumvention of normal process to the attention of the House to highlight the Government&#146;s ham-fisted approach to that aspect of delegated legislation, and to expose the dangers of increasing out-of-court disposals.</p>

Across England and Wales, in the 12 months to last March, only 724,179 of the 1.4 million offenders &#147;brought to justice&#148;, as Government-speak would have it, actually came before the courts. This has been described in various forums as &#147;justice in secret&#148;, and as &#147;duff justice&#148; in a leader in <i> The Times</i> not so long ago. I would describe the practice as leading to soft justice. The House does not need to take my word for that, however. John Thornhill, chairman of the Magistrates Association, has said:</p>

The situation came to light last August, when a letter was sent to all the magistrates in the county by the justices&#146; clerk. It highlights the consequences of the increasing use of on-the-spot fines. It says:</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman will have to be patient if he wants to hear our position on fixed penalty notices. They certainly have a place. If penalty notices for disorderly behaviour did exactly what it says on the tin, and were issued only for minor acts of antisocial behaviour, as originally intended, we could see a rationale for them. However, we must challenge the Government over the way in which that rationale has been extended to cover additional offences, including the possession of cannabis.</p>

However, I strongly differentiate those minor matters from offences such as possession of cannabis or theft, which are potentially very serious.</p>

 We can certainly draw that distinction. A case that recently came into the public eye was that of Ashley Cole, who was arrested for being drunk and disorderly and was fined &#163;80. No doubt he was more affected by the &#163;160,000 fine imposed by his club, but that area of offending illustrates the suitability of penalty notices, as their use no doubt relieves the burden on police time and helps all concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90311-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09031165002260">A wholly different situation pertains in regard to other offences, however. Magistrates have contacted me, and the Magistrates Association has stated forcefully that there is ever-increasing scope for the notices to be used beyond their original remits. There is certainly a worry that they are being used more for administrative convenience than for the purpose of ensuring that justice is done and seen to be done. We know that it can be done properly in the magistrates courts, where summary justice should take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90311-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09031165002261">The burden on courts has been mentioned, but we should not assume that the expansion of the use of penalty notices will lead to a reduction of the burden on magistrates. The administrative burden is still there. Approximately half of all penalty notices for disorder are unpaid, and it is the magistrates who have to follow those cases through to try to enforce the payment of those unpaid fines. That is particularly relevant to this statutory instrument, and to the related instrument that the Delegated Legislation Committee considered in January. The explanatory memorandum to that statutory instrument stated that the costs of enforcement may be in the order of &#163;1.5 million by year 3. On 22 January I asked the Minister for an assurance that the overstretched court budgets would be able properly to enforce the expansion of the penalty notice for disorder regime to cannabis. I repeat that question today and hope that there will be an answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90311-0014.htm_para15"><a name="09031165002262">The Government say that penalty notices for disorder are an appropriate penalty for possession of cannabis. They say, as the Minister did on 22 January, that they are an extra weapon in the police&#146;s armoury. They talk belatedly about being tough on cannabis, now recognising, as Conservative Members have all along, that cannabis is a harmful drug, and increasingly so given the high potency of the skunk varieties that are on our streets. They talk about wanting such possession to be robustly enforced. However, what is the reality behind this talk? Let us be clear that the use of fixed penalty notices for cannabis possession and the attraction, under the order, of a penalty of &#163;80, is not a tough sanction. It leads to no criminal liability, and there is no admission of guilt and no criminal record.</p>

magistrates court. Earlier today, my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) introduced a ten-minute Bill that outlined the prevalence of shoplifting and the importance of its being dealt with other than as at present, whereby shoplifters, on repeat offending, are given penalty notices, which does not satisfy the victim and certainly does not satisfy justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="90311-0014.htm_para17"><a name="09031165002266">Year by year, the Government have often treated criminal justice legislation as a messaging service when they want to sound tough, and it is no different in relation to cannabis. However, let us look at what enforcement really means. Often, the fixed penalty notice and &#163;80 penalty is imposed not on an offender coming to the attention of the police for the first time but on a repeat offender. The Government have introduced what could be termed a &#147;three strikes&#148; policy for cannabis possession: strike 1 is the warning, strike 2 is the fixed penalty notice, and strike 3 is the arrest. However, the police will often struggle even to get beyond strike 1 because warnings are not being recorded. In previous discussions, the Minister herself has accepted that the position in many areas is hit and miss. With that first strike, we are in the realms of hit and miss. It does not give much confidence that the possession of cannabis will be dealt with robustly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="90311-0014.htm_para18"><a name="09031165002267">The computer system&#151;PentiP&#151;is not in place to be able to deal with the regime that the statutory instrument would have us enforce. It was due to be introduced in September 2009, at a cost of &#163;9.3 million&#151;an amount that has increased, as ever with such systems, to &#163;19.3 million. We now have an indication that implementation will not take place until May 2012, yet in the recent debate the Minister said that the implementation date would be 2010. I ask the Minister once again to provide some reassurance on the implementation date of the computer system, because it is crucial that the warning be recorded if there is to be effective enforcement of the three-strike policy; otherwise, people can run up multiple warnings before a fixed penalty notice is deemed appropriate. Even if a person gets past the first and second strikes, let us not forget what we are left with at the third strike. It would effectively be a third offence, and would lead to arrest. That could involve prosecution, and the case could eventually go to the magistrates court, but it could simply mean a caution, or indeed no further action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="90311-0014.htm_para19"><a name="09031165002268">I do not wish to dwell today on the reclassification of cannabis; we have been consistent on that subject. The question for debate today is why, for possession of cannabis, enforcement should take the form of an &#163;80 fixed penalty notice. Is that decision based on the prevalence of the drug? Is that why cannabis is to attract a fixed penalty notice? If that is the case, why does the policy not extend to ketamine, a class C drug that is increasingly becoming the drug of choice for young people? Is there a risk that the penalty notice for disorder regime will be extended to other drugs? Can the Minister provide a specific assurance that there will not be such an extension to other drugs, whether they be class B or class C? Would issues of prevalence, or any evidence that disorder was affected by the possession of drugs, lead to fixed penalty notice enforcement?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90311-0014.htm_para20"><a name="09031165002269">The problem with the statutory instrument is that there is a lack of evidence on the effect of the penalty notice for disorder.

doubt it relieves the police of some paperwork and saves some time. However, what is the evidence that it deters offenders and ensures that justice is done? The Magistrates Association has called on the Government to gather and publish evidence, and I invite the Minister to take up that call and to say where the evidence is to justify the expansion in penalty notices for disorder. Have the Government considered the efficacy of the enforcement regime for possession of cannabis in Scotland and Northern Ireland? They have ruled out cannabis warnings, and there is a presumption of prosecution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="90311-0014.htm_para21"><a name="09031165002270">The order before us is not just about cannabis. As hon. Friends have pointed out, it deals with other serious offences, including theft and criminal damage. As we heard earlier today, this year there have been some 295,000 shoplifting offences; that is 6,000 a week. The largest increase in the number of penalty notices for disorder issued has been for shoplifting. The number rose from 38,000 in 2006 to 45,000 in 2007. Will the Minister provide reassurance that the use of fixed penalty notices for theft will be limited to first-time offenders, as my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York has suggested? When, as is often the case, there are underlying causes of theft, such as the need to feed an addiction to drugs or alcohol, will that lead to intervention by the court? The court is best placed to deal with an order for treatment to deal with those underlying causes. That opportunity would be completely lost if a fixed penalty notice were simply issued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="90311-0014.htm_para22"><a name="09031165002271">I now come to the issue of criminal damage. Did the Minister assess the impact of reinstating the penalty for criminal damage before hastily putting the order together? Has she assessed the impact on the victim? When a fixed penalty notice is issued, the victim does not benefit from the opportunity to receive a compensation order for up to &#163;500 through a magistrates court. Does the Minister have any details of whether such victims have taken up the only opportunity left to them, which is to pursue a civil claim? Has there been any consideration of those victims, who say that they have lost the opportunity to get true justice through the courts?</p>

 May I ask my hon. Friend to emphasise, too, the undesirability of using fixed penalties in respect of sale of alcohol to persons under 18? After all, it is an important part of the Government&#146;s strategy to abate alcohol misuse, which lies at the root of much other crime, especially violence. That being so, surely fixed penalties for the sale of alcohol to persons under 18 are disproportionate and unwise.</p>

 I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend. The Magistrates Association made a similar point about that offence, which is associated more often than not with violence, not being downgraded to a fixed penalty notice. It is important that we look at the rationale for each extension and whether there should be an extension. The concern that many share and which the Government have not answered is that the extension is designed to relieve administrative burdens, rather than to seek true justice in each individual case.</p>

We cannot support an order that goes soft on proper enforcement or which further undermines summary justice and justice that should be administered primarily by a magistrates court, which is the public forum that is there for all to see, so that victims can receive justice and there is transparency.

 I begin by trying to deal with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes). We can agree across the House that cannabis use is harmful. Cannabis is an illegal drug and should not be taken. It needs to be tackled through a comprehensive package of measures as part of a drug strategy that includes prevention, education, early intervention, enforcement&#151;which is what we are dealing with&#151;and treatment when that is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="90311-0015.htm_para0"><a name="09031165002276">We believe that cannabis can pose a real threat to health. It can produce both immediate and longer-term harm to physical and mental health. For that reason, enforcement of the fact that it is illegal is an important part of deterring its use and trying to ensure that we minimise the harm caused to and by those who use it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o236"><a name="09031165002277"><a name="90311-0015.htm_spnew0"><a name="09031165004441"><b>Mr. Malins:</b>
 If the Minister&#146;s argument is right, why permit possession of cannabis to be treated by a penalty notice, which does not involve a criminal record and never comes to the notice of the court or anybody else? It is as though the offender has not done anything, if they pay the money. Why do that if it is important, as the hon. Lady says, to bring offenders into court for treatment?</p>

 I shall deal with that point. At present, the 2004 Association of Chief Police Officers&#146; administrative arrangements on cannabis warnings for possession are in use. Any police officer catching somebody in possession has the immediate capacity and jurisdiction to arrest if the circumstances warrant it, but if it is simple possession with no aggravating features, he or she may take the view that some sort of warning is appropriate if it is a first offence. At present there is an administrative warning in England&#151;a cannabis warning&#151;which, anecdotally, has been used on more than one occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="90311-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09031165002279">The arrangements that we are putting in place through the order, part of which introduces a penalty notice for disorder for a second offence, create an escalation such that an individual who is caught in possession, in circumstances that the officer concerned considers appropriate, can receive a cannabis warning&#151;an administrative warning&#151;for a first offence, a PND for a second offence, and can be arrested for a third offence. This is a regime of escalation. I accept the importance of sending signals, as the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate said. He called the measure a three-strike policy, but it is an attempt to escalate the consequences of being caught more than once.</p>

 That is a good point, as I have accepted in previous discussions. There are local arrangements within particular forces for making notes of such things. PNDs are now available, and can be issued for offences; that has been possible since 26 January, as the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="90311-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09031165002282">Possession of cannabis is a recordable offence and should therefore be put on the police national computer within 24 hours; that is the arrangement. That, of course, works only if a cannabis warning has already been given as part of the escalation. PentiP, the computer system that will record cannabis warnings and PNDs across England, will be in operation by 2010. Until then, we will rely on local forces&#146; own, more informal recording of cannabis warnings. The PND would, of course, be recorded on the police national computer and there would be an arrest for a further offence of possession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90311-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09031165002283">I remind the House, however, that every investigating officer uses his or her judgment at the time and in the circumstances.

We want the individual police officer to exercise their professional judgment, and it is possible for them to arrest for a first offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90311-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09031165002296">There has been some concern about the level of the fine. The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate said that &#163;80, which is the level at which the financial penalty will be fixed under this order, was too little. I do not know whether this assists the House, but the average fine for cannabis possession in 2006 was just under &#163;80, and just over &#163;81 in 2007. The level of financial penalty will be about the same as the average fine when a case is taken to court, according to the latest statistics. I hope that that allays any concerns about whether the penalty is sufficient.</p>

Member for Woking knows that it is right that only about half of PNDs are paid, because he was nodding when his hon. Friend made his remarks. If they are not paid, they are increased by 50 per cent. and enforced as fines. I can tell the House that 85 per cent. of fines are collected, but I cannot disaggregate the percentage that started out as PNDs. There is a high chance that enforcement will follow, and one wishes that individuals who are subject to a financial penalty would pay it, and that the matter would be  <br>

enforced if they did not. Certainly, 85 per cent. is not a bad place to start, but we are always focusing on fine enforcement to increase that level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="90311-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09031165002298">We believe that PNDs offer a proportionate second step in the escalation process. Cannabis is the most widely used drug, and the PND offers a method of disposal that provides a greater penalty than simply an administrative warning&#151;the cannabis warning that the Association of Chief Police Officers uses in England at present. It offers a disincentive to the individual concerned of a financial penalty to make them think about their behaviour, which a cannabis warning does not. If a person chooses not to pay the penalty notice, they remain liable to be convicted, and will be chased under the enforcement arrangements for the penalty that they have not paid. We therefore believe that penalty notices represent an escalation from the cannabis warning and a salutary and important suggestion to people that if they overstep the mark again, they will be going to court.</p>

I accept that there has been a move away from using them simply for disorder, which is where their name came from. They now cover a variety of minor antisocial offences. The right hon. and learned Gentleman made the point that PNDs are used for some offences that sound too serious to be dealt with in that way. However, they are designed to be used only at the very lowest end of the scale of those offences. For example, in the case of false reporting to police, they are for abuse of 999 calls. One would not expect them to be used for such offences at a higher level. They provide an extra option at the lowest end for the police when they are trying to make use of the limited resources that are always available. There is never enough money for them to do everything that one would wish them to do.</p>

The answer is simply that we are moving to an escalating arrangement whereby it will be made obvious to the person committing an offence that things will get worse if they continue to behave in the same manner. We trust in the professionalism and good sense of our police officers out on the beat to make the appropriate choice, in the circumstances that they find in front of them, about whether a penalty notice is the right way forward for a particular offender. Of course, they always retain the capacity to arrest if they believe it appropriate.</p>

Officers have not been in place. If someone is caught in possession, they are therefore considered for prosecution.

 As we have heard, the reason for our being here this afternoon is a long story. The original statutory instrument, which was laid before the House in December, had to be withdrawn at short notice because the Government had not consulted about many of its provisions&#151;for example, the one on taxi touts. Taxi touting was one of the 21 new offences that were included in that statutory instrument. As a result of having to withdraw it hastily, the Government introduced the order that we are considering, which relates specifically to cannabis as the only new offence of the original 21.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90311-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09031165002306">Penalty notices for disorder are, in principle, good policy instruments for several reasons. First, they save police time. The Under-Secretary made one of the standard arguments, which we hear all the time, about the amount of paperwork and bureaucracy that keeps police from carrying out their front-line duties and ties them up in the station. Using penalty notices for disorder in the appropriate circumstances is a great time-saver. I believe that it takes half an hour to issue a penalty notice for disorder, compared with a minimum of two and a half hours for a more detailed case if the police have to go down another route. That is a great advantage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90311-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09031165002307">Secondly, PNDs help to avoid criminalisation. Again, that is welcome in the correct circumstances. I tabled an amendment to the Policing and Crime Bill, which has recently completed its Committee stage, that would have a similar effect. I proposed that local authorities could take similar measures against graffiti and fly-posting and use restorative justice, thus allowing the offenders to repair the damage that they had done and avoid getting a criminal record. Hopefully, that early shock would prevent people from going on to greater criminal activity. We support the principles of restorative justice and trying to avoid criminalisation at the first stage of offending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90311-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09031165002309">In principle, we support penalty notices for disorder, but we have doubts about how they work in general, and specifically about their use for cannabis offences. Where is the evidence base for the policy? Eight years have passed since the 2001 Act, which was extended in 2004 to bring children over 10 within its scope. Incidentally, I understand that, in the previous statutory instrument debate, the Under-Secretary said that PNDs would not be used for people under 18 who used drugs and that other Acts would apply in that case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90311-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09031165002310">Some 400,000 PNDs have been issued in the eight years since they were introduced.

How do PNDs tie up with other Government police policy, such as the Policing and Crime Bill&#146;s dropping the &#147;three strikes and you&#146;re out&#148; to two for licensees? If there are to be only two steps, where does the &#163;80 PND fit in that sequence?</p>

As a first step, do they help to prevent people from being criminalised and reoffending? What are the reoffending rates? It appears&#151;remarkably&#151;that, eight years after PNDs were introduced, no research has been conducted to ascertain whether they are effective as well as widely used.

quite agree with one of them. The association is concerned that magistrates can be sidelined where PNDs are used. As I have already said, that is in part one of the benefits of PNDs for low-level disorder. The hope is that PNDs will catch minor offenders&#151;presumably first-time offenders&#151;and thereby prevent them from being taken to court, being criminalised and getting a record. Sidelining the magistrates courts and keeping such people out of the criminal justice system at that point would be a good thing, if PNDs are used in the correct circumstances.</p>

 What the hon. Gentleman is saying is in part correct, but there is a disadvantage in respect of first-time offenders, which was outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins). If someone has a drug problem that underlies the commission of that first offence, they do not have the opportunity to have it dealt with by a criminal court, which can make the proper provision.</p>

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman is quite right; indeed, that is one of the points that I was coming to and it is also one that the Magistrates Association has made. I disagree with the Magistrates Association on the general principle of magistrates being sidelined by PNDs, because the whole point is to try to avoid criminalisation at the first, low-level stage. However, there are a number of cases where PNDs are used&#151;there would have been a lot more had the statutory instrument been introduced in December&#151;where that might be appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90311-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09031165002318">The example that the right hon. and learned Gentleman gave is exactly one of those cases. Does the use of PNDs for more serious offenders tackle the root cause? If a shoplifter is given a PND the first time they are caught and if the reason they are shoplifting is that they are addicted to alcohol or drugs and trying to feed their habit, giving them a PND, which they are probably not going to pay anyway because of their disorderly lifestyle, will not lead them to the kind of treatment that might result from a court order higher up. As I keep saying, PNDs have to be used in the appropriate circumstances for quite low-level offences, which was the original intention in 2001.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90311-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09031165002319">The Magistrates Association has expressed other concerns. One is that magistrates courts have a much better success rate in collecting fines than the 50 per cent. for PNDs. The association has also pointed out that magistrates courts are not funded by the Government for all the extra work created as result of having to deal with the fall-out from whatever proportion of the 50 per cent. who do not pay their PNDs are sent to magistrates courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90311-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09031165002320">Magistrates are worried that the Government intend at a later stage&#151;although obviously not with the order before us today&#151;to reintroduce some, most or all of the 20 or so more serious offences that were intended in December, which magistrates do not think are appropriate for PNDs. Those offences include throwing stones at trains. I could see that a PND might apply if someone is throwing a very small stone. However, if someone is throwing things of any size at trains, it does not take much of a leap of the imagination to see them throwing a brick through a window and killing a driver, which has happened at least once. That is not a minor offence.  <br>

That is a complete contradiction: either cannabis is a serious class B drug or it is not, and no other class B drug is included. Ketamine, amphetamines and Ritalin are sometimes mentioned as drugs that can be misused, so why are they not on the list if the Government really believe that all class B drugs&#151;now including cannabis&#151;should be treated in a certain way related to how dangerous they are?</p>

 Let me clarify why cannabis does not equate to other class B drugs in this regard. It is because although cannabis is relatively simple to identify, some of the other drugs that the hon. Gentleman identified have to be carted off and analysed forensically, so they are not suitable for a PND.</p>

 I am grateful for that, but some confusion remains. If we go back to the original debate on the statutory instrument in January, we find some discussion of different types of cannabis took place&#151;there is cannabis, but there is also skunk, for example, and they are of very different strengths. After the seizure of cannabis on the street on a dark night, how can a police officer identify it at first glance and say whether it is skunk or a less strong and thus less dangerous form of cannabis? As I have said, considerable confusion is evident: is cannabis a class B drug or not, and is it to be treated as a low-level offence or not?

We see a parallel example in the Policing and Crime Bill, which increases the fine for possessing alcohol in a prohibited public place. It is currently &#163;500 and it is to be increased to &#163;2,500, but nobody has ever been fined more than &#163;250 and most people do not pay it anyway.

First, I have never said and never would say that cannabis is not harmful&#151;in fact, I am going on to say just the opposite&#151;and nobody has said that during the course of this debate. I do not know where the hon. Gentleman pulled that one from&#151;certainly not from anything I have said. Secondly, dependence on cannabis should never be used as an excuse for wrongdoing in a court of law. I agree that barristers sometimes behave in a disgraceful way when arguing their case, but then I have never been a barrister, and have never had any desire to be one.</p>

Between 1998 and 2005, notwithstanding all the folk moral panics that the <i> Daily Mail </i>and others keep spreading, the number of instances of people being registered with doctors, psychiatrists and psychologists owing to problems such as schizophrenia were falling. We were told, however, that the number of cases of schizophrenic disorder were increasing because of the increase in skunk usage. The evidence suggested the exact opposite, but, as we have seen on a number of occasions, it was a case of &#147;Don&#146;t let the facts get in the way of a good bit of knee-jerk posturing&#148;.</p>

It is 100 per cent. guaranteed that anyone who has ever taken a harder drug, although they may or may not have started with cannabis, drank alcohol before proceeding to harder drugs. People keep repeating a nonsensical theory of cause and effect. Of course cannabis is dangerous. Of course smoking cigarettes is dangerous, although at least it does not cause violent or antisocial behaviour. Of course alcohol is dangerous.</p>

Recently, when we were taking evidence during the Committee stage of the Policing and Crime Bill, I asked what substance needed most to be controlled. The answer was alcohol. Of course cannabis is dangerous&#151;all drugs are&#151;but we have a legal drug that is far more dangerous, and we treat it much more leniently than cannabis.

 As one who has always found the drinking of alcohol more than enough of an issue&#151;although at least alcohol tells people when they have had too much, because they start to slur, fall over and get headaches&#151;I would not suggest that anyone should take drugs, illegal or otherwise. However, I do not think that that is the point. What we are discussing is the reality of the world in which we live. How can we deal sensibly with the misuse of drugs, whether or not they are illegal drugs such as amphetamines, ketamine, cannabis, heroin, crack cocaine, ecstasy and LSD? To me it seems self-evident that the sensible way to deal with such drug issues is to examine the scientific evidence and make rational policy based on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90311-0016.htm_para28"><a name="09031165002358">To return to a previous example, I remember when I was a teacher, about 15 years ago. It was exam season and the 16-year-olds were off on exam leave for their GCSEs. One lunchtime a group of them were in a classroom. They had not been at school for a week or two, and I went in to have a chat with them. They were arguing. Three or four of the girls were berating one of their friends because that night after the exam she was going to smoke some cannabis with her friends. She was arguing, saying, &#147;Tonight, you&#146;ll be out drinking lager in the town centre with all your friends falling over, vomiting and getting violent and shouting. I&#146;ll be sat having a chilled, happy chat with my friends at home not doing that. Which is better?&#148; That was that 16-year-old&#146;s opinion some 15 years ago. As a teacher with 22 years&#146; experience, I can say that 16, 17 and 18-year-olds are smart, intelligent and savvy. If someone tells them lies about the impact of a particular drug, they are not going to believe them. We must base policy making on sensible, rational approaches, and making cannabis a class B drug is not such an approach, as every bit of scientific evidence shows and as every group of experts who work in the field have said repeatedly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="90311-0016.htm_para29"><a name="09031165002359">There are a number of questions, all of which I have touched on. Will the missing 20 offences be introduced after December and added to the PNDs, in which case there will be some concern that PNDs, which are good in principle, are moving away from minor, low-level offences into more serious offences? Which is inappropriate? Will some violent offences be included? They were going to be among the original 21. Apparently, the magistrates feel from lobbying the Government that they have won that one and those offences will not be included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90311-0016.htm_para30"><a name="09031165002360">Will research on the effectiveness of PNDs be undertaken? As I say it is eight years since the experiment began. It was a very good one and probably should be working. However, we should know whether it is or not, and not just assume it. That was the point I made about drugs policy: let us base it on evidence and reality, not on what we think. Will other class B drugs be included at a later stage and treated in this way? Apparently, from what the Minister said earlier, they will not be, but it seems illogical. If cannabis is a class B drug, why treat it in such a low-level way with a PND and why not treat other class B drugs in that way?</p>

 It is always a pleasure to follow the hon.

That is not the only example; there are many other case histories that we have read about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09031165002371">The Government are right to begin any consideration of the policy of enforcement with a clear and unequivocal statement about drug taking and drug use.

There is research and medical evidence to support what she said and although this debate is not specifically about cannabis&#151;in the sense of whether our penalties are severe or not&#151;and is on a limited motion that deals with enforcement, it is important that the House looks at the issue.</p>

to be concerned about these matters, but I ask him not to let the process get in the way of a decision that has to be made by the House today. I hope that the Conservative party will not vote to have the order annulled because it is important that we have the necessary penalties in place to deal with the situation. I know that he feels that the penalties are not sufficient. I gather from his speech that he would like the &#163;80 fine that is to be imposed to be even higher, but I think that the three-stage process set out by the Government is a method that works and that we can support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09031165002374">I hope that the Minister will, as a result of the debate and the other deliberations she has had upstairs, now ensure that sufficient research is done in support of the Government&#146;s view that those penalties work. I know that some research has been commissioned in the past, and I do not think the issuing of 400,000 fixed penalty notices since 2004, implemented across all 43 police forces, would have resulted in nobody being discomfited, so such steps clearly work, but there is a need for further research of the sort that the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate spoke about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para6"><a name="09031165002375">The hon. Gentleman was also right when he said that this three-stage process must be properly monitored, and I was grateful that the Minister responded positively to that suggestion. The worry is that the warning that should currently be given is not in the local notes of police officers. That is why I have put to the Minister&#151;and I put it to her again now&#151;that if there is concern that there is not proper monitoring, the proper course of action is for the Home Secretary to write to the chief constables in the 43 areas or to communicate with ACPO. There are many methods by which the Home Secretary can get across to chief constables the importance and necessity of recording such information&#151;and I notice that the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing has just entered the Chamber to listen to the debate. I think that that deals with the Opposition&#146;s point. I therefore hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), will go away and, not have an informal chat with the Home Secretary, but actually make sure something is done to support this, so that there can be more robustness to the three-stage process that she spoke about.</p>

 From the information that has come to me. No, we have not taken evidence on this, which is why it is important that we look at this issue in the inquiry we are about to start, and I promise the hon.  <br>

Gentleman that we will. Obviously, the Government take slightly longer than a Select Committee to commission reports and then review them and conclude, but we will look into the issue, and it is to be hoped that we will have the evidence he seeks. If PNDs are not effective, he can be clear that, with Members such as the hon. Member for Monmouth sitting on the Committee, the report will not be agreed by the Committee. We will certainly look at penalties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para8"><a name="09031165002379">I also want to discuss the effectiveness not of Government policy, but of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. The hon. Member for Chesterfield referred to Professor Nutt. It was Professor Nutt who said recently that there was not much difference between horse-riding and ecstasy, and it was Professor Nutt and his council who said that cannabis should be downgraded from class B to class C. The body is called the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and it only advises the Home Secretary, and it is right that, in the end, the Home Secretary and politicians, who are accountable to this House, should make the final decision. The Home Secretary needs to have a few words with the chairman of the advisory council. First, she needs to put him right on his statement, although I think that he has made some subsequent comments about it. At the end of the day, it must be for the Home Secretary to decide on these matters and for the Government to send out an appropriate message.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09031165002380">If the Opposition vote to annul this order, they will be sending out the wrong message to the public&#151;that this House does not treat the issue seriously enough. In accepting penalty notices for disorder and talking about the need for more research, and with the increase in the amount of skunk available on the streets of our capital city and other cities, the Government need to send out the message that it is vital that we continue with the Home Secretary&#146;s tough line on drugs. We must continue to ensure, even if the advice is against us, that if the Home Secretary and the Government feel that it is important to reclassify this drug, that is what we should do. It is what we have done and we should ensure that we monitor the process so that those who mistakenly believe that in some way taking drugs is acceptable social practice&#151;whether they are celebrities or whoever else&#151;understand that this House will be very serious about the way in which it deals with this real and difficult problem.</p>

 Because of the lateness of the hour, I shall be brief. I am not opposed to the principle of fixed penalty notices. They have a role to play, but they should be confined to relatively minor transgressions. Indeed, I would qualify that by saying that they should be confined to very minor transgressions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09031165002383">My anxiety, looking at the schedule, is that the fixed penalty notices are capable of being applied in more serious cases. For example, in the example I gave to the Minister, giving a false report to the police can amount to conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. We can all recognise that theft is a very serious offence, and criminal damage ditto. The point about the sale of alcohol to persons under 18 has been ventilated frequently in this House. Incidentally, the last offence under part 1&#151;knowingly giving a false alarm to one of the emergency services&#151;can be a very serious offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09031165002384">The Minister made a perfectly fair point in that she said, rightly, that the police have discretion and that a constable on the beat, identifying an offence of this character, can choose to arrest and to go through the prosecution process. However, that places a considerable burden on the police because they have to go through the arrest process and they might have to turn up in court. There is a temptation to an officer on the beat. Incidentally, many years ago I was a special constable, so I have some experience. There is a real temptation to take the easy option. Although I am not saying for a moment that all officers will do that, some certainly will. The truth is, as I have often said in this House, that if one gives powers to officials one can be sure that those powers will be abused at one stage or another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09031165002385">The problem, it seems to me, is that when we extend the capacity to apply fixed penalties to offences that are not minor, we can be quite sure that on occasion they will be applied in cases that should go to the courts. Hon. Members have cited various good reasons why such cases should go to the courts, especially when an addiction of one kind or another is an underlying cause. In any event, I think that theft, for example, is an offence that should generally go to the courts. I am unhappy therefore with the concept of the various offences that I have mentioned, which are capable of being serious, being included in the schedule.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09031165002386">I want to be brief, as I know that three other hon. Members want to speak. I shall vote with my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) against the order, because it includes offences that should not be contained in the schedule.</p>

 I, too, shall be brief in view of the shortness of the time. As always, I declare an interest as a lawyer, Crown court recorder and part-time district judge. What troubles me about the principle of fixed penalty notices is that the motive behind them seems to be to make life easier and simpler for the police, with less form-filling and less hassle than going the whole way to court. If that is part of the motivation, I think that it is wrong. I entirely agree with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) that, if the matter concerned is of the very lowest seriousness&#151;such as dropping litter, and so on&#151;there is a case for the use of a fixed penalty notice. However, that is not appropriate for the more serious offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09031165002388">I am troubled about judicial discretion being exercised largely by officers on the beat, and I fear that some very serious matters will simply not see the light of day if penalty notices are being issued. The notes accompanying the order state:</p>
<a name="90311-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="09031165002423"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Penalty notice disposal provides the recipient with the benefit of an administrative disposal which does not require attendance at court nor an admission of guilt and does not result in a record of criminal conviction.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09031165002389">That would be fine for dropping litter and similar matters, but what about the other offences? As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham said, the schedule contains some serious offences. Theft carries a prison sentence, but the list includes wasting police time, criminal damage and selling alcohol to under-18s. It cannot be right that, for all those offences, something happens that does not result  <br>

in any record whatsoever. Moreover, many of the offences also have victims, but they appear to have no say in what will happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para16"><a name="09031165002390">I am troubled by those two points. In the remaining minutes at my disposal, I want to make it clear that I am also troubled that cannabis possession is to be included in the list of offences for which a penalty notice is handed out. Goodness knows what the courts will think when they discover that neither magistrates, judges nor anyone else will be able to know that a penalty notice&#151;for theft, say&#151;has been handed out to the people come before them. The law will not allow that knowledge to be made available, as it does not amount to an admission of guilt. It is therefore not relevant and cannot be taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para17"><a name="09031165002391">Opinions vary about the sentences that should be handed out for cannabis possession, but I believe it to be a gateway drug to more serious crime. When a person is up for possession of cannabis, I would prefer it if the courts did not say, &#147;Stand up! Here&#146;s a &#163;50 fine, next case, please!&#148; I want the courts to take that offence more seriously, as I believe that, in the long term, cannabis can be very damaging drug indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para18"><a name="09031165002392">I am unhappy at any suggestion that the possession of cannabis&#151;and skunk, of course, is so strong&#151;or other potentially serious offences can be dealt with, not by a judicial authority but by something happening in the street, no record of which is kept at all.</p>

 Like another hon. Member who spoke earlier, I want to declare an interest in that I am a serving special constable. I am also a member of the Home Affairs Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09031174000016">In an ideal world, there would be no such things as penalty notices for disorder. Unfortunately, the world that we live in is not ideal. The reality is that two police officers halfway through a shift who are faced with a person who has committed a minor offence will have to make a choice: they can turn a blind eye&#151;one would hope that that would never happen&#151;issue a penalty notice for disorder, in some instances, or make an arrest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09031174000017">Let me make clear what making an arrest would entail for the two officers. Because of the rules about how custody suites must come up to various standards these days, they are few and far between, so the officers would have to wait for transport to take them to a police station far away. They would then have to wait to book their prisoner in, and wait again while the prisoner was assessed medically and while a solicitor and perhaps an interpreter were found. The officers would have to write up their notes, and then go back to interview the prisoner. The long and short of it all is that the officers will have written off practically their whole shift. A lot of time will also be used up by the custody sergeant and the other people involved in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09031174000018">If, at the end of all of that, a meaningful sanction is applied to the prisoner, the process will have been worth while. However, if the person who has committed a minor offence is back out on the streets a few hours later and faces only a small fine some way down the line, one has to ask what any of it has achieved.</p>

crimes for which they are used. For the same reasons that other hon. Members have already outlined, I have a problem with PNDs being used for any form of theft, such as shoplifting, or of drug abuse. I do not accept the comments made earlier by an hon. Member who seemed to liken cannabis to alcohol. Cannabis is a very dangerous drug that leads on to other drugs. It is often used as a defence for heinous crimes, which suggests to me that the courts and the authorities need to bear down as strongly as possible on this drug. With all due respect to the Minister, I fail to understand why PNDs are being issued for the possession of cannabis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para23"><a name="09031174000020">I can think of two other offences that cry out for PNDs, and it might interest the Minister to know that I have tabled an amendment to the Policing and Crime Bill, proposing that we implement PNDs for people who have committed minor ticket offences on the railways. I know from my own experience that the British transport police spend a great deal of time trying to sort out people who have committed such offences, and it would be absolutely great if they could give out a PND and impose an instant fine on people who admitted the offence. That would save a vast amount of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para24"><a name="09031174000021">Another offence that is worth looking into in this regard relates to what I call professional beggars, although I would not want to table an amendment on the matter without doing further research. The people in question are often removed from railway stations and other places with very large amounts of money on them. They are often not arrested for any offence, but if they could be given an immediate PND, some of that money could be taken away from them. So there is a place for penalty notices for disorder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para25"><a name="09031174000022">If the Minister is trying to free up police time, I offer her those two suggestions in all helpfulness. I urge her please to look at the amendment that I have tabled, to see whether the Government can find a way of supporting it. It would have widespread support among the police, and I cannot see how it would go against anything that her Government stand for politically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para26"><a name="09031174000023">In an ideal world, offenders committing any sort of an offence would simply be marched into a court. There would be no long process; they would appear before a magistrate straight away and they would receive summary justice. We do not live in an ideal world, however. I hope that things improve, but until they do, there is a place for PNDs. Let them be used effectively, however, and let them be used for appropriate offences. Theft and drug possession are not appropriate offences for PNDs, and I will therefore oppose the motion.</p>

taken off the order and that the order was revoked and then revised in its present form. We have been able to highlight those points today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para28"><a name="09031174000026">The debate about the process goes further, however. The process that the Government want to implement is an escalator, comprising the three-strikes warning, the fixed penalty notice and finally the possibility of arrest and prosecution. The reality that has been exposed today is that that escalator is not functioning, and it is unlikely to do so in many parts of the country, given the lack of a computer system and a means of recording the offences involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="90311-0017.htm_para29"><a name="09031174000027">Opposition Members have also highlighted the number of serious offences in the order, and on the schedule, that will now be dealt with using a fixed penalty notice, rather than properly seeing the light of day in the courts. Summary justice has traditionally been done, and seen to be done, in magistrates courts. As we have already seen, the risk is that the expansion of the use of PNDs, which have their place in limited circumstances, will lead to their falling into disrepute. It could also have that effect on summary justice. The order that the Government sought to push through under cover has come to light, and we now need to annul it. I urge hon. Members to do that today.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I seek your advice on whether the frustration that the House has experienced tonight is appropriate. Conservative Members called for a vote and then did not vote&#151;and they did it deliberately in order to delay us from reaching a motion that would allow the youth of the country to debate in this Chamber. What makes their backsides any better than those of the youth of this country to sit on these Benches?</p>

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker, I was in the Committee that scrutinised the motion on the control of ozone-depleting substances. Not one Conservative Member opposed it there, just as not one Conservative Member actually voted against it when we divided just now. Conservative Members were effectively voting to try to stop debate on whether or not our bottoms are so sacred that we cannot share these Benches with members of the UK Youth Parliament. Does that not bring this place into disrepute and risk lowering our reputation below that of the Youth Parliament?</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Have you had a request from the Secretary of State for Justice to make a statement about the fiasco of the C-NOMIS computer system for the prison and probation services? It is now disgracefully late in coming into service and has exceeded its budget by 300 per cent. to reach more than &#163;690 million. This represents an object lesson in failure. May I suggest that the public have a legitimate expectation that the Government will come here and account for it?</p>

 Further to the points of order, Mr. Speaker. Have you heard from the Government as to when they will give Government time for a proper debate on the Youth Parliament issue? When the Prime Minister announced the proposal, he said it would be subject to proper discussion and consultation with all Members of this House. Because that consultation has not taken place, a number of us are concerned and want a debate on it. On, I think, six or seven occasions, a motion has been on the Order Paper, but with no debate, and the Government have been trying to put pressure for this issue to be put through on the nod. I am sure that you, Mr. Speaker, would think that it is not the sort of issue that should be put through on the nod, but that it should be subject to proper debate.</p>

 This petition is about people who are often out of sight and out of mind: those people who live in care homes. It concerns the 240,000 people in our country who receive an allowance called the personal expense allowance, which amounts to just &#163;3 a day, and which is based on national means-testing rules, which mean that those with savings of more than &#163;22,250 have to surrender their pensions to pay for their care home fees. This allowance is going up by 75p this April to &#163;21.90. Last year, in answer to a parliamentary question, the Minister responsible at the time, the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), promised a consultation on these matters, and this petition is intended to raise these issues in the House this evening.</p>

 This petition relates to green land at the side of the Dutch Village on Canvey Island. Only six houses in the whole of the Dutch Village did not respond to the petition, which shows the determination and clarity of vision of Canvey residents. If the development goes ahead, as some borough councillors wish, it will make much worse the flooding risks for every island resident as well as further damaging our island&#146;s environment and putting greater pressure on our infrastructure. I stand shoulder to shoulder with all the excellent petitioners and with Graham and Linda Bracci and Jan Eagle, who prepared the petition.

 Considering the controversy about youth a few minutes ago, I hope that you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, will pass on to Mr. Speaker the thanks of my young constituents who have participated in a parliamentary summer school here over the past two summers. They have considered matters such as the arts, and Mr. Speaker has been informative and courteous in inviting them to meet him in his chambers. His welcome was gratefully received, and the feedback that I have had from those young people is that it has been the highlight of their visits to Parliament over the past two summers. I hope that you will pass on their grateful thanks, Mr. Deputy Speaker: they have expressed them in writing already, but I would like them also to be recorded in the pages of <i> Hansard.</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09031174001504">Young people in my constituency inform much of what I have to say about the arts, thanks to an advisory committee made up of youths of all ages. The committee has worked with me over the past 18 months to prepare proposals to remedy the deficit in support for the arts that my constituency, like others in the former coalfield areas, suffers from. I know that the Minister and funding bodies will be interested in our proposals, not least as they affect money coming directly and indirectly from national Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para9"><a name="09031174001505">The Government generally have a proud record on arts spending, which has increased nationally by 73 per cent. since 1998, to a total of &#163;412 million last year. Investment in this country&#146;s creative industries has grown, and we are global leaders in advertising, craft, cultural heritage, design, music, literature and the performing and visual arts. I know this because the sector employs some of my constituents. The statistics show unequivocally that there has been an almost 40 per cent. increase in the number of people attending performances, that 85 per cent. more new plays have been produced, and that nearly 6,000 performances are given at home and on tour annually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09031174001506">The Government have made successful efforts to get more young people involved in the arts. For example, the Creative Partnerships programme works in some of the most deprived wards in the country. It has worked with 330,000 students in 2,700 schools, and 90 per cent. of the head teachers involved thought that it had improved pupils&#146; confidence and communication skills. We would like the opportunity to spread such good work to the schools of Bassetlaw.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para11"><a name="09031174001507">The Government&#146;s national record on the arts is something to be praised and to be proud of, but there is a deficit in constituencies such as mine, particularly in former coalfield areas. On other indicators, in the eight years since I became the Member of Parliament for Bassetlaw, we have done well compared with the national average. We have had the largest investment in new secondary school buildings per capita anywhere in England. Our primary care trust had the largest increase in funding anywhere in Britain in the last settlement, and we have been the most successful part of Britain in terms of health performance for some time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para12"><a name="09031174001508">The jobs market is experiencing difficulties in the rest of the country, and in my area as well. However, in January, Laing O&#146;Rourke created 300 new jobs in my area, and MBA Polymers is creating 90 new jobs. Even now, we are creating jobs, and our record has been good on roads and infrastructure. The recently completed improvements to the A1, costing &#163;30 million, represent a significant boost to local people and local businesses, and they supersede achievements in other parts of the country. Would that that were the case with the arts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para13"><a name="09031174001509">Let me give the House some examples of the problems. Berry&#146;s music shop used to be on Bridge street in Worksop. It acted as the centre for the burgeoning music scene, selling sheet music for the colliery brass bands, new electric guitars, tickets for classical concerts and much more. But Berry&#146;s was bought by Williams Music, which went into liquidation in 2007. It closed down, leaving nowhere to buy music or classical instruments, and no single place to find a music teacher in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para14"><a name="09031174001510">Then there is the shame of the Regal arts centre, which was once run by Bassetlaw council. It suffered under-investment over the years, and in 2004 it was closed down and handed over to the Bassetlaw Studio Project. The project was well-meaning and successful, but very small. It ran small-scale music projects for young people, but it had neither the resources nor the experience to take over the Regal arts centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para15"><a name="09031174001511">The Regal arts centre, as well as having a small cinema, used to run a programme of live comedy, theatre, children&#146;s workshops and a regionally acclaimed folk programme, attracting people from a wide area. It also used to stage performances by local groups such as the light operatic societies, amateur theatre groups and dance schools. Sadly, it is now in great decline. It receives no more local authority funding, as such funding is no longer available for such operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para16"><a name="09031174001512">The Regal was never ideal. It was old and dilapidated, and needed a great deal of investment. The films that were shown there were on their second release, following their screening in the multiplexes. My constituency is 44 miles across&#151;the size of Greater London&#151;yet it now has no cinema. In the United Kingdom, 3,661 screens currently receive advertising in more than 700 locations. We are the size of Greater London, but we have no cinema.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para17"><a name="09031174001513">Areas such as Bassetlaw are rather important when it comes to the arts. For many years, the county council had a strong touring programme. Its Stages programme brought groups such as Northern Broadsides within reach of my constituents, if not quite inside the boundaries of my constituency. Music in Quiet Places took professional music into our churches around the constituency. These European-funded programmes have now stopped. I could give other examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para18"><a name="09031174001514">There are many good activities going on, involving young and old people. People across all sectors of society are performing without the resource or facilities to do so: for example, through the Worksop music and drama festival, Ryton Chorale&#146;s concerts, and Worksop Miners Welfare Band and other bands around the area. They have been going for centuries and are still going today. I wish to put on record and acknowledge the hard work done by people in such groups as the Worksop light operatic society, Bassetlaw youth theatre and many more, who put great effort into keeping the performing  <br>

arts alive in my constituency. The traditions of the brass bands in mining communities&#151;the marching bands from my constituency that led the way&#151;are not long gone, but they are gone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para19"><a name="09031174001515">The reason is simple. In my area, we have the creativity, the ingenuity, the people prepared to put in the time and effort, and the performers; we have the artists, the painters, the musicians. In every form of the arts we have the talent, but it is undernourished and under-resourced. Let me cite some starkly contrasting statistics to demonstrate why the money does not come to my area or to such places as Ashfield, Bolsover and all the other former mining communities in the vicinity. I hope that the Minister will take these statistics and this debate to her own officials, to the national lottery, to the Arts Council, and to the Department for Children, Schools and Families project, myplace, in order that they can learn from them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para20"><a name="09031174001516">There is bias in the system. I calculate that since the lottery was formed, &#163;1.63 billion has gone to the arts in London, which has the same geographical space as my constituency. That may be an underestimate, but it is a minimum. In my constituency, we are talking about a rather smaller sum&#151;&#163;439,389. I have been through the figures. Some allocations have been made to things not in my constituency and should not have been included, so in fact the figure is slightly lower still: just over &#163;400,000 for Bassetlaw, but &#163;1.63 million for London. Kensington and Chelsea has received &#163;133 million; Islington, South, &#163;100 million; Islington, North, &#163;39 million; Hampstead, &#163;27 million; Hammersmith, &#163;25 million; Bethnal Green, &#163;31 million; Holborn and St. Pancras, &#163;116 million; Cities of London and Westminster, &#163;356 million; Vauxhall, &#163;127 million; Regent&#146;s Park, &#163;22 million; Southwark and Bermondsey, &#163;41 million; and Hackney, South, &#163;50 million. I could go on and on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para21"><a name="09031174001517">Those figures compare with &#163;400,000 in my constituency and similar amounts in adjoining former mining constituencies. That is why the arts are not flourishing there. That is why we do not have an arts centre that people of all ages, but particularly young people, can be proud of and utilise&#151;that can garner their skills, take their talents forward, and give them the opportunity to express themselves in the way that people in London and the other big cities do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para22"><a name="09031174001518">One would expect that with this absurd bias in the London-oriented, London-dictated, London-run lottery, the Arts Council might, with its modest funding, redress the balance. I have last year&#146;s figures for Arts Council funding, and what do we see? Which constituencies get most&#151;more than &#163;500 million&#151;of the money? Those in London. Some 27 London constituencies got more than &#163;100,000 from the Arts Council. London, and the centre of London in particular, gets all the lottery money, which is hundreds of millions of pounds, and on top of that it gets the Arts Council money. Instead of redressing the gross, awful imbalance in lottery funding, particularly as regards the arts, the Arts Council does the opposite, and reinforces the discrimination against my constituency. Bassetlaw got &#163;13,716. We are thankful for that. A quarter of it&#151;in fact a quarter of all Arts Council money for my area&#151;has gone to the Harley gallery on the Duchess of Portland&#146;s estate. We are grateful for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para23"><a name="09031174001519">However, the deprived communities&#151;the centre of Worksop, and the mining villages and former mining villages&#151;are not getting any money from the Arts Council or the lottery for the arts. That is why the arts are struggling. There are brilliant people such as David Jordan, who created the Acorn centre, having received no funding whatever to put towards the running costs. With tiny amounts of capital coming in, he created a centre that allows people to perform. Why are the Government not directing the Arts Council, and not advising the lottery, to put money into such facilities to allow the arts to flourish?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para24"><a name="09031174001520">We would accept 5 per cent. of what some of the London constituencies have got. I would take 5 per cent. of the money for City of London and Westminster; that would make a huge difference. It is not that we have not put proposals forward. We do not have all those arty-farty people&#151;professionals in the arts&#151;who spend their time running around bidding for money. We have decent, working people, who do a job, raise their families and get on with life. They spend their spare time creating the arts in my constituency, and they deserve a slice of the cake. It is a shame that the Arts Council in particular does not attempt to redress the balance by putting money where it will make a huge, major difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para25"><a name="09031174001521">My constituency demands the right to have a cinema, like every other place, so that we can get kids off the street and give them the opportunity to see the latest films. We demand an arts centre, so that the talents of people of all ages can find expression. We demand what everyone else, particularly the large cities, and particularly London, is getting in excess. The Government need to redress the balance. In areas such as mine, people need a chance to express their creativity. I look forward to hearing a positive response from the Minister on how the imbalance can be redressed.</p>

 First, I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. I know how much he cares about the subject, his constituency and his constituents, and I commend him on his tireless work in support of the arts in his Bassetlaw constituency. That part of north Nottinghamshire has a long history of interest in the arts&#151;in fact, one of the longest such histories in Britain. Creswell Crags near Worksop contains the country&#146;s only known examples of ice age rock art. Stone age, bronze age and Roman artefacts have also been found in Bassetlaw. However, it is the present, not the past, that my hon. Friend and I are concerned with today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="90311-0020.htm_para26"><a name="09031174001523">I know that my hon. Friend shares my belief in the power of the arts to transform communities and the lives of those who live in them, because he has worked closely with Arts Council England, East Midlands to try to do just that in his constituency, and because of the impassioned speech that he gave in defence of his constituents&#146; need for better arts provision. His close involvement in the issue is demonstrated by the detailed examples that he has given of instances in which he would like to see improvements to arts provision for his constituents. He has also detailed the funding provision that he would like there to be.</p>

by Arts Council England. It would, therefore, be wrong for me to comment on the level of support that the Arts Council gives to particular projects, but I am more than happy to comment in general on the issues that he has raised and to give my understanding of the steps that Arts Council England, East Midlands is taking to deal with them. I will make sure that Arts Council England East Midlands is fully apprised of his concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="90311-0021.htm_para1"><a name="09031174001525">Like my hon. Friend, I am glad to say that over the past decade there has been record investment in the arts in this country, both inside and outside London. As an MP with a constituency outside London and as a Minister who has visited a number of very active artistic endeavours outside London, I cannot remember when the arts scene outside the M25 was as vibrant and as active as it is today. I am doing all I can to ensure that it remains so and keeps growing, despite the downturn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90311-0021.htm_para2"><a name="09031174001526">My hon. Friend&#146;s constituency is in the east midlands region which, like others, has seen a real improvement in artistic activity in the past 10 years. That is, as he mentioned, due in no small way to an increase in funding. Arts Council England East Midlands in this spending round will make grants of more than &#163;50 million. This money will help to support more than 50 regularly funded organisations, or RFOs, including Sinfonia Viva, the region&#146;s professional chamber orchestra, the Leicester, Nottingham and Northampton Theatre Trusts, numerous other dance troupes and folk groups, a fistful of festivals, and a very active forum for participatory arts organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90311-0021.htm_para3"><a name="09031174001527">In addition, during the past three years about 900 grants for the arts have been made. Those are worth &#163;16 million and have been funded from lottery funds in the east midlands region. This year sees the culmination of the &#163;130 million arts venue programme in the east midlands. When the Nottingham Contemporary is completed this autumn, the city, which already has the New Art Exchange, will have two brand new arts venues. Those, together with the QUAD in Derby, First Movement in Rowsley and the Curve in Leicester, will give the region five exciting new arts centres.</p>

 I thank the Minister for kindly giving way. From my constituency to Nottingham, to give the equivalent distance south of where we are now, would take us into the sea beyond Brighton. Therefore whatever happens in Nottingham or Leicester is of little concern to my constituents because it is nowhere near. That is my point.</p>

<p><a name="st_o303"><a name="09031174001529"><a name="90311-0021.htm_spnew1"><a name="09031174004313"><b>Barbara Follett:</b>
 I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s point and I will deal with it now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="90311-0021.htm_para4"><a name="09031174001530">I am glad that so many residents of the east midlands have taken advantage of schemes such as Own Art and Take It Away to bring more than 1,000 musical instruments and 75 pieces of art into their own homes. A guitar propped up against a bedroom wall or a picture by an up-and-coming British artist in a living room provide a wonderful opportunity for interaction with the arts in people&#146;s own time, in their own home and on a daily basis. But as my hon. Friend stressed, proximity is important, and I realise that distance plays a great part in access to the arts. People should not have to travel if they want to attend arts events, and those should most certainly not be restricted to the big towns and cities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90311-0021.htm_para5"><a name="09031174001531">I am sorry to hear that my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents do not have a cinema. When I first became the Member   <br>

for Stevenage, there was a similar situation there. I would like to meet my hon. Friend to discuss ways of attracting a cinema to his town. If we are to engage and enthuse people, it is important that there should be projects and events happening within their own areas&#151;within walking distance and in their communities. I therefore fully understand my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns about provision in his constituency and the lack of an arts centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90311-0021.htm_para6"><a name="09031174001532">I am glad that my hon. Friend is in discussion with Arts Council England, East Midlands and that it has been meeting not only him, but local arts providers and Nottinghamshire county council, to try to address the issue. Discussions are also being held about other issues in the area, such as support for &#147;Young Potential&#148;, the scheme at the Worksop Regal for young people who live with real disadvantage which my hon. Friend mentioned. There are issues with the lease and required refurbishment at the Regal, and I hope that they will soon be resolved, not least because the Arts Council and Nottinghamshire county council are providing funding for a programme for learning-disabled people called &#147;This Stage Life&#148;, which is to be held at the Regal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90311-0021.htm_para7"><a name="09031174001533">Further discussions are also being held about increasing the number of applications for creative partnerships, which my hon. Friend mentioned. Netherfield infant and nursery school and Meden school and technology college are already involved, and Arts Council England, East Midlands is working with Nottinghamshire county council to encourage more schools to participate. Arts Council England, East Midlands is also involved in talks about the development of the arts on offer for young people at Manton community and learning centre; it is particularly interested in working on dance provision. Arts Council England, East Midlands has also provided small amounts of funding for both development and building work for the Acorn community theatre, which my hon. Friend mentioned, in Worksop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="90311-0021.htm_para8"><a name="09031174001534">As I said at the outset, it is not proper for me to be involved in these discussions, but I am glad that the executive director of Arts Council England, East Midlands has been in contact with my hon. Friend, and I encourage my hon. Friend to develop that relationship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="90311-0021.htm_para9"><a name="09031174001535">I turn now to the lottery awards and other money. In the past five years, my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency has had 24 Grants for the Arts awards, with a total value of more than &#163;290,000. However, I have discussed with Arts Council England and the lottery the amount of money that is going from the good causes to local authorities with coalfields in them. Only about 10 per cent. of the total are involved, and we are doing what we can to raise that. However, for lottery awards to be made, lottery applications also have to be made. Sadly, we had only five grants for the arts applications in Bassetlaw in 2007-08. I hope that my hon. Friend will encourage his constituents to create schemes and events and apply for funding.</p>

Friend has been consulting with local young people about exactly what facilities and schemes they would like to see in Bassetlaw; I am sure that one of their requests was for a cinema, as that was top of my constituents&#146; list. That desire to engage the next generation has led to a number of initiatives. One of the schemes about which we are most excited&#151;and   <br>

of which his constituents can take advantage&#151;is the &#147;A Night Less Ordinary&#148; scheme, which will provide more than 600,000 free theatre tickets to people under 26 over the next two years. I realise that the nearest theatres are some distance from my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency&#151;about 30 miles away&#151;but I hope that people will take advantage of this offer to experience some of the Shakespeare, Arthur Miller and Tchaikovsky, among others, being put on in Sheffield, Nottingham, Barnsley, Scunthorpe and Derby over that two-year period. I also hope that the Find Your Talent programme, which has 10 pathfinders running across the country, will eventually help his constituents.</p>
