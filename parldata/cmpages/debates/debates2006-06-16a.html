of which it was substantially rewritten. Today, the House has its first
opportunity to consider the effect of that rewriting and the extent to
which it meets concerns expressed on Second Reading 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 979</b><br>and elsewhere. The late and much lamented Eric Forth, whose death has
left such a gap in our lives and in this House, raised such concerns in
one of his shortest Friday speeches, which lasted only four minutes. He
said that</p><a name="06061623000963"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it is
insufficiently focused and in some respects requires

Baldry (Banbury) (Con):</b> Can my hon. Friend help me with a
dilemma? Is it safe for people such as myself, who wish to remember
Eric Forth, to go canvassing in Bromley this morning or&#151;if they
support the Bill, as I do&#151;will they need to stay here for
closure motions? I would be grateful for some
advice.</p><p><a name="06061623000168"><b><a name="06061623001131">Mr.
Chope:</b> My hon. Friend will need to decide that for
himself. My own assessment is that the Bill will receive a Third
Reading today, but after full consideration. Given that so many hon.
Members are in their places, I hope that we will have a cross-party
Back Benchers&#146; rebellion that will strengthen the provisions of
the Bill, perhaps against the wishes of the Executive. The Prime
Minister&#146;s payroll is in a minority today, with the majority
being on the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s payroll. If the
latter comes into the Lobby in support of some of the amendments, I
hope that my hon. Friend will join them. I cannot predict what will
happen. Indeed, it is the whole essence of proceedings on a Friday that
there is an element of unpredictability about
them.</p><p><a name="06061623000169"><b><a name="06061623001132">Mr.
William Cash (Stone) (Con):</b> Does my hon. Friend accept
that there are those of us who support improvements in transparency on
international development issues, but are appalled by the failure to
deal with the fundamental question that faces the international
development community&#151;that of corruption? I shall listen to him
with great interest in the hope that I may get an opportunity to get a
word in edgeways at some point. I do not really care which party deals
with the matter, because corruption is a serious matter. I look
straight at the Secretary of State for International Development, who
is in his place. He knows where I am coming from and he also knows what
my new clause would have amounted to. I simply
say&#151;</p><p><a name="06061623000170"><b><a name="06061623001133">Mr.
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I will say something simply to the
hon. Gentleman. First, he must not verge on discussion of an amendment
that has not been selected and, secondly, if he hopes to make a
contribution to the debate it would be a great pity if the length of
his interventions caused that not to
happen.</p><p><a name="06061623000171"><b><a name="06061623001134">Mr.
Chope:</b> I hope that my hon. Friend will have a chance to
participate in the debate. As he knows, the word
&#147;corruption&#148; is included in at least one of the
amendments in the group.</p><p><a name="06061623000172">In Committee, the promoter of
the Bill, the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill
(Mr. Clarke), was chided for allowing the Bill to become a Government
Bill. Of course, until it left Committee, the measure was vulnerable to
Government dirty tricks, but now, collectively, we have the opportunity
to strengthen it and I hope that 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 980</b><br>nothing will stand in the way of our achieving that objective today. Why
do not we have a collective Back-Bench rebellion against the
Government, who have been reluctant to make the Bill as strong as it
could and should
be?</p><p><a name="06061623000173">The
promoter of the Bill is to be congratulated on having rescheduled
Report from its original date of 12 May so that we have a
full day for discussion. The essence of the Bill is to achieve public
accountability and to encourage public discussion of important issues.
Over the next few hours we have the chance to do just that and to
demonstrate how concerned we are and how much importance we attach to
greater transparency and accountability in the spending of
taxpayers&#146; money on overseas
aid.</p><p><a name="06061623000174">This group of
amendments is, in effect, a shopping list. We shall not be able to vote
on all of them, but I hope that in the course of our discussion we
shall be able to agree collectively that some of them are worthy of
support and inclusion in the Bill, which can then in that amended form
achieve Third Reading. Before I discuss new clauses 5 and 7 in detail
it may be more convenient for the House if I go through some of the
more technical amendments seriatim, so that Members can begin to assess
which ones should have the greatest priority for
inclusion.</p><p><a name="06061623000175">Amendment
No. 2 would leave out subsection (4) of clause 1. Why should an annual
report be able to
revise</p><a name="06061623000964"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;anything
contained in a previous annual
report&#148;?</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000176">That smacks of
rewriting history, and for the Bill to include a provision to
facilitate and achieve such an objective demonstrates just how unusual
it is in legislative terms. Are we suggesting that companies should be
able to rewrite their annual reports, or that all annual reports may be
changed willy-nilly? If there is an error in an annual report,
especially a report to Parliament, why cannot we have a system whereby
it is corrected immediately and brought to the attention of the House
rather than being held over until the next annual report? The current
provision refers not even to correcting a report but to revising it,
which is much wider; it provides for the revision of anything contained
in a previous annual
report.</p><p><a name="06061623000177"><b><a name="06061623001135">Philip
Davies (Shipley) (Con):</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that an
annual report is just that&#151;annual? If circumstances have changed
from the previous year, the facts would inevitably be included in the
next annual report so there would be no need for revision of the
earlier
report.</p><p><a name="06061623000178"><b><a name="06061623001136">Mr.
Chope:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Most
Members would assume that an annual report is just that. I certainly
cannot understand why subsection (4) is
necessary.</p><p><a name="06061623000179">Amendment
No. 3 would leave out subsection (5) of clause 1. The annual report is
an important document and I agree with the promoter and supporters of
the Bill that we need more transparency and accountability, so surely
the best way to bring that about is to make sure that the annual
report, with its specific requirements, stands alone. Why should not
that happen? From what the Minister said in Committee, it seems that
the Government have it in mind to combine the report required under the
Bill with the annual report of the 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 981</b><br>Department for International Development. However, DFID&#146;s 2006
report, which has been published since Second Reading, is well over 300
pages, so the very specific requirements for the annual report for
which the Bill provides would be lost in that great big departmental
report. Surely, there should be a specific annual report, in readable
form and accessible to as many people as possible. It would be much
better if it were not combined with any other report, as subsection (5)
would
provide.</p><p><a name="06061623000180"><b><a name="06061623001137">Philip
Davies:</b> Given the Government&#146;s track record on
burying bad news, is not the danger of including subsection (5), and
thus the strength of my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment, that it would
prevent the Government from possibly burying bad news in an important
field where we are all committed to bringing
transparency?</p><p><a name="06061623000181"><b><a name="06061623001138">Mr.
Chope:</b> My hon. Friend is right. One problem is that the
more information is available, the more difficult it is for people to
focus on what is important. It has been said that with, open government
and freedom of information, more information is being put in the public
domain in the knowledge that the public will not be able to get access
to it&#151;there is so much information that they will not be able to
find it. We should focus on the important requirements to be brought
before Parliament and debated each
year.</p><p><a name="06061623000182">Amendment No. 4
would omit the word &#147;must&#148; from clause 2 and insert the
more reasonable requirement that the Secretary of State
shall</p><a name="06061623000965"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;so far as
reasonably
practicable&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000183">include
particular matters in the annual report. The amendment demonstrates the
reasonableness of our position. It would also make it easier to add to
the provisions of the schedule. One can anticipate arguments such as,
&#147;We can&#146;t add these provisions to the schedule because we
won&#146;t be able to guarantee the production of the
information.&#148; However, if we qualify the requirement to produce
such information in the schedule by specifying that it should be
produced only so far as is reasonably practicable, the list of things

8 would require a specific report on the effectiveness of European
Community aid to which the United Kingdom contributes. I know that that
is a concern not just of my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr.
Cash), but of many other Members. We put vast sums of taxpayers&#146;
money into the European Community, but it difficult to get good
information about whether we are getting value for
money.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001013">10

Cash:</b> My hon. Friend will remember that the report of the
European Court of Auditors comes out periodically. It has not been
possible to sign off the accounts of the European Union for 12 years. I
concur with his views on that subject, because if we do not sort that
out, we will not be able to help the people who need
help.</p><p><a name="06061623000186"><b><a name="06061623001140">Mr.

growing public scepticism 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 982</b><br>about the whole European Community project. Many people feel that,
rather than giving taxpayers&#146; money to the European Community to
spend on overseas aid, it would be much better if our Government spent
that money directly and were accountable to the House for the way in
which it was spent. That would be preferable to the indirect processes
that operate at the moment. However, recognising the realities of
things as they are now, the amendment would at least create a
requirement for a specific report on the effectiveness of our
contribution to European Community aid. I hope that, for that reason,
it will commend itself to other right hon. and hon.
Members.</p><p><a name="06061623000187">Amendment No.
11 is important, as well. It deals with effectiveness. Surely we should
be concerned about the effectiveness of all bilateral aid in excess of
&#163;10 million per year. Why not require the Government to report
on that? We are talking about taxpayers&#146; money. If bilateral aid
in excess of &#163;10 million a year is going to individual
countries, why should we not have a report on it? Why should there not
be proper accountability? The Bill as currently drafted glosses over
the need for that. Although pressure was put on the Government in
Committee by my hon. Friends the Members for Boston and Skegness (Mark
Simmonds) and for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), we did not really
get a satisfactory answer out of them.</p><p><a name="06061623000188"><b><a name="06061623001141">Philip
Davies:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is incredibly
important that that aspect is included in the Bill? Some of the
greatest white elephants in many countries in the third world are
projects that were funded by the European Union, which a considerable
amount of our taxpayers&#146; money has been involved in generating.
It is therefore incredibly important that those white elephants are
highlighted to make sure that the problem does not
reoccur.</p><p><a name="06061623000189"><b><a name="06061623001142">Mr.
Chope:</b> Again, my hon. Friend is right. Information is
power. If the information is available, it will ensure that political
pressure can be put on to achieve more effective spending.</p><p><a name="06061623000190">Amendment No.
16 is expressed in an alternative form to amendment No. 11. It is less
far-reaching, but goes further than the existing wording of the Bill.
It would require the Government to identify 20 countries that are
recipients of the greatest amount of United Kingdom bilateral aid and
then report on the effectiveness of that aid. The same principle
applies to that as to amendment No. 11: if the Government do not have
that information available already, surely they should have. We are
talking about taxpayers&#146; money going in large tranches to
foreign countries. Surely we should require the Government to report to
us on the effectiveness or otherwise of that public expenditure. We
know that the Government talk a lot about delivery in public services
and not just inputs. The Bill is an opportunity for the Government to
impose requirements on themselves to deliver and to show the outputs
from the investment, or expenditure, of taxpayers&#146;
money.</p><p><a name="06061623000191">Amendment No. 9
is an alternative to amendment No. 16, which in turn is an alternative
to amendment No. 11. It is a weaker alternative because it accepts the
existing wording but increases the number of countries in respect of
which the reports would have to be produced from 20 to 30. In
Committee, the Minister 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 983</b><br>undertook to increase the number to 25, but the Government&#146;s
approach in that respect is, in my submission, self-serving, because it
is linked to the public service agreement targets&#151;and who
decides what those public service agreement targets are going to be,
but the Government? Particular countries have been selected so that the
Department can assess the effectiveness of expenditure, but,
surprisingly, those targets are not concentrated on the countries where
we have the largest expenditure of taxpayers&#146; money but chosen
according to some other set of criteria. The Bill gives us the chance
to increase public accountability. We should require the Government to
increase the number significantly from what is already contained in the
Bill. I do not support amendment No. 9, because my earlier amendment is
better. Amendment No. 10 is even weaker, but yet again, it is stronger
than the provisions in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061623000192">On amendment No.
13, why should not the Secretary of State include everything in his
assessment, rather than just what he thinks is appropriate? Why should
it just be left to the Secretary of State to decide what he thinks is
appropriate? Why should not some more objective standard
apply?</p><p><a name="06061623000193">Amendments Nos.
17 and 19 extend the requirements imposed on the Secretary of State to
report on the programmes being pursued by Government agencies, as well
as Departments and non-departmental public bodies. I will wait to hear
what the Minister says in responding to those two amendments. However,
the original clause 2 as it was passed on Second Reading contained the
expression &#147;across all departments&#148;. Many of us thought
that that added to the coherence of what the provisions sought to
achieve. The Minister has not really given a satisfactory explanation
of why the expression &#147;across all departments&#148; has been
dropped from the revised version of the Bill as it has emerged from
Committee. I wonder whether &#147;Government departments&#148; is
meant to include Government agencies and non-departmental public
bodies. If it already includes them, I would welcome that assurance
from the Minister. If it does not, surely it should.</p><p><a name="06061623000194">Amendment No.
15 relates to the issue that my hon. Friend the Member for Stone is
interested in: corruption. It would require corruption to be addressed
specifically in the annual report. It is worth referring to the text of
the amendment, if I can find the right page of my notes. My pages have
turned over; obviously it is getting windy in this part of the
Chamber.</p><p><a name="06061623000195"><b><a name="06061623001143">Mr.
Cash:</b> Does my hon. Friend accept that including the notion
of corruption as part of the observations to be made in the Secretary
of State&#146;s report would take us forward very little and not do
the job properly? The African Union itself estimates that $148 billion
a year leaves the continent because of corruption. That amount of
course dwarfs the aid and debt relief that Africa receives, on which I
have been campaigning for many years. Does he agree that it is
pointless merely to report on something that the African Union has
already
condemned?</p><p><a name="06061623000196"><b><a name="06061623001144">Mr.

link between the commitment of aid and the reduction of corruption in
recipient countries.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000197">Corruption is a really big problem. The
fact that it is rife deters many individuals from making private
contributions to overseas projects because they are worried about what
will happen to their money. In my experience, the most effective help
for overseas countries is often given through such means as direct
involvement by individuals on the ground in villages in Africa. Those
people thus know that the work that they do, or the money that they
give, is going directly to the people who need it, rather than being
siphoned off in large parts through corrupt
practices.</p><p><a name="06061623000198"><b><a name="06061623001145">Mr.
Cash:</b> Does my hon. Friend also accept that the $148
billion a year that leaves Africa because of corruption represents a
quarter of the continent&#146;s gross domestic product? I take those
figures from the excellent report &#147;The Other Side of the
Coin&#148;, which was prepared under the chairmanship of the hon.
Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley). Transparency International,
which has campaigned vigorously for many years on corruption in Africa
and elsewhere, gave significant help on the
report.</p><p><a name="06061623000199"><b><a name="06061623001146">Mr.
Chope:</b> My hon. Friend is a recognised expert in the field.
He feels strongly about the matter, as do many hon. Members. I thus
hope that we will be able to achieve a consensus that amendment No. 15
would address in some part concerns about the lack of progress on
reducing corruption. There is a need to ensure that corruption is
reduced and that money goes to the people for whom it was originally
intended.</p><p><a name="06061623000200">Amendment
No. 22 would have a similar effect to amendments Nos. 17 and 19 because
it addresses the question of whether the phrase &#147;Government
departments&#148; in clause 7 includes Government agencies and
non-departmental public
bodies.</p><p><a name="06061623000201">Amendments
Nos. 23 to 25 would add to the specific terms that will require
definition or explanation in the annual report. The Bill sets out a
series of such terms: &#147;bilateral aid&#148;; &#147;gross
national income&#148;; &#147;humanitarian assistance&#148;;
&#147;low income countries&#148;; &#147;multilateral aid&#148;;
&#147;official development assistance&#148;; and the word
&#147;sector&#148;. However, it would be in the public interest if
the annual report included an explanation of what was meant by
corruption, poverty and sustainable development. People bandy those
phrases about, but it should be possible to define them precisely. The
requirements of the Bill would be strengthened if each annual report
had to include such specific definitions and
explanations.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001014">10.15

behalf of his father, thereby avoiding tax in Nigeria. Tax revenue was
thus denied to a country to which our taxpayers contribute large sums
in aid. I do not know whether that would come under the definition of
corruption, but it would certainly help us if we knew whether that was
the case. That would be achieved if there was a proper definition in
each annual report of what was meant by
corruption.</p>

absolute poverty and relative poverty&#151;means different things to
different people? It is thus crucial that the word is properly defined.
Does he further agree that &#147;sustainable development&#148; is
one of those warm phrases that are much loved by politicians because
they use them so that they can make the right noises when speaking to
certain people? However, few who use the phrase actually seem to make

governance, both within the United Kingdom in respect of our

governance and what happens to taxpayers&#146; money when it goes to
other countries, but I depart slightly from his position because I do
not think that it is reasonable of us to impose on third-world
countries higher standards of governance than we exercise in this
country. In recent months it has become apparent that our own
Government, in our sophisticated country with its developed economy, do
not know what is going on in various areas of public life and policy,

there.</p><p><a name="06061623000214"><b><a name="06061623001155">Mr.

We have a Public Accounts Committee and a National Audit Office that
examine all those questions properly. It is inconceivable that
corruption on the scale that we witness in other countries could be
carried on in this country. I believe that our taxpayers are entitled
to know that when the money arrives in other countries, it is properly

accountability and transparency.</p><p><a name="06061623000215"><b><a name="06061623001156">Mr.

tighter requirement in amendment No. 28. As drafted, the Bill does not
require information for any relevant period to be included in the
annual report</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 987</b><br><a name="06061623000969"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;if the figures for that period are

we&#151;Parliament&#151;require that the Government provide
information, that information should be made available, and if it
cannot be made available for some reason, the annual report should set
out the reasons why it is unavailable and, by implication, when it will
become available. In effect, the clever, subtle drafting of paragraph 7
negates the requirement in paragraph 1 that the annual report
&#147;must&#148; contain various pieces of information by allowing
the publication of the information to be deferred or
delayed.</p><p><a name="06061623000218"><b><a name="06061623001157">Philip

also allow some important information that the Bill is designed to make

accountability.</p><p><a name="06061623000219"><b><a name="06061623001158">Mr.

sometimes be regarded as being somewhat sceptical about the
Government&#146;s motives. When I see provisions such as paragraph 7,
I wonder why they want excuses for not doing what Parliament requires
to be set out in legislation. Have the Government been dragged, kicking
and screaming, into accepting the Bill, or are they enthusiastic
promoters of improved transparency and accountability for the way in
which we spend our money on overseas aid?</p><p><a name="06061623000220"><b><a name="06061623001159">Mr.

gathered&#151;I am sure that the Secretary of State and the

would rather have the Bill than have to deal with the real problems
that arise from corruption. I await the Under-Secretary&#146;s

amendments, I come to the new clauses in the group. New clause
5&#151;the key provision, which leads the group&#151;goes to the
heart of the Bill. It is all about the millennium development goals and
requires that each annual report should include the Secretary of
State&#146;s assessment of the millennium development goals and the
indicators used to measure achievement, and whether they need to be
amended. The millennium developments are, in some respects, already
looking rather sick. The Chancellor of the Exchequer himself has said
that, far from the goal of primary education for all being delivered by
2015, it will not be delivered until 2130. That is so far into the
future. How meaningful is it to have a directive that must be achieved
by the year 2030? Is this not bringing into ridicule the process of
having millennium development goals? Is this not encouraging a lack of
focus on our priorities for the third
world?</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 988</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001015">10.30

rather insidious, which is characteristic of the Government, in piling
in a vast amount of time and attention to targets&#151;for example,
public services and so on&#151;and yet to leave the issue on which
the focus should be addressed in disarray? We end up by having an
enormous amount of spin, huge reports, commissions and everything else.
At the same time, there are people in Africa and other countries who
are starving to death because the relevant issues are not being dealt
with, and the money that is given by charitable organisations, for
example, is being
diverted.</p><p><a name="06061623000224"><b><a name="06061623001162">Mr.

further than they should properly be pushed on this
occasion.</p><p><a name="06061623000225"><b><a name="06061623001163">Mr.
Chope:</b> I revert to the issue of millennium goals and
poverty, Mr. Deputy Speaker. One of the goals was to halve poverty by
2015. Who would disagree with that as an objective? Some may say that
halving it would not be good enough and that it should be eliminated.
It is impossible to eliminate poverty if it is defined in terms of
relativities. However rich other people become, there will always be
some people who are not as rich as others. If we accept that there is
such a thing as absolute poverty, halving it by 2015 is fine. That is a
reasonable objective. However, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has told
us that poverty will not be halved until the year 2150. That will be
135 years too late for those who might be hoping that they will be
removed from poverty. Again, we are presented with a meaningless
concept. What is the point of having goals that are so far in the
distance? It is rather like last night, when people wondered when the
goals were coming. At least they came in the end. However, we have
millennium development goals that are unlikely to be met&#151;in this
case, of halving poverty&#151;until 135 years have
passed.</p><p><a name="06061623000226">Even more
distressing is that the goal of eliminating avoidable infant
deaths&#151;not unavoidable infant deaths&#151;is 2015. When is it
likely to be achieved? It is the year 2165&#151;in other words, 150
years later than the original target. It is only seven years since the
millennium. In another six years, perhaps the target will be extended
to 150 years further into the distance, beyond the horizon. In this
context, I think that new clause 5 would improve the Bill enormously.
It would force the Government to address the millennium goals and lead
to an open discussion on whether they are worth while, whether they
should be amended and whether there should be a focus on fewer of them
and on achieving the most important ones.</p><p><a name="06061623000227">My new clause also includes the
indicators of the goals. Some of the indicators of whether the goals
are being achieved, or are likely to be achieved, are unnecessarily
controversial and undermine the main objectives of the goals. If goal 1
is to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, why do we not concentrate
on that goal and on goal 2, which relates to universal primary
education, and on reducing child mortality, which is goal 4, rather
than getting diverted into the issue of the 12th indicator in goal 3,
which is the proportion of seats held by women in national
Parliaments?</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 989</b><br><p><a name="06061623000228">Surely there
is no comparison between the gravity of the earlier issues to which I
referred and increasing the proportion of seats held by women in
national Parliaments. It is grossly distorting to think that seats held
by women should even be considered in the same context as other,
much more important, millennium goals. The new
clause would give the Government the opportunity to engage the public
in a debate about where the millennium goals are and where they are
going.</p><p><a name="06061623000229">At present, 50
countries are going backwards on at least one of the millennium goals.
In sub-Saharan Africa, some countries are failing in every one of those
goals. There should be much more focus on them and we should think
about modifying them so that they are more realistic and attainable.
Even if we increase the proportion of public expenditure in this
country and the GDP that goes in public contributions to the developing
world, that will go nowhere near solving the problems that have been
identified in the millennium development goals.</p><p><a name="06061623000230">There are many who find it
rather depressing and debilitating to think that things are getting
worse rather than better. The facts give credence to those commentators
who argue that the effect of aid is often to increase the poverty and
the problems in other parts of the world, rather than to deal with
them, and that too much of the discussion and posturing about
third-world aid is to make us feel better, although we are not
achieving very much on the ground in the countries to which we say we
are directing our resources and
help.</p><p><a name="06061623000231">That brings me
on to new clause 7, which is an important alternative proposal. It
would provide that:</p><a name="06061623000970"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Secretary of State
shall include in each annual report observations on the overall
appropriateness and value of aid to developing countries, and set out
such barriers to development as appear to him to be relevant in the
countries to which bilateral aid is provided, for which action might be
taken or recommended...Such observations shall include the effects
of third party regulations and controls, including those promulgated by
the European Community, the World Trade Organisation and the United
Nations, which have the effect, whether unintentionally or not, of
distorting or hampering development, or of slowing it down...They
shall also include observations on the civil and judicial structures in
each country provided with bilateral aid, which either assist or hamper
the development and enforcement of property rights and the resolution
of
disputes.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000232">Having
been speaking at some length, I shall not go into great detail about
what might be the effect or the impact of being able to include new
clause 7 within the provisions of the Bill. The value of aid and the
barriers to development are important issues. There are some who might
argue that 40 years of aid and help have not helped to reduce the
dependence of African countries on aid, but instead have made them more
dependent on
it.</p><p><a name="06061623000233"><b><a name="06061623001164">Mr.

over the necessity for countries to receive aid, but also to have debt
reduction. I campaigned as chairman of the Jubilee campaign&#151;with
more than 300 Members of this place supporting me&#151;for the
reduction of third-world aid. If a reduction in debt relief results in
an increase in the amount of money made available to other countries,
they can help themselves, which is one of my main
objectives.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 990</b><br><p><a name="06061623000234"><b><a name="06061623001165">Mr.

to individual people, rather than to Governments. On 23 July 2005,
<i> The Business</i> magazine
said:</p><a name="06061623000971"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A 1 per
cent. increase in aid to Africa produces a 3.5 per cent. drop in real
per capita growth.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000235">That is a result of the way in
which the money is made available, and it demonstrates the
ineffectiveness of such aid. Under new clause 7, the Government are
required to include in the report observations about the value of aid
and about the effect of third-party regulation and controls. Bob Geldof
said:</p><a name="06061623000972"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The EU

and judicial structures when addressing the lack of property rights,
the need for a trusted judiciary, law enforcement and the rule of law.
On 3 July 2005, <i> The Business </i>said that developing countries

have houses, but not the titles to them; crops, but not deeds;

for ownership is a system of informally evolved and acknowledged
property rights. It would be useful to include Government observations
on such issues in the annual report.</p><p><a name="06061623000241">It has taken me longer than I

introduction of the Bill was prompted by the millennium development
goals of 2001, which called on Governments to increase the proportion
of gross national income spent on aid to 0.7 per cent. In considering
the annual report, I should like to focus on the requirement for all
Governments to participate in that initiative. High profile areas that
have received money include Sudan and Phuket in Thailand, with which I
was involved in the aftermath of the tsunami, and regions affected by
the Indonesian earthquake. As a nation, we are very generous in
providing money and resources, which combine with the generosity of
other countries&#151;some offer more, some less&#151;as the
millennium development goals are designed to involve everyone. Money
and resources, however, must be used wisely in the country that
receives them. We must be sure that our money is spent correctly, and
to prevent overlaps and clashes in the deployment of funds,
co-ordination is required.</p><p><a name="06061623000248">Yesterday morning I returned
from Afghanistan, where I spent a few days meeting military
organisations and civilian ministries. I met President Karzai, whom I
asked about security and international development, General Jones, the
head of NATO, and General Richards, the head of the international
security assistance force. All of them agreed that the security
umbrella provided by NATO and ISAF could be improved, as more troops
were needed. In general, the provision is working, but the level of
security provided by NATO cannot last for ever, as funds will
eventually run out. International development and reconstruction
organisations must take advantage of a small window of opportunity to
build the necessary infrastructure, win the trust of the local people
and develop local economies to provide jobs and livelihoods that are
not connected to the poppy trade.</p><p><a name="06061623000249">I visited
Helmand province, where I met a representative from the Department for
International Development and the provincial reconstruction team. They
are doing fantastic work&#151;which, however, is taking place in
isolation from work in neighbouring provinces and other parts of
Afghanistan. It is a silo project, and there is no overall co-ordinator
in Kabul to make sure that those vast sums are spent correctly. When
visiting Kabul and 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 992</b><br>Kandahar I was deluged with details of international organisations and
operations spending. All of them spend vast sums but, I am afraid, they
work separately and follow their own agenda. Myriad organisations and
ministries are active in Afghanistan, including UN missions and
departments across Kabul, EU missions and delegations, and embassies,
which provide cash, but also issue caveats about the way in which that
money is spent. DFID is present, as is the United States Agency for
International Development, ISAF, the Christian Foundation for Children
and Aging and the Afghan Counter Narcotics Trust

must consider how our money fits into that. I am pleased that the
Secretary of State has joined us. I hope that the annual report for
which the Bill provides will contain an analysis of how our money, and
other money, is being
spent.</p><p><a name="06061623000257">I shall cite
two examples to show how money is being spent and, unfortunately,
wasted. The first relates to a school that was built by a
non-governmental organisation to the north of Kandahar&#151;a
commendable project to provide education in a small town where there
has been no form of education for a couple of decades, because of the
various wars. Unfortunately, once the school was built the poppy fields
to the north of the town were scorched, taking away the
livelihoods&#151;illegal though they were&#151;of all the people
who lived in that town. They have abandoned the town, leaving behind a
brand-new 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 993</b><br>school building. That is a good example of lack of co-ordination between
the various international operations in
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06061623000258">The
second example relates to bilateral aid, which was mentioned earlier.
An embassy offered to build so many miles of road in Afghanistan. There
are already many contractors building roads there and much work has
been done in that respect. The condition that the
donor country placed on the project required that
country to provide the contractors. Limited funds were made available
for the road building, and by the time the firm of contractors had
flown out all its equipment, the time, and the funding, had almost run
out. Had that money been allocated to a senior organisation in
Afghanistan, it could have paid local contractors to continue the road
building, rather than wasting time getting another company to come out
and do the same
work.</p><p><a name="06061623000259"><b><a name="06061623001176">Mr.
Cash:</b> As the Secretary of State is in the Chamber, is my
hon. Friend conscious, in the context of what should be included in the
annual report under clause 2, that the Bill does not provide for it to
include figures on corruption? There is a reference in the Bill to
progress in</p><a name="06061623000976"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the better
management of aid, including the prevention of
corruption&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000260">but no
figures that would enable us to identify where the problem
lies.</p><p><a name="06061623000261"><b><a name="06061623001177">Mr.
Ellwood:</b> As my hon. Friend observes, the Secretary of
State is present and heard his comments. The schedule provides a
framework for the annual report, but the content of the report is for
the Department. I hope that the comments on corruption have been heard.
Corruption is widespread in Afghanistan. People there are not used to
democracy, and tribal loyalties are strong. That is how a great deal of
money is lost. If the Secretary of State can include such an analysis,
it would put in perspective the challenges posed by the country to
which the aid is
going.</p><p><a name="06061623000262"><b><a name="06061623001178">Mr.
Chope:</b> During his visit to Afghanistan, was my hon. Friend
able to assess the extent to which the money put in to help there is
being wasted? For example, has the vast sum spent on subsidising people
to give up farming poppies been well
invested?</p><p><a name="06061623000263"><b><a name="06061623001179">Mr.
Ellwood:</b> We are straying a little, but that is an
important point. Unfortunately, last year&#146;s poppy crops were the
largest ever recorded. About 4,000 tonnes of opium is being produced
each year. We have spent &#163;400 million on the poppy
trade, and because last year&#146;s crop was the largest
ever&#151;that is an estimate, of course, because the trade is
conducted on the black market&#151;questions must be asked about how
that money was spent. That is why I argue that there should be one
person or one organisation in charge, with the authority to make
decisions, co-ordinate and use the finances and resources that donor
countries provide. At present, so many conditions are attached to such
aid that progress is being held back and movement away from reliance on
the poppy trade is being hindered. That is crucial for the success of
Afghanistan and for determining whether the money spent there by DFID,
the Foreign Office and NATO is well spent.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 994</b><br><p><a name="06061623000264"><b><a name="06061623001180">Mr.

about my visit to Afghanistan on another occasion. It was an
eye-opening experience, and I look forward to taking up those points
with the Secretary of State on a future
occasion.</p><p><a name="06061623000267">In
conclusion, I strongly support the Bill, and congratulate the right
hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill on bringing it this
far. I hope that it does not encounter any further hurdles as we
approach Third Reading. I strongly emphasise the need for co-ordination
and accountability for British money spent on international
aid.</p><p><a name="06061623000268"><b><a name="06061623001183">Mr.
Cash:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to
the debate. I regard the Bill as significant. In the light of my
earlier comments, I hope that the Secretary of State, who is still in
his place, will recall that on a number of occasions I have paid
particular tribute to him and also to the Prime Minister and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer for their efforts, which I believe to be
genuine, to deal with the problem of world poverty and the difficulties
that arise in Africa, as well as in other countries in the developing
world. It is often pointed out that international development is
focused on only one continent. There are, of course, many difficulties
elsewhere in the world.</p><p><a name="06061623000269">However, the problem of
corruption, the issue with which I am primarily concerned, will not be
dealt with by the Bill. The Bill provides for an undeniably useful
exercise&#151;the production of an annual report and statistics
showing progress towards the United Nations 0.7 per cent. expenditure
target, aid effectiveness and millennium development goals 1 to 7,
policy coherence and millennium development goal 8 and transparency. At
that point, I would have to pause to ask myself whether the
observations that the Secretary of State thinks it appropriate to make
about</p><a name="06061623000977"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the
contribution by Government departments to the promotion of transparency
in...the provision of aid, and...the use made of aid
provided&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000270">would be
meaningful without dealing with the problem of
corruption.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001017">11 am</h5><p><a name="06061623000271">I recently spoke informally to
a Minister in this Government; I will not disclose which one, or their
sexual orientation&#151;I am sorry, I mean that I will not disclose
their sex. When I asked that person what they thought about what was
going on in terms of corruption in such countries, they gave a clear
indication that they were worried about it. I therefore assume that the
Secretary of State himself is deeply worried about it. The observations
that he thinks appropriate about the contribution made by Government
Departments to the promotion of transparency should include
observations about the 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 995</b><br>lack of sufficient control inherent in the procedures that are made

<p><a name="06061623000272">Clause 6 says that there should
be observations about</p><a name="06061623000978"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;progress in relation
to...the prevention of corruption&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000273">I would have expected that as part of
those observations, recommendations would be made by the Secretary of
State. The existing legislation on dealing with corruption and the
audit arrangements that go with it is inadequate, and he could explain
to the House exactly what could be done to improve the
situation.</p><p><a name="06061623000274">I take the
good will of the Ministers concerned for granted, but what
distinguishes good will from action is whether there is the political
will to deal with the problem, the scale of which is clear from the
African Union report showing that as much as $148 billion a year is
going in the wrong direction. That represents a quarter of the gross
domestic product of the continent of Africa. The schedule to the Bill
should contain specific information on that subject. It
states:</p><a name="06061623000979"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;An
annual report must include the following information for the most
recent relevant
period&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000275">It goes on to
list bilateral aid, multilateral aid, the amount of multilateral
official assistance and various other complicated formulas almost
entirely dealing with aid.</p><p><a name="06061623000276">That is all very useful.
However, we should bear in mind the amount of aid cited in the report
by the African Union, assisted by that renowned organisation,
Transparency International, of which I am sure the Secretary of State
is well aware. In March, the distinguished all-party group on Africa,
which is chaired by the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh
Bayley)&#151;who I am afraid cannot be with us today for some
reason&#151;produced a report saying that the amount of money lost
through corruption &#147;dwarfs&#148; the amount of money that goes
into aid and debt reduction. We are talking about monumental sums. I
have even seen a report suggesting that $220 billion has been
wrongfully diverted in relation to Nigeria alone.</p><p><a name="06061623000277">As for the observations of the
Secretary of State on what a Government Department may think or do in
relation to the systems in place to guarantee that the money is going
to the right place, one would expect as a minimum that some reference
to the statistics and figures relating to corruption should be included
under the schedule. Without that information, it will be very difficult
to calculate the balance of proportionality between aid on the one hand
and debt reduction on the other, both of which are dwarfed by the
amount of money lost through corruption.</p><p><a name="06061623000278">There is a great need for that
to be provided, as we are told that it is extremely important that we
should relate what goes on in this House to what goes on in the minds
of the public. We have often found that the best way to keep a secret
is to make a speech in the House of Commons. I would be very surprised
if anything that we say in this debate gets on to the BBC tomorrow
morning, although there may be one or two references. The newspapers
and the media in general pay little attention to parliamentary
proceedings. That is deeply regrettable, undemocratic and
counter-productive. The media give a great deal of attention to the
question of world poverty, and there is a great deal of concern among
the public at large, at whom the information in 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 996</b><br>the annual report is intended to be directed. They should therefore have
the information provided to Parliament about the extent of corruption,
as analysed by the Government, the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund and other organisations.</p><p><a name="06061623000279">Despite my enthusiasm for the
Bill&#146;s general objectives, it will fall short if that
information is not included in the annual report. I dare say that the
people who are giving their &#163;5, their 50p or their substantial
charitable donations to emergency relief operations led by the likes of
Bob Geldof and Bono, and others not of celebrity status in the Churches
and non-governmental organisations, would be pretty horrified to
discover that the accumulated money that they make available through
their generous donations and their emotional commitment, which I share,

should cover corruption.</p><p><a name="06061623000286"><b><a name="06061623001188">Mr.
Cash:</b> My right hon. Friend makes a fair point, but I
revert to my primary question of whether providing information will
solve the problem. In respect of your point, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I
simply mention that paragraph (3) of the schedule specifically
mentions, for understandable reasons of calculating the amount of money
that goes to the right place&#151;the people for whom we should have
passionate concern&#151;&#147;multilateral organisations&#148;
and humanitarian assistance. Government money is inextricably bound up
with money that is made available through charitable organisations,
which often act as agencies for the Government in delivering public
aid. Money is delivered, with some criticism, by some non-governmental
organisations and charitable organisations. I therefore understand your
concern but I should also like to make the
point&#151;</p><p><a name="06061623000287"><b><a name="06061623001189">Mr.
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is
not challenging my ruling. It is clear that the Bill requires the
Secretary of State to report annually on the total expenditure of his
Department.</p><p><a name="06061623000288"><b><a name="06061623001190">Mr.
Cash:</b> I accept that. I simply make the point that there is
interweaving between the money made available by charitable
organisations and Government 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 997</b><br>money, simply because those organisations, through their administration,
receive public funds from the Department.</p><p><a name="06061623000289">I should like to consider
corruption, with which amendment No. 23 deals, and its definition. My
hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) proposed the
inclusion of &#147;corruption&#148; and its definition in the Bill.
The Prime Minister&#146;s initiative, the Commission for Africa,
reported in detail on corruption in &#147;Our Common
Interest&#148;. The matter was to be considered at the Gleneagles
summit on that tragic day when the bombing in London happened. The
Prime Minister had to come back at short notice to attend to his duties
in Westminster and at No. 10. Governance and
corruption were on the agenda for that day but were sidelined by other
events.</p><p><a name="06061623000290">What
corruption would be reported under the Bill if the amendment were
accepted? If corruption is included in the annual report, it is clearly
important, as my hon. Friend said, that we know exactly what it is.
&#147;Corruption&#148; appears in some emanations from the European
Union, for example, in relation to the European arrest warrant, but
without a definition. There is a way in which to define corruption.
Another private Member&#146;s Bill, which is about corruption,
contains such a definition. I am glad that the promoter of the Bill
that we are discussing is a signatory to the other measure, although it
is a pity that he did not include more effective provisions for dealing
with corruption in his Bill.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001018">11.15
am</h5><p><a name="06061623000291">I
wait with interest to hear from the Under-Secretary why the Government
are so anxious to avoid my proposals for dealing with corruption. As
amended, with the inclusion of &#147;corruption&#148;, properly
defined, the Bill would enable us at least to get information, thus
allowing us to ascertain the relevance of corruption to dwarfing aid
and debt-reduction moneys. The fact that the Bill does not deal with
corruption, even in the schedule, raises serious concern. If the
measure proceeds to the House of Lords, will the Government be prepared
not only to tackle the definition of corruption but to include in the
schedule arrangements to ensure that statistics on corruption are made
available as a contribution to the transparency arrangements, for which
clause 6 provides, and to do something about it?</p><p><a name="06061623000292">It is not
credible for the Government, who are doubtless grappling with
corruption behind the scenes, to eliminate from discussion provisions
for external audit, for which new clause 1 would have provided, when
corruption is the kernel of the problems of people in developing
countries, especially in Africa. It is therefore a moral question.
However, there is also a practical question of why we are left only
with information and reporting. Even that is insufficient on
corruption. That would be true even if amendment No. 23 were
accepted.</p><p><a name="06061623000293">I have been
a Member of Parliament long enough to understand that Bills are not
perfect and I do not suggest that we should expect them to be perfect.
However, the object of our debates is to improve the quality of Bills
and the intent, purpose and effect of our legislation. People would
become disillusioned if they supposed that there was a deliberate
attempt to exclude proposals to deal genuinely with corruption in 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 998</b><br>such an important Bill. It is inconceivable that the Secretary of State,
the Prime Minister or the Chancellor of the Exchequer, all of whom I
have commended, would be party to excluding corruption from the Bill by
rejecting amendment No. 23. If the Secretary of State intervened now to
answer that point, I would be
glad.</p><p><a name="06061623000294">We all know that
corruption exists, and we all know that the Bill does not address it.
We know that my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment would provide some
measure of improvement in terms of providing information. We also know
that people outside the House are deeply concerned to know why all this
poverty still exists despite the fact that huge sums of
money&#151;including their own&#151;are being provided to the
countries. If the amount of corruption dwarfs the amount of aid and
debt reduction, that should be the No. 1 question that a Bill of this
importance should answer for people.</p><p><a name="06061623000295">Fortunately, it so happens that
we have a House of Lords. However, I hope that the Secretary of State
will be able to give me an assurance, either himself or through his
Minister, that they will deal with this question. It is as big a
question as any that faces the world today. We need to solve the
problems that are reported on our television screens and our radios.
Given the number of times that the Secretary of State appears to talk
about such matter, it seems that it is not just information in an
annual report that he will have to deal with. There is also the
question of what he is going to do about it.</p><p><a name="06061623000296">I do not say
that in a critical fashion, although I am somewhat suspicious, given
the time that I have devoted to trying to get the issue across, as to
why it has been sidestepped. I am not suggesting that it has been
sidestepped by the selection of amendments, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I
understand the reasons; it was because the scope of the Bill was
changed in Committee. However, that does not alter the fundamental
question. We must not get hung up on the procedural questions when the
real question is whether in substance the Bill deals with corruption.
The amendment that my hon. Friend has tabled would certainly improve
matters, but the Bill should deal with the issue in a more substantial
manner.</p><p><a name="06061623000297">The report of
the Commission for Africa contains a number of important statements
that should be part of the information on corruption and which would be
included in the annual report under my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment.
For example, page 14 of the Commission for Africa&#146;s report
states:</p><a name="06061623000982"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Improving
accountability is the job of African leaders. They can do that by
broadening the participation of ordinary people...They can also help
build accountable budgetary
processes&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000298">In that way,
the people of Africa could see how money was being raised and where it
was going. How are people to see how the money is raised and where it
is going if they are not able to get to the bottom of the matter
through the provisions in the Bill or through the amendments and new
clauses?</p><p><a name="06061623000299">My proposals
are that there should be an external audit of the Public Accounts
Committees in each of the countries involved, and an assessment made by
the Secretary of State of whether those countries are doing the job
properly. That is not a form of colonialisation of their Public
Accounts Committees. Our taxpayers have a direct interest in the issue,
as do all those who 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 999</b><br>make contributions. The world at large also has an interest in ensuring
that those countries are governed in what the Commission for Africa and
the African Union insist is the right way.</p><p><a name="06061623000300">The Commission for Africa
report goes on to
state:</p><a name="06061623000983"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;That
kind of transparency can help combat corruption, which African
governments must root out. Developed nations can help in this too.
Money and state assets stolen from the people of Africa by corrupt
leaders must be repatriated. Foreign banks must be obliged by law to
inform on suspicious
accounts.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000301">How will they
be able to inform on suspicious accounts if the information is not made
available in the annual report? The Bill&#146;s very title specifies
a requirement for reporting and transparency. In other words, it cries
out for further information and action.</p><p><a name="06061623000302">The report
goes
on:</p><a name="06061623000984"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Without
progress in governance, all other reforms will have limited
impact.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000303">Chapter 4 of the
report deals with the kind of information one would expect to find in
the annual report under my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment. Its summary
includes the question
of</p><a name="06061623000985"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Increasing
transparency of revenues and budgets, especially in countries rich in
natural resources; this also makes a powerful contribution to conflict
prevention&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000304">It
goes on to refer to tackling corruption as a main item, including the
repatriation of stolen assets. Accountability is part of the
transparency referred to in clause 6, of the new clause that my hon.
Friend has so ably described, and of his amendment on
corruption.</p><p><a name="06061623000305"><b><a name="06061623001191">Mr.
Greg Knight:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend about the need to
measure the effectiveness of aid. Does he agree, however, that one of
the least satisfactory ways of doing that would be to allow the
Department to measure the success of its own gifts overseas? Would not
it be better if another, independent body were to deal with
that&#151;perhaps the Public Accounts
Committee?</p><p><a name="06061623000306"><b><a name="06061623001192">Mr.
Cash:</b> I have discussed that very matter with the Chairman
of the Public Accounts Committee. The PAC has responsibility for
ensuring that money spent by the Department for International
Development&#151;which falls squarely into the transparency
provisions in clause 6&#151;is properly spent. I have also had
discussions with the National Audit Office on the matters about which I
am specifically concerned, and about the mechanics of dealing with
corruption in the context of the Public Accounts Committee. This is
directly related to clause
6&#151;</p><p><a name="06061623000307"><b><a name="06061623001193">Mr.
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman should remember
that we are debating a report that is to be brought to Parliament by
the Secretary of State. Any other arrangements are outwith this
discussion.</p><p><a name="06061623000308"><b><a name="06061623001194">Mr.
Cash:</b> The accountability that derives from the information
made available in the annual report is part of the accountability
process that the Bill purports to put forward. In relation to certain
comments that have been made, the Secretary of State was himself a
major participant in the Commission for Africa. I see from its report
that it was chaired by the Prime Minister, and that the Secretary of
State for International Development&#151;who is here today&#151;and
the Chancellor 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1000</b><br>of the Exchequer also participated, as did Sir Bob Geldof and many other
distinguished people. The report states:</p><a name="06061623000986"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In this section we
discuss participation, then consider key mechanisms of accountability:
constitutional structures, parliaments and political
processes&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000309">That is
precisely what we are doing now. That is part and parcel of the
information that is to be made available in the annual report, and with
which my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment on corruption deals
specifically. The amendment is specifically about providing information
on corruption in order to assist the Government and the promoter of the
Bill to achieve the objectives of transparency that are clearly set out
in clause 6. I wait with interest&#151;</p><p><a name="06061623000310"><b><a name="06061623001195">Mr.
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I understand the point that the
hon. Gentleman is trying to make, but he cannot go on repeating
himself. When he reads the <i> Official Report </i>tomorrow, he will be
horrified to see how much he has done so. I have been very tolerant
with him, but he should now make his remarks more concise. The
particular point that he is trying to address has now been very
adequately dealt with.</p><p><a name="06061623000311"><b><a name="06061623001196">Mr.
Cash:</b> I am grateful to you for that, Mr. Deputy
Speaker.</p><p><a name="06061623000312">As the report
clearly states, corruption is a by-product of weak governance, and that
is something that we would all want to resolve. The issue also arises
in the context of
procurement&#151;</p><p><a name="06061623000313"><b><a name="06061623001197">Mr.
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman must understand
that this is not a debate about corruption, but about whether the
report at the heart of the Bill should include corruption. We cannot
have a separate debate about the degree of corruption that may or may
not exist.</p><p><a name="06061623000314"><b><a name="06061623001198">Mr.
Cash:</b> I understand that full well, and my point is that it
is not possible to deal with my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment with
respect to including corruption as a part of the information without
explaining what that corruption is and its
extent&#151;</p><p><a name="06061623000315"><b><a name="06061623001199">Mr.
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Accepting what the hon. Gentleman
says, I am perhaps a better judge of that point than him. He has
explained to the House more fully than is necessary, within the terms
of the amendments, what corruption
is.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001019">11.30
am</h5><p><a name="06061623000316"><b><a name="06061623001200">Mr.
Cash:</b> I am grateful for that, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I have
more than adequately prescribed how I believe that the Bill could deal
with the serious questions that will arise from the public information
that it would provide and the consequent action that would be
necessary. No doubt there will be ample opportunity in future to
discuss those matters in more detail.</p><p><a name="06061623000317">In conclusion, I have made
substantial and important observations about what is not in the Bill
and how it could be improved. Will the Secretary of State and the
Minister explain why the Bill is deficient in respect of the matters
that I have addressed, which are of fundamental importance to the
people of this 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1001</b><br>country in understanding the nature of world poverty and the extent to
which the amount of corruption dwarfs aid and debt
relief?</p><p><a name="06061623000318"><b><a name="06061623001201">Mr.
Chope:</b> Does my hon. Friend accept that it cannot be that
difficult to get hard data on the extent of corruption when Franklin
Cudjoe, the Ghanaian director of the Imani think tank, has asserted
that &#163;4,700 is stolen by African Governments from their people
every second?</p><p><a name="06061623000319"><b><a name="06061623001202">Mr.
Cash:</b> That is an astonishing statistic on which to finish
my speech. That is the kind of thing that really concerns people. They
are more interested in what is really going on than they are in the
reporting process or the procedures, which would prevent us from having
a proper discussion of the real
issues.</p><p><a name="06061623000320"><b><a name="06061623001203">Philip
Davies:</b> I support the Bill and I congratulate the right
hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) on
getting it so far. I am here not to delay or wreck the process but to
support and strengthen the Bill, which has an awful lot of merit. My
hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) urged us not
to delay the Bill&#146;s passage unnecessarily, and I intend to take
his advice. I am sure that he would also agree that it is crucial that
all legislation is scrutinised properly in the House. On such an
important issue, on which many of my constituents feel incredibly
strongly, it is essential that we try to strengthen the Bill in every
way possible, which my hon. Friend&#146;s amendments go a long way to
doing.</p><p><a name="06061623000321">When I talk
about the importance of scrutinising legislation, I do so in the full
knowledge that this is the first day of debate on private
Members&#146; Bills since the tragic death of our former right hon.
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, who always made it clear to me how
important proper scrutiny of legislation was. I am sure that everyone
in the House feels that these debates on a Friday will be the weaker
for not having Eric Forth&#146;s forthright, witty and important
contributions.</p><p><a name="06061623000322">Amendment No. 2, which deals
with annual reports being able to revise anything contained in a
previous annual report, is particularly important. As I said earlier,
an annual report talks about what has happened in the previous year,
and if something has happened that revises something in a previous
annual report, surely it would be contained anyway. The subsection
concerned is unnecessary.</p><p><a name="06061623000323">The other main concern about an
annual report revising anything contained in a previous annual report
is that we may have to wait for up to 11 months for revisions to appear
so that people are aware of them. Surely if anything needs revising, it
should be done immediately and openly, not buried away in a later
annual report under some obscure heading or subsection so that people
do not realise that there has been a revision. The whole Bill is about
reporting and transparency and my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment
improves both the reporting and transparency of information. Should the
amendment not be passed, will the Minister consider ensuring that any
revisions 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1002</b><br>are made in an appendix to a future annual report, so that they are
perfectly clear, not buried away and difficult to find?</p><p><a name="06061623000324">Amendment No. 3 deals with the
subsection that states:</p><a name="06061623000987"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Nothing in this Act
shall be read as preventing an annual report being combined with any
other report which the Secretary of State lays before either House of
Parliament.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000325">I understand
the many advantages of combining annual reports with other reports laid
before Parliament. Obviously, the first advantage is the simple one
that it might save considerable time and money, as printing costs are
expensive. The reason that Opposition as well as Government Members
feel that the Bill is important is that it is about transparency and
proper reporting, which we want. My fear is that, if the annual report
is combined with other reports, it might get buried and undermined and
not receive the focus that it deserves. As we have a Government who
think that it is important to bury bad news, I would not like to think
that bad news on this subject was being buried deliberately in other
reports.</p><p><a name="06061623000326"><b><a name="06061623001204">Mr.
Cash:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that, if the report does
not include the right material in the first place, including matters
such as corruption, it will not attract a great deal of attention
anyway? Does he have any idea of what has been the track record of
reports that have emerged along the lines that he has described? How
often do they get completely overlooked, gather dust and achieve next
to nothing?</p><p><a name="06061623000327"><b><a name="06061623001205">Philip
Davies:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. As I mentioned,
an awful lot of what goes on in this place does not get properly
scrutinised. The bigger and bulkier a report, the less chance it has of
being properly scrutinised. It is therefore vital that the annual
report stands alone so that it does not get buried in others that will
not get scrutinised.</p><p><a name="06061623000328"><b><a name="06061623001206">Mr.
Cash:</b> If the report focused specifically on the fact that
corruption dwarfed aid and debt reduction, I suspect that that really
would get a headline. Does my hon. Friend
agree?</p><p><a name="06061623000329"><b><a name="06061623001207">Philip
Davies:</b> I certainly agree. It is crucial for the right
information, and clear information, to be provided. My hon.
Friend&#146;s amendments go a long way towards ensuring that the
information is clearer, and that people understand what is behind
it.</p><p><a name="06061623000330">It is also
crucial for the reports to stand alone and to be given the scrutiny
that they deserve and that the public demand. The reports will not be
scrutinised just by Members of both Houses; many of my constituents
will want to find out what is happening to international development
aid. Many of them feel passionately about the subject and I would not
want them to experience difficulties in finding the relevant part of a
report because it was buried under something else.</p><p><a name="06061623000331">The Secretary of State must be
held accountable, and anything that makes the information clearer for
that purpose must be welcome.</p><p><a name="06061623000332"><b><a name="06061623001208">Mr.
Greg Knight:</b> The duty to report does not cover reporting
on technical assistance, although significant 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1003</b><br>aid is often provided by way of assistance rather than cash. There is
also no duty to report on projects carried out jointly with other donor
Governments. Are those not further weaknesses in the
Bill?</p><p><a name="06061623000333"><b><a name="06061623001209">Philip
Davies:</b> My right hon. Friend is right. I shall deal later
with why the report should include reference to taxpayers&#146; money
spent in different ways from the one covered by the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061623000334"><b><a name="06061623001210">Mr.
Cash:</b> Will my hon. Friend consider the wording of the
critical clauses, clauses 5 and 6? Clause 6
says</p><a name="06061623000988"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Secretary of State shall include in each annual report such
observations as he thinks appropriate&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000335">and the wording in clause 5 is similar.
The words &#147;as he thinks appropriate&#148; are surely a let-out
in law to enable the Secretary of State not to include observations
that he does not want to include. That is a major defect in the Bill,
because it prevents the Secretary of State from having to include
material that we would regard as important.</p><p><a name="06061623000336"><b><a name="06061623001211">Philip
Davies:</b> My hon. Friend is right. That point is made in one
of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch
(Mr. Chope), and I shall say more about it later.</p><p><a name="06061623000337">It seems to me that the main
purpose of allowing the Secretary of State to include the annual report
with other reports is to save printing costs and to save time for those
who prepare the reports and those who examine what has been produced.
Surely the money that would be saved is a fraction of the amount that
is spent on aid for developing countries. Given that so much
taxpayers&#146; money is rightly being spent on aid, it is far more
important for the report to stand on its own so that we can see exactly
how that money is being spent than for relatively small amounts to be
saved on stationery and printing for the convenience of Departments. I
hope very much that my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment is
accepted.</p><p><a name="06061623000338">I listened
carefully to my hon. Friend&#146;s skilful explanation of amendments
Nos. 4 and 5. There was a great deal in what he said, but on reflection
I feel that those amendments may not be the strongest that have been
tabled. Although I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s reasons for
wishing to replace &#147;must&#148; with</p><a name="06061623000989"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;shall so far as reasonably
practicable&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000339">it may
cause more problems than it solves by allowing the Secretary of State
to avoid publishing some information that we would like to see. With
respect, I hope that my hon. Friend decides not to press his
amendments. In fact, they were probably intended to be probing
amendments.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001020">11.45
am</h5><p><a name="06061623000340">Amendment No. 8
is particularly important. It would insert the words</p><a name="06061623000990"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;European Community aid
to which the UK contributes, and...other multilateral aid to which
the UK contributes&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000341">My
right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) referred
to that earlier. It is an essential part of what should be in the Bill,
because it concerns taxpayers&#146; money. It should be relatively
immaterial whether that money is given directly or indirectly, or

Greg Knight:</b> Would not the inclusion of those words also
make the Government look better? The Government are obsessed with spin.
If the report included reference to money given by Britain through its
contributions to the EU budget, there would be a higher aid figure on
which the press would rightly
focus.</p><p><a name="06061623000343"><b><a name="06061623001213">Philip

would have been in the Government&#146;s best interests to make the
information available.</p><p><a name="06061623000344">The money spent by British
taxpayers through the EU is often spent on white elephant projects that
are never completed. There are many examples of such projects
throughout the world and the Government themselves have been concerned
about that. It is crucial for the public to have a fair idea of how all
that taxpayers&#146; money has been spent, not just a narrow
proportion of it. A considerable amount of money is now spent on
European Union and other multilateral aid. I hope that my hon. Friend
will press amendment No. 8, because many members of the public would be
very interested to know how the money is spent and
where it is being wasted. They might also realise what a washed-up
organisation the European Union is and recognise that we should be
spending much less on it generally, not just for international aid
purposes.</p><p><a name="06061623000345">Amendments
Nos. 9 to 11 are some of the weaker amendments that my hon. Friend has
tabled, and to which I have added my name. I think that they too are
probing amendments, intended to establish the extent to which we should
report what is going on. Perhaps we should concentrate on the
priorities. Increasing the number of countries covered might not be of
great advantage, but at least it would produce more transparency. After
all, the Bill is all about reporting and transparency, and extending
the number of countries included in the report would provide the
transparency that I am sure we all want. My hon. Friend made some
important points in the amendments, but I am not sure that they are the
most important amendments that he has tabled.</p><p><a name="06061623000346"><b><a name="06061623001214">Mr.

well.</p><p><a name="06061623000347"><b><a name="06061623001215">Philip

make a little more progress first.</p><p><a name="06061623000348">I hope that
my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch will not press all these

explored in this debate&#151;those that would strengthen the Bill and
deliver what not only we in this House want, but what members of the

<p><a name="06061623000349">I turn to
amendment No. 15 and corruption, which my hon. Friend the Member Stone
mentioned. The link between corruption and how aid is spent, and
achieving a reduction in corruption, are crucial to the 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1005</b><br>whole nature of this Bill. The amendment would provide a valuable
mechanism to enable the public properly to judge how effective such aid
is. Using aid as a tool to reduce corruption is a vital step for
long-term aid development and surely has to be a top priority for the
Government. I do not see how an annual report on international aid,
which is trying to encourage transparency, can stand without promoting
a link between the commitment of aid and the reduction of corruption in
recipient
countries.</p><p><a name="06061623000350"><b><a name="06061623001216">Mr.
Cash:</b> Given the significance of what my hon. Friend, my
hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and I have said,
would my hon. Friend be as astonished as I would be to discover that
the Bill&#146;s promoter and sponsors would not support that
amendment in a vote? However, to fail to do so would undermine the
whole information and transparency
system.</p><p><a name="06061623000351"><b><a name="06061623001217">Philip
Davies:</b> I very much agree with my hon. Friend. This issue
is so fundamental to what the Bill seeks to achieve
that I cannot see how we can allow it to progress if it does not
contain that important amendment. This issue goes to the heart of what
the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr.
Clarke) is rightly trying to achieve through his Bill. I commend it in
many respects, but I hope that he will acknowledge that this amendment
would strengthen his excellent Bill and provide much-needed
information. To reduce corruption must surely be a top Government
priority, but in the public&#146;s mind and in our minds, lots of aid
gets wasted, in that what it is spent on proves to be corrupt. My hon.
Friend the Member for Stone made it clear how much corruption actually
exists.</p><p><a name="06061623000352">In producing
an annual report, it is crucial that the Secretary of State be held
accountable for the money that is spent and where it goes, and that he
ensures that it gets into the right hands. As the Government themselves
have acknowledged, on too many occasions, far too much aid does not get
through to the people who need it. In certain countries, much direct
budgetary support for Governments is spent on palaces and building up
arms, rather than on the purpose for which it was intended. I know that
the Government are concerned about that, and it is surely a crucial
part of the report; we cannot allow such issues to be overlooked. The
purpose of the Bill is transparency. It would be perverse to allow such
important information to be buried away somewhere&#151;in other
reports, for example&#151;or not to be reported at all, given that
these issues are of concern to many members of the
public.</p><p><a name="06061623000353">Amendment
No. 22 is similar to amendments Nos. 17 and 19. The important point is
that we are talking about taxpayers&#146; money. If the amendment of
my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch were agreed to, the report
would detail how all taxpayers&#146; money is spent, not only the
money that happened to be channelled directly through the Department. I
hope that the House will agree that what is important here is that all
taxpayers&#146; money be properly accounted for; which agency such
money goes through should be irrelevant. I therefore 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1006</b><br>urge Members to support amendment No. 22, so that there is greater
transparency in respect of how taxpayers&#146; money is
spent.</p><p><a name="06061623000354"><b><a name="06061623001218">Mr.
Cash:</b> Will my hon. Friend also note that the distinguished
Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee has just come into the House?
He is doubtless taking a very close interest in this Bill because,
after all, it is the Department for International Development that has
to account to him for these
matters.</p><p><a name="06061623000355"><b><a name="06061623001219">Philip
Davies:</b> I agree wholeheartedly with my hon.
Friend&#151;that is indeed why my hon. Friend the Member for
Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) is taking such a close interest in this Bill.
He, too, doubtless supports a Bill allowing for greater transparency of
Government spending; indeed, his excellent Committee spends all its
time ensuring that Government money is spent effectively. Making sure
that this Government do that is a difficult challenge, but his
Committee certainly plays a great role in ensuring that any instances
when money is not spent properly are highlighted. He will be
particularly interested in amendment No. 22, which would allow all
taxpayers&#146; money to be properly accounted for in these annual
reports, rather than just that spent directly by the
Department.</p><p><a name="06061623000356">My
hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch made a great job of explaining
why amendments Nos. 23 to 25, which seek to define the terms
&#147;corruption&#148;, &#147;poverty&#148; and
&#147;sustainable development&#148;, are so important, and why
those terms should be defined. It is clear that they all mean very
different things to different people. My hon. Friend the Member for
Stone made clear how &#147;corruption&#148; is defined in the
Corruption Bill. I hope that Members will look at that definition
closely and perhaps seek to include it in the Bill before us.</p><p><a name="06061623000357">As I said,
&#147;poverty&#148; and &#147;sustainable development&#148;
mean very different things to different people. Poverty can be judged
in absolute or relative terms. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Christchurch made clear, if we always refer to poverty in relative
terms, we will never eradicate it. We should focus on ensuring that
everyone gets wealthier and absolute poverty is eliminated. That should
be our top priority and this report should make it clear what we are
trying to achieve. Sustainable development is one of those warm phrases
that politicians love to use in front of voters. It sounds very nice
and as if we care about the same things as they do, but it is used
without anyone having a particular idea what they mean by it. Surely in
a Bill that focuses on transparency we should make it clear what we
mean by words such as poverty, corruption and sustainable development
so that we can see whether the Government are achieving their goal of
eliminating
them.</p><p><a name="06061623000358"><b><a name="06061623001220">Mr.
Cash:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that it would not be
difficult to assume and declare that sustainable development means
keeping people alive who otherwise would die from starvation and
poverty?</p><p><a name="06061623000359"><b><a name="06061623001221">Philip
Davies:</b> I agree. One does not need the wisdom of Solomon
to come up with an adequate definition of those terms. I am sure that
my hon. Friend would offer his services to ensure that they were
properly defined, should the Government and the House accept the
amendments, as I hope they will.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1007</b><br><p><a name="06061623000360">Amendment No. 5 is similar to
amendment No. 4, and&#151;as I said earlier&#151;on reflection I am
not sure that it is one of the stronger amendments. Amendments Nos. 29
to 31 address the waste of money. My hon. Friend pointed out the amount
of bilateral aid that has been misused, stolen or diverted into
fraudulent schemes, and surely any report on international aid has to
focus on how much of that aid has been diverted into fraudulent schemes
or, as in amendment No.
30,</p><a name="06061623000991"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;has been paid,
directly or indirectly to nationals of any country, either directly or
indirectly through their employment, who are not citizens of the
countries to which the aid
is...addressed&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000361">I
do not understand why hon. Members do not want such information to be
clearly stated in the report. Surely we all want to ensure that
taxpayers&#146; money is not wasted. The amendments would ensure that
taxpayers&#146; money was spent
properly.</p><p><a name="06061623000362">If
amendments Nos. 26 and 27 are not accepted, we may have to wait 11
months or so for information. We want information to be collected and
made available straightaway. It is pointless to have a Bill that
requires information on certain subjects if a provision is included
that says that information does not have to be included in the report
if it cannot be obtained in time, and paragraph 7 of schedule 2 would
undermine everything that the Bill seeks to achieve. It would
strengthen the Bill to remove that paragraph so that DFID would have to
find the relevant information.</p><p><a name="06061623000363">I
was fascinated by what my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch said
about new clause 5 and the millennium development goals, some of which
were so far in the future that they were essentially meaningless. Goals
such as halving poverty by 2015 are important, and we may want to
reassess whether the goals are still suitable. He mentioned the goal of
increasing the number of women in parliament, and surely that cannot go
hand in hand with the goal of halving poverty. Everybody can see that
some of the goals are more important than others. The benefit of the
Bill is that it would stimulate a public debate on how the Government
are spending the money. Many of my constituents feel passionately about
that. The Bill gives us the potential to stimulate public debate about
how money is spent. After the public have made their views clear, we
may want to reflect on amending some of the millennium development
goals, such as the number of women in Parliaments, and focus on some of
the more important aspects of international
development.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001021">12

effectively direct Government grants are spent. We did not reach it at
DFID questions but I would have liked to press the Secretary of State
about the measures being taken to reduce corruption and the waste of
money given directly to Governments. The beauty of the Bill is that
such things will be made more transparent; it might mean that such
questions would not need to be asked in Parliament because the
information would be provided in the reports, which is why it is so
important we ensure that they contain the correct
information.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1008</b><br><p><a name="06061623000366">My hon. Friend the Member for
Christchurch made the good point that many people may want to debate
whether aid is working. So much aid has been poured into countries, yet
they still rely on aid&#151;in many cases, they rely on even more aid
than they did in the past. New clause 7 touches on the fact that in
many countries the promotion of trade may be more important than aid.
The provision would require the Secretary of State to include in the
report observations on things that affect the spending of the money and
its impact on development in the country. That is crucial. It is no
good the Government doing a cracking job making sure that their money
is spent effectively if things such as the common agricultural policy
and the dumping of products in third-world countries undermine
everything that they are trying to achieve. New clause 7 is crucial not
only to ensure that Government aid is spent effectively but also to
monitor the effect that other people may have on the spending of that
money. The European Union is a great menace to ensuring that aid and
development contribute to progress in third-world
countries.</p><p><a name="06061623000367"><b><a name="06061623001224">Mr.
Cash:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be extremely
useful if bodies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund accepted the criteria that we are promoting in our arguments
today? It is not just a question of what goes on in Government; it also
involves the EU, the World Bank, the IMF and so
on.</p><p><a name="06061623000368"><b><a name="06061623001225">Philip
Davies:</b> My hon. Friend is right. All those institutions
spend British taxpayers&#146; money, which is why it is so crucial
that any report contains information about how all that money is spent
and not just a narrow part of
it.</p><p><a name="06061623000369">In
relation to new clauses 5 and 7, I highlight the fact that many people
in this country see the limitations of aid in helping third-world
countries and realise that in many respects trade will bring wealth to
those countries. India and China are prime examples; they have lifted
hundreds of millions of people out of poverty through trade, not
through aid. It is essential that we explore how trade, not just aid,
can help countries. With its protection rackets and tariffs, the
European Union does an awful lot of harm to ensuring that third-world
countries can trade their way out of
poverty.</p><p><a name="06061623000370">In
conclusion, I urge the House to consider many of the amendments
proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch. They will
strengthen the excellent Bill promoted by the right hon. Member for
Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, as I hope he agrees. I hope that he
acknowledges that they will increase the transparency that he wants to
add to the reporting of international development
aid.</p><p><a name="06061623000371"><b><a name="06061623001226">Mr.
Tom Clarke (Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill) (Lab):</b> I
intend to be brief. The House will understand that private
Members&#146; Bills can be talked out by their friends and supporters
as well, so I hope that I am giving a lead to the many who I believe
support the Bill when I stick to the brevity to which I have committed
myself. I do so with perhaps more confidence that might have been the
case earlier today when I recall the intervention from the hon. Member
for Banbury (Tony Baldry), which I welcomed. I related that to what he 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1009</b><br>said at the end of the Committee sitting. That sitting was comprehensive
and did not involve a single Division. It has led to the Bill being
presented to the House in the shape that it is today. He said
then:</p><a name="06061623000992"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have
had, on Second Reading and today, a most comprehensive debate. We have

the hon. Gentleman&#146;s advice. I will, however, respond briefly to
the debate that we have had so far. You very rightly pointed out that
there was more than a degree of repetition in at least one of speeches,
Mr. Deputy Speaker. What worried me a little more was the repetition of
point after point that was made on Second Reading and dealt with in
detail in Committee. In response to the hon. Member for Christchurch
(Mr. Chope), who talked about this being a Government Bill, I have to
say that, whereas I welcome the clarification and
the assistance that my hon. Friend the Minister offered comprehensively
in Committee, in my view it would be the most dreadful slur on the hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) to imply that he was not
acting as the principal spokesman for the Opposition and doing his job
in scrutinising the Bill. I believe that he did his job very
well.</p><p><a name="06061623000374"><b><a name="06061623001227">Mr.

Clarke:</b> No, I will not give way. The hon. Gentleman had
plenty of time. I will come to the main points that he made.</p><p><a name="06061623000376">I can give examples not just of
repetition, but of points that are being made in support of amendments
and new clauses that do nothing whatsoever to strengthen the Bill.
Indeed, they weaken it. For example, amendment No. 3 to clause
1&#151;I will go through this quickly&#151;seeks to prevent
combination with other reports. We were told on Second Reading that we
were seeking to do too much and now when we recommend that, for
example, the departmental report should become part of the report to
Parliament, somehow or other that is seen as unacceptable. What we seek
to do avoids duplication, saves money and leaves scope for more
detailed reporting if necessary. In joining in the tributes to the late
Eric Forth, may I say that on Second Reading, he expressed the strong
view that he found repetition unacceptable, as well? He did not oppose
the Bill.</p><p><a name="06061623000377">I turn
briefly to country numbers and criteria. I welcomed the excellent
speech from the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), which
was made all the more relevant by the fact that he sat through the
whole of the Second Reading debate and the Committee sitting. Many of
his proposals were taken on board&#151;not least in terms of the
countries 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1010</b><br>that will be covered. The number was 10 at Second Reading. It is 20 now.
The Minister told the Committee that the Government would report on 25.
That is appropriate given that that is based on public service
agreements, which have the importance of providing a specific focus on
pursuing the millennium development goals, which, incidentally, were
not even mentioned in amendment No. 11. We have made considerable
progress in that respect and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman
acknowledged
that.</p><p><a name="06061623000379">I now come to the contribution
of the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash). Although it would not be
expected that the Bill would deal exclusively with
corruption&#151;nor should it&#151;it simply is not true that we
have not taken that matter seriously. Clause 6(2)(c) reflects many of
the points that he made. The hon. Gentleman has made many relevant
points about corruption both today and on other occasions. However, the
Department is pursuing corruption; there is not a shred of evidence to
suggest that it takes corruption lightly. When we have the opportunity
to debate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s International Development
(Anti-corruption Audit) Bill, as I hope we will, many will say that it
is the correct vehicle to deal with his arguments. However, given what
clause 6 will do on corruption, the British people would be absolutely
astounded by any attempt to delay my Bill with such arguments, and I am
sure that that would not be the wish of the
House.</p><p><a name="06061623000380"><b><a name="06061623001229">Mark
Simmonds (Boston and Skegness) (Con):</b> I congratulate the
right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)
on not only introducing the Bill, but piloting it successfully through
the Second Reading debate and Committee. His passionate and articulate
speech on Report meant that his fundamental belief in the right of the
Bill came over strongly. I hope that he will acknowledge the support
that he has received from me, Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition and my
hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell), who sadly
cannot be with us today because he is in New York at the United
Nations. We have supported the objectives of the Bill, and I thank the
right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill for his
comments about the process of scrutiny both on Second Reading and in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06061623000381">12.15
pm</p><p><a name="06061623000382">It is fair to say
that the right hon. Gentleman, Ministers and the Department should be
congratulated on the way in which they listened to constructive
contributions that hon. Members on both sides of the House made about
possible ways of improving the Bill. I am sure that the right hon.
Gentleman will acknowledge that the Bill that we considered on Second
Reading has been totally reconstructed and redrafted to become the Bill
before us today. The amended Bill is significantly better because it
will create greater simplicity and clarity than the original Bill would
have done.</p><p><a name="06061623000383">Having said
all that, I do not necessarily share the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
implied criticism of my hon. Friends. They raised significant issues in
their contributions on the new clauses and amendments. My hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) was absolutely right to
highlight the problems of 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1011</b><br>meeting the millennium development goals&#151;problems that are
becoming clear, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. However, I must
correct my hon. Friend because I do not think that the Chancellor has
pushed out one of goals, namely, the aim of all children being in
primary education by 2130&#151;that was a prediction of what would
happen if we continued at the present rate. We need greater focus and
we must all work together to ensure that we achieve the target of
spending 0.7 per cent. of gross national income by 2030, and thus get
as close as possible to meeting the millennium development goals by
their target dates. When considering new clause 5, which deals with the
millennium development goals, it needs to be said that those goals were
set up by the United Nations, not the British Government, even though,
quite correctly, the Government were a signatory to
them.</p><p><a name="06061623000384">The House will
be delighted to hear that I will not talk about every new clause and
amendment, but I want to speak to several key measures. My hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch was absolutely right to highlight in new
clause 7(3) the importance of enforcing property rights. I would go
further and suggest that the relevant point in many countries is not
just the enforcement of property rights, but the setting up of property
rights. That is a fundamental necessity if we are to have not just
property rights, but the rule of law, which helps to generate the
inward investment and the creation of capital that we have seen in
Asia. Such mechanisms lead to economic growth and the creation of jobs,
and thus the alleviation of poverty, as has happened in south-east
Asia. My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) made
exactly that point in his
speech.</p><p><a name="06061623000385">Amendment No.
4 takes us back to our debate in Committee about the phraseology of
clause 2, although I will not repeat the points that were made at that
time. What the Opposition want is to see quality statistics that enable
an informed and enlightened debate on the way in which DFID and other
Departments spend British taxpayers&#146; money. We want statistics
that measure both outputs and inputs&#151;a theme to which I shall
return on other
amendments.</p><p><a name="06061623000386">We are
concerned that the changes to the Bill have removed the provision of
the independent monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of
policy and expenditure, which appeared in clause 8(2)(a)(iii) of the
Bill as originally published. The removal of that provision weakens the
Bill somewhat. Independent assessment of the aid budget could well be
beneficial; it can be done and it has been done. For example,
DFID&#146;s 2004 to 2007 Latin America regional assistance plan
states that there will
be</p><a name="06061623000994"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an independent
evaluation of the effectiveness of DFiD work in the
region.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000387">The
International Development Association, which is a branch of the World
Bank, has also committed to monitoring outputs through</p><a name="06061623000995"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a results based management
system&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000388">and it has full
disclosure of countries&#146; performance ratings. If that monitoring
is possible for one part of DFID&#146;s work in one part of its
departmental structure, why can it not be done across the Department?
DFID has stated that the IDA is an effective instrument with a 25 per
cent. efficiency gain, so clearly detailed analysis of performance is
taking place within the 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1012</b><br>Department in relation to some areas and a conclusion has been reached,
so comparisons must have been made with other funding channels. The
Bill would be more comprehensive if that detailed analysis were
included so that both outputs and inputs could be effectively monitored
and
measured.</p><p><a name="06061623000389">There
are other important issues, which I shall not explore in detail, but I
shall give an example. DFID does not keep sufficient records of how and
where money that goes through other bilateral channels, such as USAID,
is spent. In our view, that should be addressed.</p><p><a name="06061623000390">Clause 4 and amendment No. 8
deal with which multilateral institutions should come within the Bill.
The amendment proposes that the European Community should do so, and my
hon. Friends have rightly spoken about that. The Secretary of State and
the Under-Secretary know&#151;I am sure that, privately, they
agree&#151;that many people think that the British taxpayers&#146;
money that goes to the European Union is not necessarily spent as
effectively as we would like, or in the places that we want it to be
spent. I know that Members are lobbying European Ministers hard to
persuade them to our way of thinking. The Opposition want the most
detailed possible assessment of aid spending, so we welcome the
division of a general clause into its constituent parts, which is an
improvement on the original drafting. However, if multilateral aid is
to be broken down into separate funding streams, the Bill should make
provision to examine and compare aid given by the EU, the UN, the
Bretton Woods institutions and the development banks, as well as
bilateral aid, in order to determine which aid channels are the most
effective.</p><a name="06061623000957"><p>Amendments Nos. 11, 16, 9
and 10 relate to the effectiveness of aid. The amendments are designed
to include more countries in the Bill, for example, by proposing that
those in receipt of UK bilateral aid exceeding &#163;10 million be
included. The right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill
rightly made the point that the original Bill covered 10 countries,
whereas the amended Bill covers 20, and the Minister said in Committee
that for the duration of this Parliament a minimum of 25 countries
would be considered. In Committee, I expressed concern about how the
countries would be selected&#151;the Minister obfuscated, so I shall
return now to the point on which I did not get an answer then. The 25
DFID PSA&#151;public service agreement&#151;countries on which the
Minister proposes to carry out analysis and report are the same 25
countries that receive the maximum amount of British bilateral aid,
with one exception.</p><a name="06061623000958"><p>I wonder whether any hon.
Member on either side of the House can guess what the exception is? It
is, of course, Iraq. In 2003-04, Iraq was the greatest recipient of
British bilateral aid. During the past financial year, it has been the
10th biggest recipient of UK bilateral aid. It is my understanding of
the Bill that there is no necessity for bilateral aid&#151;that is
British taxpayers&#146; money going to Iraq&#151;to be reported on.
There are two pages of text in DFID&#146;s annual report summarising
the contribution to Iraq. It is not clear from those two pages how much
money is going to Iraq and what it is being used for. When the Minister
replies, I would like him to assure the House that the continuing
contribution that the British taxpayer is making through DFID and other
Departments will be reported 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1013</b><br>upon in the annual report, and will therefore be debated and scrutinised
by the House.</p><p><a name="06061623000391">Amendment No. 17 relates to the
work of other Departments and how they will fit in with the DFID annual
report. It is essential&#151;especially with regard to the Foreign
Office, the Department of Trade and Industry and, we hope, with the
progress that will be made with the World Trade Organisation
reorganisations and the economic partnership arrangements that the
Minister and I were discussing at the back end of last week&#151;to
facilitate enhanced trading to generate economic growth and, therefore,
job formation and the alleviation of poverty. There must be important
co-ordination between Departments. My hon. Friend the Member for
Shipley was right to highlight the importance of
trade.</p><p><a name="06061623000392">The other issue
of Government co-ordination that needs to be highlighted is the
well-known problem and tension between DFID, the Foreign Office and the
Ministry of Defence. We need to ensure that where British
taxpayers&#146; money is used, particularly when military action has
taken place, everyone is working in harmony for the benefit of people
on the ground.</p><p><a name="06061623000393">I do
not want to delay the House. I hope that the Minister has many
constructive comments to make when he replies. However, I would not be
doing my job properly if I did not address the correct and powerful
points that my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)
made about corruption. It is right to highlight the necessity for the
international community as well as the British Government, irrespective
of the colour of that Government, to tackle corruption throughout the
world. It has a severely negative impact in hindering aid distribution,
economic growth and the alleviation of poverty.</p><p><a name="06061623000394">There are various ways in which
the problem needs to be tackled, not just by creating conditions and
criteria for any aid that is given through DFID and with British
taxpayers&#146; money, but by building transparent and honest police
and judicial systems and by strengthening auditor-general powers within
specific countries rather than having external
auditors.</p><p><a name="06061623000395">Corruption
is not just about people taking funds for personal gain; it can be the
misallocation of funds, which means that money does not end up for the
social projects for which it was originally intended, such as health
and education. Sometimes, the recipient Government move money from the
health and education budgets to the defence budget or other budgets
about which we would not necessarily feel comfortable.</p><p><a name="06061623000396">Amendment No.
15 relates to direct budgetary support. I hope that the Minister will
acknowledge that there is growing concern about such support, not from
only within his Department but from within the international
development community, whether it be the global fund or the various
United Nations organisations. I do not know whether Members are aware
that since 2000, &#163;1.5 billion of British
taxpayers&#146; money has gone into direct budgetary support for 20
countries.</p><p><a name="06061623000397">We support
the Bill, the principles behind it and the overarching architecture,
but as the Bill stands, just42.6 per cent.&#151;or
&#163;35 million&#151;of the total bilateral aid going to Uganda
will be covered by the measure. It 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1014</b><br>is also a fact that 67 per cent&#151;or &#163;66 million&#151;of
the aid going to Tanzania will not be covered by the Bill. Indeed, 73
per cent. of the aid going to Mozambique will not be covered by the
Bill. I hope that the Minister will be able to say that the appropriate
use of taxpayers&#146; money is being provided through direct
budgetary reform, and that that will form a fundamental part of the
annual review. That provision is not set out in the Bill, nor is the
way in which the selection of the 20 to 25 countries will be reported
upon.</p><p><a name="06061623000398">I have set out
the general problems with specific regard to the amendments. I welcome
the fact that the Bill has been brought to the House and I congratulate
the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill on doing
so. He will find us extremely supportive during the rest of its passage
through the House. We wish there to be an expeditious
enactment.</p>

<p><a name="06061623000399"><b><a name="06061623001230">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development
(Mr. Gareth Thomas):</b> First, I join the hon. Member for
Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and other hon. Members in paying tribute to
the late Eric Forth. When we last discussed the Bill and the money
resolution on the Floor of the House, he made clear his intention to
continue to scrutinise the Bill. I am sure that I speak for the whole
House in saying that his absence makes the House feel emptier
today.</p><p><a name="06061623000400">Once again, I
pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston
and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke), who rightly drew the attention of
the House to the fact that while the Bill has been significantly
amended its substance remains the same. As he said, the Government have
sought to take on board concerns expressed on Second Reading, including
anxiety about the absence of the millennium development goals from the
Bill. I encourage hon. Members to resist new clause 5, because those
internationally agreed goals, which chart the steps that must be taken
to combat poverty, deserve to be included in the Bill and provide a
rallying point for all donors, including the Government.</p><p><a name="06061623000401">New clause 7
deals with aid effectiveness and policy coherence. It is right that
they should be included in the annual report, but the need for such
measures has already been addressed by the Bill. The hon. Member for
Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), reflecting on his visit to
Afghanistan, usefully pointed out the need for much better
co-ordination of work by non-governmental organisations and others
throughout the international community. He will be reassured to learn
that the Government accept that argument, and we have sought to
implement the international agreement that was reached in Paris in
March 2005 on the better harmonisation of aid. We wish to make progress
in harmonising and aligning our aid with aid from other international
donors, and we shall encourage them to do the same.</p><p><a name="06061623000402">Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 26
and 27 deal with the way in which the annual report is produced, the
information that it includes and the question of further information on
development assistance that may become available after it is published.
It is sensible to include a review provision in the Bill to enable my
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to update the House if further
information becomes available, so I urge hon. Members to resist
amendment No. 2. It is clearly sensible on the grounds of economy,
efficiency and effectiveness, which all hon. Members wish to 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1015</b><br>encourage, to allow the Secretary of State flexibility in the way in
which he seeks to align the Bill&#146;s requirement for an annual
report with other information published by the Department. I encourage
the House to resist amendments Nos. 4 and 5, as paragraph 7 of the
schedule makes provision for occasions when figures are not available
for an annual report, specifying that they must be included in a
subsequent report.</p><p><a name="06061623000403">A
number of hon. Members dwelt on amendment No. 8, which deals with
European Community aid to which the UK contributes. I accept that we
should report on such aid, and I am surprised that hon. Members did not
acknowledge the fact that a provision requiring such a report is
included in the Bill. I draw hon. Members&#146; attention to
paragraph 3 (a) and (d) of the schedule, which refer to the need to
report on European Community and other multilateral
aid.</p><p><a name="06061623000404">12.30
pm</p><p><a name="06061623000405">Amendments Nos. 11,
16, 9 and 10 relate to the number of countries on which we report and
how the choice of those countries is made. We had a long discussion on
that in Committee. As hon. Members have acknowledged, I made it clear
that it is our intention to report for the duration of this Parliament
on 25 countries currently covered by our public service agreement with
the Treasury. I did, however, accept the representations made by my
right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill and
other hon. Members on Second Reading that we should increase in the
Bill the number of countries on which all future
Governments will be required to report. That figure increased from 10
to 20.</p><p><a name="06061623000406">The hon. Member
for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) asked me whether we would
continue to report on our work in Iraq. I assure him that we will
continue to do so in the reports that are published as a result of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061623000407">Amendments Nos.
17, 19 and 22 are similar in purpose and relate to whether Government
agencies and non-departmental public bodies are covered by the Bill. I
can assure hon. Members that under the terms of the existing text,
Government agencies and non-departmental public bodies are potentially
covered. If they provide aid, we will report in the way set
out.</p><p><a name="06061623000408">On amendment No.
13, the clause as it stands sets out much more clearly the requirements
on the Secretary of State. Again, I urge hon. Members to desist from
pressing the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06061623000409">The
amendments that were subjected to particular scrutiny were those
dealing with corruption, especially amendment No. 15. I assure the hon.
Members for Stone (Mr. Cash), for Christchurch and for Shipley (Philip
Davies) that the Government take extremely seriously the need to deal
with corruption. The hon. Member for Stone paid tribute to the work of
Transparency International. I am sure it will not have escaped his
attention that the Department funds much of that work. He rightly paid
tribute to the work of the all-party group chaired by my hon. Friend
the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley). We welcome that report on
corruption and the Government will respond to it in due
course.</p><p><a name="06061623000410">The need for
more work by the Department to address the issues of governance and
corruption surfaced a number of times in the consultation on the 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1016</b><br>White Paper. I hope that the forthcoming White Paper will give the hon.
Member for Stone further confidence that we continue to address those
issues. If he wants even more detail about the considerable amount of
work that we are doing to fight corruption, I would be more than happy
to meet him to get through that at greater
length.</p><p><a name="06061623000411">Amendments
Nos. 23, 24 and 25 relate to theneed for definitions of
&#147;poverty&#148;, &#147;sustainable development&#148; and
&#147;corruption&#148;. Those terms are in common parlance and we
do not need to write definitions into the Bill. Lastly, on amendment
No. 29, which related to the loss of moneys through fraud, let me
reassure the House that we already have robust approval, procurement,
risk management and reporting arrangements to ensure that aid is spent
for the purposes intended. All our aid is subject to independent audit
and the National Audit Office has consistently given an unqualified
opinion on DFID&#146;s accounts. We have recently gone further by
establishing a fraud response unit so that we can drill down even
further on the
matter.</p><p><a name="06061623000412">I hope that
with those remarks I have addressed the concerns of Opposition Members
and that they will refrain from pressing any of their amendments to a
Division.</p><p><a name="06061623000413"><b><a name="06061623001231">Mr.
Chope:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that full
response. I am grateful to the promoter of the Bill for his
contribution, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness
(Mark Simmonds) for his remarks. Eric Forth would indeed be proud of
the detailed scrutiny that we have given to the amendments
today.</p><p><a name="06061623000414">Amendment No.
15 was the principal subject of discussion. I said earlier that the
amendments and new clauses were effectively a shopping list and that at
the end of the discussion we would choose which to put to the vote. In
responding to amendment No. 15, the Minister said that the Government
take the issues of corruption seriously. If so, why cannot they
possibly accept the amendment? It would merely require, in the
interests of transparency, that the Government should produce and
include in the annual report observations about progress in relation
to</p><a name="06061623000996"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;promoting the
establishment of a link between the commitment of aid and the reduction
of corruption in recipient
countries.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000415">I
think that it is a no-brainer that that should be included in the Bill,
and I propose that amendmentNo. 15 should be put to the
vote.</p><p><a name="06061623000416">I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the motion.</p><p><a name="06061623000417"><i> Motion and clause, by leave,

time.</p><p><a name="06061623000420">It gives me
great pleasure to move new clause 6 in this important debate. I hope,
Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you will give me a chance to say a few words,
because it is the first time that I have spoken on a Friday since the
death of my dear friend, the late Eric Forth. I hope that you will
forgive me if I join hon. Friends and other hon. Members who have paid
tribute to him. They say that imitation is the best form of flattery,
but I am conscious that I could never imitate the way in which my late
right hon. Friend scrutinised Bills so effectively on a
Friday.</p><p><a name="06061623000421">Hon. Members
will be relieved to hear that I do not intend to speak at length,
because we have already had a very useful debate. I will not repeat
what my late friend used to do so superbly, speaking for about an hour
and then saying, &#147;And I now come to the end of my preliminary
remarks.&#148; I thought that as he was such a dear friend, I would
do this almost as an Eric Forth memorial day, and wondered what sort of
amendment I could table that would pay tribute to his memory&#151;a
sensible amendment that could possibly be accepted by the promoter of
the Bill.</p><p><a name="06061623000422">That is why
I came up with new clause 6, which is supported by my right hon. and
hon. Friends. It
says:</p><a name="06061623000997"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It shall
be a duty of the Secretary of State to make a motion for a resolution
approving each annual report in the House of Commons, within three
months of the report being laid.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000423">That would merely ensure that when the
Bill is passed, as I am sure it will be, and we have the annual report,
it is debated on the Floor of the House. If the sponsors of the Bill
feel able to accept the new clause, what greater tribute could there be
to my late right hon. Friend than that we have not only achieved an
annual report on a very important subject, but achieved more debate and
greater scrutiny on the Floor of the House, which is what his whole
life was dedicated
to?</p><p><a name="06061623000424">I hope that I am
pushing on an open door, because the right hon. Member for Coatbridge,
Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) himself said on Second
Reading:</p><a name="06061623000998"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As
the International Development Committee has pointed out repeatedly,
parliamentary scrutiny and a coherent policy across Government are of
the utmost importance. An annual report to Parliament carries more
status than a departmental report or information posted online, and
invites debate on the Floor of the
House.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000425">If my amendment
were passed, that is, presumably, precisely what would happen. It would
not simply invite debate, it would ensure debate. Later in the debate,
my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning)
said that</p><a name="06061623000999"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Bill
would ensure that the House has an opportunity to hold a similarly
robust and informed scrutiny debate.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official

1082.]</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000426">I am
not sure that the Bill as presently drafted does necessarily ensure
that there will be an informed debate, but my new clause, which is
tabled in a very positive spirit, would achieve that. I very much hope
that the Bill will be passed with the new clause as part of
it.</p><p><a name="06061623000427">The right hon.
Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill said in
Committee:</p><a name="06061623001000"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Minister&#146;s
views reflect my own. He has said as much as we would expect him to say
in the debate. However, it might be helpful if I say that I would
certainly look forward to the report 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1018</b><br>being debated annually in both Houses.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official
Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 15 February 2006; c.
5.]</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000428">What would a
debate achieve? It would allow better scrutiny of the report and the
progress that had been made in the past year in international
development. That is a vital issue, yet we devote far less time to it
in Select Committees, Standing Committees and debates and Question Time
on the Floor of the House than to discussing, for example, the Foreign
Office. In its public expenditure and its importance to the national
interest, international development is, arguably, as important as the
Foreign Office. Some of us often wonder what the Foreign Office does,
but we all know what international development achieves. Why does our
parliamentary system ensure that the Department for International
Development gets so much less scrutiny than the affairs of the Foreign
Office?</p><p><a name="06061623000429"><b><a name="06061623001233">Philip
Davies:</b> Many of my constituents make the same point. They
would like many more opportunities to debate international development,
which is increasingly important to the public. Does my hon. Friend get
the same feedback from his constituents, and does he agree that the new
clause would guarantee much more regular debate of international
development issues, which the public would love to
happen?</p><p><a name="06061623000430"><b><a name="06061623001234">Mr.
Leigh:</b> Like my colleagues, I get as many letters and cards
about international development as on any other issue. That is good.
There is a well-organised lobby, and I sometimes believe that, in our
work in Parliament and in the prominence that we give different
matters, issues such as international development do not receive as
much scrutiny as they should.</p><p><a name="06061623000431">The Secretary of State, a
gentleman for whom I have the greatest respect, is in his place. I also
have the greatest respect for his permanent secretary, who has appeared
before the Public Accounts Committee on two or three occasions. The
Department is one of the few that has a good record of public scrutiny
before the PAC, and of ensuring that money is well spent. The accounts
are not qualified. Again, the PAC has few sittings on international
development, partly because the Department is so effective in bilateral
aid. We have not held hearings in which enormous criticism has been
made of lack of value for money, waste and so on. However, if we have
less scrutiny by the National Audit Office, which reports to
Parliament, and less scrutiny by the PAC, it is all the more important
to accept an amendment such as the new clause, which, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) said, reflects the public
interest in such
issues.</p><p><a name="06061623000432">If the new
clause were accepted we could debate the finer points, which one can
never get from an annual report. Many organisations produce annual
reports. The promoter does not believe the Bill to be part of gesture
politics. He believes that it will make a difference; he wants to make
a difference and have a real debate. He does not simply want another
annual report, to be put in a pigeonhole. How many annual reports do we
receive every day in our post&#151;from great British public
companies and this and that agency? How many hon. Members can put their
hands on their hearts and say that they read them?</p><p><a name="06061623000433">However, debates here make a
difference. Members of Parliament are present for this debate, which is
well 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1019</b><br>attended. How many people are watching it, not only in the Public
Gallery but on television? I doubt whether there will be great
reportage about it in the papers tomorrow, but it is our opportunity to
put the Secretary of State on the spot, which we cannot do with an
annual report alone. However, we can do that if he is brought to the
House on the back of a detailed annual report, and made to answer for
what he has achieved.</p><p><a name="06061623000434">An annual debate would raise
awareness of the extreme poverty in many countries. I hope that it
would promote greater interest and perhaps encourage the public to make
greater donations. It would also lead to more detailed and better
understanding of the report. It is
necessary.</p><p><a name="06061623000435">Let
us be honest: there is a tendency in annual reports to gloss over
things and do the bare minimum. The Bill is specific about what it
wants in the annual report, but we all know about statistics, lies and
damned lies. When writing something that is not scrutinised publicly,
it is easy to gloss over embarrassing things. So this is our
opportunity to hold the Department to account. That is what Parliament
is about.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001022">12.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06061623000436">Parliament
is very weak in its scrutiny role, although it is good as a kind of
general debating society for issues of massive public importance. It is
also very weak in scrutinising the estimates of
Government Departments and what they actually spend. I recently visited
the United States Congress, whose role is far more developed in
relation to line-by-line scrutiny of Government Departments. We might
not achieve that in this debate, but at least we will start to make
progress towards what we want, which is that a Department should be
able to be specifically ordered by Parliament to set out its goals,
priorities and targets, and to reveal whether it has achieved them.
That should be written down in an annual report, and the Secretary of
State should be brought back to Parliament and held to
account.</p><p><a name="06061623000437"><b><a name="06061623001235">Mr.
Cash:</b> In his excellent remarks, my hon. Friend might care
to note that the report by the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh
Bayley), &#147;The Other Side of the Coin&#148;, deals specifically
with the role of DFID in this context. Under my hon. Friend&#146;s
proposal, a resolution could be approved by Parliament; it could also
be disapproved. That is where the problem lies. The report
states:</p><a name="06061623001001"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;DFID
must not turn a blind eye to
corruption&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000438">I have no
doubt that we shall continue this discussion, but that is what is
stated in this report, which was produced by a Labour Member of
Parliament, the Chairman of a very distinguished group whose importance
the Minister has
acknowledged.</p><p><a name="06061623000439"><b><a name="06061623001236">Mr.
Leigh:</b> I was going to deal with corruption, but I do not
think that I need to do so now, because it is a matter that we want to
bring out in the debates that we are proposing.</p><p><a name="06061623000440">I want to ask why, despite
increases in the overall amount of aid and debt relief given by the
international community, aid is allocated inconsistently and not always
to the countries most in need. For example, in 2002, less than half the
EU&#146;s aid budget was directed towards low-income countries,
according 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1020</b><br>to the House of Commons Select Committee. We also know that, for
political reasons&#151;and for reasons of promoting commerce rather
than eradicating poverty&#151;too much aid, particularly from the EU,
goes to middle-income countries that should have a lower priority than
the least developed ones.</p><p><a name="06061623000441">The former Secretary of State
for International Development, the right hon. Member for Birmingham,
Ladywood (Clare Short), once
said:</p><a name="06061623001002"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Anyone
who knows anything about development knows that the EU is the worst
agency in the world, the most inefficient, the least poverty-focused,
the slowest, flinging money around for political gestures rather than
promoting real
development.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000442">So, as part
of the debate that takes place on the back of the annual report, let us
have more discussion about the effectiveness of UK bilateral aid,
compared with the ineffectiveness of so much multilateral
aid.</p><p><a name="06061623000443">Let us also have
a discussion about how aid is used. For instance, Zimbabwe receives
food parcels from the United Nations, yet Mugabe has repeatedly used
food aid as a weapon by withholding it from those who do not support
his Government. Let us also have a debate on the fact that India,
Russia and China all get UK bilateral aid for &#147;assistance in
developing infrastructure&#148;. Those countries might be developing,
but they are hardly suffering extreme hardship. All those issues could
be debated under the provisions in new clause 6, and the Secretary of
State could be held to account on the Floor of the House.</p><p><a name="06061623000444">Let us also
consider sanctions, and what should happen after the report has been
published. If we had a debate on the report, and we determined that
mistakes had been made&#151;as undoubtedly they would have been; this
happens even in the best-run Departments&#151;what sanctions should
be imposed on the Department? That is what this House is all about:
scrutiny and criticism. For instance, we could scrutinise in detail all
the methods used by the Department and discuss what new methods or
actions could be introduced to improve the situation. All those things
could form part of the annual debate.</p><p><a name="06061623000445">We could also
discuss which countries receive the most aid, and why. After all, the
annual report will deal with only 20 countries. Are they the right
countries? Should we be focusing our attention on them? We could
discuss how, and in what form, aid is given, and whether it is used
effectively by the country receiving it. We could also ask whether a
particular millennium goal should be prioritised, and, if so, why, and
what might be the best way to tackle corruption&#151;a point raised
by my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash).</p><p><a name="06061623000446">The other
reason why we need an annual debate is that things change and are
driven by events&#151;tsunamis, hurricanes and so on. We need to
examine how the Department responded in terms not just of a dry
academic exercise or of meeting bureaucratic targets, but of what it
did on the ground. One of the Public Accounts Committee&#146;s most
interesting recent reports was on the effectiveness of DFID and the
Foreign Office in dealing with the after-effects of the Asian
tsunami.</p><p><a name="06061623000447">Let us also
debate, on the back of the report, how the Department has performed in
the past year. Such a debate would allow us to examine how the
Secretary of State and Ministers have performed. Have they performed
badly? Have they made errors? Should they be held to account and how?
How Ministers perform in 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1021</b><br>the House is a key element. Ministers rise and fall not just according
to how they pass pieces of paper around their Department or how
efficiently they run their Department&#151;the permanent secretary
can do that&#151;but according to how they perform in this House. As
part of our scrutiny, we want to know how our Ministers, on whose work
we place great importance, respond to criticism on the Floor of the
House, in an annual debate on their annual report.</p><p><a name="06061623000448">Such a debate would allow the
Chamber to assess whether the original key goals concerning
international development and eradicating extreme poverty are being
met. If they are not, a change of approach might be needed. We could
examine whether progress has been poor in certain areas. Surely such a
debate would be an opportunity not just to scrutinise a Secretary of
State but for us to put forward our views, which might be different
from his, about our priorities and how his Department could perform
better.</p><p><a name="06061623000449">I think that
I have summarised the key points. For the life of me, I cannot see why
anyone who loves Parliament should want to oppose the new clause. I am
proud to put it forward, and I say sincerely to the promoter of the
Bill that were he able to accept the new clause, it would be a fitting
memorial to a much-loved former colleague.</p><p><a name="06061623000450"><b><a name="06061623001237">Mark
Simmonds:</b> It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the
Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) who is a fellow
Lincolnshire Member of Parliament and a highly distinguished Chairman
of the Public Accounts Committee.</p><p><a name="06061623000451">This matter was debated in
Committee, and the additional point was made that because of
the&#151;correctly&#151;increasing budget of DFID, half an hour was
perhaps not long enough for DFID questions, especially given that
Foreign Office questions are allocated one hour. I also note that there
has been a subtle change in the Bill since the Committee
stage&#151;initially, it stated that the report would go to
&#147;either House&#148;, which was questioned, but it has now been
changed to &#147;each House&#148;. That is welcome.</p><p><a name="06061623000452">The point also needs to be made
that debates in Westminster Hall on Select Committee reports seem to be
subject to significant delay, and we need to ensure that when this
report comes to the House, that is not the case.</p><p><a name="06061623000453">My final
point is that other Departments have annual debates. A Welsh debate
takes place, on St. David&#146;s day, I think&#151;perhaps the
Minister will clarify that&#151;and there are also annual fisheries
and defence debates. In relation to this important report, the
Opposition see no reason why there should not be an annual DFID debate
on the Floor of the House.</p><p><a name="06061623000454"><b><a name="06061623001238">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development
(Mr. Gareth Thomas):</b> I pay tribute to the hon. Member for
Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) for his work on the Public Accounts
Committee. I therefore hesitate to tell him that I will urge the House
to reject new clause 6. He was generous about the officials who work in
the Department. I thank him for that; I agree that our staff do an
excellent job.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1022</b><br><p><a name="06061623000455">Having given the hon. Gentleman
the news&#151;not, I suspect, unexpected&#151;that the Government
will not support new clause 6, let me make it clear to him that that is
not because we fear scrutiny. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State and I welcome the considerable scrutiny of the
Department&#146;s work that already exists. A number of Select
Committees as well as the departmental Committee and the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s Committee have been scrutinising other aspects of
our work. Many other Departments contribute to the international
development effectiveness effort, and they are all open to scrutiny
through questions
sessions.</p><p><a name="06061623000456">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s purpose was clearly to secure some form of annual
debate. He will understand that I am not in a position to comment on
that request, but the many representations made on Second Reading and
subsequently, repeated today by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member
for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds), will have been heard by other
Members, who reflect on these
matters.</p><p><a name="06061623000457">Let me gently
say to the hon. Member for Gainsborough that no other departmental
annual reports are required to undergo the process suggested in new
clause 6. On that basis, and given the considerable scrutiny that
already takes place, I urge the House to resist the new
clause.</p><p><a name="06061623000458"><b><a name="06061623001239">Mr.
Leigh:</b> I am very disappointed by what the Minister has
said, but it is not entirely unexpected. I hesitate to say this, but I
think that unless the report is dealt with on the Floor of the House it
could prove to be an empty vessel. I am surprised that those who
support the Bill&#151;and apparently everyone in the House
does&#151;are not more enthusiastic about what I have
suggested.</p><p><a name="06061623000459">I worded
the new clause carefully. The debate would have to be held here, rather
than in Westminster Hall or a Committee, which is another tribute to my
late right hon. Friend Eric Forth. This is where the people hold the
Government to account. The Minister says that all Departments produce
annual reports, but I suspect that the real reason for his opposition
to my new clause is his belief that it would open the floodgates to
others who want debates on annual reports. Presumably there were
discussions through the usual channels. There was probably a degree of
nervousness about the possibility of more scrutiny and more debate on
the Floor of the House.</p><p><a name="06061623000460"><b><a name="06061623001240">Mr.
Cash:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. Given that we are
dealing with the question of helping people in the third world, with
which many of us are passionately concerned, the apparent reluctance to
be put to the test strikes me as extraordinary. Perhaps, if the
Government are determined not to support the new clause, we shall end
up using an Opposition day to ensure that the annual report is
debated.</p><p><a name="06061623000461"><b><a name="06061623001241">Mr.
Leigh:</b> I am sure that we could do that, but how much
better it would be if the debate took place automatically. Of course I
appreciate that other Departments produce annual reports, but this is a
specific annual report. The Bill specifies key goals and targets. Let
us not just have the Government&#146;s version; let us 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1023</b><br>bring the Minister to the Dispatch Box and hold him to account. I am
very disappointed by the Minister&#146;s response, and I am afraid
that I will press the new clause to a vote.</p><p><a name="06061623000462"><i> Question put, </i>That the

pm</h5><p><a name="06061623000684"><b><a name="06061623001451">Mr.
Tom Clarke:</b> I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the
Third time.</p><p><a name="06061623000685">I am
delighted to be able to propose the Third Reading of this important
Bill. I begin by thanking so many people who have done so much in order
that the Bill could get this far and, we hope, further. I thank right
hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House, spokespersons for all
the political parties, and many others. We have been encouraged by the
public support shown by, for example, the aid agencies&#151;there was
an excellent letter in <i> The Guardian</i> yesterday, accompanied by a
welcome leader&#151;and the Churches, including the Church of
Scotland and the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission. This week,
Edinburgh&#146;s Cardinal Keith O&#146;Brien paid a visit to
Westminster; I welcome his support, also.</p><p><a name="06061623000686">Perhaps it is appropriate that
someone from Edinburgh should have made that appeal, because in many
ways the idea of the Bill originated at the time of that great march
ahead of the G8 summit in Edinburgh last year. We were responding to
public support and to people who have been mentioned in our
debate&#151;Bob Geldof, Midge Ure and many others. Above all, we were
responding to those ordinary people&#151;my constituents and people
from all over the United Kingdom&#151;who wrote to me offering their
support for the Bill and pleading that other hon. Members would do as I
think they will and ensure that the Bill goes to the other place and is
there approved.</p><p><a name="06061623000687">I
also thank the Department for International Development, my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of
State, whose contributions have been outstanding&#151;typical of an
outstanding Department. That is what the Bill will allow the House to
discuss, year by year.</p><p><a name="06061623000688">To me, the principal message,
which the House will endorse today if it gives the Bill a Third
Reading, is that Parliament has the right to hold the Executive to
account and, likewise, people have the right to hold parliamentarians
to account. The Bill deals with many issues, which, if I may say so,
are being splendidly addressed by DFID and other Departments, but there
are many more issues that have led millions of people in Britain and
throughout the rest of the world for a long time to ask the question:
when? I believe that when we have an annual report and the present
Government and future Governments are accountable, not only will we in
the United Kingdom have made great progress, but we may hope that, as
the UN co-ordinator on the millennium development goals has
recommended, other Parliaments in developing and developed countries
will follow the lead that we
offer.</p><p><a name="06061623000689">How long have
we waited for the achievement of0.7 per cent. of gross
national income? The answer is36 years. It is reasonable,
given movements up and down over those years, that as part of the
annual report 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1026</b><br>the Government of the day should tell the House and Parliament what
progress is being made. That is an extremely important first.</p><p><a name="06061623000690">There is something else that is
important as a first. We have discussed the millennium development
goals, but if the Bill is given a Third Reading we will be endorsing
those goals from 1 to 8, and particularly goal 8, for the first time in
legislation. That should surely be welcome. It is a goal that says to
those millions of people who are suffering from poverty and deprivation
in Africa, Asia, the Americas and elsewhere, &#147;Yes, we see your
need for improved education. We endorse that goal that says that we
should take on board the challenges of aid, trade and debt. Despite all
of our efforts, these challenges have not been settled to the
satisfaction of those who are so very much in need.&#148; Health care
is extremely important. Infant mortality and maternal mortality must be
addressed. That must be recognised in the need for progress on
millennium development goals. We welcome the fact that those goals are
at the heart of the Bill.</p><p><a name="06061623000691">The Bill does something else
that is crucial to everything that we have debated, and is common to
everything that we debated in Committee and on Second Reading.
Committed as we are to development assistance, we all passionately
believe in aid effectiveness. The schedule is full of opportunities for
reports to the House so that the House will know, Parliament will know
and the British people will know of the commitment of this Government,
and one hopes of future Governments, to aid and international
development, which is one that we continue to endorse. That is based on
accountability and transparency, which I hope will be seen as profound
given the outlook of this important
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061623000692">If the Bill is
passed, as I hope it will be, and if another place decides to endorse
it, I believe that Parliament will be supporting progressive
legislation. I believe also in something else. Across many areas over
the years, we in Britain have given a lead in challenging poverty and
in seeing the need to focus on poverty reduction. That is much
reflected in the policies of the Department for International
Development. We want to do more. We want to ensure that there is
participation at every level in every
nation.</p><p><a name="06061623000693">I heard my
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State say in answer to a question at
one of the fringe meetings at our last party conference that it was not
our Government&#146;s policy to export colonialism to developing
countries. I thought that that was a wonderful thing to say. The Bill
goes along those lines in encouraging, inspiring and helping developing
countries. That is something that the Brandt report made clear all
those years ago, which led to the biggest lobby of the House and
remains true today.</p><p><a name="06061623000694">For those reasons, I invite the
House to give the Bill a Third Reading. That is right for Britain,
right for our Government and right for Parliament. I passionately
believe that, whatever progress we might have made this afternoon, many
people will welcome a further step forward&#151;one that will give
inspiration in a practical sense to an increasingly disenchanted
world.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001024">1.35
pm</h5><p><a name="06061623000695"><b><a name="06061623001452">Mark
Simmonds:</b> May I begin by putting on record our
congratulations to the right hon. Member for 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1027</b><br>Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) on introducing this
important Bill and on the way in which he has held together a
multifarious group of individuals who support, in different ways, what
he is attempting to achieve. Once the Bill is enacted, it will make a
significant contribution by improving the transparency of the reporting
structures of the Department for International Development to the
House, thus maximising the effectiveness of British taxpayers&#146;
money in alleviating poverty. Inevitably, such resources are limited,
even though we have accepted the need to increase them.</p><p><a name="06061623000696">As we have said, the Opposition
support the Bill, which demonstrates greater clarity and simplicity
than it did when it was introduced, particularly as it includes a
commitment to meet the millennium development goals. Opposition Members
genuinely wished to make constructive suggestions to improve the Bill,
and the right hon. Gentleman, Ministers and DFID officials deserve to
be congratulated on listening and including some of those suggestions
in the legislation. The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s most significant
achievement is ensuring that, as he rightly pointed out, the United
Nations target of spending 0.7 per cent. of gross national income on
international development appears in statute for the first time. That
aspiration, as he said, was first expressed by the UN 36 years ago, and
it is supported by the Opposition and Members from all parts of the
House. The right hon. Gentleman deserves to be congratulated on that
major achievement.</p><p><a name="06061623000697">The right hon. Gentleman
highlighted millennium development goal 8, which is difficult to
measure. I draw the attention of the House to the first part of that
goal, which aims
to</p><a name="06061623001004"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;develop further an
open trading and financial system that is rule-based, predictable and
non-discriminatory, includes a commitment to good governance,
development and poverty reduction&#151;nationally and
internationally.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000698">Sadly,
it appears that the latest World Trade Organisation round will not meet
that requirement, so we must all be vigilant in ensuring that the WTO
makes progress in improving trading rules to benefit developing
nations. We must ensure, too, that regional trading agreements are made
to help developing nations improve their economies, as well as
bilateral trading agreements and pan-African trading agreements. To
improve trade within specific countries, we must focus on
infrastructure as well as the larger WTO discussions.</p><p><a name="06061623000699">As I have said, the Opposition
agree with the Bill&#146;s overarching objective of bringing
accountability and transparency to international development spending.
It rightly encourages DFID to report on the effectiveness of its aid
spending to meet the millennium development goals and to alleviate
poverty. Opposition Members, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for
Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), have expressed concerns about the
Bill, and we are pleased that the right hon. Gentleman was happy to
include in the Bill a requirement for DFID to report every year on
humanitarian assistance, as significant sums are involved. In 2004-05,
DFID spent &#163;437 million on humanitarian assistance, &#163;344
million of which was spent on bilateral aid and &#163;93 million on
multilateral aid. The amendment to monitor the spending of that money
is therefore a welcome addition to the Bill.</p><p><a name="06061623000700">I am encouraged that the link
between the millennium development goals and the monitoring of 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1028</b><br>aid has been strengthened. The annual report that will be produced as a
result of the Bill will have an explicit function in monitoring
progress towards those strategic goals and should contribute
significantly to ensuring that development assistance is used
specifically to alleviate
poverty.</p><p><a name="06061623000701">The
redrafting of the Bill increased the number of countries that will be
assessed for aid effectiveness to &#147;no fewer than 20&#148;. We
agree with that change, and I accept that the Minister said in
Committee that for the duration of this Parliament the figure would be
no fewer than 25. The change was the result of an informed discussion
on Second Reading, and I am pleased to acknowledge that in Committee
the Minister gave the assurance that for the lifetime of this
Parliament aid effectiveness will be monitored in 25 countries.
Hopefully, that will continue beyond this Parliament, whichever
political party is in power after the next election. I certainly hope
it will be my
party.</p><p><a name="06061623000702">We remain
concerned, and we have pointed out at every stage of the discussion,
that the Bill is still too focused on inputs rather than outputs. That
was acknowledged by the Minister in Committee. We recognise that much
of the information in the proposed annual report will already be in the
public domain as a matter of course. As acknowledged by DFID in its own
report entitled &#147;How effective is DFID?&#148; and by an
increasing number of outside organisations, the Department is
struggling to deliver a regular, systematic and comprehensive
assessment of the effectiveness of British aid spending. The Bill,
which we hope will be enacted expeditiously, should be the foundation
for a major shift towards the assessment of the outputs of aid, so that
British taxpayers can transparently evaluate and assess whether their
money is being spent effectively to alleviate
poverty.</p><p><a name="06061623000703">I draw the
attention of the House to what I consider to be an oversight in the
Bill. It does not allow for easy comparison between the effectiveness
of different funding streams. We support a policy in which there are
several different appropriate aid streams&#151;bilateral,
multilateral via NGOs, regional development banks, the UN and the
Bretton Woods institutions&#151;so that the most effective method can
be used. However, the Bill makes no provision for comparison between
the effectiveness of different funding streams, so as to establish
which are the most effective and, more importantly, the least
effective. On implementation of the Bill, DFID needs to give that
aspect further
consideration.</p><p><a name="06061623000704">In
conclusion, DFID is still too focused on inputs, not outputs&#151;on
money spent rather than its effectiveness. Our long-term goal must be
to assist the developing world in graduating from dependence on aid to
strong democracies with vibrant economies that can create jobs and
alleviate poverty, generating revenues to invest in their public
services while maintaining environmental sustainability. That can be
achieved only by reducing global poverty, creating freer and fairer
trade, making wider and deeper debt reduction, enhancing civil society,
implementing the rule of law, strengthening private property rights and
assisting developing nations to build their capacity and trading
infrastructure internally, regionally and internationally.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1029</b><br><p><a name="06061623000705">We therefore welcome the Bill,
as it will introduce monitoring and reporting structures to ensure that
development aid is as effective as possible for recipient nations and
provides the greatest possible value for money for British taxpayers.
The Bill is not the whole answer, but it is a positive step and builds
on the work of the Department, just as the Government have built on the
work of previous Conservative Administrations, and just as we will
build on the Government&#146;s work when we are returned to
power.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001025">1.43
pm</h5><p><a name="06061623000706"><b><a name="06061623001453">Mr.
Thomas:</b> I join the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness
(Mark Simmonds) in paying tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member
for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) for the way in
which he has articulated the case for the Bill. It is admirably crafted
and has been skilfully steered through all its stages thus far in the
House as a result of the remarkable coalition of support that he has
established. Aid agencies, celebrities, and Members on both sides of
the House back his Bill. Not every hon. Member has the opportunity to
introduce a private Member&#146;s Bill, and not every hon. Member who
does so is lucky enough to steer it through all its stages in the
House. My right hon. Friend has already succeeded in that once, and I
hope that the way in which he has made his case to the House, not only
today but in Committee and on Second Reading, will serve to encourage
the other place to allow him a second great
success.</p><p><a name="06061623000707">As my right
hon. Friend made clear, the Bill will enhance parliamentary and,
importantly, public scrutiny of how aid is spent. In particular, it
provides scrutiny of whether the UK is playing its part in increasing
our aid in line with the commitments that were made last year. Labour
Members, and the Government in particular, welcome the additional
scrutiny required by the Bill of progress towards achieving the 0.7 per
cent. goal. That is particularly important when one bears in mind the
record of Governments in the past on aid as a proportion of national
income.</p><p><a name="06061623000708">The hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness drew the House&#146;s attention to a
number of changes that have been made as a result of our discussions in
Committee and the representations that were made on Second Reading. We
have rectified the absence of any reference to humanitarian assistance.
We have added the need to make progress on the millennium development
goals. We have increased the number of countries on which we will
specifically report. As the hon. Gentleman said, I gave an additional
commitment that for the life of this Parliament we will go even further
in reporting on 25 countries in
particular.</p><p><a name="06061623000709">The
hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) has been particularly
assiduous&#151;on Second Reading, through his 10-minute Bill, and on
Report&#151;in raising the need to do more to tackle corruption. As I
said in response to the first group of amendments, the Government have
strongly picked up the message that the public and aid agencies want
even more work to be done alongside the considerable work that we are
already doing. The forthcoming White Paper will signal our intent to do
even more. I do not accept the view expressed throughout the debate
that further amendments are necessary. Clause 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1030</b><br>6(2)(c) specifically alludes to the Government reporting on our progress
in tackling
corruption.</p><p><a name="06061623000710">We know
that aid works. Over the past three years, I have had the privilege of
seeing in action a variety of the methods that we are using to provide
aid, including the support that we are giving to non-governmental
organisations. One particularly powerful example is Christian Aid,
which, through our funding, is able to provide support to those sadly
dying of AIDS, orphaned by AIDS or at risk of becoming HIV-infected in
a township just outside Johannesburg. The work that it is doing using
our resources is remarkable.
</p><p><a name="06061623000711">However,
we have to recognise that support for NGOs does not always enable us to
do as much as we would like in a country. In such circumstances, and
where the conditions are right, budget and sector support has an
important role to play in increasing access to education and improving
health outcomes. Last year, when I visited Malawi and Zambia with the
Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for
Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), I was able to see the benefits of
budget and sector support through the extra nurses who are being
recruited, and the effectiveness of our financial support in that
regard. I also had the chance to visit Sri Lanka and Indonesia to see
the effectiveness of our spending through multilateral organisations
such as the United Nations in helping those two countries deal with the
terrible devastation that the tsunami brought in its
wake.</p><p><a name="06061623000712">I have also had
the privilege of witnessing the increasing effectiveness of European
Community aid. I reject some of the wilder comments that we heard in
the debate about its effectiveness. I draw hon. Members&#146;
attention to a report that the House of Lords European Union Committee
published in April 2004. It specifically stated that there had
been</p><a name="06061623001005"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;significant
improvements in aid management and organisational
effectiveness&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000713">by
the European Union. It went on to make the case for further reforms,
which we accept. However, European Community aid is
making a huge difference throughout the developing world. For example,
in Afghanistan and India, EC aid contributes to more children being in
school and to building more roads. The old adage, to which the hon.
Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) referred, about the EC being the
worst aid agency in the world, no longer applies. The EC is getting
better, but it needs to go
further.</p><p><a name="06061623000714">We must
examine the circumstances in each country before we determine the
funding mechanism that has to be used. It would be inappropriate to use
budget and sector support in countries such as Zimbabwe and we do not
do that. We work through the United Nations and NGOs. Budget and sector
support is more appropriate in countries that are committed to reform,
tackling corruption and good financial management. We need to consider
the circumstances in each
country.</p><p><a name="06061623000715">The debate
has been excellent and I pay tribute to the spirit in which it has been
approached. In moving Third Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member
for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill demonstrated the Bill&#146;s
importance not only in allowing the British public to be aware of how
British money is spent and whether we are fulfilling the commitments
that we made last year, but in serving as a template for other
countries in the developing world and throughout the developed 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1031</b><br>world to ensure that others follow up on the commitments that have been
made.</p><p><a name="06061623000716">I have been
advised that, in summing up on the first group of amendments, I may
have inadvertently suggested that non-departmental public bodies are
included in the existing text of the Bill. As hon. Members know, that
is not the case, but the Secretary of State can already report on such
bodies. Given the interest that hon. Members clearly have in them, I am
sure that my right hon. Friend will do
so.</p><p><a name="06061623000717">Again, I pay
tribute to the superb way in which my right hon. Friend the Member for
Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill introduced the Bill and the way in
which he kept the coalition of support together. I commend the Bill to
the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001026">1.52

Barrett (Edinburgh, West) (LD):</b> I place on record my
support and that of my Liberal Democrat colleagues for the Bill. It
feels like the end of a long journey and, as the right hon. Member for
Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) said, it started in
Edinburgh during the Make Poverty History march. I was delighted to
have met the late Robin Cook, who was then Member of Parliament for
Livingston, at that march. We chatted about the way in which the Make
Poverty History event had captured the imagination of the people.
Several hon. Members mentioned the late right hon. Member for Bromley
and Chislehurst, Eric Forth, and I wanted to place Robin Cook&#146;s
name on record. He was a great supporter and, had he been here today,
he would have been delighted to lend his weight to the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061623000719"><b><a name="06061623001455">Mr.
Kevan Jones (North Durham) (Lab):</b> Does the hon. Gentleman
agree that the campaigning work of not only NGOs but Church groups
throughout the country has led to pressure to get the Bill through, and
that tribute should also be paid to individuals who work tirelessly to
promote third-world issues?</p><p><a name="06061623000720"><b><a name="06061623001456">John
Barrett:</b> I could not agree more. I hope to mention some of
those people and groups in my speech. However, I shall not manage to
mention them all and their omission is not by design but because there
are so many, whether they are NGOs such as Oxfam and Save the Children,
Church groups or individuals.</p><p><a name="06061623000721">Back at the
start of this journey, an awful lot of people were asking where the
political parties stood on the Bill, and on the entire issue. However,
many of the most inspiring people have not been aligned to any party or
group; they have been individuals. As Midge Ure said at the reception
last night, according to the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston
and Bellshill, this is about a lot of ordinary people out there with
their kids supporting the Bill. I want to pay tribute to the right hon.
Gentleman for gathering an interesting group of supporters. In my five
years in the House, I cannot remember having encountered such people as
Midge Ure, Bob Geldof, Jemima Khan and many others, all of whom have
encouraged people to get behind the Bill and to push in the same
direction.</p><p><a name="06061623000722">I have been
equally delighted to see support for the Bill from both sides of the
House. The hon. Member for 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1032</b><br>Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) and a number of his colleagues, as
well as other hon. Members from all parties, have been happy to support
it. The Bill might not be perfect&#151;it has received some
criticism&#151;but this is not a perfect world, and the people whom
the Bill hopes to support do not live in a perfect world. However, we
have heard support today from members of all political parties. When
people from outside the House consider this debate, they will see that
there is all-party support for what is basically a good idea.</p><p><a name="06061623000723">Members have asked why people
do not follow our debates in Parliament more. I have to say that we did
not see the best example of our debates today. We heard a lot of
repetition, and that is not the best aspect of this House. However, the
spirit of the Bill is crucial because it captures the imagination of
the people. It has cross-party support and the support of those who
belong to no party. Ordinary members of the public are behind what we
are doing, and we have an opportunity today to see the Bill through its
present stage and send it on to the Lords, where I hope it will have a
successful passage as well.</p><p><a name="06061623000724">Some people have said that the
Bill is not perfect, and Members asked this morning why the Government
responded to the amendment on corruption in the way that they did.
However, I am perfectly aware that the Department for International
Development is not only funding good work in the fight against
corruption but taking action in a number of other areas to deal with
the problem. Other issues were raised, but the Bill is not necessarily
the best way to deal with them.</p><p><a name="06061623000725">The provision in the Bill for
reaching our long-overdue aid target of 0.7 per cent. of gross domestic
product is the jewel in its crown. However, this is not the end of our
journey; it is a stop along the route. Hon. Members were talking about
corruption earlier. They said that enormous sums were being spent on
the eradication of poverty and asked why we had not dealt with the
problem. The answer is simple. Enormous sums of money are spent on the
problem because it is an enormous problem. The number of people
throughout the world who live on less than a dollar a
day, who are being treated for HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis or polio, or who are suffering on the bare minimum, trying
to get by and get enough food for themselves and their children is just
staggering.</p><p><a name="06061623000726"><b><a name="06061623001457">Stephen
Pound (Ealing, North) (Lab):</b> At the risk of contributing
to the end of party political divisions as we know them, may I tell the
hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)
that their demeanour throughout the debate today and on earlier
occasions has been not only exemplary but admirable? I very much hope
that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last words will bring together
everyone in the House on a subject on which we can surely all
agree.</p><p><a name="06061623000727"><b><a name="06061623001458">John
Barrett:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his
remarks.</p><p><a name="06061623000728">People often
say that politicians live in a bubble and that we are out of touch with
the real world. I have now been in this place for five years, which is
admittedly a lot less time than many others. During that time, however,
I have served on the International Development Committee, and I have
seen at first hand the work of the Secretary of State and his
predecessor, and of the Minister and the Department. I have also 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1033</b><br>seen at first hand what is happening in countries as diverse as
Ethiopia, India, Malawi, Mozambique, among others. I spent 20 years
working in industry before I came here, and I do not live in a bubble.
I have seen the extremes that people have to live through, and I know
what kind of legislation we need to pass to make an difference to
people. No matter how many problems we might have here, we are the
lucky ones. We can pass this legislation and make an impact on hundreds
of millions of people in developing countries who are in need. Although
they will not know our names, we can be sure that when the Bill is
passed it will make a difference to them.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001027">2
pm</h5><p><a name="06061623000729"><b><a name="06061623001459">Mr.
Cash:</b> I was glad to hear the Minister&#146;s comments
about the White Paper. I am grateful to him for offering a meeting to
talk about corruption. It was a pity that the Government and the
promoter of the Bill, the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston
and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke), could not agree to the amendment that
established the link between aid and corruption. I understand that he
was getting edgy at one point in the debate. I think that he thought
that the Bill would run out of steam. I happened to know otherwise, and
I support the Bill. I pay tribute to him for his work on the Bill. It
is a step forward.</p><p><a name="06061623000730">I
am passionate about the third world. Some people think that those from
my end of the political spectrum are somehow to be categorised as
right-wing and anti-development in the third world and all that goes
with it. Nothing could be further from the truth. I think that I can
say, without undue self-aggrandisement, that I took an active part in
the Jubilee campaign. Some 320 MPs backed my motion to support that
campaign. Those of my Conservative colleagues who have taken a strong
position on these matters include my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury
(Tony Baldry), Baroness Chalker and Lord Patten. There are many others.
I do not want anyone to take away the impression that such concern is
somehow exclusive to any one side of the House.</p><p><a name="06061623000731">I pay tribute to the right hon.
Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, however, and I was not
averse to his getting edgy earlier about my references to corruption,
which is an issue that needs to be addressed more specifically in the
Bill and otherwise. I also understand the sensitivities that it raises
in the international development context. There is that sneaking
feeling that those who go on about corruption might somehow be trying
to colonialise the public accounts of other nations. That is not the
objective, but there is a serious problem, which is recognised, for
example, by the all-party Africa group in its report, &#147;The Other
Side of the Coin&#148;, which I have mentioned, by Transparency
International and by Front-Bench spokesmen on both sides of the House.
I am certain that the Secretary of State and the Minister are well
aware that it is an issue. The figures that I gave show the dwarfing of
aid and debt reduction in that context. I have fought as hard as anyone
in the House to have that debt cancelled completely, because that could
release resources to help people who live on a pittance every day,
which is a disgrace and a moral outrage.</p>

to make progress because of the time constraints, but I congratulate
him on his Bill and continue to support its main
objectives.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001028">2.6
pm</h5><p><a name="06061623000737"><b><a name="06061623001460">Mr.
Tom Clarke:</b> With the leave of the House, Mr.
Deputy Speaker.</p><p><a name="06061623000738">I am
very pleased to follow the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), and I
agree with much of what he said. Along with the hon. Member for Boston
and Skegness (Mark Simmonds), my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon.
Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett), he acknowledged the input of
various all-party parliamentary groups such as the Africa and Great
Lakes Region and Genocide Prevention groups, and the group that deals
with important issues of debt. It was right to acknowledge their
helpful contribution to the development of policies and to the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061623000739">I want to
return briefly to corruption. Let me gently remind the hon. Member for
Stone, in the spirit of peace that appears to have broken out, that
this is not the only legislation that deals with corruption. I served
on the Standing Committee of what was intended to be the International
Development Act 2001, but was delayed by an election and became the
International Development Act 2002. One of its main sections deals with
corruption, and the issue continues to be
addressed.</p><p><a name="06061623000740">I think the
House has sensed that the important issue of the annual report and
Parliament, which is what my Bill is about, has not been
ignored.</p><p><a name="06061623000741"><b><a name="06061623001461">Mr.
Chope:</b> May I return the right hon. Gentleman to the
subject of corruption? Has he any figures that 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1035</b><br>might enlighten us on the exact amount of taxpayers&#146; money for
overseas development aid that ends up being wasted through
corruption?</p><p><a name="06061623000742"><b><a name="06061623001462">Mr.
Clarke:</b> That is a wonderful theme, and the hon. Gentleman
will be able to pursue it, along with the other points that he made,
when we have the annual report.</p><p><a name="06061623000743">I am particularly grateful to
people outside the House who have been supportive. Children are very
much in our minds when we deal with the issues in the Bill, and Jemima
Khan, speaking for UNICEF, was extremely
supportive.</p><p><a name="06061623000744">Many
issues will be dealt with if we have an annual report. By developing
the focus on, for example, the millennium development goals, the Bill
gives the House the opportunity to deal with an issue that has often
been the subject of debates, if not in this Chamber, then certainly in
Westminster Hall: HIV/AIDS. It is relevant to the MDGs, affects
millions of people&#151;men and women, and their families&#151;and
I know that the House wants very much to address it.</p><p><a name="06061623000745">I also welcome the fact that,
as was rightly made clear by my hon. Friend the Minister, the Bill
moved along, in that changes were made and it was improved. The number
of countries involved has been increased, and humanitarian aid has been
included. The Bill has also been tightened, as many asked for on Second
Reading. I trust that the House agrees that that has served to
underline something. I accept that it is not enough merely to have a
parliamentary report every year; I of course invite&#151;we all
invite, I think&#151;Parliament to act on that report. If the
information that we seek through the Bill is provided, the House will
be much better informed when it seeks to pursue some of the issues that
have been raised today, along with others that are perhaps on some
Members&#146; minds.
</p><p><a name="06061623000746"><b><a name="06061623001463">Mr.
Cash:</b> The right hon. Gentleman will understand that I was
concerned at the fact that the tightening of the Bill&#146;s scope
cut out my new clause. He mentioned the 2002 Act earlier. My new clause
related to that Act, so it has been cut out. However, I am not
complaining at this stage, because I want the right hon. Gentleman to
be able to complete his
speech.</p><p><a name="06061623000747"><b><a name="06061623001464">Mr.
Clarke:</b> I am delighted that my friend, the hon. Member for
Stone, wants us to end on a note of agreement; that is very good advice
indeed. The point that he makes will be pursued.</p><p><a name="06061623000748">As I was
saying, it is important not only that Parliament be informed, but that
Parliament listen. The better the information that we get, and the more
that we listen, the better will be our legislation and the policies of
the Departments that serve Government. For that reason, another clause
that I greatly welcome, and which adds to the Bill&#146;s content, is
that dealing with coherence across Departments&#151;an idea that I
know appeals to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State.</p><p><a name="06061623000749"><b><a name="06061623001465">Philip
Davies:</b> I again congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on
introducing this Bill and on steering it through the House; he will be
commended by many people in the country for doing so. I agree with him
that the report should not be an end in itself but a means to 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1036</b><br>the further end of greater understanding. Can he therefore explain why
he and his right hon. and hon. Friends voted against the new clause
proposed my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), which
would have guaranteed a debate on the report that he has done so much
to bring about?</p><p><a name="06061623000750"><b><a name="06061623001466">Mr.
Clarke:</b> With great respect to the hon. Member for
Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), the House was more convinced by the response
of my hon. Friend the Minister and therefore voted accordingly. In a
democratic Parliament, who am I to question that?</p><p><a name="06061623000751">The House itself, given that we
have endorsed the need for an annual report, will decide on the issues
that it wishes to pursue. It of course has a right to alter, through
future legislation, what this legislation says. It also has the right
to alter the 2002 Act&#151;if that is the will of the House. I merely
urge parliamentarians&#151;frankly, in the light of today&#146;s
debate, I doubt whether such urging is necessary&#151;to do the job
that I know we all want to do: to serve our people, to question, to
probe, and to deliver the best policies as effectively as we can within
each of the Government
Departments.</p><p><a name="06061623000752"><b><a name="06061623001467">Mr.
Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b> I had the great
pleasure of serving in Committee on this Bill. International aid comes
from not only this country, but many countries. Is there not a wider
dimension to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s efforts in encouraging
other legislatures around the world to hold their Executives to account
through similar annual
reports?</p><p><a name="06061623000753"><b><a name="06061623001468">Mr.
Clarke:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. I visited Sweden in
January and saw the impact there and Eveline Herfkens from the UN, whom
I have mentioned several times, would certainly agree with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
point.</p><p><a name="06061623000754">In conclusion,
I thank the House sincerely. It is poignant that we take our final
decision on the Bill 30 years after the dreadful riots in Soweto. I say
with some modesty that, among many others who have supported the Bill,
Nelson Mandela has made it clear that he welcomes it and would also
welcome the same procedure being introduced in other Parliaments. I
again thank everybody responsible for bringing the Bill to this point
and I hope that when it reaches the other place we will have influenced
them to move quickly towards the enactment of a very desirable piece of
legislation.</p><p><a name="06061623000755"><i> Question put,</i> That the

Power</h3><p><a name="06061623000925"><i> Motion
made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now
adjourn.<i> &#151;[Tony Cunningham.]</i></p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001029">2.35
pm</h5><p><a name="06061623000926"><b><a name="06061623001608">Dr.
Alan Whitehead (Southampton, Test) (Lab):</b> Some proponents
of renewable energy are fond of clinching their argument for its
radical extension with a phrase that goes roughly thus: Britain has the
largest supply of wind, the highest tidal range and the most powerful
barrage of waves of any country in Europe; there is enough of
nature&#146;s power to warm and heat every home in the country and
still tap only a fraction of what is out there. That is, of course,
true, but it can be seen as a truism: it does not in itself power
anything, and for the statement to be practically true, as some
opponents of renewable energy are fond of pointing out, we would have
to be served by veritable forests of wind turbines stretching across
the country and perhaps dam our estuaries with substantial tidal
barrages.</p><p><a name="06061623000927">Wind energy
has made great strides in recent years. With, I have to say,
considerable and often under-recognised support from the Government, it
has come into the mainstream of non-carbon-emitting energy in the UK.
Onshore wind is providing better capacity than was predicted, but we
have to acknowledge that practical problems remain, such as that of
generating enough power over the area covered by conceivably erectable
future wind farms, the planning process and, in some parts of the
country, the opposition&#151;misguided, I believe, and sometimes
based on spurious grounds&#151;from people opposed to the siting of
wind farms near their homes and in their area.</p><p><a name="06061623000928">Offshore seemed to be able
substantially to solve the problem of deriving a greater amount of
power from wind, but there are difficulties with that, too. Under the
Energy Act 2004, the Government have provided licences in two phases so
far: first, for building wind farms in inshore waters close to the
coast, a number of which are operational; and secondly, for larger wind
farms further out to sea, in areas such as the Wash, Morecambe bay and
the Thames estuary. However, offshore wind is more expensive per kWh
than onshore and some other forms of energy supply, and there are some
potential problems. Those include difficulties with grid connections
and the connections between wind farms and landing stations. Recently,
for example, the London Array site suffered the refusal of its landing
station permission by a local council. We hope that that will be
resolved soon, but there are problems with how those much larger sites,
located as they are fairly well away from shore, can land their power
and feed it into the national grid.</p><p><a name="06061623000929">Having said
that, offshore appears to be the future of large wind as a part of the
energy mix. It resolves the problem of space versus output&#151;for
example, when the London Array is fully operational, it will provide
sufficient electricity for the whole of Kent. In the medium to
long-term future, the grid is likely to be far more decentralised. I
envisage it becoming a more overlapping series of grids, more on the
model of the internet than on the present model of a few big power

<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1041</b><br>grid connections if the system, as a whole, is to work well into the
second half of the century.</p><p><a name="06061623000930">The question is how will things
go from here? Do we stop at phase 2 of the commissions that have been
given for offshore wind, important though those are? Section 92 of the
Energy Act 2004 provides not only for commissioning in the offshore
areas beyond the 12-mile limit, which have already been agreed, but
of</p><a name="06061623001008"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;waters within an area
designated under section 1(7) of the Continental Shelf Act
1964.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000931">That approximates
pretty much to the areas that were designated when the licences for oil
and gas exploration were issued some while
ago.</p><p><a name="06061623000932">If we provide
allocations in the third phase in deeper and further waters,
essentially up to the boundaries of the energy allocation zone for gas
and oil, will it be viable or will we be chasing an insurmountable
problem of greater costs unless there are viable grid connections? This
is where we need to take a step back, to consider whether such
allocations simply tread the present assumed path of connecting
umbilically to the UK shore, but with longer umbilici, if that is the
right declension&#151;or are there other ways forward?</p><p><a name="06061623000933">Why not consider, for example,
whether the farms themselves might be connected on a grid that lands in
the UK but also interconnects with farms and, perhaps, acts as an
interconnector between the UK and countries on the continent, such as
Germany and Holland? In the main, that would connect farms in the North
sea and would facilitate the construction of deeper-water farms further
out in the North sea, such as phase 3 allocations. Deeper-water farms
could also be connected at a later date in the Irish sea and in the
Atlantic on the edge of the continental shelf, and perhaps part of the
Mediterranean, where there are wind hot
spots.</p><p><a name="06061623000934">The advantages
of such a grid, if it were possible, are certainly clear. It would
facilitate the development of much larger, sustainable and clean energy
than has hitherto been envisaged. It would facilitate the development
of a real single energy market in Europe. It would use current
technology. No breakthrough in technological development would be
needed. The cable required is already in existence&#151;it is about
the size of a china plate and no new technology would be required for
developing and laying it. Most importantly, the output of such
geographically dispersed offshore farms could be aggregated and
smoothed. That would produce what is effectively a base load of energy
from wind with minimal
variability.</p><p><a name="06061623000935">Given
European weather patterns, essentially weather comes into Europe from
the Atlantic. It is always blowing fairly hard somewhere in Europe,
somewhere on the North sea. That is the situation pretty much all of
the
time.</p><p><a name="06061623000936"><b><a name="06061623001609">Mr.
Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b> I congratulate the
hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. Given that Britain
has a world leadership position in the use of sub-sea technology and
also in the construction of electricity grid systems, is there not an
ideal opportunity to extend our world leadership role in both
spheres?</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1042</b><br><p><a name="06061623000937"><b><a name="06061623001610">Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we have a
substantial lead. The development of such a grid system would not only
cement that lead but, with the right arrangements, would provide, among
other things, a substantial amount of future employment in the UK
economy.</p><a name="06061623000959"><p>The
variability of such an interconnected series of farms is important. It
is stated in the energy review&#151;or in the consultation document
for the review, on which we are shortly to hear the
results&#151;that:</p><a name="06061623001009"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;With
large proportions of renewables on the system, additional backup
(likely from coal, oil or gas) would tend to add to the cost and
technical complexity of system management. The electricity system as a
whole also requires a consistent &#145;base-load&#146; of
electricity. Because the potential for further large-scale hydro in the
UK is limited, coal, gas and nuclear power are currently the major
options for base-load in the
UK&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061623000938">Given the
development of new, deeper-water farms with an interconnector between
them, there is a new candidate for that base load. Cost savings would
result from easy connection to the grid and the interconnector, making
offshore wind farms far more competitive in future. In addition, when
fully developed, that system could be used as an auxiliary UK grid,
allowing the electricity load to be transported from the north to the
south. That is particularly important because, on current estimates, we
need to spend several million pounds on grid reinforcements. If that
funding is not forthcoming, it will be difficult to develop
technologies that put power on the grid at nodes distant from the
traditional spine and power station
centres.</p><p><a name="06061623000939">I hope that
hon. Members accept that that is an interesting proposal. It is not,
however, pure fantasy, as Airtricity, a large Irish-based renewable
energy company, wishes to play a substantial role in the development of
a supergrid, and has drawn up a detailed outline of the components of a
supergrid and the way in which it would work. It proposes a time scale
of five years, from 2010 to 2015, for a pilot programme to develop an
interconnector and grid between the UK, Holland and Germany in the
southern part of the North sea. That project would connect existing
offshore programmes and encompass new deeper-water wind farms of
10GW&#151;the equivalent of the generating capacity of 80 per cent.
of our nuclear power plants&#151;and it could make good the perceived
gap in energy supply by 2020.</p><p><a name="06061623000940">The foundation cost is about
&#163;1.3 billion for the grid and interconnector, together with the
cost of the wind farms, which is about &#163;1.3 million per megawatt
of installed capacity. The capital investment costs are probably lower
than the costs of new nuclear but, whatever my views on the
advisability of new nuclear plant commissioning, I am not suggesting
that such investment is a case of either/or. It is worth noting that
the projected investment cost does not pertain to the introduction of
untried or untested technology, nor is it likely to produce high cost
overruns. The project can be financed entirely privately, without any
fundamental changes to the regulatory regimes in the
UK.</p><p><a name="06061623000941">There are,
however, issues that need to be considered. I have already mentioned
the third phase of permissions in UK waters under the Energy Act. We
must consider, too, the deregulation of European markets. EU
commissioner Piebalgs has expressed 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1043</b><br>interest in the proposals, as have a number of Members of the European
Parliament, but will there be a level playing field if the trading of
electricity becomes a reality through the medium of such an
interconnector? The UK Government can take a lead on both issues. We
can speed up the allocation of phase 3 sites and participate in
deliberations at European level about how such an interconnector would
operate in a level playing field for energy trading in Europe. That
level playing field is vital for the long-term reliability of our
existing gas interconnectors, which, at the height of the spike in
wholesale gas prices in the UK last winter, were only half full of gas.
Much higher prices were paid in the UK than in Europe. The market would
suggest that the price would fuel the interconnector but, by and large,
it did not do so.</p><p><a name="06061623000942">The
main hurdle to be cleared is one of imagination, but it is not as high
a hurdle as may be thought. If, a relatively few years ago, someone had
said that we would in a few years erect platforms in a number of
locations, lay pipes across the North sea to connect them up, and
establish shore-based facilities to receive their contents, it would
have been easy to say that that could not be done, or that it would
cost the people of UK an arm and a leg to make it happen. But it was
done, and the North sea gas industry came of age.</p><p><a name="06061623000943">Those facilities are still
there as the gas industry declines, so why not a new phase for the
North sea at, incidentally, less cost than that of the first industry
that developed those facilities in the North sea for the benefit of the
United Kingdom? Why not a new phase in which the North sea once again
provides energy security, reliability of supply and low cost
electricity in exactly the way that gas has done over past 30 years? In
the context of our future energy planning, perhaps the question is not
why, but why
not?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061623001030">2.50

Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b> I am grateful to my
hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) for
raising the profile of the interesting proposal for an offshore
European supergrid, and for the opportunity to set out what the
Government are already doing to promote offshore wind and connect
offshore projects to the onshore electricity grid in Great
Britain.</p><p><a name="06061623000945">Let me set
the scene. In 2005, around 3.8 per cent. of the UK&#146;s electricity
supply came from renewables obligation eligible sources of energy. That
compares to just 1.5 per cent. in 2001, before the renewables
obligation was introduced. The growth in installed wind capacity has
been even more significant. In January 2006, we had some 1,300 MW of
installed wind capacity, compared to just 321 MW back in
1997.</p><p><a name="06061623000946">Although
most of the new capacity so far is onshore, offshore wind also has a
valuable contribution to make to our 2010 target of deriving 10 per
cent. of our electricity from renewable sources, and to our longer-term
aspiration that that figure should be 20 per cent. Helped by Department
of Trade and Industry capital grants, three large-scale offshore wind
farms are already constructed and operating, and a further one at
Barrow will start operating soon. These projects are part of the first
round of offshore wind farms. Round 2 has the potential to make an even
more significant impact, with individual 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1044</b><br>projects that could contribute around 1 per cent. of total electricity
supply. Rounds 1 and 2 offshore wind have the potential to contribute
more than 8 GW to the UK&#146;s generation capacity in
total.</p><p><a name="06061623000947">The energy
review to which my hon. Friend referred is examining the potential for
emerging low-carbon technologies, and how best to bring them forward.
The first outcomes from the review will be published later in the
summer, so I do not want to say more at this stage. However, I am
convinced that offshore wind has the potential to make a significant
contribution to the capacity gap that we will face here in the UK. The
challenge for industry and the Government is to turn that great
potential into a
reality.</p><p><a name="06061623000948">The
potential for emerging technologies and the development of a European
grid is also being considered at the European level. On 8 March this
year the Commission published a Green Paper on a European strategy for
sustainable, competitive and secure energy. The Government will be
responding to the Green Paper. The UK firmly believes that the
development of a competitive single market for energy should be the
framework within which we approach our European energy policy. Projects
such as offshore wind complement that
strategy.</p><p><a name="06061623000949">The higher
cost of developing offshore wind remains an issue, and the cost of
connection to the electricity grid is a part of that. Grid connections
are likely to form 10 to 15 per cent. of capital costs for the round 2
wind farms, given the considerable cable lengths involved. Certainty
about how the grid connection costs will be funded and the regulation
that controls them is therefore a key factor that developers need in
preparing their business models.</p><p><a name="06061623000950">I was pleased to announce back
in March that for offshore projects in UK waters, the Government have
decided to extend the existing onshore model of regulation of
transmission links. Following a joint consultation with Ofgem, I have
concluded that this approach has a number of clear advantages for
offshore projects&#151;first, extending the regulated price control
approach offshore will ensure consistency with the regulatory
arrangements onshore. Secondly, it will provide a financial benefit to
offshore developers, by spreading over a number of years the costs that
they face to connect to the onshore electricity system. Finally, it
will also mean that the responsibility for developing the offshore
transmission network will be shared by the system operator and the
transmission asset owners, who can bring their existing expertise to
bear. I believe that that will provide a significant cost benefit to
the industry, and that it demonstrates the Government&#146;s
continued commitment to the development of offshore
renewables.</p><p><a name="06061623000951">It is
expected that most of the grid connections for round 2 projects will be
direct connections to shore in Great Britain, either connecting single
offshore projects or by joint connections shared by several offshore
projects. The European supergrid proposal is an idea for the longer
term, possibly connecting up future rounds of offshore wind projects to
interconnectors between different member states. As such, the ideas
behind the proposal very much support two of the Government&#146;s
key energy policy objectives: first, to cut CO2 emissions,
which the proposal supports through the ambitious suggestion for
significantly more renewable development offshore; and secondly, to
promote competitive markets in Great Britain 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1045</b><br>and beyond by putting in place more physical connections between member
states, thereby providing the opportunity for cross-border
trade.</p><p><a name="06061623000952">As we have
heard, the UK has some of the best wind resource in Europe. The
challenges of climate change and the need to ensure security of supply
through diversity of supply sources means that we will need to consider
the utilisation of resources in areas not currently marked out for
exploitation. While there are currently no further plans to develop
offshore wind beyond the current round 1 and 2 projects, that is not to
say that the Government do not believe that further rounds may be
needed if we are to meet our longer-term aspirations for offshore
wind.</p><p><a name="06061623000953">Any
such moves to further offshore rounds will require careful
consideration, as we need to work with stakeholders to understand how
offshore renewables can successfully coexist with other marine
industries and be developed with the environmental impacts minimised.
The 
<br><notus-date day="16" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>16 Jun 2006 : Column 1046</b><br>Government intend to introduce marine spatial planning through a marine
Bill, which is currently the subject of consultation. When it is taken
forward, it will provide the opportunity to introduce strategic
management of sea use. The supergrid proposal for more offshore wind
projects in the North sea shows the industry&#146;s appetite for
further development.</p><p><a name="06061623000954">The UK also believes that the
liberalisation of the internal EU electricity and gas market is
essentialto EU economic reform. To progress greater
liberalisation, Europe needs to remove barriers to cross-border trade
to create more integrated markets, and in some cases to put in place
the infrastructure to connect those markets physically. The supergrid
proposal to link member states offshore is therefore very much in line
with our goal of integrating national EU energy markets by removing
barriers to the freer flow of energy around
Europe.</p><p><a name="06061623000955"><i> Question
