<p>1. <a name="41201-01_wqn0"><b> Mr. Andrew Robathan  (Blaby)</b> 
 (Con): If he will make a statement on progress by participants in the Belfast agreement in using their influence to achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms.  [199398]
</p>


<p>6. <a name="41201-01_wqn1"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold)</b> 
 (Con): If he will make a statement on arms decommissioning.  [199403]
</p>


<p><a name="41201-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Ian Pearson): </b> 
 It is essential, as the Prime Minister, Taoiseach and others have made clear, that all aspects of paramilitarism are put behind us in Northern Ireland. The decommissioning of paramilitary arms is an essential part of that objective and at the heart of our dialogue with the Northern Ireland political parties. I am happy to note that the Ulster Defence Association has engaged with the Decommissioning Commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-01_para0">
There have been four acts of decommissioning to date, the latest of which occurred on 21&nbsp;October 2003, when the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning reported that it had witnessed a third event in which IRA weapons were put beyond use.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Robathan: </b> 
 The Minister will have recognised the direct quote from the Belfast agreement. He will know perfectly well that, according to the agreement, &quot;total disarmament&quot; was expected by 22&nbsp;May 2000&#151;four and a half years ago. When will he stop listening to the lies of Sinn Fein&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does anybody doubt that they are lies? The lies are inextricably linked to the IRA. Sinn Fein promised total disarmament six and a half years ago. When will he hold Sinn Fein and the IRA to account?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 I have no problem in agreeing that Sinn Fein and the IRA are inextricably linked, but the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments are not helpful at this delicate stage of the talks process, and it would be inappropriate to comment further.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 We are, I hope, on the eve of an historic agreement between the parties in Northern 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 618</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Ireland, a critical part of which is the decommissioning process. Does the Minister agree that if all parties wish to participate in the democratic process, they must accept that the armed struggle is over and that we should have a clear and verifiable path to decommissioning? In saying that, we focus on the IRA and its associates, but should we not also focus on the decommissioning of loyalist paramilitaries?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 I agree. To use a rugby analogy, we are going up the pitch and are camped out on the 5&nbsp;yd line. We are tantalising close to achieving what I believe will be a long-lasting peace settlement in Northern Ireland. The hon. Gentleman is right to point to the fact that all paramilitary organisations, both republican and loyalist, must decommission and give up the path of violence completely. That is why I am very pleased that the UDA has decided to engage with the Decommissioning Commission. We as a Government will continue to exert any influence we can on all paramilitary organisations to decommission.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson  (Belfast, East)</b> 
 (DUP): I support the Minister&#039;s views on loyalist paramilitaries and the need for them to follow any initiative that might be taken by the Provisional IRA. Although he may not have found our comments helpful, they do, none the less, reflect a sincerely held degree of scepticism in Northern Ireland about the behaviour of the Provisional IRA. Therefore, any act of decommissioning must be not only conclusive and verifiable, but transparent in a way that has a visual aspect, so that the day afterwards no one in the House or outside has any doubt that the event occurred.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 Again, I am happy to agree. Public confidence in the decommissioning process is important. I recognise that greater transparency is required if both sides of the community are to be satisfied, and, as the hon. Gentleman will be aware, that is certainly something under detailed discussion.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. David Trimble  (Upper Bann)</b> 
 (UUP): May I, first, endorse entirely the final words of the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) about decommissioning? What he describes is simply the complete implementation of the Belfast agreement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-01_para1">
General de Chastelain and his colleagues on the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning have no obligation under the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Act 1997&nbsp;or the scheme made under that Act to keep the details of decommissioning secret. Will he urge the general to publish details of what has happened and what may happen, without worrying too much about the views of the paramilitaries concerned?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 I note the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments. The scheme and the regulations allow for confidentiality at the request of participants. I reaffirm the Government&#039;s confidence in the integrity and the abilities of General John de Chastelain. We recognise as a Government that public confidence in decommissioning is important. Discussions are ongoing and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 619</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Eddie McGrady  (South Down)</b> 
 (SDLP): So far, the Minister has referred mainly to paramilitary arms. Does that indicate a change of opinion from the one expressed in the joint declaration, which stated that all paramilitary structures and other activities&#151;criminal activities and so on&#151;are covered by the term &quot;decommissioning&quot;?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-01_para2">
How does the Minister respond to the fact that, although the Northern Ireland Office welcomed the UDA ceasefire some weeks ago, yesterday five UDA members were charged with conspiracy to kidnap? People with whom he has been negotiating were in court cheering on those who were accused of paramilitary and illegal activity. Does not that tell us what the people of Northern Ireland will think of both types of paramilitary organisation and their so-called decommissioning, not only of weapons, but of criminal and intimidating activity?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to point out that decommissioning is only one element&#151;albeit an important one&#151;of the process of removing violence permanently from politics in Northern Ireland, which is what we all want.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-01_para3">
As for the UDA, I do not wish to comment on a matter that is before the courts, but I will say that I welcome the arrests that the police have made. Paramilitary organisations must recognise that neither the Government nor the people of Northern Ireland will tolerate the crimes that they commit being treated any differently from ordinary crimes. The Secretary of State has made it clear in talks with the Ulster Political Research Group that that remains the Government&#039;s position. We have said before that we will judge the UDA on its actions, not on its words, and we will continue to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-01_para4">
On a more positive note, there are early signs of a decrease in paramilitary assaults since the UDA&#039;s statement. I welcome that.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hugo Swire  (East Devon)</b> 
 (Con): This is really a question for the Secretary of State, but he is curiously silent this morning, so I shall address it to the Under-Secretary. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that until there is verifiable and transparent decommissioning of all arms and paramilitary infrastructures, it would be most unwise to dismantle the existing security and military infrastructures in Northern Ireland?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 We are only on Question 1, and I am sure that my right hon. Friend will speak at some point. As for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s substantive point, the Chief Constable and the General Office Commanding keep the security situation under continuous review and ensure that we have the resources required to meet the threat assessed.
</p>




<a name="41201-01_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Cross-Border Trade</h4>


<p>2. <a name="41201-01_wqn2"><b> Hugh Bayley  (City of York)</b> 
 (Lab): What effect the recent depreciation of sterling against the euro has had on cross-border trade with the Republic of Ireland.  [199399]


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 620</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>


<p><a name="41201-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Barry Gardiner): </b> 
 The exchange rate between sterling and the euro has been relatively stable in recent years. Between June and October 2004, sterling depreciated by 3&nbsp;per cent against the euro. Given that the depreciation is very recent, it is not expected to have had a significant impact on cross-border trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew12"><b> Hugh Bayley: </b> 
 The growth in trade and investment and the record number of jobs in Northern Ireland that have come from that are among the real benefits to have emerged from the peace process. Does the Minister recognise that political certainty creates the right climate for investment and that the restoration of devolved government would create that certainty and therefore encourage further prosperity in Northern Ireland?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is correct. The stability brought about by the Good Friday agreement has resulted in a staggering increase in foreign direct investment in Northern Ireland in the past two years&#151;a total of about &#163;1&nbsp;billion, in fact. Major world companies, including Northbrook Technology, HCL and Citigroup, have decided to locate in Northern Ireland. They have helped to create 60,000&nbsp;new jobs in the past five years, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 5.7&nbsp;per cent. to 5.1&nbsp;per cent. and then to 4.7&nbsp;per cent. There has been a staggering improvement in the Province&#039;s economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-01_para5">
There has been a 90&nbsp;per cent. increase in the number of tourists visiting Northern Ireland. Tourists see it as a destination that is safe and good to visit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-01_para6">
Those are all benefits of stability. The hon. Gentleman is right that the restoration of the devolved Assembly would be a tremendous signal to investors and tourists that Northern Ireland is on track and is a place to do business.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Jeffrey M. Donaldson  (Lagan Valley)</b> 
 (DUP): Speaking of jobs, I hope that the Minister will welcome the prospect of 1,000&nbsp;new jobs at the proposed John Lewis department store in Sprucefield, which will have the benefit of attracting cross-border trade. Does the Minister recognise that we are competing with Dublin for this project and that Departments in Northern Ireland must make every effort to secure this investment for the Province?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 Yes. The hon. Gentleman will know that a planning application has been made and that it would not, therefore, be right for me to comment on it, although I understand that it is being dealt with as expeditiously as possible. The hon. Gentleman is right about large companies locating in Northern Ireland: they bring with them jobs and prosperity, which is what we want. Business is confident that it can invest in Northern Ireland and make money. I have in mind the companies that I have visited recently, such as Andor Technology, a home-grown company, and Montupet and Michelin. It is clear that companies see Northern Ireland as a very good place to locate and do business in the single market in Europe.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 621</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. George Foulkes  (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Is the Minister aware that when I was in Derry recently the euro was readily accepted in shops, hotels and taxis, and that Northern Ireland is in the vanguard of acceptance of the euro? Is it not about time that the Government met the five tests and that we get into the euro as quickly as possible?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend will appreciate that the five tests are beyond my ministerial portfolio. He is right to highlight the fact that in Derry and other parts of Northern Ireland it is extremely important that we offer tourists what they want, part of which is being able to do business in euros&#151;people expect that when come from Europe. Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom that shares a land border with the eurozone, so it is doubly important that such a facility is available. That shows, once again, the strides that tourism is making in Northern Ireland to meet customers&#039; needs.

<p>3. <a name="41201-02_wqn0"><b> David Burnside  (South Antrim)</b> 
 (UUP): How many parties represented in the Stormont Assembly retain links with terrorist organisations; and what his latest estimate is of the terrorist threat posed by such links.  [199400]
</p>


<p>7. <a name="41201-02_wqn1"><b> John Barrett  (Edinburgh, West)</b> 
 (LD): If he will make a statement on the peace process.  [199404]
</p>


<p><a name="41201-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Paul Murphy): </b> 
 Intensive dialogue on political advance between the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland parties continues. We have in that context put to some of the parties the detailed proposals of the two Governments on the best way forward. We await a response.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-02_para0">
The Independent Monitoring Commission has identified associations between the leadership of paramilitary groups, and Sinn Fein and the Progressive Unionist Party. I do not believe the links of themselves increase the threat of terrorism, but it is essential that paramilitarism itself should come to an end.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew0"><b> David Burnside: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for that answer. Last month a leading member of Sinn Fein was jailed for four years in the Irish Republic for spying on democratically elected politicians in the south of Ireland&#151;an incident similar to the one that led to the closure of the Stormont Executive and the operational Assembly. The month before, in October, the police believe that the IRA-republican movement were involved in a &#163;1&nbsp;million robbery of cigarettes in south Belfast. Does the right hon. Gentleman believe that the ordinary people of Northern Ireland can tolerate republican criminals being placed in the Executive of Northern Ireland? Does he not realise that ordinary Unionists and people on the ground, irrespective of the views of some political leaders, are totally against Sinn Fein-IRA republican terrorists being in the Government of Northern Ireland?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I think that the ordinary people of Northern Ireland would agree that we must tackle 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 622</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>criminality in all its forms very robustly. I agree that people who are accused of crimes and are found guilty should be dealt with according to the law. However, I also think that the ordinary people of Northern Ireland want a future based on power sharing between nationalism and Unionism. I believe that everybody in Northern Ireland would like the restoration of their Assembly and Government and, to that end, I applaud the work of all the parties that are trying to ensure that that happens. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that it is far better to have a Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive than direct rule.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew2"><b> John Barrett: </b> 
 What steps is the Secretary of State taking to ensure that the current talks include supportive parties such as the Alliance party, not just the Democratic Unionist party and Sinn Fein?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 The Good Friday agreement was made between all the parties in Northern Ireland that were at the talks, so it is important that any agreement is as inclusive as possible. Sinn Fein and the DUP are the biggest parties in their respective communities, so they have an important role to play because of their electoral mandate. The other parties, too, have an extremely important role to play, and we cannot go forward unless there is consensus among them. I met the leader of the Alliance party in recent weeks. Indeed, I met its deputy leader yesterday, and the Alliance party is meeting the Prime Minister today in Downing street.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Seamus Mallon  (Newry and Armagh)</b> 
 (SDLP): The outgoing Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir John Stevens, has stated on the record that there were substantial links between Northern Ireland authorities and an illegal paramilitary organisation, and that that collusion resulted in a number of deaths, including that of Pat Finucane. Does the Secretary of State agree that the public and the family of Pat Finucane have a right to know what those links are and how long they lasted? Does he further agree that the links between the authorities and a terrorist organisation can be properly established only by a fully independent tribunal that deliberates in public and has restrictions placed on its findings?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right that everybody in Northern Ireland wants to find out the truth and what happened. I agree, too, that the only way to do so is through a genuinely independent tribunal that looks at the issues. He knows, of course, that when Judge Cory looked at those issues and at whether the tribunal should meet in public or in private, he said that as far as possible it should do so in public but that, inevitably, because of issues of national security, it would not always be possible. My hon. Friend also knows that the inquiries Bill will soon come before the House, so he will be able to scrutinise that measure and make his points. I agree absolutely that we must find the truth and that there is no excuse whatsoever for collusion.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Nigel Dodds  (Belfast, North)</b> 
 (DUP): Does the Secretary of State accept that Sinn Fein must get rid of all the weapons of terrorism in a credible, verifiable and transparent way and that there must be a complete end to the criminal and other activity that occurs daily? 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 623</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Otherwise, democrats in Northern Ireland must move on without Sinn Fein, and will there be a Government commitment to that effect?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 It is not just the Government who committed themselves&#151;the Good Friday agreement itself said that the only way forward in Northern Ireland was through non-violent and peaceful means. Clearly, decommissioning is an important part of that. We have just had exchanges across the Floor about how that should happen, and I agree not only that decommissioning must be final, full and transparent but that everybody must have confidence in the way in which it is carried out. He is also right that there must be an end to paramilitary activity by all sides in Northern Ireland. Until we get there, we will never have a properly democratic society. He also knows, because he has been involved in recent negotiations, that those important issues are currently being discussed. I sincerely hope that in the days ahead we will resolve those difficulties and secure an agreement that will ensure that we have an Assembly and an Executive in Northern Ireland very soon.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew8"><b> Mr. David Lidington  (Aylesbury)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Secretary of State share my sense of exasperation that 10&nbsp;years after the first ceasefires were agreed, parties linked to paramilitary organisations are still able to impose political control on certain areas by resorting to violence, intimidation and crime? Must we not insist that, to get terrorism out of politics altogether, we must see the end of paramilitary structures and organisations so that people everywhere in Northern Ireland and from all parties look to the police and the courts, not to the paramilitaries, to enforce the law and see justice done?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right in everything he says. He can rest assured that those principles lie at the heart of the current discussions and negotiations between the parties and the Governments. I sincerely hope, as I have just said, that the discussions will be fruitful and that we will resolve those issues.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for that assurance. Will he bear in mind in the negotiations people&#039;s fears, particularly in areas such as South Armagh and parts of Fermanagh, that a reduction in the number of soldiers and the removal of watchtowers might expose them to the sort of terrorist threat that is still alive in those areas and from which their families have suffered for many years? Will the Secretary of State make it clear that the Government will place the security interests and the defence of the people of Northern Ireland ahead of any need for political gestures to republican parties?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 It is not about political gestures. If there is normalisation in Northern Ireland, which again is part of the Belfast agreement, it has to be based on a genuine move by paramilitaries. Normalisation features prominently in the current discussions. I agree that people&#039;s security should be uppermost in any Government&#039;s mind, but if we have an agreement&#151;if there is movement in the way that we want it to happen&#151;we want a normal society in Northern Ireland, whether in South Armagh or any other part of the province.

 (Lab): What steps he has taken to combat religious bigotry in schools.  [199401]
</p>


<p><a name="41201-02_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Barry Gardiner): </b> 
 Let me make it clear that there is no place for intolerance in schools, and schools in Northern Ireland have been in the forefront of tackling the issue. I condemn any form of prejudice in society and commend the efforts made by schools and teachers to help overcome it&#151;for example, through integrated education and elements of the curriculum such as education for mutual understanding, cultural heritage, religious education and, in the future, the citizenship programme that will be coming into our curriculum.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Allen: </b> 
 The Minister will be aware that the Secretary of State for Education and Skills has issued guidance to schools in the UK that they should offer a broad-based education in religious and other life-value systems so that youngsters get a broad idea of different views. Does that apply in Northern Ireland, the place where it is probably most needed? If not, what other steps does the Minister propose to ensure that youngsters from both communities can receive an inoculation against the religious bigotry that infests their communities?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 We already have in schools in Northern Ireland cross-curricular themes such as education for mutual understanding and cultural heritage, which are doing tremendous work in bringing children together and helping them to cope with the different traditions that exist there. From September 2006, the revised curriculum, which I have accepted, will bring citizenship in as a compulsory element at key stages 3&nbsp;and 4. That will include topics such as diversity, inclusion, equality and human rights. My hon. Friend will be well aware of the number of integrated schools in Northern Ireland, which are also doing tremendous work. They have a combined enrolment of 16,000&nbsp;pupils already. Much good work is going on in the denominational schools as well to ensure that children cope with the pressures in society.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew14"><b> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire)</b> 
 (LD): Has the Minister read the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which says that the unavailability of unsegregated education might raise education rights issues? The Government say that they are in favour of choice. In the light of the overwhelming demand and substantial under-provision, will the Minister make a commitment that every parent who wants to send their child to an integrated school will have that opportunity in Northern Ireland?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman knows that the Government are obliged not to promote any particular form of education, but to encourage and facilitate any form of education in accordance with the wishes of parents.

<p><a name="41201-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Blunt: </b> 
 On Monday, the Government-appointed South East England regional assembly rejected the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s plans for concreting over the south-east. In the new year, the Deputy Prime Minister will re-impose his plans on the south-east. Will the Prime Minister explain the point of that body, which the Deputy Prime Minister will ignore, as he ignores our properly elected local councillors, who are infinitely more capable of deciding housing numbers in their own areas?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-03_spmin1"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The South East England regional assembly is responsible at this stage for examining alternative options for the development of the south-east. We are at an early stage in the process and should take it one step at a time. Let us be clear that anyone who looked at housing supply in this country would recognise the need to build more homes in the south-east. We need to build more homes, the majority of which will be on brownfield sites. We will protect the green belt, but those hon.

 We are doing our best to make sure not only that we get the necessary orders for the Swan Hunter plant and for other plants, but that anyone who is made redundant is given full help in order to be able to retrain and get another job. Exactly the same package of measures that has been put in place in my constituency and other constituencies where jobs losses have unfortunately occurred will be put in place there. From my experience in my constituency, I know that that package of measures is immensely successful in getting people new jobs. Since the Government have been in power, I am glad to say that we have 2&nbsp;million more jobs in this economy. People remember the days when unemployment was 3&nbsp;million and people had no help to get new jobs.

<p><a name="41201-03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Michael Howard  (Folkestone and Hythe)</b> 
 (Con): On Monday, the chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life repeated the Committee&#039;s view that allegations against Ministers should be considered by members of an independent panel, drawn up in agreement with the Opposition, which would be ready to act whenever an allegation is made. That recommendation was originally made in April 2003, and the Prime Minister rejected it. Will he now reconsider it?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-03_spmin3"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 No, for the reasons that we gave at that time. We believe that it is better, if an allegation is made, to appoint people on an individual basis and not to have a standing panel. That is the right way to do it. In this instance, we have someone of unimpeachable integrity who will examine all the facts of the case and come to a conclusion.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 Let me tell the House what Sir Alistair Graham, the man appointed by the Prime Minister to chair this important Committee, said a couple of days ago:

</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-03_para0">
The Prime Minister said that he wanted the highest standards in public life. He appointed the Chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. The Committee has made clear recommendations. Why has not the Prime Minister accepted them?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-03_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 We did not accept this recommendation because we believe that it is better to appoint people on an individual, case-by-case basis. The right hon. and learned Gentleman talks about the speed of the inquiry&#039;s being set up, but the allegations were made on the Sunday in the newspapers, and that day, at the insistence of the Home Secretary, somebody was appointed to examine them. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman would agree that Sir Alan Budd is a man of independence and unimpeachable integrity. He will have the opportunity to look at the facts of the case and to make those facts known to the public. I cannot see what is wrong with that way of proceeding.

 (LD): How much will each individual end up having to pay for their identity card?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-03_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 As I have already explained, the reason we should introduce identity cards is that in any event we will have to introduce biometric passports. Of the &#163;85&nbsp;cost, &#163;70&nbsp;is attributable to the biometric passport, and only &#163;15&nbsp;to the additional amount for the identity card. Given what that does for us as a country, in terms not only of security but of access to services and tackling issues such as illegal immigration, I think that that is money well spent.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Kennedy: </b> 
 Two years ago, the Home Office said that the entire scheme would cost &#163;3&nbsp;billion. Two days ago, it said that the revised estimate, which is not a final maximum figure, was now running at almost twice that amount. Given the history of this Government when it comes to introducing complex information technology systems, not least for the Child Support Agency and tax credits, will the Prime Minister rule out any company that has had its hands in those fiascos having anything to do with identity card systems? Does not all this, financially and in terms of potential complication for the individual citizen, have all the hallmarks of another Government fiasco in the making, with the individual being left to pick up the tab?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-03_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is simply wrong on the costs. The ID card element is around &#163;85&nbsp;million a year, and that is spread over several years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-03_para1">
Let me go back to the point that I am trying to make to him. In any event, because many countries&#151;the United States, those in Europe and elsewhere&#151;are introducing a requirement for biometric visas, it is important that we introduce biometric passports here. That will already mean considerable change over the next few years. It makes sense in those circumstances, given the new biometric technology, also to have an identity card. The additional cost of that is quite small in relation to the overall cost. We think it is necessary not only because of issues to do with security and terrorism but, as I said to the right hon. Gentleman a moment ago, because of issues relating to access to services&#151;for example, ensuring that people who use the national health service are entitled to do so.
</p>

What has happened to violent crime and gun crime since he became Prime Minister?

<p><a name="41201-03_spmin11"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, in respect of the horrific murder that took place a short time ago in London, I think we would all like to express our sympathy to the family concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-03_para5">
According to the British crime survey, violent crime is down. It is correct that, on recorded crime, it is up. The right hon. and learned Gentleman knows that that is largely because of changes that have been made, for example, in recording domestic violence. Of course, violent crime and gun crime are too high. That is precisely why we have introduced new measures in criminal justice legislation to provide that anyone who is caught in possession of a firearm will be given a minimum sentence of five years.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 The British crime survey figures do not include murder, rape, drug offences or crimes against children, which is why the Prime Minister never mentioned them when he was Leader of the Opposition and why he then used the recorded crime figures only. On the recorded crime figures, violent crime is up by 83&nbsp;per cent., 1&nbsp;million violent crimes are committed every year and gun crime too has doubled. He said:

 I do not have the figure in front of me for what has happened since 1997. I do have the figure for the last year, when the rate of detection increased. However, I have to say to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that the British crime survey is taken as the most authoritative crime survey overall. That is why it is used.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-03_para7">
In respect of crime, let me just remind the right hon. and learned Gentleman that when the Conservatives were in power crime doubled, and when he was Home Secretary police numbers fell. In relation to violent crime, when he was Home Secretary&#151;on both recorded crime and the British crime survey&#151;it rose, which is simply to say that this is an issue here and in many other countries. We are taking action on it. The new legislation that we are introducing now, as well as that which we have introduced over the past couple of years, has tightened the law considerably. We will continue to do it. Let me just draw the contrast: on any basis, crime under this Government has fallen; it rose and doubled under him.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 The Prime Minister, to make his point against the last Government, has just used the recorded

Now, let me tell him what has happened to detection rates under his Government. For violent crime, they are down 35&nbsp;per cent.; for sexual offences, they have fallen by half; overall, detection rates have fallen by more than 10&nbsp;per cent. since he took office.

The Prime Minister promised to make criminals face up to their offending behaviour. How many crimes have been committed by prisoners let out before the end of their sentence on his early release scheme?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-03_spmin14"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, let me just correct the right hon. and learned Gentleman. It is true that recorded crime went up under the last Conservative Government, but if he wants to take the British crime survey, it also went up by over 50&nbsp;per cent. under the last Government. In respect of his record, I said that violent crime went up when he was Home Secretary, and it did. Recorded crime went up by 18&nbsp;per cent. So, let us have no more from him about how he managed to achieve this great reduction when he was Home Secretary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-03_para10">
The fact is that violent crime has been rising for a number of years. In relation to early release, fewer than 2&nbsp;per cent. reoffend. These are people who are going to be released in any event. I might just say that when that early release scheme was introduced to the House, it was supported by everyone, including Conservative Members.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 More than 3,500&nbsp;crimes have been committed by prisoners released early under this scheme. The Prime Minister says that that does not matter, because they are only 2&nbsp;per cent. of the crimes committed in this country. That is a disgraceful thing to say, and it will be no consolation at all to the victims of those crimes. The failure rate under the early release scheme has almost doubled since the Home Secretary extended it. Is not it the simple truth that under this Prime Minister the fight against crime is being lost and crime is out of control?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-03_wqn3"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Let us just be quite clear: overall, crime has been falling, not rising. That is not simply my view; it is the view of any independent analyst who has looked at the crime statistics. It is also the case that crime doubled under the Conservatives or, if the right hon. and learned Gentleman wants to use the British crime survey, it rose by over 50&nbsp;per cent.
</p>



<p>The point is that under this Government we have record numbers of police officers and the new antisocial behaviour legislation. We now have new measures on drugs and drug addiction and crime. We have community support officers. I did not say it does not matter if people commit crimes; of course it matters. It is no consolation to anyone who is a victim of crime to be told that crime has fallen, but neither is it any

Secondly, it will amend the Protection from Harassment Act 1997&nbsp;to extend it to the harassment of two or more persons who are connected, such as employees of the same company. Thirdly, it will provide an additional power for the police to direct a protester to leave the vicinity of a home and not return to it within a specified period up to three months. I assure the hon.

<p><a name="41201-04_spmin3"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I am glad that my hon. Friend has said that. In addition to the excellent school results, there has been record capital funding for our schools. Indeed, there will be &#163;17&nbsp;billion of capital over the next three years. It is possible to visit primary and secondary schools in any constituency and see the results of investment in extra classrooms, extra teachers, extra teaching assistants and, in many cases, new school wings or even new schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-04_para2">
According to the shadow Chancellor, there would be &#163;35&nbsp;billion-worth of cuts in spending over the next few years. Therefore, the choice is very simple: keeping up this investment in our schools system under this Labour Government, or returning to the bad old days of cuts under the Tories.

<p><a name="41201-04_spnew4"><b> Mr. Alex Salmond  (Banff and Buchan)</b> 
 (SNP): Does the Prime Minister understand the level of concern in Scotland caused by the Secretary of State for Defence&#039;s apparent dismissal of the substantive case for keeping historic Scottish regiments as merely the tartan question? How can Labour be trusted to represent Scottish interests if that is an example of the standard of senior Ministers&#039; thinking? Does the Prime Minister accept that ultimately, this will be a matter for his personal decision, and according to what time scale does he intend to make it?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-04_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 We have made it clear, as I said earlier, that we have got to balance the Army&#039;s requirement for more flexible deployment of troops with maintaining regiments&#039; traditions. I have listened, and will listen, very carefully to what my hon. Friends say and to what Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members say. However, the idea that the Scottish National party should lecture us on the British Army is one of the most absurd that I have ever heard. If the hon. Gentleman had his way, there would not be a British Army. So we will take these decisions in the best interest of the British Army and the United Kingdom.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;but regret that the Gracious Speech contains nothing that will reduce regulation, cut excessive bureaucracy or give the taxpayer value for money; condemn the Treasury for sponsoring 70&nbsp;new regulations per working day, for blocking real reform of public services and for the consequent failure to deliver cleaner hospitals, school discipline, controlled immigration, more police on the streets and a lower tax economy; further regret that the Gracious Speech contains no measures to reverse the Chancellor&#039;s punitive taxation of pension funds and reductions in tax incentives to save which have contributed to cutting the savings ratio by one third whilst household debt now exceeds one trillion pounds; are disturbed that more pensioners are means tested than ever before whilst 2&nbsp;million pensioners live in poverty; note that the Treasury&#039;s failure to provide taxpayer value and the waste of billions of pounds on unnecessary expenditure means that another round of stealth tax rises is inevitable under this Government; and further deplore the fact that there are no measures in the Gracious Speech to reverse the Government&#039;s policy of high levels of regulation and taxation which have resulted in the UK slipping from fourth to eleventh in the international competitiveness league and having a lower GDP per head than Ireland.&quot;.</p>

Before I begin discussing the main substance of today&#039;s debate, I want to make a few remarks about the Bills in the Queen&#039;s Speech relating to the economy. The Treasury&#039;s Bill on the merger of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise carries our general support, as the Chancellor is aware, although we remain concerned about its practical implementation. We are dealing with two organisations that have between them 250&nbsp;legacy computer systems and some 13&nbsp;million customers. It is no mean feat to put them together, and we will want to look at the details extremely carefully.

<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 637</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-05_para1">
Before dealing with the Bills relating to the Department of Trade and Industry, I want to point out that the Queen&#039;s Speech does not include two Bills that&nbsp;might conceivably have been expected to be included.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-05_para2">
One is the provision for real estate investment trust rights, and I hope that the Chancellor will confirm that clauses will be forthcoming to deal with the introduction of such rights either in the Finance Bill or by some other means. The Opposition believe that those new vehicles have a great deal to offer to our economy. We would want to ensure that the means by which they are introduced are not over-bureaucratic and restrictive, but we would want to support measures to introduce them into the capital markets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-05_para3">
Also notable by its absence&#151;it was not present in the Queen&#039;s Speech&#151;was any reference to a statistics Bill. I hope that the Government will draw up proposals to deal with the issues raised by the Statistics Commission about the transparency of national statistics. We shall produce proposals in that connection in the next few weeks and I hope that the House will have the opportunity to discuss and debate such matters during this Session.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-05_para4">
In respect of Department of Trade and Industry legislation, the consumer credit Bill carries our general support. We are particularly keen to see some change in the extortionate credit test. As long as the Bill moves&nbsp;towards increasing transparency rather than imposing undue bureaucratic burdens, we will support its gist.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-05_para5">
The equality Bill is in much the same position. The CBI, as the Chancellor will be aware, has warned that the new proposed commission for equality and human rights could too easily become too concerned with enforcement, too bureaucratic and not sufficiently concerned with promoting good practice. We will want to see whether those dangers are apparent in the Bill and we will want to debate the provisions in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-05_para6">
I now turn to the main subject of today&#039;s debate. Tomorrow we will have an opportunity to see the Chancellor launch his personal election campaign with his customary brio and to discuss the very poor fiscal position that he is in. Today I want to take the opportunity to do something different and examine the Chancellor&#039;s economic record, which he is both pleased about and proud of. He frequently presents his economic record as being all for the best in the best of all possible worlds&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Government Front Members seem to be very happy about the situation.

 The right hon. Gentleman has the uncanny knack of falling into the very trap that I am seeking to set for him. It is perfectly true that we are willing to admit it when things go wrong. The problem that I am about to illustrate is the fact that the Chancellor does not know how to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-05_para10">
The Chancellor is incapable of recognising that the inheritance we built up after the ERM fiasco&#151;I admit that it was a fiasco&#151;was the strongest inheritance that any Chancellor has had in living memory, as is attested by the Prime Minister&#039;s economic adviser. As that adviser points out, there is a question mark over the Chancellor&#039;s economic performance. Neither the right hon. Gentleman nor the Chancellor are very keen to admit it, so I shall go through the record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-05_para11">
It is fair to say that the Chancellor is especially proud of his record on stability. He speaks about stability on almost every available occasion. That record of stability has two aspects&#151;fiscal and monetary. However, the remarkable fact about both those forms of stability is that they are due to the fact that the Chancellor has allowed someone else to set the policy. His fiscal stability, which is now running out&#151;we will talk about that tomorrow&#151;derives almost exclusively from the fact that for the first two years the Government&#039;s policy on spending was set by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), the previous Chancellor, whose spending plans the Chancellor obeyed for two years. Had he not done so, he would not be within a million miles of adhering to his golden rule today. Indeed, he would be in the most terrible trouble.

Well, what has his record been on productivity growth? It has dropped by a third. The Chancellor shakes his head. Why does the Chancellor shake his head?

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 640</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The Treasury uses the so-called underlying trend rate of growth of productivity and it seeks to persuade itself that the productivity growth rate is reasonable. But the ONS, which is not in this respect governed entirely by Treasury diktats&#151;thank God&#151;produces a different series of actual productivity growth rates which show that they have dropped by a third.

 Absolutely not at all. The hon. Gentleman suffers from the most astonishing delusion if he believes that the Department of Trade and Industry is currently assisting British competitiveness.

Let us turn to growth. The Chancellor is proud of his record on growth, too&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear&quot;.] Yes, his hon. Friends are very pleased about it, too, but they do not spend much time noticing that about six sevenths of the growth in the last quarter was due to the public sector. They do not do much comparison of our growth rates with countries that are growing fast. The Chancellor likes to compare us with the eurosclerotic zone; by those standards, he says, we are doing brilliantly. But what about the rest of the world? What about the other major English-speaking countries; how does our economic growth compare with theirs? It is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 641</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>slower than that in any other major English-speaking country. It is half the rate of growth in Ireland since 1997; our per capita income is now below that of Ireland. Why? Because in Ireland they have been following quite different economic policies from those of the Chancellor.

I admit that in this one respect the motion is insufficiently generous to the Government, because that translates into 70&nbsp;per week or 15&nbsp;per working day, which is an increase of 53&nbsp;per cent. on the figures for 1979&nbsp;to 1996.

The fact is that the Government have produced these dismal figures on productivity, competitiveness and growth in very large part because they have over-regulated our economy. They have overtaxed our economy, with 66&nbsp;tax rises including many on business. The CBI, which has assessed the annual business tax bill at &#163;54&nbsp;billion in the year 2005-06&nbsp;on current trends, points out that this is a rise of &#163;7.6&nbsp;billion from 1997, and adds that to the cost of the additional regulations to show that this Chancellor, who prides himself on being a friend of business, has actually added &#163;15&nbsp;billion a year of costs through extra regulation and extra tax on business.

The Chancellor has blocked every effort at radical reform of the public services to try to overcome the vast productivity gap there. He destroyed foundation hospitals. He destroyed them so much that he even led to the removal, by his own will, of the then Secretary of State for Health. What does the Chancellor do about this? He tries to deal with the figures rather than the facts. The broad fact is that we have had a 25&nbsp;per cent. increase in spending on our hospitals in real terms, and only a 5&nbsp;per cent. increase in the number of treatments or finished consultant episodes. And what happens as a result? The national statistician is called in, and he is asked to redo the productivity figures for the health service; and he calls in Sir Tony Atkinson. What does Sir Tony Atkinson do? He tries to create 10&nbsp;different measures by which he could prove that the productivity of the national health service has not gone down.

So I return to my original question&#151;what is the reality behind the myth? The reality is this.

On inflation, consumer prices are averaging just 1.3&nbsp;per cent. on the new index, 2.4&nbsp;per cent. on the old index, contrasted with 6&nbsp;per cent. average under the Conservative years.

<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 646</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>2004, he agreed that the single most important consideration&#151;I hope that the shadow Chancellor is listening, because he may have to adapt his policies as a result of this&#151;is the cost impact of government. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Businesses are reluctant to locate in places where: tax rates are high&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Places like Ireland, the USA, Hong Kong, Singapore and the UK attract because their tax rates for business are low.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-08_para1">
So the shadow deregulation Minister does not describe the condition of the British economy as does the shadow Chancellor, who says that our tax rates are unacceptable, and has told an audience outside the House that tax rates are low.
</p>

<p>

The shadow deregulation Minister went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The second most important consideration is a flexible and willing work force. The third issue is access to market and to supplies. The fourth issue is ease of doing business&#151;do you feel happy there?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The UK&#039;s strong academic links around the world are an important part of our network&quot;</p>

<a name="41201-08_para6">
What of the next stage: the Queen&#039;s Speech itself, and our policies? The shadow Chancellor did not mention the child benefit Bill. It will enable the Government to extend financial support to trainees who are unwaged and to 19-year-olds completing a course of non-advanced educational training. That will remove the disincentives in financial support for young people to stay on in education while at work. With the growth of education maintenance allowances, it will help many of the 100,000&nbsp;who do not stay in education and training. I hope that the Opposition will support the Bill, even though the right hon. Gentleman did not mention it.

 Perhaps the curve will take him over the threshold. The savings ratio is 6.2&nbsp;per cent. now; it fell to 4.5&nbsp;per cent. in the late 1980s under a Conservative Government. The savings ratio is only 2&nbsp;per cent. in the United States of America. The hon.

 The savings ratio reflects the cycle; it reflects the point at which the economic cycle is.

We shall set out proposals for 100&nbsp;per cent. multilateral debt relief from international institutions, which could complete the process of debt relief for the 37&nbsp;poorest countries and could be extended to other poor countries as well.

The Liberal party has been making commitment after commitment on spending over the past few months.

He said:
</p>
<ul>

<a name="41201-10_para4">
We are owed some precision from the Liberal party on these matters in this debate. If it is going into the&nbsp;election giving the impression that 41&nbsp;per cent. is the correct figure, it will have to be honest with the electorate that it would be cutting public spending. At the same time, I look at all the proposals that have been put forward by the Liberal party&#151;abolishing tuition fees, introducing maintenance grants, introducing free long-term care, introducing 10,000&nbsp;more police officers, cutting council tax bills, extending off-peak travel&#151;

The list adds up to more than &#163;10&nbsp;billion. That is money that the hon. Gentleman cannot afford if he would freeze public expenditure. The money that we had last year has risen. As everybody knows, it has been rising this year and it will rise next year and the year after. Only last week, in the Queen&#039;s Speech debate, the Liberal environment spokesman, the hon.

 I am happy to do so if the hon. Gentleman can clarify the matter. If he is setting public expenditure at 41&nbsp;per cent. and at the same time he wishes to spend at least &#163;10&nbsp;billion more, what is the message going out to Liberal candidates? They cannot go round the country saying that they support more spending when they are outside Westminster, when the hon. Gentleman&#039;s rule is that spending would have to be cut. This is not a question of Liberal party policy nationally being that there should be more spending, it is a question of cutting the share of public spending in the national income. I hope that I can give the hon. Gentleman the opportunity to clarify that.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-10_spnew14"><b> Dr. Cable: </b> 
 I am delighted to have the opportunity to do so. The Chancellor is absolutely right that we have a set of spending commitments that amount in total to about &#163;10&nbsp;billion a year. Half that would be generated by the higher rate of tax. As someone who has argued in favour of social justice over the years, surely the right hon. Gentleman would be in favour of that. That is 50&nbsp;per cent. tax on earnings over &#163;100,000. The other &#163;5&nbsp;billion a year comes from cutting other elements of public spending, which undoubtedly include some of the things that the right hon. Gentleman believes in passionately, like the Department of Trade and Industry and the baby bond scheme. However, we would cut them to finance priority spending.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-10_spnew15"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 That is extremely illuminating. The hon. Gentleman will cut public expenditure by &#163;5&nbsp;billion. I think that he owes the House and the country an explanation of where these cuts will be made. He is also saying that he will increase public expenditure by &#163;5&nbsp;billion through a tax change. Yet at the same time he says that the share of public spending in national income will fall. I suggest to the House that his figures do not add up in any way. He is claiming that he will spend less, while in every part of the country the Liberals are committing their party to spend more.

When Lady Thatcher was Leader of the Conservative party in the 1970s and was facing the 1979&nbsp;election, her policy was not to make any spending commitments.

There is a gap between the Conservative party&#039;s spending commitments and the real world, and it must find &#163;50&nbsp;billion of cuts, which cannot be achieved by savings on paper clips in the civil and public services.

The right hon.

If a Conservative Administration were in power tomorrow, they would be looking for a total of &#163;70&nbsp;billion of efficiency savings. That is the state of play for the Conservative party.

On fiscal policy, the Chancellor will have to acknowledge over the next few days that there is a growing consensus that he has a problem in meeting his fiscal objectives. It is not a political point. The International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research are not politically driven bodies, but they are all arguing that he faces that problem. It may not be a big problem quantitatively&#151;&#163;7&nbsp;billion, &#163;8&nbsp;billion or &#163;10&nbsp;billion is a very large sum to most individuals, but in terms of the economy it is not a very large sum. That is the standard consensus projection of the extent to which the Chancellor will be adrift in respect of his fiscal policy objectives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-11_para8">
My concern is not the sum of money. Economically, it is not large and could easily be absorbed in the Government&#039;s overall borrowing requirements, since the debt position is comfortable. The issue is credibility&#151;fundamental economic credibility. If the Government set tests, they should be able to meet them. The Government clearly understood from the outset that economic credibility was important. Indeed, this year the Nobel prize went to a couple of economists who spoke about the importance of economic credibility. Credibility was what lay behind the decision to establish the Monetary Policy Committee, and it has enhanced the credibility of interest rate setting enormously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-11_para9">
There is a problem, however, with the way the Government have approached fiscal policy. They set fiscal rules, which are broadly sensible, and more or less followed them, but there is a question about who decides whether those fiscal rules have been met. Will that be determined independently or by the Government? The golden rule is a highly technical area. Even for anoraks, it is a recondite subject. There are a couple of specific issues. First, who evaluates the assumptions that the Government make in their forward projections? At present, the Government invite the National Audit Office, on a restricted basis, to examine those assumptions and pass judgment on them. That is sensible, but the NAO does not have unrestricted access to evaluate the Government&#039;s assumptions, and it should.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-11_para10">
The second aspect that is defective is who decides what the golden rule is and whether it has been met. That is a technical point but it is extremely important. Who decides when the cycle started and when it ends? That is a difficult question. In my private sector days, I was once set the problem by my company. If the company had known the answer, it would have saved a lot of money in investing in refineries and chemical plants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-11_para11">
Somebody must answer the question, and it should not be the Chancellor, but a genuinely independent body. That is why we argue that the National Audit Office should have an enhanced role&#151;economically and technically, it has competent staff&#151;to evaluate the full range of fiscal policy and give an independent judgment on which the Government can then base a credible fiscal policy. There is no party political advantage in arguing

 As a former member of the Public Accounts Committee, I know that the NAO has to borrow civil servants to do its calculations. It would probably have to borrow civil servants from the Treasury to fulfil the role that the hon. Gentleman is setting out for it. Is he saying that there are civil servants in the Treasury who have been falsifying the figures, or that the credibility problem, as he calls it, is that people do not believe the figures because they come from the Treasury? What difference would it make to transfer people who currently do that work in the Treasury to do it at the NAO?

On the wider question of economic policy, we have discussed the rate of economic growth, which is respectable. It would help, though, if instead of looking back, we looked forward. Any honest assessment of the future must be based on the fact that the Government will face economic challenges that will make economic management much more difficult. Some of them are external and the Government have little control over them. It is still possible that we could be hit by a major oil shock. The Saudi Oil Minister was in London yesterday arguing that something of the order of $15&nbsp;dollars a barrel is still being paid, on account of the political risk arising from the war and enhanced terrorism risk in the middle east. The oil price could get a good deal worse, but it is not a factor that the Government can control.

A second challenge that is looming is the problem presented by the collapsing dollar. I could make the point that sterling is now higher than at any time since the days of black Monday, but it is not a domestic issue. It relates to the United States. The American currency is collapsing, at least in part because of fiscal irresponsibility caused by a tax-cutting agenda on which, I fear, we differ substantially from the Conservatives. It has had disastrous consequences in the US and it will have a major impact on this country.

We also have a home-grown problem, which is the problem associated with personal debt, and the linked problem of boom and bust in the housing market. Some revealing figures on personal debt were produced in the

<a name="41201-12_para3">
On the position in the housing market, I have no views&#151;it is not sensible for politicians to have a view on whether it is good for house prices to rise or fall. What is serious is that we have a boom-and-bust environment. Within the past few weeks, we have seen growing evidence of a very substantial collapse in lending and in equity withdrawal, which almost certainly, according to analysis by the Bank of England, will have major economic consequences. I do not raise the matter simply as a problem. It would be helpful if the Government thought through some of the steps that they could take to alleviate the problem. I shall make a few suggestions.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-12_spnew4"><b> Mr. Nigel Beard  (Bexleyheath and Crayford) (Lab):</b> 
 The Bank of England gave evidence to the Treasury Committee yesterday and did not concur in any way with the predictions that the hon. Gentleman is making. It gave no indication that it believed that boom and bust was about to occur.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-12_spnew5"><b> Dr. Cable: </b> 
 The Bank of England quarterly bulletin is full of articles describing the difficulties in detail. Why has the Bank of England taken on the job of setting interest rates in relation to the housing market? As the Governor has made abundantly clear, he is alarmed at the possibilities that will arise. There are certain things that the Government could sensibly do to alleviate the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-12_para4">
The first is to ensure that we have a price index that reflects the housing market. At present we do not. I understand that the Treasury is working with EUROSTAT to establish a new index that will fully incorporate the price of housing. It would be helpful if the Government would say whether they intend to adopt it and when. That would enable the Bank of England to take house prices much more explicitly and clearly into account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-12_para5">
Another problem relates to credit insurance. One way of stopping hundreds of thousands of people facing the disasters that people experienced in the early 1990s would be to ensure that their mortgage payments and credit payments were insured. If the Chancellor had studied the problem and thought about it, he would know that the mortgage insurance market in this country is unsatisfactory. It is expensive and defective. I hope that he can take some initiative to ensure that the competition authorities look at it.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-12_para6">
Long-term growth and the factors that drive it is the third issue that I want to raise. I sympathise with the views expressed by the Conservative spokesman about the Government&#039;s remarkable optimism that their intervention in promoting innovation and growth will produce consequences. One of the reasons why I am sceptical about pouring large amounts of money into the Department of Trade and Industry, which does some useful things, is my extreme scepticism about the extent to which that can drive economic growth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-12_para7">
Scientific research is clearly a Government responsibility: the market will never do it, but it is clearly a public good. That is why I am in favour of, among other things, bee research, which the Chancellor and the Prime Minister found so surprising and amusing. Research is clearly desirable and the Government should fund it. It is, however, another thing to argue that private companies, many of which would invest anyway, should be subsidised to do so, when they can raise money in venture capital markets and from charitable bodies such as the Wellcome Trust. The market enables growing companies to function without large-scale funding from the DTI, and I am sceptical about the role that the Government are playing in driving economic growth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-12_para8">
The other area of scepticism relates to the complexity of Government regulation. The Chancellor has a view, with which I happen to disagree, that somehow or other the Government can fundamentally change how business behaves and operates. The classic example of that is the belief that the Government have invested in research and development tax credits. R and D tax credits are a superficially attractive idea&#151;&quot;R and D is a good thing. Let&#039;s give them a big tax credit to support it.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-12_para9">
All the research done in the past two years shows that R and D tax credits have made no difference to the level of research and development, because most private companies were doing it anyway and the policy has a large associated dead-weight cost. I am not suggesting that we should simply stop that tax credit, but we must evaluate its consequences. The belief that tweaking the tax system and adding great complexity somehow or other changes business behaviour and increases investment, innovation and growth is fundamentally flawed.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-12_spnew8"><b> Ms Sally Keeble  (Northampton, North) (Lab):</b> 
 Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he would keep the tax credit, despite the fact that he thinks that it does not work, or is he saying that he would get rid of it? Will he get on to other Liberal Democrat tax and spending plans, because some hon. Members are interested in hearing them?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-12_spnew9"><b> Dr. Cable: </b> 
 As I have said, any sensible Government of any party would evaluate the effects of policy before rushing in to change them. The research and development tax credit is a good example&#151;we need to be guided by experience. If it works, we would judge it more sympathetically.

<p><a name="41201-13_spnew0"><b> Dr. Cable: </b> 
 Yes. The hon. Gentleman is right. This morning, the <i>Financial Times</i> published a letter supplied by the Treasury, which makes the opposite point from the one that it was intended to make. It was published to highlight the horrors of tax avoidance and the iniquity of tax avoidance lawyers and states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;As the government regularly changes the rules of the tax game, you need to be very vigilant. You have to check continuously to see you&#039;re still getting the best from your company&quot;.</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-13_para0">

<p><a name="41201-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. Martin O&#039;Neill  (Ochil) (Lab):</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has sought to disparage the R and D tax credit and has assumed that companies that receive it would have invested anyway and remained in Britain. However, the market in a number of areas is international, both for business and for tax and rewards. A number of companies have invested considerable sums in Canada, where Liberal Governments have provided the kind of R and D tax assistance that the hon. Gentleman disparages in the United Kingdom.

 If I were representing a company in front of the Treasury Committee, that is exactly what I would say. Why look a gift horse in the mouth?

My final point is rather different and relates to an issue, inequality, on which I probably share much more common ground with the Chancellor than do the Conservatives. One thing that has emerged from the statistics, which are somewhat unsatisfactory, is that, despite the Chancellor&#039;s undoubted commitment to that issue, income and wealth inequality in the UK are not very different&#151;in some respects, they are even worse&#151;than they were in the days of Mrs. Thatcher. There are several reasons why, some of which involve the workings of global markets, and some of which involve the workings of the tax system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-13_para2">

</p>





<p><a name="41201-13_spnew6"><b> Dr. Cable: </b> 
 We have suggested that a better way in which to deal with the position of older pensioners would be to give them a decent, basic old age pension rather than a pension credit. One of the reasons why, which we have debated extensively, is that large numbers of pensioners do not claim pension credit. More seriously, those pensioners who claim face a very high marginal rate of tax&#151;40&nbsp;per cent. of them pay more than half their marginal income in tax as a result of benefit withdrawal. The system is so pernicious because it is a massive disincentive to save. It does not solve the problem of inequality.

In conclusion, the Chancellor has let it be known in the press over the past few days that he wants to present himself, his Government and his Budget with a flavour of Britishness. Economic policy will gain a patriotic element, which I appreciate because we all like to feel that we are patriotic rather than nationalistic. Under this Government, however, we have finished up with American levels of inequality, French levels of centralisation and, if the Home Secretary has his way, we will get Chinese levels of civil liberties.

Some would say that the housing market has gone off the boil, which would have implications for the economy. The risks to the UK economy are largely international, with oil prices at $50&nbsp;a barrel or so, the implications of the USA&#039;s current account deficit for the global economy and the sluggish growth in European countries.

One of the issues that the Treasury Committee will consider with the Chancellor is how to improve productivity.

There are several sobering statistics for us as regarding developing countries. Within 20&nbsp;years, half the world&#039;s manufacturing exports could come from those countries. Already, China is exporting more than France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Indeed, Asia is exporting as much as the European area. We can learn a lot from what is happening in those countries in terms of the need for us to develop our skills in the knowledge economy. We pride ourselves on the information technology graduates who come out of our universities, but India and China are producing 125,000&nbsp;computer science graduates compared with 5,000&nbsp;in the UK.

I welcome those steps. However, we need progressive policies on science and skills. As a chemistry graduate, I am very sad that Essex university is closing its chemistry department&#151;[Hon.

There are 3.17&nbsp;million people in Great Britain who receive pension credit. That is a great testimony to the Government and their initiative since 1997. I also note that the Government will spend an extra &#163;10&nbsp;billion on pensioners in 2004&#150;05; &#163;7&nbsp;billion more than an earnings link would have provided. Some parties offer an earnings link for four, eight or six years, certainly not for eternity. The Government are right about the issue.

<a name="41201-14_para5">
Adair Turner and his colleagues on the Pensions Commission have been examining whether it is worth saving for pensions. They found that the pension credit, through the savings credit, rewards pensioners aged 65&nbsp;and over who have made modest provision throughout their lives. It is worth &#163;14.70&nbsp;a week to individuals and &#163;19.20&nbsp;to couples. That is a welcome development. Are there pensioners who may lose out? Yes. Is it worth while saving in today&#039;s environment? That is manifestly the case. The Turner commission and others made that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-14_para6">
Withdrawal rates were mentioned earlier. Before 1997, pensioners faced a withdrawal rate of 100&nbsp;per cent., with savings being matched to benefits, pound by pound. The new savings credit rewards people for saving and that is a progressive policy.

Three issues dominate the subject of financial services, to which the Treasury Committee has given a great deal of consideration in the past. First, a healthy financial services industry is crucial to the country. It is a &#163;2&nbsp;trillion industry, a major employer, a major provider of capital to United Kingdom companies and a major repository of savings for nearly every family in the country. Policy makers cannot allow the industry to fade away as several great United Kingdom industries faded away in the past.

<p>
<a name="41201-14_para8">
Secondly, rightly or wrongly, there is a loss of trust in the industry, and customers have departed. Ron Sandler said in his testimony to the Treasury Committee that local supermarkets are now trusted more than major insurance institutions. We need to correct that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-14_para9">
Thirdly, major parts of the financial services industry have abandoned everyday, average Britain. In many ways, it is a middle-class pastime. We have not reached those people on lower incomes and poorer people to get them to save. The industry must take that on board. The other side of the industry&#151;the credit card providers&#151;is inundating us with promotions for cards, but that does not apply to the asset gatherers. They have complex products and expensive distribution channels. That needs to change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-14_para10">
I have held discussions with the industry in the past few weeks. Along with the industry, consumers, the Association of British Insurers, the Investment Managers Association and others, we hope to establish a forum for the industry and consumers to come together to examine issues that affect financial services and consider the future so that we can rebuild a healthy industry. That is one of the reasons why I welcome the consumer credit Bill. The Treasury Committee has been banging on about it for many months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-14_para11">
The need to tackle unfair credit agreements, for more regulation, to excise the crooks from the market, for a fairer regime for business and, overall, as the shadow Chancellor said, for a clearer and transparent market, is important. We need to implement the Bill before May 2005. That is an arbitrary date but it is important that the measure is implemented before then. I do not want us to resile from that commitment. I therefore ask Treasury Ministers and others to respond to that specific point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-14_para12">
I agree 100&nbsp;per cent. with the Chancellor about better public services. However, my right hon. Friend knows that civil servants, especially lower paid civil servants, are concerned about the number of redundancies that have been announced. The Chancellor appeared before the Treasury Committee in July and I note that the Public and Commercial Services Union welcomed his statement in July. However, it makes the point that there should be an agreement between the Government, the unions and other civil service organisations about the steps that Departments should take to avoid compulsory redundancies. Time should be allowed for civil service-wide machinery to be put in place. It is incumbent on the Government to do that, given that most of the individuals who could be made redundant are the lower paid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-14_para13">
The policies that were announced in the Queen&#039;s Speech and today&#039;s debate ensure that we will rise to the long-term challenges that face the country. How do we implement the Lisbon agenda? How do we make Europe a more competitive environment? How do we continue to ensure UK economic growth and more employment in our communities? How do we ensure safer communities for our constituents and their families? If we can achieve those aims, we will have a better Britain and a more contented country. I wish the Government well in that but warn them that the Treasury Committee will examine the detail of the pre-Budget report to ensure that the Chancellor and his colleagues live up to their promises.

<p><a name="41201-15_spnew0"><b> Mr. Howard Flight  (Arundel and South Downs) (Con):</b> 
 Tomorrow, one way or the other, I believe that we shall hear the Chancellor&#039;s last pre-Budget statement. Today, we have heard the Chancellor being, a little unwisely, as complacent and boastful as ever. If he, like me, had got on his bike in the past few weeks and visited the financial community, on which so much of our earnings for our imports depend, he would have found it increasingly concerned about the deterioration in our public finances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para0">
If I may put it simply, our economy is close to full capacity. The norms of Government borrowing are; borrow when an economy is well below capacity to keep it afloat, but that it is sensible, when an economy is at full capacity, to be in balance or even in surplus. However, our borrowings this year approach &#163;40&nbsp;billion. We have an external current account deficit that is likely to be around &#163;40&nbsp;billion. That is not a balanced, well positioned economy. It is irrelevant whether the Chancellor fudges the figures to fulfil the golden rule because the position is the wrong way round. The golden rule makes sense over a cycle if one borrows when there is slack in the economy and moves into surplus when it is at full capacity. Doing it the other way round leaves matters positioned wrongly for the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para1">
Estimates of the black hole that would have to be filled by additional taxation if the Government were re-elected vary between &#163;11&nbsp;billion and &#163;20&nbsp;billion. The latest City estimates have continued to increase. Again, on the golden rule and the true underlying position, it is disappointing that the Chancellor had to resort to cooking the depreciation figures to squeeze another few billion pounds in his favour. As we all know, instead of treating the cumulative deficit on a numbers basis&#151;adding the pluses and minuses&#151;the Chancellor resorted to a bogus method of average in relation to gross national product, giving a figure that is not the actual monetary cumulative deficit over the cycle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para2">
My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) went through the wider issues that make it clear that the economy is no longer as well placed as it has been. We have dropped from fourth to eleventh in the world&#039;s competitiveness league. We have underperformed when compared with the other English-speaking economies, especially Ireland. Our productivity growth is a third down on what it was under the Conservative Government and below the EU average, when the Chancellor is perhaps among the most critical of EU economic performance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para3">
The savings ratio is down not only because of the cycle; it has been down by a third on average in the past six or seven years. That presents considerable problems for pension accumulation and investment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para4">
We still have a stock market, although the Government have done their best to wreck it. They appear to believe that long-term investment can be financed by cashing bonds. A sad disappointment may be encountered. This country&#039;s stock market has underperformed by 35&nbsp;per cent. when compared with the United States and France. It has even underperformed by 10&nbsp;per cent. when compared with Germany. I do not claim that the stock market 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 668</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>constitutes a full measure of the position of an economy but it is ignored at peril. There are serious imbalances in the economy.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-15_spnew1"><b> Paul Farrelly  (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab):</b> 
 Have the hon. Gentleman&#039;s City friends ventured an opinion on how the shadow Chancellor&#039;s figures stack up? He proposes tax cuts on top of spending cuts.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-15_spnew2"><b> Mr. Flight: </b> 
 I am pleased to tell the hon. Gentleman that they understand perfectly well what we are saying and that they are surprised that neither the Chancellor nor Labour Members seems to understand. I shall summarise it very simply; perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be able to understand. We have set out our spending strategy, which, instead of the Government spending 42&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product, will result in us getting the figure down to 40&nbsp;per cent. over the period to 2008. The amounts have been set out bit by bit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para5">
I and various colleagues set up the taxpayer value review in which 60&nbsp;people under David James have considered each area of Government. It is not quite complete, but there will be savings significantly in excess of the Gershon savings. Now, let us take those two together. We have made it clear that in some areas additional spending will be needed&#151;for example, in defence, and for our policies of choice in health and education&#151;but the resulting overall position will clearly permit some scope to reduce taxation by a significant amount over the next period of government.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-15_spnew3"><b> Mr. O&#039;Neill: </b> 
 I appreciate that the James study has not been completed, but there must obviously be some overlap between Gershon and James. Can the hon. Gentleman give us any indication of its extent, because surely any additional money over and above James is all the Conservatives would have to offer as a tax cut?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-15_spnew4"><b> Mr. Flight: </b> 
 Again, I am grateful for the intervention. First, there is the question of how much of both is cash for real and how much accounting entries. The hon. Gentleman will no doubt be aware that roughly half of Gershon is accounting entries, not for real. If he reads our announcements, he will see that we have got up to a figure of, if I recollect correctly, approximately &#163;24&nbsp;billion and covered about 70&nbsp;per cent. of the territory. He can make his own estimates as to where we will get to in the fullness of time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para6">
The second task is to consider how much of our work is cashable and how much is not. The answer is that the proportion that is truly cashable is substantially higher than Gershon. The James review has covered all the territories that Gershon has covered. There are a lot of territories that Gershon has not covered; I cannot understand why the Chancellor did not give the review a full brief to consider all areas. On the figures that are available to date and in respect of what I have just said, I trust the Chancellor understands that, in cashable terms, quite a significant margin will come through in excess of Gershon.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-15_spnew5"><b> Mr. James Plaskitt  (Warwick and Leamington) (Lab):</b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman is referring to the James report, can he confirm that its proposals are official Conservative party policy?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-15_spnew6"><b> Mr. Flight: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman, but I think that is rather a strange question. The Conservative party 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 669</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>has made it quite clear that the David James team is an independent body that is considering the whole public sector and will report back to the Conservative party, which will make its policies very clear when our election manifesto is set out. That is perfectly clear and straightforward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para7">
The reality is that the Chancellor has presided over a rising tide of personal debt, but he has kept the figures looking good and created hundreds of thousands of public sector jobs, although only 100,000&nbsp;of the total of 600,000&nbsp;mean, as he has just said, more people in the front line; more doctors, more nurses and so forth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para8">
What lies behind what has happened is the tale of the two Chancellors; I am sure Labour Members have read it. William Keegan wrote a superb book entitled &quot;The Prudence of Mr. Gordon Brown&quot;, which I was asked to review earlier this year. Indeed, he set it out very clearly that the Chancellor, in his first three years in office, was deliberately prudent to seek to win the longer-term confidence of middle England and the financial community. Then, he embarked on a massive public spending splurge from 2000&nbsp;onwards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para9">
It is worth focusing on the macro figures and on the Office for National Statistics figures in relation to that public sector spending. By the end of this tax year, spending and taxation in cash terms will be up by about 60&nbsp;per cent. The question begs itself; where has all that spending gone? Every citizen knows that they do not see improved delivery of anything like 60&nbsp;per cent.&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> If Labour Members would care to pause for thought, they would realise that the ONS figures show that approximately 80&nbsp;per cent. of all that spending has been consumed by public sector inflation as the ONS defines it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para10">
What is public sector inflation? It is a mixture of several things. It is basically higher pay for those working in the public sector and more people; another 600,000. When I was a student economist, I asked my teacher why people earned less in the public sector than in the private. He said that they had greater security of employment and better pensions. That seemed a fair balance to me, but the ONS now shows that, level by level, pay in the public sector is 20&nbsp;per cent. higher than in the private. Indeed, many of my friends who work in the health service have made the point to me that the money is not getting through for additional facilities, but has come through in significant pay increases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para11">
Again, we should consider the macro data. In 1997, public sector inflation was 1.6&nbsp;per cent. It is now running at 10&nbsp;per cent. We should consider the productivity data. The Government try to hide the figures, but productivity in the public sector has declined by 10&nbsp;per cent. This is the overall story of failure to reform the public sector, failure to deliver, excessive regulation, excessive bureaucracy and more and more costs between money at the centre and getting it down to the delivery units.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para12">
As William Keegan&#039;s book points out, this was the Chancellor&#039;s great fear; that people would say, &quot;You&#039;ve spent all the money, but the delivery is not there. You&#039;ve wasted it.&quot; So, the Chancellor set up his target regime. Alas, that was based on an entirely out of date concept that had not worked in the private sector in the 1970s and 1980s; management by objectives, setting targets 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 670</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>from on high and dictating to the people working, rather than bringing them in and getting suggestions from the coal face on how to do things better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para13">
We have heard little or nothing of the targets regime because, in the main, it has been a failure. Targets have not been met, they have distorted priorities, and they have greatly upset and demotivated people working in the public sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para14">
Last summer, I think, the European Central Bank commissioned a group to consider public sector spending in this country compared with that in other countries. It found that, compared with Japan and the United States of America, our public spending was enormously wasteful, citing a figure of 20&nbsp;per cent. inefficiency. We were only slightly better than France and Germany.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-15_para15">
Now, the ECB is hardly an organ of the Conservative party, but that is the magnitude of the inefficiency of our public sector. Indeed, that is why the Chancellor was eventually obliged to set up his own Gershon review, after we had started work on our review. I have already said quite a bit about that work in answering various questions, but I repeat the point that if the Chancellor wishes to understand what we are saying, rather than ranting a lot of, candidly, gibberish, he should consider what has been announced area by area in the David James review and what the shadow Chancellor said last spring about the spending plans. He will find that the figures add up perfectly logically.

<p><a name="41201-16_spnew0"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 I should have asked the hon. Gentleman this question earlier when he was talking about the James review. Which specific areas should the Chancellor have considered for spending cuts that were excluded from the Gershon review but included in the James review?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Flight: </b> 
 There are a large number of areas. As the hon. Lady will be aware, broadly, the approach of Gershon has been to say, &quot;Here are areas where money can be saved, such as better procurement and pooling back offices and various other things. Now, civil servants, try to find 2.5&nbsp;per cent. savings.&quot; I was contacted by a friend who has been seconded to the Home Office who said that people there said, &quot;We have not even got proper financial accounts to know what we are spending and how, and how we can effect the economies.&quot; That is a measure of how unsatisfactorily our public sector is run.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-16_para0">
Broadly, the James review has considered matters area by area, detail by detail; in only a few areas has Gershon done that. I suggest that the hon. Lady would get an answer to her question if she read the summary reports of the James review and noticed that Gershon has not covered any of that territory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-16_para1">
I want to move on to two other big areas, but the essence of the point&#151;I am concerned about complacency and, candidly, so is the City&#151;is that everybody knows that this country cannot afford not to reduce tax and regulation. We face the challenge of Asia. Most service businesses can move elsewhere and this country has become considerably less competitive. Capital inflows are trailing off quite worryingly and those who come to Europe increasingly go to central Europe, not this country. Unless we make our economy 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 671</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a good deal more competitive, we will have a less promising future than the Chancellor seems to think he is presiding over.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-16_para2">
I want to say a little about pensions. Having talked to members of trade unions, I can see that everyone knows that the one thing that the Chancellor has really messed up has been our pension savings. Earlier in the debate, the Chancellor referred to my comments about the British stock market having halved. He does not seem to understand that as a result, first, of the &#163;5&nbsp;billion removal of advance corporation tax credit, the stock market fell 20&nbsp;per cent. further than it needed to have done, because stock markets bottom when dividend yields cross over gilt yields. Logically, had 20&nbsp;per cent. of dividend yields not been removed, the stock market would have bottomed 25&nbsp;per cent. higher than it did. The extent of the fall led to forced selling by pension schemes, life companies and individuals, and a fall of 50&nbsp;per cent. has understandably destroyed investors&#039; confidence. If citizens no longer have confidence in long-term equity saving, it will not be possible for the whole economy to move forward satisfactorily, as that is where the money comes from for real investments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-16_para3">
A stock market fall of that extent, to which I referred at the time, has had a disastrous effect on equity savings, leading to the unwillingness of people to save. So far this year, there have been net withdrawals from individual savings account schemes. What bigger measure can one have of the loss of equity confidence? Again, if people think that pension funds will be able to accumulate enough through investing in bonds and cash, another thought is coming to them. The only way in which a sufficient amount can be accumulated over the long term is through successful equity investment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-16_para4">
My real criticism is not just of the &#163;5&nbsp;billion per annum that the Chancellor has taken away, but of the knock-on effects, which have been enormously greater. Outstanding final salary schemes still have deficits of around &#163;100&nbsp;billion. Coincidentally, if a price-earnings multiple is applied to the &#163;5&nbsp;billion loss of income&#151;a multiple of 20&nbsp;is a fair average&#151;that is equal to exactly the &#163;100&nbsp;billion that is missing. More than 10,000&nbsp;schemes have gone into wind-up, affecting more than 300,000&nbsp;individuals. As the National Association of Pension Funds has recently warned, three quarters of employers&#039; final salary schemes are facing funding difficulties. As companies must put that money into their pension schemes, that reduces their profits, and as their profits are hit, faith in equity investment in this country is hit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-16_para5">
I say to the Chancellor that the voters of Britain&#151;not just the financial community&#151;understand what has happened and do not like it. They are well aware of the biggest single area in which he has failed seriously.

<br>&nbsp;<br>evidence for the assumptions on which he based so much of his arithmetic. Indeed, if one wanted to examine the reasons for the difficult performances in the pensions industry, one need only look at such a so-called specialist and the way in which he glibly manipulates figures to suit his own purposes, as many of us have thought that many of the people responsible for pension funds elsewhere have done in the past. Certainly, such slick arithmetic does not make any serious contribution to an issue that vexes many people and has perhaps created greater distrust in the City and in financial institutions.
</p>

It is for reasons of that nature that we find that the savings ratio is not what we would want it to be&#151;people do not trust financial institutions, because of mis-selling, bad calculation and failure to take account of basic demography. Consequently, while there may be some lack of sympathy for the performance of this Government in relation to pensions, there is no substitution of sympathy with the Conservative party, as evidenced by its woeful showing in the opinion polls.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-16_spnew3"><b> Mr. Flight: </b> 
 I am well aware of the issue of mistrust in financial institutions. As a bottom line measure, however, does not the hon. Gentleman accept that the fact that ISAs&#151;although largely about individuals buying individual shares and doing their own thing, and not the same as pension saving&#151;have gone negative demonstrates that people have lost confidence in equity investment? That is the most worrying point.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-16_spnew4"><b> Mr. O&#039;Neill: </b> 
 I am not sure exactly what percentage of ISAs are accounted for by equity investments, in so far as many people take them through building societies and just opt for tax-free interest on a very safe investment. The hon. Gentleman, by his question, has illustrated my point: the evidence that he provides is, to say the least, superficial. We have had a repeated statement from the Chancellor today that the savings ratio has increased by 6.2&nbsp;per cent. this year. I will not duck the charge that the savings ratio has been disappointing, but it is improving. It may be that people are taking money out of one account and putting it into another, although that is not what I wanted to talk about today.

The Queen&#039;s Speech has an interesting symmetry, because the preoccupation in debates earlier in the week was security, but in some respects no kind of security comes home more quickly to people than economic and financial security. If we are to sustain the economic security that many of our people still enjoy, with many people, certainly in my constituency, in employment for the first time in many years and enjoying a degree of security that they have not experienced previously in their working lives, we must recognise that there is a sense in which any financial or economic advantage that the country has will of necessity be short-lived.

We talked earlier about investment in research and development, and there was some disparagement of R and D tax credits. It is not long ago, however, that I and others, including Opposition Members, were coming to exactly the same conclusion&#151;that to encourage companies to invest in research and development, fiscal incentives were necessary. There could still be other kinds of financial incentives to encourage investment beyond R and D.

Let us face it: within British manufacturing, there is still gross under-investment per head. If there is any identifiable factor involved in the poor productivity that besets this country, that is it. In France and Germany, far more money is put behind each individual worker in manufacturing industry in the shape of newer and better kit. I have often argued that the engineering industry could benefit from that to a great extent, and certainly an engineering industry that is currently severely beleaguered because of the sad difficulties affecting part of the car industry, which historically has sourced its equipment from the west midlands and the industrial manufacturing areas of the country.

Companies such as Jaguar are prestigious, and companies such as MG Rover still account for a large volume of orders, although perhaps not for a large volume of output, but many traditional manufacturing supply chain companies operating in this part of the world and the economy are fragile at present, and if they fell by the wayside Japanese companies would find inward investment less attractive.

The Government should realise that if we are to have a research and development-led industry and promote the transfer of technology from the university laboratory to the workshop and larger areas of production, we must be sensitive to the plight of the unincorporated bodies that universities have created. That is an example of the law of unintended consequences, and I shall be very disappointed if the Chancellor does not find a way of dealing with it constructively and sympathetically. It may not be appropriate for him to refer to it tomorrow, but he could do so in his Budget speech, and it could be addressed in the Finance Bill.

It is now the largest single inward investor in mainland China. Its kit is being produced in China and returning to Taipei and the surrounding area, where only the widgets are added. China may be a workshop, but in Beijing and Shanghai it can be seen that there is a demand for consumer goods.

We have consistently argued&#151;the point is made in our published policy papers&#151;that energy should be dealt with by a department of energy, environment and transport. If we are to meet our Kyoto objectives, it is logical that all the factors that cause emissions be dealt with together, rather than being split among several Departments.

I want to address one or two issues that are of concern to my constituents, as well as other aspects of economic policy. As a Scottish Member of this Parliament, I hope that in the coming years we will develop greater co-operation between Scottish MPs and the Scottish Parliament. Like every Member of this House, I am very worried about the GP out-of-hours service. This issue is relevant to today&#039;s debate because it shows there is a crossover in respect of what this Parliament does and what the devolved Parliaments do. Health is a devolved matter, but of course the reality is that the change in the out-of-hours contract was determined by negotiation across the UK. That GPs no longer wish to work such hours might be a reasonable proposition, but it causes difficulties across the piece. UK Ministers need to work with the devolved Assemblies to ensure that we train enough doctors and consultants to cover the service and fill the gaps. I hope that we can do so in future.

My constituents were incensed when the Strategic Rail Authority said that it would no longer support the upgrading of the service between Aberdeen and Inverness because of the unexpectedly high and over-budget cost of upgrading the west coast main line. That service runs from London to Glasgow&#151;in other words, it terminates 140&nbsp;miles from Aberdeen. Although it may be of some benefit to my constituents, most of the traffic between Aberdeen and London is on the east coast main line. It is therefore frustrating to be told that the upgrading of a line that does not directly serve my constituents is being used to justify the cancelling of promised investment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-17_para14">
If the devolution of funding to the Scottish Parliament enables the reinstating of such investment, that would be welcome. If, on the other hand, it means that the UK Government are simply abdicating their responsibility for strategic decisions on rail matters affecting my constituents, that is another matter altogether. I was not encouraged on hearing the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), say that for franchising purposes the east coast main line runs from London to Aberdeen but that for investment purposes it runs from London to Edinburgh. That makes it clear that there is no commitment to strategic investment in that line, even though it is the main line between Edinburgh and Aberdeen.

It takes nearly as long to get from Aberdeen to Edinburgh as it does to get from Edinburgh to London, despite the fact that the distance involved is little more than 100&nbsp;miles. If there is to be a strategic decision, it should ensure that remoter parts of the country have access to fast transport, especially given the argument that too many people are flying internally in the UK when they could be taking the train. I would like to agree, but I can assure hon. Members that, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) will confirm, it would be impossible for me to carry out my duties as a constituency Member and to serve in this House if I relied on the rail service.

I have a constituency interest in energy, an issue to which the hon. Member for Ochil referred, but in this debate I want to link together national and constituency concerns. In some respects, the recent increase in gas and electricity prices is entirely understandable, but in others it cannot be easily explained, and it does not seem to demonstrate the efficient functioning of the market. Those of us who monitor the industry know that many long-term gas contracts have come to an end, at a time when oil prices have been rising sharply. That has become an excuse and created a market gap, which has led to an increase in gas prices, but that does not explain why UK producers are exporting gas to the continent, where prices are lower, rather than supplying the domestic market, where prices are higher&#151;unless there is another, perhaps ulterior motive relating to the long-term control of market supply.

In the past few weeks, I have had interesting meetings with a significant number of businesses in my constituency, and many specifically welcomed the consequences of EU enlargement, not least in giving them access to good-quality, hard-working labour, which has helped them meet the significant shortages that they were experiencing until recently. One enterprise in the tourism sector had employed a substantial number of Slovakian young women in an enterprising leisure facility. Those girls had come here for two fundamental reasons: to learn English, which they view as an international language that will improve their skills; and to gain more productive and better paid work experience than they could gain in Slovakia.

It has taken a positive step to promote the virtues of living and working in Aberdeen to those people. It will help the economy to be dynamic rather than run the risk of having to export jobs to where the people are.

The exploitation of these people is vicious, and some of our more draconian immigration laws make it harder for them to break out of it. We must make it clear to people that if they have been brought here by force, they can appeal.

The anti-globalisation protestors and the pro-globalisation zealots display a lack of awareness that the pressure of globalisation is felt most by western countries. Western capitalism cannot cope with global capitalism. Countries such as China appear to be able to do capitalism with greater energy and ability than countries of the west, particularly the United States of America. We have heard about the balance of payments deficits in the US, but it arises in the main from trade with China, perhaps because of the traditional links that have always existed between the two countries. The devaluation of the dollar against the euro, which is no doubt happening as we speak, will not help the US very much with the massive balance of payments deficit it has with Asian countries, especially China. As we all know, the Chinese currency, the renminbi, is linked to the dollar, so as the dollar goes down, so does the renminbi. That is what is happening at the moment.

The European Union used to believe that it was immune from such pressures.

However, that world is going or has gone. Apparently, 10&nbsp;years ago the EU had a surplus on its trading account with the countries of Asia and China.

The problem is not only the balance of payments, but costs, wages and profits. The pressure on wages is now considerable.

The minimum wage of &#163;4.85&nbsp;is fine, but my impression is that wages, certainly in the manufacturing sector, are gradually being driven down towards &#163;4.85. That figure is seen as a respectable amount, so the pressure driving wages down is considerable. Of course, that has implications for the Chancellor. He subsidises wages through the working tax credit, and the cost of that subsidy will probably increase.

If costs cannot be reduced and prices cannot be increased, companies&#039; profits will be affected. If profits do not go up, investment cannot be made. What about the effect on tax yields?

Indeed, the Chancellor&#039;s estimate of revenue from income tax fell short. VAT is a tax on prices. If the price of imported goods falls, and the price of domestically created goods falls in competition, the VAT yield will be reduced. Perhaps that can be made up by VAT on services or in other ways, but the fact remains that globalisation pushes down wages, costs and prices. If it pushes down profits, the yield from corporation tax will also fall. Governments may have to look at other ways of raising money from taxation other than the main taxes of income tax, VAT and corporation tax, because of the effect of globalisation.

<a name="41201-19_para4">
In many ways, globalisation has had a benign effect on inflation. Prices have been driven down. The high inflation of the 1980s has gone, mainly because of competitive global pressures. Japan still has zero interest rates, because some people are now more worried about deflation than inflation. Alan Greenspan in the US was so worried about deflation that he reduced American interest rates to almost 1&nbsp;per cent., although they have now gone up by a few quarters of a percentage point.

Our central bankers still try to claim the credit for reducing inflation. We have heard again today how wonderful the Bank of England is, and I bow at the shrine, albeit a little reluctantly. We have heard how 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 683</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>wonderful it has been in keeping down inflation, but that is putting the cart before the horse. It is international competition that has pushed down prices. The governors of central banks, who are usually behind the curve, follow that by reducing interest rates. I accept that that is not a fashionable view, but I believe it is a better explanation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-19_para6">
The trouble is that those central bankers keep looking for inflation everywhere; they are a bit like generals who cannot find an enemy. For central bankers, the reds are still under the bed, and they are inflation. The Bank of England looks for inflation all over the place. I do not know how an interest rate of 4.7&nbsp;per cent. can be justified when the consumer price index, flawed as it may be, is only, as the Chancellor told us, 1.2&nbsp;per cent. It was a mistake for the Bank to raise interest rates on the last few occasions so that the rate is now 4.7&nbsp;per cent. The signals coming from the Bank are extremely confusing, almost as confused as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report about which I read in the newspaper today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-19_para7">
We cannot wish away globalisation. Some of the effects have been benign and beneficial, as I have tried to point out, but there is a danger when a huge country such as China begins to dominate world trade in goods and can make such inroads into the productive capacity of western countries. We have to consider whether we can bear the substantial transfer of wealth from western countries to such countries, as the effects on standards of living, taxation yields and public expenditure will be considerable. The time is past when globalisation can be viewed merely as a consequence of free trade and countries such as China can be described as trading partners rather than as competitors. That type of imbalance makes a mockery of Ricardo&#039;s economic tenet that trade is good for all, because each country can export the products that it is good at making. That is no longer the case when a country such as China could completely dominate world trade.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-19_para8">
It will not be easy to try to alleviate the consequences of globalisation and to stem the seepage of wealth from western economies, but we should at least recognise that there is a problem and that it cannot simply be left to the free market. Governments, whether of the left or the right, will have to interfere again to protect their economies, industries and societies from the pressure from free trade and globalisation. Once we acknowledge that there is a problem, perhaps we can find ways of countering it.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-19_para9">
I want to turn from the broad landscape of the global picture of economic affairs to something more local but just as important&#151;the concerns of small businesses and the self-employed. I do so both as someone who was self-employed for more than 10&nbsp;years before I became a Member and as honorary treasurer of the all-party small

<br>&nbsp;<br>business group. I am especially pleased that it is the largest all-party group and I hope that that reflects the genuine interest and concern of all Members in the importance of small enterprises.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-19_para10">
There are 3.8&nbsp;million small businesses in the UK and 3.6&nbsp;million people are self-employed. Those distinct but overlapping groups represent the backbone of our economy. After all, they employ more than half the private sector work force and they generate much of the wealth that enables us to afford the public services that we debate in this place. They are also often the most entrepreneurial and innovative enterprises in our economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-19_para11">
There is an additional reason why I believe that small enterprises matter; indeed, it is one of the reasons that I joined the Conservative party. Family businesses&#151;the self-employed and small enterprises&#151;send out a clear message that no matter what someone&#039;s background is, whatever the colour of their skin, whatever their race or creed, if they have the ambition, the ability and the will to work they can be their own boss and make their own way in the world. That is a very powerful reason for us to consider the role of small businesses&#151;not only in the context of the economic debate that we are holding today, but because those businesses reach beyond mere economics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-19_para12">
As a former freelancer, and having met many of the small business organisations in my constituency, it is clear to me that entrepreneurs are struggling. They tell me that they are struggling for two main reasons: the burden of regulation and the burden of the tax system. It is evident that both the volume and scope of regulation has worsened over the past seven years. We know that there are 15&nbsp;new regulations every working day&#151;a 53&nbsp;per cent. increase since 1997. In absolute terms, the number is between 3,500&nbsp;and 4,000&nbsp;in any one year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-19_para13">
I am well aware that many of the regulations come from Brussels, but the majority still come from Whitehall. It is fair to say that Whitehall manages&#151;extraordinarily&#151;to make EU regulations even worse than they might otherwise be, but nevertheless regulations, and their burden, matter. They matter not simply as a debating point&#151;in the jousting between the Opposition and the Government in this place&#151;but because, no matter what their worthy aims may be, the costs of complying with regulations and of administering them actually count for businesses. Let me give a short example: the working families tax credit&#151;apparently worthy in its aim, whatever one may think of its merits as a system&#151;costs business &#163;105&nbsp;million every year to administer. That is a significant amount for business to take on, and it is but one measure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-19_para14">
I know that it is a favourite of the Chancellor&#039;s, and given that tomorrow&#039;s will, I hope, be his last pre-Budget report, I hope that this measure will go with him. When the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions replies to the debate perhaps he will enlighten us on what I am sure the Government will wish to claim is their radical&#151;nay, modernising&#151;agenda to seek to reduce this burden. I look forward to his eloquence on that point.

 It is always dangerous to try to answer such interventions in full, but I try to do so.

I shall enlighten the House on other measures later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-20_para0">
I have talked about the costs of complying both in time and money, but another problem with regulation is that it restrains enterprises; it restricts their ability to compete in the international world. I am not afraid of the international world, and neither, I am sure, is the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Denzil Davies), but as the burden of regulation has increased this nation&#039;s ability to compete has declined. We have moved from the fourth most competitive nation in the world to the eleventh in just seven years, and that is a very disappointing trend.

<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 686</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the average time involved in dealing with the cumulative impact of regulations is now over 28&nbsp;hours a working month. Many of those present will realise what an impact on family time that clearly has on many small businesses, and it is an unsustainable burden. That is why more and more of what I would describe as the serial entrepreneurs&#151;the people who create and recreate enterprises&#151;the people whom we want to keep, are retiring or selling up. That is a significant drain on the skills and the ambition that this country can ill afford to lose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-20_para1">
Over the past seven years, the tax system, as part of the regulatory burden, has become hideously complex. I am delighted that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury has joined us, albeit briefly. He will recall that this year&#039;s Finance Bill contained 310&nbsp;clauses and more than 500&nbsp;pages of new tax rules and regulations.

 Lovely.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-20_spnew10"><b> Mr. Prisk: </b> 
 Labour Members might regard that as lovely, but I suspect that their view is not shared by their taxpaying voters. It is a symptom of a Chancellor who, frankly, cannot help meddling, interfering and tinkering. Every year we have a raft of new rates, thresholds and rules. Let me, if I may, offer a classic example of that, which directly affects small businesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-20_para2">
In 2002, the Chancellor introduced a zero rate of corporation tax on the first &#163;10,000&nbsp;of profits&#151;apparently a very good idea, although the Government had not looked at it carefully. Of course it created a significant tax advantage for small firms to incorporate. Indeed, as I recall, the Paymaster General told us that this was a gift horse, which small businesses should not look at in the mouth. That was the exact quote; I apologise for the English. However, the result, of which the Government had been warned, was a massive 43&nbsp;per cent. increase in incorporations in the first 12&nbsp;months. That was far more than the Government had expected, so suddenly they realised that they were losing more than &#163;1&nbsp;billion, as I understand it, in tax revenue that they had not accounted for. Suddenly, we were warned by the Paymaster General that this was not a gift horse but a tax avoidance scheme&#151;what a farce! To compound the error, they have proceeded not to reverse the policy and admit their own error but instead to add a further change with a 19&nbsp;per cent. non-corporate distribution tax rate, to try to recoup the loss. Therefore small businesses have in three years seen four changes on different rates, which directly impact on their profitability. That is a measure of the tinkering and meddling of this Chancellor.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-20_spnew11"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-20_spnew12"><b> Mr. Prisk: </b> 
 No, I am sorry but I am short of time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-20_para3">
We also had the farce of the IR35&nbsp;regulations on the self-employed. That is a crude attack on freelancers and the self-employed. The regulations create barriers to work, especially in information technology. Even worse than that, however, despite being warned at the start that they would cost the Government &#163;900&nbsp;million and that they must act immediately, we discover three years on that, of the 500&nbsp;cases that the Inland Revenue brought to challenge that apparently pernicious threat,

<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 687</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-20_para4">
In conclusion, small businesses do not want the Chancellor interfering and meddling. They want smaller government. They are fed up with being unpaid tax collectors and unpaid benefit officers for the benefit of the Government. They want fewer, not better, regulations. Above all, small businesses want to know where they stand.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-20_para5">
Small businesses need a tax system that is not more complex, constantly changing and something that they can never trust. They need a tax system that is simpler, fairer and lower. Frankly, this Labour Government have failed to deliver for small businesses. They talk positively about deregulation, yet they pass more regulations. They talk warmly about tax reform, yet what have they done? Each year, they have passed a record-sized Finance Bill, with more rules, regulations and statutory instruments. That is the truth and the evidence of their record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-20_para6">
Despite the talk, the result of all that is that when I talk to small business organisations&#151;I am sure the same thing happens when many of my colleagues speak to them&#151;I discover that they have finally realised that behind the spin and the smokescreen this Government will never deliver for them and that only the Conservative party understands small businesses. Frankly, it is only a Conservative Government who will deliver for them.

Every time the price of diesel increases by 1p a litre it adds an average of &#163;800&nbsp;to the annual cost of running a heavy goods vehicle. They therefore want the Chancellor to abandon further increases in fuel duty&#151;an increase was postponed from September to November&#151;and introduce a temporary fuel duty de-escalator for diesel. Oil revenue income could be used to reduce the duty and compensate for the rising cost of fuel, the process being triggered when world prices exceed $50&nbsp;a barrel.

<p><a name="41201-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gregory Campbell  (East Londonderry) (DUP):</b> 
 In addressing the subject of the Queen&#039;s Speech and the economy, I shall dwell on a number of topics. In Northern Ireland over recent years it has been argued that if the economy were made more robust and there were significant investment, that would ensure that in areas where paramilitary groups have a vice-like grip on working class communities, their grip would be broken. I do not subscribe to that theory and have consistently warned against it. However, if that grip can be broken&#151;and we hope that it can be&#151;there is no doubt that a vibrant economy based on a peaceful democratic economic regime would assist local communities to build themselves and improve their local infrastructure. The Government should ensure that that can happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-22_para2">
I shall return to the proposition that has been discussed in recent days with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. There has been much media speculation in Northern Ireland in recent weeks about a regeneration fund. I know that discussions have taken place between the Treasury and the Northern Ireland Office, and my party and others have engaged in discussions in an effort to establish such a fund. It has been termed a peace fund. The term &quot;peace&quot; has been devalued in Northern Ireland down the years, because of overuse and because it has been applied when anything but peace existed, so I prefer to speak of a regeneration fund. Whatever it is called, it is important that the economy in Northern Ireland should receive as much assistance as it possibly can.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-22_para3">
The Northern Ireland economy has been suppressed for 35&nbsp;years, principally because of the ongoing regime of violence and terror, the remnants of which we are still dealing with. Compared with the rest of the United Kingdom, salaries are lower than average, we have higher power and electricity prices, we have much worse deprivation levels, and correspondingly, we have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 692</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>significantly worse health and mortality rates across the population. It is essential that the regeneration fund is targeted at alleviating those problems.

<p><a name="41201-22_spnew2"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 UK central Government funding per capita is already considerably higher in the Province. In round terms, 40&nbsp;per cent. of the UK economy is the Government. In Northern Ireland the figure is 60&nbsp;per cent.&#151;that is, 50&nbsp;per cent. higher. How much more money does the hon. Gentleman want?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-22_spnew3"><b> Mr. Campbell: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman obviously was not listening when I outlined some of the reasons why there is such deprivation in Northern Ireland. If other parts of the United Kingdom had been fighting a terrorist war for 35&nbsp;years, they might well suffer in similar ways. Through the establishment of a regeneration fund, we are endeavouring to make the Northern Ireland economy less&#151;not more&#151;dependent on the public sector. If we get the type of funding that we are looking for, we can ensure that the private sector becomes much more active in Northern Ireland than it has been heretofore.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-22_para4">
For example, tourism is one area in which we can make significant progress in a short time. Other parts of the United Kingdom have greater levels of tourism and experience higher spending per head of population. Again, that is because we are still coming to terms with the aftermath of 35&nbsp;years of violence, but we hope that violence will come to an end. If we see a definitive end to violence, the tourism sector can take off in a few short years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-22_para5">
We have a magnificent product to sell. I represent one of the most beautiful coastlines in Northern Ireland. The principal resorts of Portrush, Portstewart and Downhill can take advantage of a significant influx of tourists, providing that we have not only the product, but the marketing and expertise to drive up the spend and ensure that the number of people purchasing the product increases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-22_para6">
The other issue is the problems that have beset the manufacturing sector, which are not peculiar to Northern Ireland but have afflicted communities across the United Kingdom. The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland has experienced a particular downturn. I concur with many of the comments made by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) about small and medium-sized enterprises. If our economy gets a significant boost in the next few years, we can significantly increase the SME sector, which could take off as it has not done in the past.

The Government have funded Invest Northern Ireland, the agency responsible for delivering economic development, to a considerable degree in the two and a half years since its establishment&#151;but many of us are still not impressed by Invest Northern Ireland&#039;s results. The economy in Northern Ireland has become more buoyant, as has the economy across the United Kingdom, but I have tabled numerous written questions to try to establish how effective Invest Northern Ireland is at driving potential inward investors beyond the Greater Belfast area. Unfortunately, the answers have been minimal. It appears to many people in Northern Ireland that the body responsible for promoting the economy has a capital city mentality. Invest Northern

</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-22_para8">
The Chancellor of the Exchequer could address this issue, and I have written to him on several occasions to try to get him to do so. In Northern Ireland, as in many other parts of the UK, the black economy is prevalent. Other hon. Members and I have lobbied for a significant increase in personal allowances. If, for example, personal allowances and the threshold at which individuals begin to pay national insurance were raised to &#163;10,000&nbsp;per annum, it would no longer be productive for any small employer to pay someone who is in the black economy and consistently draws benefits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-22_para9">
That would apply particularly to part-time employment. The part-time economy in Northern Ireland is buoyant, but if the black economy is prevalent, it is a drain on the social security budget. I hope that the Chancellor will reconsider the issue and raise personal allowances significantly above the rate of inflation. If we had, for example, that &#163;10,000&nbsp;per annum limit, part-time employees could earn &#163;200&nbsp;per week and pay no income tax or national insurance, and that would reduce the amount of regulation for small employers with such employees.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-22_spnew4"><b> Mr. O&#039;Neill: </b> 
 I am listening to the hon. Gentleman with interest, but there is a certain inconsistency in his argument. He suggests radical changes in revenue raising, but equally wants large lumps of public expenditure to be devoted to one of the most disadvantaged parts of Britain. That equation does not work out. We have to increase revenue in order to have the resources to increase expenditure; otherwise we will end up like Bush&#039;s America, and that is not what we are after.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-22_spnew5"><b> Mr. Campbell: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman. I shall return briefly to the issue that I was attempting to address. We are, I hope, emerging from 35&nbsp;years of murder and violence, during which our economy has been depressed and resources that should have gone into our infrastructural capacity have been channelled and sidelined into fighting the war on terror. If those resources can be channelled into the infrastructure&#151;tourism and so on&#151;many of us believe that that will of itself help to regenerate the private sector economy and make us less dependent on the resources that we get from the block grant.

I shall conclude by asking the Government to deal with the problem of financial institutions. Last month I tabled an early-day motion on the availability of free cash machines&#151;ATMs&#151;across the United Kingdom. The fact that that EDM received the most signatures of any tabled in the past three years by a Northern Ireland Member of Parliament reflects the great level of concern. In the past six weeks, Nationwide building society has issued a report that concluded that UK financial institutions were charging personal account-holders &#163;60&nbsp;million to access their own money through ATMs. That is a disgrace. The Government should pressurise those financial institutions to display their charges clearly on ATMs to ensure that people, particularly in poor deprived areas, understand that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell) and I endorse the points that he made towards the end of his contribution about charging machines. I shall speak about that subject later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para0">
I welcome the measures announced in the Queen&#039;s Speech that relate to economic affairs, and especially the Government&#039;s commitment to introduce a consumer credit Bill. I endorse the comments of other hon. Members, including my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), who chairs the Select Committee on the Treasury. We hope that the Bill will implement many of our Committee&#039;s recommendations on consumer credit. I also agree with my right hon. Friend that the matter is urgent. I hope that the measure will be introduced soon so that Parliament can begin work on it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para1">
The Bill is important because existing consumer credit laws are approximately 30&nbsp;years old. As the Government rightly stated in the White Paper, &quot;Fair, Clear and Competitive&quot;, which was published last year, the need to overhaul consumer credit legislation has become pressing. I am pleased that Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members have so far made broadly positive noises about the Bill. I hope that there will be broad consensus for our reform of consumer credit legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para2">
The need for reform is underlined by the dramatic change in the world of credit since existing credit laws and regulations were written. When the initial legislation was introduced, I believe that only one credit card was in circulation, whereas there are now more than 500. The range of credit facilities is phenomenally greater. The complexity of the marketplace that offers credit bears no resemblance to the simple world that existed when the laws were introduced. Access to many different forms of credit is far easier. It is therefore vital to bring the laws that govern credit up to date .

There is no need to get over-excited about the &#163;1&nbsp;trillion figure. Although it is a new high, it reflects 10&nbsp;years of growth in the economy and the rise in disposable income. Before becoming too concerned, it is important to stress the balancing figure in the other column, which covers total household assets and wealth. That figure is &#163;6&nbsp;trillion. The relationship between one and six is reasonably stable and does not suggest an overall problem of indebtedness in the economy. However, in specific sectors and groups of society, there are problems. Some are due to weaknesses in consumer credit legislation. We need to deal with that.

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be helpful to try to clarify responsibility for credit card fraud, especially card-not-present fraud, before it becomes a major crisis?

 The hon. Gentleman is right, and I am right to suggest that there is a growing consensus about such issues. I am happy to endorse his comments.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para4">
Many more people have access to credit as provision has grown so fast in recent decades. There are important imperfections in the credit market and that is another reason to review the legislation. Choice and competition in the credit market and product innovation are all fine&#151;no one would have a problem with that. They drive the market and make it so successful. However, with those things have come other consequences that Parliament needs to address. There is far more complication and a great deal of consumer confusion in this market, as well as opaqueness in terms of the consumer trying to understand what the product is or what will be the consequences of taking a particular form of credit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para5">
That creates confusion for the average customer&#151;many of us would include ourselves in that category&#151;but things become far worse for the vulnerable consumer and move on from confusion to potential entrapment in a downward spiral of debt, which can lead to tragic personal consequences, as we have seen in recent years. Reform of the law is needed to realign credit legislation with the real nature of today&#039;s credit market.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para6">
Credit is very important to the economy, as it aids personal flexibility, helps us all in managing our personal finances and creates more opportunity than there would be without it, but we can improve the working of the credit market and support all its benefits while eradicating some of its excesses and bad practices, which we in the Treasury Committee have been studying and becoming increasingly concerned about.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para7">
The new Bill, when we have it in front of us, must achieve a number of important balancing acts. Yes, we need a genuinely competitive market in consumer credit, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 696</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>but to have it we need informed consumers. Yes, we want fair competition to be promoted and encouraged, but that requires an end to misleading promotions. Yes, it is important to achieve transparency in trading in credit, but that requires an end to the obfuscation that distorts so much of the market. We must have fair trading in credit and between credit providers and credit consumers. That means an end to many of the practices that constitute irresponsible lending.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para8">
To focus on an important issue, the market falls well short of being genuinely transparent. The credit terms that come with most credit cards are printed in minuscule type and written in the most opaque language that it is possible to envisage. It is very hard for the average consumer to understand&#151;if they can even see them to read them&#151;the terms of the contract that they have entered into.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para9">
Also, it is impossible to compute the cost of credit. One thing that we on the Treasury Committee discovered in considering the issue is that an average consumer who takes two, three or four credit cards from different issuers, all with the same annual percentage rate, assumes that the cash cost of credit on those cards is the same. It is not. Hidden away in the small print are so many other variables that a person can do the same transaction over the same period on those four cards, all at the same APR, and the cash cost of the credit might vary by as much as 40&nbsp;per cent. It is very difficult for consumers to keep up with all that. There are even different ways of calculating APR. That, too, adds to the lack of transparency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para10">
There is some progress in the industry&#151;I hope that some of it is due to the work that we have done in the Treasury Committee&#151;as it is moving towards a standardised APR, which I welcome. The industry is also introducing summary boxes, which summarise the key information on the credit, the offers and the statement. That is movement in the right direction, but it has been rather grudging and there is still a lot further for the industry to go.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para11">
I see those as down-payments on the complete reform that is needed. The summary boxes are not yet standardised, so it is still difficult to compare providers. The penalty charges that attach to the cards are still not clear and they represent a large part of the spiralling cost incurred by those whose debt goes out of control.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para12">
The point that we must try to reach when we reform the consumer credit legislation is that the full extent of the deal into which the consumer has entered must be on the table before the consumer signs up. The problem at the moment is that far too much is discovered after entering into the contract. That is the key change that we need to make if we are really to achieve proper transparency in the industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para13">
I hope that the Bill gives us a chance to achieve fair trading in the industry. We have found far too many examples of where that does not exist. I want to stress one, and one only: the unsolicited issuing of credit card cheques. These are being sent repeatedly to 5&nbsp;million households in Britain, all of them unsolicited. They come with glossy accompanying promotional literature. Many of the banks that issue those credit card cheques encourage people, as they send them, to spend them on holidays, cars, gifts for other people, or credit transfers to yet another credit card. There is always room, it 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 697</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>seems, to print on the cheques themselves and the promotional literature all the things that they can be spent on, but there never seems to be room to print the APR, the actual credit cost, what will happen if one only makes minimum payments and so on. There can only be one justification from the industry&#039;s point of view&#151;it is an inducement to the consumer to use up more and more of their credit limit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para14">
I have put the question to many providers of credit card cheques when they have appeared before our Committee: what is the justification for unsolicited issuing of credit card cheques? Answers come back along the following lines: credit card cheques provide convenience to consumers; they cover instances of payment when one cannot pay with a credit card or bank cheque; or they are helpful for balance transfers. All those are reasons for having credit card cheques as part of the credit business, but not one of them is a reason for the unsolicited issuing of credit card cheques. They are only delivered repeatedly, over and over again, because providers hope that they will land on the doormat on the same day as a glossy holiday brochure, and consumers will simply find it irresistible, put two and two together, and end up paying six for the privilege. It is simply an irresponsible extension of credit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para15">
There is quite a simple answer. The industry can make the argument for the existence of credit card cheques&#151;I have no problem with that&#151;but the consumer should opt in to them, not have to face repeated issuing of them, over and over again, when they are not requested and not used. In the White Paper, &quot;Fair, Clear and Competitive&quot;, to which I referred earlier, it is suggested that the unsolicited issuing of credit card cheques &quot;could&quot; or &quot;may&quot; be one of the instances of irresponsible lending. I would suggest that it &quot;is&quot; an irresponsible form of lending. There is no justification for it, and I hope that we will use the opportunity of the forthcoming Bill to end the practice of the unsolicited issuing of credit card cheques.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para16">
I also hope that when we consider the Bill in more detail, we can deal with the excessive interest rate problem in relation to store cards&#151;credit cards issued by retailers. I can describe such interest rates as excessive, but it is not my description. When the Select Committee had the bosses of the four main banks in front of us, we asked them what they thought constituted an excessive rate of interest. The head of Barclays was unwilling to define it, but the others could&#151;they put it in the region of 20&nbsp;per cent. or more, against the backdrop of current base rates. Most of the interest rates charged by store cards are well in excess of that, so we can describe them as excessive&#151;they are condemned as excessive by the industry itself, not just by consumer associations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para17">
There are 21&nbsp;million store cards in circulation, &#163;5&nbsp;billion a year is spent on them, 14&nbsp;million adults have them, but they all charge excessive interest rates. I hope that we will have an opportunity, in consideration of the Bill, to do something about that, and to act on conclusions already reached by the Office of Fair Trading, whose report stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the level of interest rates on store cards does not appear to be disciplined by competitive pressures.&quot;</p>
</ul>

We must move to a genuinely competitive market, and if we do, we should see an end to excessive interest rates on store cards.

I want to pick up on the observations made by the hon. Member for East Londonderry about charging automated teller machines. That issue will also be examined by the Committee, and it is another area in which it is important to review regulations on money and credit. There is an explosive growth of charging ATMs. There are 20,000&nbsp;of them around the United Kingdom, and they grew by 40&nbsp;per cent. last year. Of the 5,600&nbsp;new cash machines installed across the UK last year, 63&nbsp;per cent. were charging machines. We are nearing the point at which there will be more charging machines than free machines, because some banks are selling their networks to charging operators. This means that we are paying for our own money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-23_para20">
The industry argues that it is all about convenience. It says that in remote areas, if there were no charging machine there would be no machine. That is not a convincing argument. Many charging machines are in areas that could not possibly be described as &quot;convenience&quot; locations. In Leicester square, for instance, there is a Travelex charging machine, which does not warn people that they will have to pay but tells them that they will have to do so only after they have completed five screen actions. On the other side of the square, there are free cash machines. That constitutes a total lack of transparency, and it is a further reason for my hope that the consumer credit Bill will deliver a transparent industry.

It takes real skill to bring down 60,000&nbsp;work stations. Normally, servers are the problem; one machine is killed, and no one else can gain access. These people managed to kill 60,000&nbsp;machines simultaneously, which deserves respect from a technical if not an operational point of view.

Stories of IT failures have been well rehearsed both in Committees and here, and I would rather spend my time suggesting solutions that I believe would produce a credible Government IT strategy on which we could pin spending plans with a degree of expectation of actually being able to meet them. I characterise them as &quot;people, practices and purposes&quot;. IT problems often lie not in the detail of the technology, but in the &quot;people, practices and purposes&quot; that surround it. Let us begin with &quot;purposes&quot;, sometimes described as &quot;requirements&quot; or specifications. We should view it in a broader context, and start by asking what any system is for. Far too often we do not look at the context of what we are trying to achieve in the wider world, but simply mechanise existing systems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-24_para5">
One example of our losing track of the wider world is the tax credit system. Like me, other Members doubtless get regular visits from constituents who complain that they have been overpaid tax credits and are now being asked to pay them back. The system works; it correctly calculates that such people have been overpaid, informs them&#151;in a way that is completely unintelligible to me, and certainly to them&#151;and then seeks to reclaim the money. In doing so, it loses track of the wider point that we are giving these people money in the first place because they are on low incomes, so our ability to reclaim it is bound to be limited. The purpose of delivering money to people on low incomes has been lost in the process of creating a system that works well at a technical level&#151;it does not lose the Treasury&#039;s money&#151;but which does not deliver what the customer actually needs.

 My hon. Friend is making a valuable point about the impact on people with low incomes. Just today, a constituent got in touch with my office to explain how their problem was dealt with.

 I am listening to the hon. Gentleman with great interest. Before he leaves the subject of tax credits, may I ask whether he will join me in congratulating the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on insisting that claims made by people in receipt of income support will not be handed over to the child tax credit system? The decision has been delayed yet again, and it is clear that the Department for Work and Pensions is not confident that those on the lowest incomes would get the money that they need if they were handed over to that system. Long may the Secretary of State carry on battling in favour of long-established benefits and against this scheme, which is still so unreliable.

<p><a name="41201-24_spnew4"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes the point very effectively.

<p><a name="41201-24_spnew8"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 I have an enormous amount of sympathy with my hon. Friend&#039;s observation. As our surgery experience shows, many such changes are based on a business plan that involves getting rid of lots of people, but which does not recognise that, in the early months of its implementation&#151;but hopefully not in the long term&#151;more people are needed to deal with teething troubles. Otherwise, a huge backlog develops. Existing queries cannot be answered and more queries arise, leading to a cycle of difficulty. Sadly, that is what is happening with certain aspects of the tax credit system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-24_para6">
The NHS IT programme will be another major issue for debate in this House. To my mind, the purpose of that electronic medical records system is to improve patient health by ensuring that information is available to support clinical decisions. Its purpose is not to create electronic records per se, which would have no value except where they lead, directly or indirectly, to patient benefit. Again, we should think about such systems in terms of what they are trying to achieve for the public, rather than as the simple creation of electronic records. We frequently fail to debate such issues in that way.

Initially, they were wanted for their own sake, but since then we have gathered up an ill-defined set of functions&#151;preventing illegal working, national security, access to NHS services&#151;and tacked them on. To me, that rings very loud bells as regards whether the system will work. I cannot see it as having a clearly defined purpose. We could have a separate debate about whether it would meet those requirements, which seem to be hazy.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. If I may say so, it is one anorak giving way to another. Does he agree that the gateway system introduced by the Government is another problem? The whole point of having a gateway review is that a project should not go ahead until gateway zero has been initiated, yet quite often&#151;the hon. Gentleman mentioned the NHS as an example&#151;we enter gateway three a long time after gateways one and two have been ignored.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-24_spnew10"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 In the case of ID cards, we know that the scheme has been through the first gateway, as the general feasibility has been looked at. One of the problems that the House will face is that, after public money has been spent and the best Treasury brains in the Office of Government Commerce have been applied to the project, we will not be able to see the outcome. We will have to debate ID cards in the knowledge that a report into feasibility has been drawn up, but is unavailable to us. I know that the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) is working on the task of gaining access to the gateway reviews. After all, we are taking decisions about spending public money, so the information should be made available to us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-24_para8">
Gateway reviews are one of the practices that should be followed. Many have been dealt with in National Audit Office and Public Accounts Committee reports and, to be fair to the Government, there are some signs of hope in the work of the Office of Government Commerce and, indeed, of some Departments in proving their game. I believe that we should compliment Departments when they start to get things right, but there are still clouds on the horizon, especially in the apparent lack of competition in the market, which leads to companies that have failed in one area still picking up lucrative contracts from other Departments.

It is an easy target, but Electronic Data Systems is often singled out for its problems with tax credit systems, Child Support Agency systems and high-profile incidents such as what happened last week at the Department for Work and Pensions, a story that writes itself. Yet EDS remains a major partner and one of only two consortiums remaining for the &#163;4&nbsp;billion defence information infrastructure project that will be awarded next year. Understandably, people ask how we can end up with failure being rewarded by the award of another contract.

 Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the Child Support Agency in Australia, on which the UK CSA is based, got its computer system to work only by getting rid of the external supplier and taking the computerisation in-house?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. We have already, quite rightly, done away with the private finance initiative for IT projects, but the level of in-house expertise, which I am coming on to now, is critical to getting these sort of projects right. We have, sadly, developed a culture of tolerating failure in software development, which is simply not necessary. There are voices calling for proper software engineering principles to be applied, as mentioned in a very good report produced by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the British Computer Society. We should listen to what is being said. Correctly engineered software does not have to cost more than buggy software, yet there is a sort of lazy assumption out there that these things simply have to go wrong. That is not true. The engineering principles are there; the problem is that they are not being applied.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-25_para0">
Improvements to Government performance could be made by instilling these disciplines in departmental IT centres of excellence. If we are to have IT centres of excellence, let us ensure that they are truly excellent and that they do not adopt some of the lazy practices offered by suppliers over the years. They must secure best practice rather than state of the art. State of the art is terrible; they need something better than that. We should use information architects, which is an important recommendation in the Royal Academy of Engineering report, and we should have requirement specialists to get the designs right from the beginning. We need to ensure that a broader range of companies is able to bid into the public sector market.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-25_para1">
The most important, and often the most neglected, element of any IT project is the people. Industry&#151;British Gas, BT and others&#151;has learnt to look at such projects as business change projects, rather than as technology projects. They are not about technology but about changing the business, with technology as a large element of that change. An example of how far the public sector is from that attitude is the national programme for NHS IT. The technology procurement appears robust&#151;I am sure that Richard Granger&#039;s team will have bought some good technology&#151;but the people have been left so far behind that the technical press, and even the more general press, are full of stories of clinicians in the NHS who are fighting the very programme that is supposed to assist them in their work. The project is getting the people side desperately wrong. If anything brings down the programme and leads to significant wastage of the &#163;6&nbsp;billion committed to it, it is likely to be on the people side, not the technology side.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-25_para2">
We must ensure that the NHS now gives priority to working with its staff to implement the new IT systems and puts money into training. The NHS must ensure 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 703</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that it has in-house expertise so that people can use the systems and derive maximum benefit, rather than leaving the matter to the external contractors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-25_para3">
The Government can improve their IT procurement, to the benefit of the public purse and, most importantly, the users of the services, if the will is there. The Government can do more to create a climate in which the UK IT sector can flourish to the benefit of the economy as a whole; the pointers to what needs doing are already there. Ofcom should be robust in promoting a competitive telecoms market and can expect a lively year ahead as it grapples with some of the more difficult issues of telecoms competition that have been left to ride over several years. The Government can respond urgently to the e-skills UK report, &quot;IT Insights&quot;, which highlights the improvements needed in work force training. Other hon. Members have mentioned our competitiveness with China and India, but the report tells us what problems we will have if we do not address the issue of skills, all the way up to chief executive and ministerial level. We need IT skills across the work force if we are to be able to make correct and informed decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-25_para4">
We need to ensure that we continue to review our support for research and development in technology to ensure that it is genuinely additional and efficiently delivered, without the complexity that often makes it inaccessible to the very companies that would most benefit from it. Such companies often say that they cannot make their way through the bureaucracy to access the funds that are supposed to be available to support innovation, or that they have to employ an extra layer of specialists to do so for them.

I am not in the camp of those Jeremiahs who wish to see the Government fail in their objectives. That is especially so in the case of the improvement of public services through new technology. Indeed, I am desperately keen that the Government should succeed in that agenda. It is not in anyone&#039;s interests that such projects should continue to fail. It is a high-risk agenda, but not an impossible one. I hope that the Government will continue to learn the lessons. The Liberal Democrats believe that our approach to the issue is credible. We could achieve savings through the use of new technology, but it is incumbent on all parties who put forward a cost-saving agenda for the public sector to demonstrate that they have the credibility, have learnt the lessons and will deliver.

<p class="tabletext">&quot;More than 1,000&nbsp;former and current workers at APW&#151;the UK electronics manufacturer, which announced the winding-up of its pension scheme yesterday&#151;are set to lose up to 80&nbsp;per cent. of their retirement savings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Those are not isolated scandals; they are a flaw in the system, and not least in the Chancellor&#039;s approach of maintaining that his responsibility is the prudent management of public finances, which is laudable, while leaving the private sector largely to operate as it wants.

The Chancellor is not out of the woods as far as I am concerned, however.

I believe that there has to be dignity and well-being now for today&#039;s pensioners, and I praise the Government on their efforts on that. They were right to tackle the appalling legacy of pensioner poverty that they inherited from the last Tory Government. In 1997, 2.7&nbsp;million pensioners were in poverty and expected to live on a total of just &#163;69&nbsp;a week. The poorest pensioners are now &#163;1,800&nbsp;a year better off and absolute pensioner poverty has been reduced by two thirds.

Savings used to be harshly penalised by a reduction in benefits. The new pension credit has changed that. The setting up of the pension protection board, to help the workers in those firms that go broke and wind up their pension fund, is also a very welcome move by the Government. But there need to be decent pensions for people in the future, and to achieve that reform is needed.

<a name="41201-25_para25">
The recent interim report of the Pension Commission, chaired by Adair Turner, formerly of the CBI, said that a sustainable comprehensive approach was required for the long term. There are, it argued, four &quot;unavoidable choices&quot; for policy makers, at least one of which will have to be made. The first is that pensioners become poorer relative to the rest of society. The second is that taxes and/or national insurance contributions devoted to pensions will need to rise, or public spending on other services will need to be reduced, presumably to balance tax and national insurance. The third is that each generation will have to save more and be reliant on the next generation also saving more. The fourth is that retirement ages will have to rise. Without action on this, the report said,

The Exchequer should insert an initial sum, like that proposed with the child bond&#151;which I very much favour, although the Liberals opposed it&#151;into the individual savings accounts, and add a state contribution to extra private savings made, say a pound for every pound saved.

The Queen&#039;s Speech is set against a world environment in which two particularly important things have happened. One is the general situation in the middle east, which has severe consequences. It has led not only to a huge oil price spike but to a significant cost, both here and in the USA, of keeping our troops in Iraq. That, of course, has led to the special provision by the Chancellor. The second is the substantial decline of the dollar, which has now reached a rate of almost 50p. That is because other world uncertainties have led commentators and others to concentrate on the very large twin deficits in the States and here.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-26_para2">
The Chancellor has had an extremely lucky tenure since he has been at No. 11&nbsp;because of the stable world environment. From what I said, it is clear that I believe that that might, sadly, become less stable. That will give him even greater problems in meeting his fiscal and monetary targets. In tribute to him, but in concert with many other central banks around the world, central banks have become much better at managing the macro-economy, injecting liquidity into an economy when it is needed, but also engaging in monetary tightening when economies are starting to overheat. That has led to a much more stable economic cycle.
</p>

 I do not recognise the description of a stable world environment. We had the Asian contagion, which the British economy managed to work its way through because of our economic policies, and the aftermath of 9/11.

<p><a name="41201-26_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 My comments on the stability of central banks include the Chinese and other Asian central banks. In particular, the United States Federal Reserve and Alan Greenspan&#039;s work, and the Governor of the Bank of England, have led us to manage the macro-economy in a much more stable way. That has been helpful.

<p>
<a name="41201-26_para3">
The decline of the dollar will be important to both the American economy and our own and could well lead to a slowdown in world demand and growth. I hope that the same will not happen here, but there is no doubt that imports to the American economy will now be more expensive. America has been living on its huge fiscal deficit and on cheap imports, principally from China and India, but the US deficit and the huge Chinese economic surplus will have to be addressed in the not-too-distant future.

Under present policy, over the next Parliament taxes set by the Chancellor will rise to their highest level for 24&nbsp;years. The UK public sector has undergone a period of dramatic expansion and taxes are now rising to pay for it. They will have to rise even further after the next election, to pay for the Chancellor&#039;s black hole. Many people predict that next year the fiscal deficit will rise massively to about &#163;20&nbsp;billion&#151;the equivalent of 8p on income tax. My right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer has set up the James committee, of which the Gershon committee&#151;to which, as usual, the Government gave very limited terms of reference&#151;is a pale imitation. The James committee has real teeth and I understand that it has identified savings of approximately &#163;20&nbsp;billion. The message for the British people is simple: under the Chancellor&#039;s proposals, there will be a &#163;20-billion black hole and their taxes are likely to go up by the equivalent of 8p on income tax; under my right hon. Friend&#039;s proposals, taxes will stay the same for the same level of public services. The choice at the next election will be clear.

<p><a name="41201-26_spnew8"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 The difference is that we were at a different stage of the economic cycle.

There is also the disaster of pension credit, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Mr. Cohen), whom I am pleased to follow. Pension credit was introduced by the Department for Work and Pensions, which, incidentally, now has more employees than all our armed forces put together. Pension credit, introduced by the Department in October last year, guaranteed an income of &#163;105.45&nbsp;a week. That is good for anyone over 60. It guarantees &#163;160.95&nbsp;for couples. However, effectively it taxes savings of &#163;6,000, which is only &#163;120&nbsp;a week, at more than 40&nbsp;per cent. If the full indexation rules remain the same&#151;the pensioners&#039; withdrawal tax&#151;experts estimate that as much as 80&nbsp;per cent. of the pensioner population will eventually qualify for means-tested benefit. That is a situation that Mr. Adair Turner of the CBI has rightly described as unsustainable. It is wrong that pensioners who have a small amount of pension are taxed on that small amount and are often worse off, or no better off, than someone who has managed to organise their lives to claim the maximum amount of benefits. I know that my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench have proposals to deal with this problem.

The minimum income guarantee system, which was introduced by the Government, is an utter disgrace.

The basic state pension is only &#163;70&nbsp;a week. The difference between that and the MIG of &#163;105&nbsp;affects some of the poorest people who cannot afford properly to heat their house or to feed themselves. That is an utter disgrace. The proposal to link pensions to earnings to improve the lot of our poorest pensioners is greatly to be welcomed. I think that the British people will greatly welcome it too.

 My hon. Friend is bringing to the debate a welcome sense of realism about pensions and also a sense of despair among many pensioners.

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) will refer to the matter when he makes his winding-up speech. Indeed, he is nodding. This is an area where the Government, who claim to be the champion of some of the poorest people in the country, have failed our poorest pensioners. I put it as strongly as that because I believe that that is the case. Something needs to be done. I have no doubt that there will be a clear choice at the next election.

<a name="41201-27_para0">
I want to refer to what I call fiscal drag. It is the issue of not uprating allowances in line with inflation, let alone earnings. The example of property taxes is perhaps the most stark. I declare my interest&#151;it is in the Register of Members&#039; Interests&#151;as a fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, so I do know a thing or two about property. It is a disgrace that the threshold for stamp duty is set at &#163;60,000&nbsp;when the average house price is &#163;100,000. When the threshold was set, the average house price&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford, who also knows a great deal about property will correct me if I am wrong&#151;was &#163;22,500. The ratio is therefore the wrong way round, and a huge number of low and middle earners with modestly valued houses will be caught by the tax for the first time. It is a tax on mobility, including job mobility, which we desperately need to maintain a competitive economy. That feeds through to the allowance for inheritance tax. If we uprate stamp duty to reflect the increase in house prices, we must also uprate the exemption for inheritance tax from &#163;262,000&nbsp;to about &#163;300,000. That is a much more realistic allowance for inheritance tax.

In his 2002&nbsp;Budget, the Chancellor forecast net borrowing of &#163;13&nbsp;billion in 2003&#150;04. A year later, he said that it would be &#163;27&nbsp;billion, but it turned out to be &#163;35&nbsp;billion, or 3.1&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product. In his first tenure&#151;and I listened to him hour after hour&#151;he said that he was providing prudence for a purpose. Goodness knows how often we heard those words. Prudence has now jumped out of the window&#151;poor Prudence has gone, never to be seen again by the Chancellor, who is now running the country into huge debt and does not know how he will get us out of it, except by taxing the people of this country more and more. The tax take has doubled in the past seven years, costing the average family &#163;5,000&nbsp;each. The British people have a stark choice&#151;either their taxes are increased significantly under another Labour Government, or they can have a Conservative Government who will hold taxes at the same rate, do their best to reduce them over the cycle, yet produce a better level of public services. The choice is clear&#151;I am sure that they will want to vote Conservative.

The themes of the Queen&#039;s Speech were clearly security and opportunity for all in a changing world. Before talking about opportunity, I congratulate the Chancellor on his economic record and the achievement of economic stability, which underpins all our subsequent policies as a Government and gives us the chance at long last to invest in and reform our sorely neglected public services, ensuring that we can create a fairer society with opportunity for many people who were left behind in the years of Conservative government. That economic stability has been achieved through political choices about, for example, the independence of the Bank of England and monetary policy, as well as a system of fiscal rules that have enabled us to steer a steady course through internationally choppy waters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-27_para3">
Whatever the Opposition&#039;s motivation in attempting to paint a different picture, the economic facts are unchallengeable and need to be put on the record. We have had growth in every quarter for the past seven years, thus achieving the longest period of continuous growth for 200&nbsp;years. We have had the longest period of low inflation and interest rates since the 1960s, and while the Government have been in office 2&nbsp;million more jobs have been created. Unemployment is at its lowest for 29&nbsp;years. In my constituency, there has been a 57&nbsp;per cent. fall in unemployment, and youth unemployment has been wiped out. Those are the lowest ever figures for my constituency, and I will be proud to campaign on them when the time comes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-27_para4">
Economic stability and growth have enabled sustained public sector investment in our schools and hospitals, child care, skills and the knowledge economy. For example, in Wirral borough, before a Labour Government were elected, capital investment in schools ranged from &#163;1.5&nbsp;million to &#163;2&nbsp;million a year. That has steadily risen to &#163;18&nbsp;million a year, and we have a transformed infrastructure in which our children can learn. In addition, there is a &#163;55&nbsp;million private finance initiative project which will deliver seven new schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-27_para5">
Many people would have thought that such a changed environment for my constituents was impossible when the Government came to power in 1997. It contrasts with our experience of 3&nbsp;million unemployed, 1.5&nbsp;million households in negative equity and constant cuts in public services, which was the Tory record. We have heard today of the &#163;35&nbsp;billion of cuts that are the Tory threat and their platform for the next election.

I refer to the opportunity and anti-discrimination Bills in the Queen&#039;s Speech. Translated into English, that high-falutin&#039; economic phrase means that if people are happier and are treated more fairly, they will generally be more productive and work harder, and the economy will benefit.

The Disability Discrimination Bill will help the 14,000&nbsp;people in Wallasey who suffer from some form of disability, as it will help the 14,000&nbsp;people, on average, in every constituency who struggle to manage with one form of disability or another. The Bill will complete the Government&#039;s manifesto commitment to legislate for full civil rights for disabled people and is to be welcomed for that. It will put in place an end date for transport to be made accessible. It will introduce a positive duty to promote equality, which will help to prevent much of the thoughtless discrimination against people with disabilities that we see around us. It will extend the scope of reasonable adjustment provisions to allow the many hundreds of thousands of disabled people who feel able and ready to work now, and the million or more who aspire to be able to work, practical access to the labour market to enable them to get on with their lives and contribute to both the wealth that we create in our society and their own personal fulfilment and development.

Many things can be done to help those who have been stuck on incapacity benefit to get back into the labour market and make their contribution. It is important that the Disability Discrimination Bill accompanies any effort in that direction, because it is no good expecting people with disabilities to be reasonable and try to get back into work if barriers in the workplace prevent them from doing so. We must sort out both sides of the equation. When the measures are unveiled, we can all judge whether they are practical and whether we support them.

I welcome the equality Bill, which will put together the current commissions for disability, gender and race and add other duties in order to create a more user-friendly organisation.

I particularly welcome the positive duty to promote equality on gender grounds in the equality Bill, because I had a ten-minute Bill on that subject not long ago.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-28_para5">
The Government have delivered on their commitment, which was made in 1999, and the legislation will help to shift the structure of our battles against discrimination in our society on to a preventive footing.

<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 714</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>enable us to create a culture&#151;initially in the public sector, and in due course in the private sector&#151;of prevention, which will enable employees to know that they have rights, and employers to know that they have responsibilities to ensure that unthinking and illegal discrimination does not happen.

I welcome the equality Bill&#039;s extension to goods and services of protection on the grounds of religious belief.

This important Bill will change the equality delivery infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-28_para7">
The UK&#039;s existing anti-discrimination legislation needs to be updated, as it is inconsistent, piecemeal and complex. Since the enactment of the first such legislation by Harold Wilson&#039;s Labour Government&#151;the formidable and fantastic Barbara Castle piloted it through this House more than 25&nbsp;years ago&#151;it has developed into a package of 30&nbsp;Acts, 38&nbsp;statutory instruments, 11&nbsp;codes of practice and 12&nbsp;EC directives and recommendations. I am not surprised that even those employers who wish to do right find the increasingly complex and sometimes inconsistent regulations facing them to be a bit much. It is about time that we had a Bill to simplify, harmonise, consolidate and extend our legislation to make it much easier for employers and employees to comprehend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-28_para8">
Unless that is done, the Government&#039;s plan to combine the three different commissions, welcome as it is, will be flawed. It is important that employers who wish to do right know exactly what is expected of them and that employees who are subject to unlawful discrimination realise that they have been discriminated against and know that they can have redress. It is even more important that employers and employees can work together to eliminate from the labour market and from the provision of goods or services any unlawful discrimination on the grounds of gender, race, religious belief, disability and, I hope very soon, sexual orientation and age. Then, as our economy develops in the choppy waters that our Chancellor has managed to navigate so well, we can make certain that opportunities that have not been available in practice in the past are opened up to all our citizens regardless of their gender, race, creed, colour, disability, age or sexual orientation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-28_para9">
Extending and consolidating that approach will make our economy more efficient and enable us to use the undoubted skills and talents of our citizens, many of which are grossly underused, much more effectively. That will put us in a position to continue to make our way in the world and to enjoy the ever rising standards of living that we have experienced. It will also, crucially, help us to fight inequality, poverty and disadvantage, which we still find in all too many parts of our communities where discrimination has been suffered.

With the Bills in this Queen&#039;s Speech, the continuing work to ensure that we preserve our economic stability, and the equality Bill to consolidate anti-discrimination legislation, we truly look forward to a much fairer and more progressive future.

The commitment of the hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle) to dealing with discrimination and to disability issues is undoubted and it is hard to disagree with much that she says. However, I would counsel that, although many of the initiatives are worthy and desirable, they have an impact on business, especially the operation of small businesses. That must be carefully considered and I shall say a little more about it later.

I have heard the Chancellor make similar speeches on several occasions. Today, he simply made one of his typical speeches. He comes to the Chamber and is surrounded by Brownite Members. It is interesting to see who sits behind the Chancellor; we shall keep a little note of that. He approached the Dispatch Box with a fistful of press cuttings and extracts from broadcasts. He spoke for about 40&nbsp;minutes and said little apart from reading comments that Conservative Members and Liberal Democrat Members had made to the newspapers. We witnessed a bit of a record today because, if I heard the right hon. Gentleman correctly, he quoted from the <i>Lincolnshire Echo</i>. He must have been scratching around for press cuttings to reach that level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-28_para13">
As always with the Chancellor, what he did not say was notable. We expected some sort of trailer for tomorrow, but there was nothing. He said little, if anything, about pensions, almost nothing about borrowing and the attendant problems that he faces, and nothing about the golden rule. We are determined to hear what he has to say about that tomorrow but we expected him to give us a bit of a clue to what it is all about. If he had taken an intervention from me, I would have asked about the rules of the golden rule, which get more mysterious as the days pass.

<p><a name="41201-28_spnew7"><b> Mr. Prisk: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the supposed golden rule has become a flexible tool? Is not it better described as a golden elastic band?

<p><a name="41201-28_spnew8"><b> Mr. Atkinson: </b> 
 That is a good point. Given that the Chancellor&#039;s borrowing requirement is predicated on the golden rule, he should give the House his interpretation of it. We think that we know when it started because the Treasury tells us that, but we do not know when it finishes because we do not know when the right hon. Gentleman believes that the economic cycle will finish. Will that happen in 2005&#150;06&nbsp;or next year? The Governor of the Bank of England more or less hinted that it could be in a few months. It is difficult for anyone to make a substantial judgment on our position and that of the Chancellor&#039;s borrowing requirements without knowing the basis for the golden rule.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-28_para14">
In 2002, the Chancellor predicted a borrowing requirement of &#163;13&nbsp;billion; a year later, he predicted a figure of &#163;27&nbsp;billion and now, if we are to believe PricewaterhouseCoopers and others, he predicts a borrowing requirement of &#163;36&nbsp;billion. That shows that he is on a rake&#039;s progress for borrowing. I hope that tomorrow will shed some light on the country&#039;s true financial state so that people can make decisions that affect their future.

The boom in house prices is one result of the uncertainty about pensions. If people are faced with the prospect of their pension being of less value than they expected, the safe alternative is to pour money into bricks and mortar. That has driven up house prices recently as people have baled out of pension funds and gone into property. The consequent increase in interest rates becomes a serious problem for many people who have chosen that form of investment. Although there has been a softening in recent weeks and we have heard predictions that interest rates will not increase, it is alarming to read in the papers today that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development believes that we should have four more interest rate rises in the near future. Other predictions are that interest rates should go beyond 5&nbsp;per cent. next year. That is alarming news for many people who have invested in property.

 I agree that that is alarming, but the difference is in how interest rates go up.

That is a substantial jump in the calculation that people make and considering&#151; <i>[Interruption]</i> If the hon.

 The Secretary of State says, &quot;Collapse?&quot; and laughs at the word. He comes from a different background&#151;public service&#151;but if he had his own private pension he would know that he will probably get back more or less what he has put in, pound for pound, over the last 20&nbsp;or so years and not a single pound in profit as a result of his investment. That is what most people in the private sector face, if they have a pension at all.

<p><a name="41201-29_spnew3"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 There is obviously political knockabout here. The hon.

 Crisis? What crisis? In fairness, the Secretary of State is talking about something slightly different. I am talking in particular about those with company pensions and private provision pensions. They are the ones who have been putting their money in bricks and mortar and in commercial property to safeguard their future. They are the people who are hit by the Chancellor&#039;s ridiculous decision to cut the amount that can be put tax free into individual savings accounts and other investments.

<a name="41201-29_para1">
I accept what the Secretary of State says&#151;in the long term, of course there is a problem down the line for the basic state pension&#151;but that is a different problem from the immediate crisis that this Chancellor has caused for those with private sector pensions. It is a shame that he had nothing to say about that. The one word that we did not hear, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) pointed out, is the magic word&#151;prudence. Sadly, prudence is now dead and buried.

<a name="41201-29_para2">
I want to make one or two other points about the problems facing business and to deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Wallasey about the welter of legislation, such as all the European directives. I agree that such measures must be simplified, but it is important to realise their impact on growing and smaller businesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-29_para3">
I represent a constituency in the north-east of England, which, as everyone knows, had a large number of old, declining industries such as coal, steel, chemicals and shipbuilding, which have long since been laid to rest. We needed to replace those, which we did with a large number of important high-tech inward investors. Some of them, such as the Nissan car company, have been tremendously successful, but others have been what might be described as false friends. They came here and made a contribution, but when economic circumstances changed they moved from the north-east to lower-cost economies. The lesson we have learned is that while they helped with the transition from the old heavy industries to a new type of economy, they are beginning to disappear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-29_para4">
Regions such as the north-east must now rely on home-grown industries. We in the north-east have been very successful in doing so and, to name a few, we now have companies such as Sage; Greggs of Gosforth, which was a little baker&#039;s shop but is now a national chain; the Go-Ahead group; and Reg Vardy in motor distribution. Those are great success stories, but we need many more. We will achieve that by building up our new smaller businesses, but regulation can damage them so much.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-29_para5">
Regulations on discrimination, paternity leave and maternity leave are well intentioned, but for a small business employing three or four people they become a considerable burden in both time and expense. Letters and representations from local businesses in my constituency, which are mostly small businesses, show that such regulations are becoming a heavy burden that restrict their development. That fact must be taken on board when such matters are discussed.

</p>





<p><a name="41201-29_spnew6"><b> Mr. Atkinson: </b> 
 I wait to see the small print of what is produced and how it works, but in principle I agree that that would be desirable. When we have such a plethora of regulation, the way in which officialdom interprets it can often be the problem. In one area, enforcement can be draconian; in another, it can be more reasonable. Regulation in relation to access for disabled people requires a certain amount of common sense, and if common sense is not forthcoming, that can be very hard on a business. Such businesses need to grow, and we must not throw huge obstacles in their way. If the north-east is to rebuild itself and have a decent future, we need to encourage them, not discourage them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-29_para6">
I should also slightly chide the hon. Member for Ochil (Mr. O&#039;Neill). Yesterday, if I read my <i>Financial Times</i> correctly, referring to the concerns of the British Chambers of Commerce about over-regulation, he said that its figures were &quot;statistically dubious&quot; and that employers were &quot;obsessed&quot; with protesting against regulation. I disagree fundamentally. My experience is that they are genuinely worried about such regulation, and see it as possibly one of the biggest drawbacks to expanding and developing their business.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-29_spnew7"><b> Mr. O&#039;Neill: </b> 
 I was questioning, in the first instance, the rather haphazard way in which the British Chambers of Commerce conducted its survey. There was no real sampling&#151;it was a self-selected group of people, who had perhaps replied by computer, and perhaps sent in forms. It was rather sloppy, and it did not stand up to close examination as an accurate expression of opinion of British business. It was more of a propaganda tool for a group of people who seemed to have as much a political as a business agenda.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-29_spnew8"><b> Mr. Atkinson: </b> 
 I am not sure that I can complain about the hon. Gentleman&#039;s last comment, but I am grateful that he has put it on the record. I urge him and his Committee to bear it in mind that over-regulation, and bad regulation, is seen as one of the greatest drawbacks for business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-29_para7">
Regulation can also be amazingly trivial. There is a small butcher&#039;s shop in my constituency, which, because it is owned by a number of farmers, likes to put up a sign saying, &quot;This lamb came from so-and-so&#039;s farm&quot;, or &quot;This beef came from so-and-so&#039;s farm.&quot; It received a letter about how it should label meat, its interpretation of which was that all that could be displayed on the board was a holding number, which would be utterly meaningless. I wrote a series of letters to Lord Whitty to try to get to the bottom of the matter. I discovered that the shop can show which farm the lamb came from, but that if it wants to do the same for beef it needs to obtain permission from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and then get a form, which it can download. I worry slightly about chaps who work in the butcher&#039;s shop downloading forms from DEFRA. Nevertheless, they can download the form, fill it in, send it back on-line, and, I hope, get permission to put up a sign saying that the beef came from Joe Bloggs&#039;s farm. That is a silly example, but it nevertheless illustrates the kind of regulation with which people must deal these days.

The Chancellor was silent on many aspects of the economy about which we wanted to hear. He was silent on one little aspect that is not mentioned much here nowadays, although it is very important, certainly to my constituency. Although it is never mentioned in Budget speeches or economic debates, agriculture&#151;which had a reasonable year last year&#151;has had a disastrous year in terms of farm incomes this year, because of wet weather and the new single farm payments scheme, which is causing uncertainty about the way in which they are paid. There have also been hugely rising costs.

Rising costs affect all businesses, but one of the businesses that they affect most is agriculture. Fuel and imported fertiliser costs form a large part of the agriculture bill.

 I am grateful for the chance to speak, and particularly grateful for the chance to speak in today&#039;s debate. The Queen&#039;s Speech includes measures on the economy that are fundamental to the well-being of my constituents, and will be fundamental to what happens next year when the election comes along. They affect my constituents particularly in two ways: they illustrate the Government&#039;s continuing commitment to economic stability, and they introduce important new provisions. Economic stability has been fundamental to the security enjoyed by my constituents in their homes and in their work, and to their sense of well-being under the present Government. It has made possible sustained investment in public services, which has also greatly improved my constituents&#039; quality of life.

We thought that we would see one or two, but we saw rows and rows of them. Now repossessions are at record low levels because of low mortgage interest rates. I accept that the rates have gone up a little recently, but given higher employment and financial security, people have been able to maintain their mortgage payments. Unemployment has fallen further, by 28&nbsp;per cent. in my constituency. The constituency has

<a name="41201-30_para2">
As for public sector investment, one of the things that we inherited from the last Government was scandalously low pay in the public services. It is right that some of the extra money going into public services should deal with pay levels and employment conditions for the people who provide those services. But over and above that, such investment has transformed the prospects of many young people. For example, a &#163;106&nbsp;million private finance initiative scheme is rebuilding all our schools.

The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr.&nbsp;Prisk) spoke persuasively about the problems that businesses encounter with regulation, and all of us can understand their frustration with red tape. But when I first became an MP, the local chamber of commerce&#039;s biggest complaint was the underperformance of schools and the skills gap. The extra investment in schools, particularly in secondary schools, is key to expanding the economy and creating the long-term security that the people of Northampton want.
</p>





<p><a name="41201-30_spnew1"><b> Mr. Prisk: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right: schooling, the calibre of individuals and the skills aspect of learning in particular are important issues. Given that she recognises that the burden of regulation is an important issue for small businesses, does she think that the 53&nbsp;per cent. increase in such regulation since 1997&nbsp;is a good thing or a bad thing?
</p>





<p><a name="41201-30_spnew2"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman may have noticed, I am not a particularly tribal politician. Small businesses usually consist of people who are simply earning an income for their families, and for that reason many banks have virtually turned their small business financial services into personal financial services. I recognise that those who run such businesses do not like filling in forms. Of course we want to see a reduction in regulation, and I understand people&#039;s complaints in that regard. Nevertheless, if we want to expand the economy, we come back to the major issue of skills shortages.

<a name="41201-30_para4">
We should remember that this Government have made available the finance to expand small businesses. The investment in early years has been key to the economic well-being of families, particularly because it has enabled women to go out to work. One of the last things that my right hon.

I want to move on to a couple of the measures in the Queen&#039;s Speech. There is a child benefit Bill, which will provide for an extension of the education maintenance allowance. I suspect that it will be one of those measures, little heralded and little talked about in this place, that will produce lasting benefits for many people. Support is already provided for more than 1,000&nbsp;people in Northamptonshire, and the feedback that I receive from single parents who are struggling to ensure that their older children stay on at school rather than go out to work has been very positive. I am rather surprised that we have heard no comments about that from either the Liberal Democrats or the Conservatives. I quite understand that people may be waiting for Second Reading, but the fact remains that this provision has been piloted and is already out there, so I would have expected to hear some comments from the other two parties on the theory or practice of that support. The legislation will reach a particular section of the community and bring real benefits to my constituents. Not everyone among my constituents aspires to go to university&#151;more&#039;s the pity, in some ways.

Some of my colleagues have mentioned the consumer protection Bill, which will provide important safeguards for my constituents. People in Northampton carry high levels of credit.

Consumer debt and the need for safeguards are important matters at this time. I welcome the fact that the Bill will make provision for much needed better regulation and raise the present &#163;25,000&nbsp;limit. On the subject of local debt, about half the people who had severe problems, with debts of about &#163;9,000&nbsp;or more, were not in work.

The ending of child poverty was mentioned earlier. I would greatly welcome that, as I would the speeding up of the extra safeguards for children, particularly in connection with housing. I am reminded that last Friday night I visited a constituent who lived with her five children in a single room in the basement of a bed-and-breakfast hostel, placed there by a Labour council&#151;no, it was not a Labour council but a Conservative one. That was a Freudian slip. It used to be Labour, but is now Conservative and standards have deteriorated. For a woman with five children to live in a basement flat is not appropriate in 21st century Britain, and she was but one of three women who came to my advice surgery with that problem.

The &#163;5, &#163;10&nbsp;or &#163;20&nbsp;in pension credit is what makes a big difference to their lives. Being able to get their children into nursery schools and the investment in the child trust fund will also transform the lives of my constituents.

Twenty years ago, the dole queue was longer by 4,500&nbsp;people&#151;six and a half times more people. That is a fair measure of how much outlook and opportunity have changed under a Labour Government.

Twenty years ago, north Staffordshire&#039;s oldest pottery firm had just bitten the dust. Elijah Cotton founded his firm in 1758, a year before Josiah Wedgwood started out on his own. However, Cotton&#039;s descendants lasted barely a year under Margaret Thatcher. We should remember that that industry was more than decimated as Geoffrey Howe unleashed raw, uneducated monetarism on this country.

 I shall come on to the beneficial inheritance of oil, especially for the Conservative Government. To set the record straight, under Labour, from 1976&nbsp;until the 1979&nbsp;general election, unemployment fell. It continued to fall until just a few months into the Tory Government, from which point it rose, rose and rose again.

My right hon. Friend the Chancellor is fond of quoting the 15&nbsp;per cent. level to which interest rates shot up during the second recession that the Tories unleashed on this country much later, in the 1990s. Today, as we know, rates are still below 5&nbsp;per cent. Then, however, there was a worse bogey figure with which to scare the wee bairn: during the first savage downturn under Thatcher, rates reached 17&nbsp;per cent. Sterling soared and yet more industry fell. By the time the monetarist experiment was killed off, quietly, during the Falklands war, one in six families in my area&#151;north Staffordshire&#151;had been hit by redundancy.

Let us compare that legacy with the current record. We have never had lower unemployment; we have never had more employment and regeneration. The unemployment figure for the whole country is 836,000&#151;nearly half the total in 1997, when it was 1.6&nbsp;million. Since 1997, the figure has fallen steadily. Under the Tories, when the Wolstanton pit closed, unemployment broke through the 3&nbsp;million barrier for the first, but far from the last, time.

In Stoke-on-Trent, next-door to my constituency, the EMA has already led to more children from poorer backgrounds staying in education and training after the age of 16.

Labour did not enjoy them in the 1970s either, when the country, like the international economy, was suffering oil shocks and when we were investing for the future in the North sea. Now, of course, we are having to prepare for a post-oil and gas economy too. But what did the Tories do with their one-off riches? Did they invest in education and skills? Did they invest in public services and the country&#039;s infrastructure? No. They blew it and threw it away.

That was worth three privatised BPs, five British Gases, two whole British Telecoms&#151;worth as much, indeed, as was raised from the sale of the electricity, gas and water industries all put together under the Thatcher and Major Governments. And of course, unlike their sell-offs, it was not a botched sale below value. Great care was taken. Bidders went through a carefully crafted auction of 150&nbsp;rounds. My right hon. and hon.

The Conservative Government ignored our advice too on insisting on clawbacks of the profit on the future sale of companies, which was standard procedure in the private sector.

They did not listen and they did not learn because they did not care. And here is the nub. How did they treat the money? Did they, like the Chancellor, treat it as a one-off to pay off debt, as any prudent household&#151;in Grantham, for example&#151;might be expected to do? No. Conservative Governments treated it as negative public expenditure. No wonder then, when the silver ran out, that the public finances were in such a mess.

It was used as an example up and down the country, certainly in Ford plants, as the road the labour force should go down to secure their future. What did they get in return? A slap in the face, because the factory is closing.

It was the Labour Government who reduced it. We have long memories.

The Liberals want to abolish the Department of Trade and Industry and the Tories want to restrict its sphere of interest, yet both say that they want to help small businesses.

The second imbalance is the growing budget deficit. If the economy is doing so well, as the Chancellor claims, why is the deficit deteriorating steadily? Why, at this stage of the economic cycle, this year, can we see such a large fiscal deficit? It was disappointing that the Chancellor failed to engage with all the warnings that he was in danger of breaking his own golden rule. He seems to be in a world where we do not face any long-term fiscal problems as a result of his policies. Let me quote to him what he said on the &quot;Today&quot; programme on Monday 18&nbsp;November. He said that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;in the Euro area pensions expenditure is 10&nbsp;per cent. of national income and is due to rise to 15&nbsp;per cent. over the next 30&nbsp;or 40&nbsp;years. And that&#039;s why major reforms are taking place in pensions in Germany, France and elsewhere. But in Britain the picture is one where we have 5&nbsp;per cent. of our national income spent on pensions. It is a perfectly sustainable position over the longer term.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-33_para9">
Does the Chancellor really believe that with his pensions policies, public expenditure on pensions will be 5&nbsp;per cent. of our national income from now till kingdom come? It is already higher than that. If he read the Turner commission report, which brings together fully all the different items of expenditure on pensions and includes not just the basic pension but expenditure on all the means-tested benefits for pensioners and also public sector pensions, which he tries to hide away, he would see that the figure is already more than 6&nbsp;per cent. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 732</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and is forecast to rise still higher. With his policies, we are converging with Europe on one of the continent&#039;s worst problems&#151;growing public expenditure on pensions. An earnings-linked pension credit going to three quarters of pensioners or more has not been factored into his calculations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-33_para10">
It is not just the flow of expenditure but the liability and the stock of debt that are problems. The Chancellor talks about how he has brought down the national debt, and we heard that again from the Labour Benches. A truer measure of the national debt would include the liability to pay public sector pensions in the future. If the&nbsp;cost of public sector pension promises is included, the true national debt has risen under the Government by 5&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product, as the expensive promises to pay public sector pensions have racked up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-33_para11">
So we have problems on the balance of payments and on the fiscal policy. Let me speak briefly about unemployment and economic inactivity. We have heard from several Labour Members how unemployment has fallen, but more than half the fall in official unemployment has been offset by a rise in economic inactivity. There are more people who are economically inactive&#151;out of the labour market&#151;in Britain today than at any time for the past 20&nbsp;years. People are being driven out of the labour market altogether. That is what is happening under this Government. The problem is affecting some of the groups that they claim to care about most.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-33_para12">
I am sure the Chancellor is familiar with table 14&nbsp;of the labour market statistics produced every month. The figures for economic activity and inactivity show that for people aged under 25, the total number who are either unemployed and not in full-time education or economically inactive and not in full-time education is 1.112&nbsp;million. That is a higher number of young people who are not working, studying or training than when the Government came to office in 1997. That is a lost generation of more than a million young people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-33_para13">
The position is deteriorating. Despite everything we hear about the new deal for young people, the figures represent a deterioration on the position that the Government inherited. That is why we say that the new deal for young people is not working. We have heard in the past from the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and I must correct him. He has claimed:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We&#039;ve virtually eradicated long-term youth unemployment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-33_para14">
Again, on the Government&#039;s own survey measure, the latest figures show that there are more than 150,000&nbsp;young people aged 18&nbsp;to 24&nbsp;who have been unemployed for more than six months. There is a problem of young people who cannot find jobs, who are out of the labour market, who are not studying, training or working, and it is a pity that the Government do not engage with that, instead of endlessly repeating their mantras about the new deal.

I want to discuss the failure of the new deal for lone parents, which several hon. Members have discussed. The Chancellor may be one of the few people who reads with relish the evaluations of the schemes that he invents, but it is a pity that he does change his policies in light of the evidence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-34_para0">
I shall quote an evaluation of lone parent work-focused interviews, which are an important part of the new deal for lone parents, published earlier this year. The research report by outside academics states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Introduction of Lone Parent Work Focused Interviews brought about no detectable change in exit rates from Income Support for eligible new or repeat claimants&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

That is the evidence about the failure of the Chancellor&#039;s schemes, which is why we are so sceptical.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-34_para2">
Finally, I shall discuss the pensions crisis and the amount that we, as a nation, are saving. I pay tribute to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who has taken a novel and refreshing approach to his job. He has given up defending Government policy, and I wonder whether the Chancellor knows exactly what his colleague gets up to. I am not sure that the Granita pact permits the Secretary of State to make these statements, because I thought that it meant that the Chancellor determines such matters.

<p class="tabletext">&quot;People feel there is no reward for playing by the rules, and one of the critical areas is pension provision. We have to bite the bullet and look at the state pension system, certainly for the longer term, so that if you do a lifetime&#039;s work, it will deliver a pension above the basic level of means-tested support.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-34_para9">
That is it. We would not abolish the pension credit, but we want to see a pension with a value higher than that of means-tested support. We welcome the Secretary of State&#039;s conversion, but it would be great to hear the Chancellor endorse his colleague&#039;s analysis of what is wrong with our pensions system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-34_para10">
Conservative Members look forward to a constructive and reasonable debate about how we can gradually get pensioners off means-tested benefits, create incentives to save and tackle the problem of the 1.7&nbsp;million pensioners who are entitled to pension credit but do not claim it. The objective should be to get a basic pension with a value higher than that of the pension credit, which is why we endorse the imaginative thoughts advanced by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. It is slightly unfortunate that those thoughts are not yet official Government policy, but given that the Chancellor is aware of his Secretary of State&#039;s strong views, it is only a matter of time.

The hon.

He continued his party&#039;s vicious and sinister vendetta against the Department of Trade and Industry. He might like to know that when I was a Minister at the DTI and that policy first emerged, I went to tell my staff, because I thought that they should know about it. I said, &quot;Look, if there&#039;s a Lib Dem Government you&#039;re going to lose your jobs.&quot; They took that as a guarantee of job security, which was not what I intended to convey.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-34_para14">
My right hon.

Let me make this absolutely clear to the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), because he invited me to do so. When we came into Government we found that 2.8&nbsp;million pensioners were living in abject poverty. The Conservatives are experts on pensioner poverty, but unfortunately experts on creating, not alleviating, the problem. Those 2.8&nbsp;million pensioners needed help and assistance immediately. The hon. Member for Havant argues, in effect, that we should have told them&#151;many were in their eighties, and two thirds were women&#151;that the problem with giving them the kind of income increase that they really needed was that it could create a savings disincentive in future. I find that argument incredible. In government we have tackled the real pensions crisis, and we should be proud that we have reduced absolute poverty for pensioners by two thirds and taken 1.8&nbsp;million pensioners out of poverty.

I do not accept that we are looking at marginal tax rates of 40&nbsp;per cent. Under the previous Government, the marginal tax rate on benefits was 100&nbsp;per cent.&#151;pound for pound withdrawal. But when we introduce a system whereby there is, for the first time, a 40p in the pound withdrawal rate so that people are not penalised for their savings, we are told that it is a tax. It is a strange tax that pays people money&#151;an average of &#163;41&nbsp;a week with &#163;1,000&nbsp;arrears to 3.2&nbsp;million pensioners&#151;but it is certainly one of which we will be proud to take ownership.

</p>





<p><a name="41201-34_spnew7"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I shall deal with that shortly. The hon. Gentleman made a thoughtful contribution and I shall tackle his point. Let me address his first point. The policy of Her Majesty&#039;s official Opposition is to restore the earnings link. Several hon. Members said that we should accept that, if we are to work, perhaps in a bipartisan way, genuinely to tackle the problems that the Pensions Commission set out, we must ensure that pensions are fair, equitable, attack pensioner poverty and are sustainable, not only now but in future.

<p>

At the beginning of the debate on the Queen&#039;s Speech, my right hon.

The right hon. and learned Gentleman replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I think that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pensioners are more interested in the real difficulties that they face today than in what might happen in 2050.&quot;</p>

I despair. If the Conservative party does not consider the sustainability of its policy, it betrays future generations of pensioners and taxpayers.

<a name="41201-34_para19">
Of course, the Conservative party removed the link with earnings. The hon. Member for Havant said only two years ago that restoring the earnings link would be an expensive error, but more recently he said that withdrawing the link had been a mistake. However, when it was pointed out to the Leader of the Opposition that he was a member of the Cabinet when the earnings link was withdrawn, he said:

</p>





<p><a name="41201-35_spnew2"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 If the Secretary of State wants a rational debate on long-term costings, we need to know the Government&#039;s estimate of the long-term cost of increasing the pension credit by earnings from now to 2050.

<p>

First, the hon. Gentleman tried to argue that the reforms to advance corporation tax created the problem. The Turner commission did not reach that conclusion. It pointed out, among other things, that in the 1980s, a Conservative Chancellor insisted that pension funds could not be funded by more than 5&nbsp;per cent. above 100&nbsp;per cent.&#151;setting a 105&nbsp;per cent. cap&#151;and created a problem that forced pension funds to get rid of surpluses because they could not put any more money into the funds. That point was made earlier. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, in seeking to use that argument, forgets that many companies during the 1980s&#151;redundancies then and in the early 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-35_para2">
The hon. Gentleman also talked about the wonderful world&#151;the nirvana&#151;in which we lived during the late &#039;90s. The Turner report calls that a fool&#039;s paradise and makes it absolutely clear that these problems started in the early &#039;80s. Anyone who thinks that we inherited a wonderful position for pensioners should remember that they were in abject poverty and that there was mis-selling of pensions. Pensions had gone up only once in 18&nbsp;years. Why did they go up? They went up because the previous Government put VAT on fuel. To suggest that that was a wonderful world for pensioners is pretty perverse.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The petition of residents of North Essex,</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Declares that Colchester Borough Council and Essex County Council have been forced to consider locating permanent travellers&#039; sites on greenfield areas&#151;where no development would normally be allowed and which would damage the value of surrounding properties&#151;because, in the absence of a designated site, travellers and others have acquired excessive rights to occupy and spoil private land in the area.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The petitioners further declare that Colchester Borough and Essex County Councils should reject proposals for a travellers&#039; site at Severalls Lane or the Crown Interchange just north of Colchester.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons calls upon the Deputy Prime Minister to introduce legislation to enable local councils to protect the interests of those they are elected to serve, including genuine travelling people, by transferring to local councils complete responsibility for Travellers and their activities within their local areas.</p>

<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 751</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
<a name="41201-38_head2"><h3 align=center>Coroners&#039; Courts</h3>


<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Ms Bridget Prentice.]</i>

<a name="41201-38_time2"><h5>7.43&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="41201-38_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Kidney  (Stafford) (Lab):</b> 
 No one could reasonably say that coroners&#039; courts are not important. When the Harry Stanley inquest said that Mr. Stanley was unlawfully killed, it threw into crisis the whole of the Metropolitan police&#039;s armed police response in London. When the coroner in the inquest on Joseph Scholes&#039; death wrote to the Home Secretary requesting a public inquiry, it cast a spotlight on the dangers of suicide when we lock up children in detention. If our system for registration of deaths and coroners&#039; investigations is inadequate, the impact can be severe. To illustrate, I pose this question: could we not have detected sooner the murderous activities of the general practitioner Harold Shipman? I add immediately that the third report of the Shipman inquiry made it clear that it was not the individuals working in the system who were to blame for Dr. Shipman&#039;s long run of murdering patients in Hyde, but the system itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-38_para1">
I asked for this debate precisely because coroners&#039; courts are important. Alongside the registration of deaths, they should provide a reliable system for collecting data on deaths and monitoring trends in deaths. They should provide an adequate investigation into suspicious deaths, to uncover wrongdoing or to provide reassurance as appropriate. They should provide also a thorough and sensitive service for the relatives of those who die suddenly and unexpectedly. Indeed, they should provide advice and guidance to us all on how to prevent avoidable deaths. They should provide the means of dealing with inquiries into mass deaths after major disasters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-38_para2">
The present system does not have the appearance of a modern and effective service able to respond to public concerns over deaths, whether of individuals or of groups, and to command public confidence. Nor does the Government&#039;s response to the reports that have exposed the failings of the present system and made recommendations for reform, which I shall come to, suggest that they are giving to the improvement of the system the priority that its importance demands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-38_para3">
In criticising the current state of the system for registering deaths, investigating them and holding inquests, I am not making any adverse judgment on the 120&nbsp;or so coroners&#151;their number fluctuates, but there are 23&nbsp;full-timers&#151;and their support staff and investigators. I am sure that most of them are hard-working and dedicated, but they are working with statutory powers and procedures that were established in a different era.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-38_para4">
It is my case that there are serious and obvious flaws in the current arrangements, and that those have been drawn repeatedly to the Government&#039;s attention. Yet the Government have not acted to put them right with the urgency that the situation requires. Action is required at two levels, legislative and administrative. I can understand that securing a slot in the Government&#039;s legislative programme may take time, but there is no reason why the urgency of the need for change cannot start to be met by administrative actions straightaway.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 752</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-38_para5">
I move on to the reports that show the need for reform. I shall call the first one the Luce report, after Mr. Tom Luce, the former head of social care policy in the Department of Health, who chaired the review team for the report called &quot;Death Certification and Investigation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland&#151;The Report of a Fundamental Review 2003&quot;, Cm. 5831. At the front of the report is printed the review team&#039;s letter to the Home Office, dated 28&nbsp;April 2003, which states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;During the last three-quarters of a century, the Government has twice commissioned reviews of these subjects, in 1936&nbsp;and 1965. Very little happened in response to their reports. The services are showing the consequences of this neglect.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-38_para6">
The first lines of the report read:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The systems in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for the certification of most deaths by doctors and the investigation of others by coroners have been seriously neglected over many decades. They must undergo radical change if they are to become fit for the purposes of a modern society and capable of meeting future challenges. The need for reform is widely recognised and supported.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-38_para7">
I would add to that that there are other high-profile cases that demonstrate the need for an effective system to be in place. I have already mentioned the case of Harold Shipman, whose unlawful killings were counted in hundreds. To that I would add great disasters like the Bowbelle/Marchioness incident, and more recently the rail crashes at Ladbroke Grove and Potters Bar.
</p>

<a name="41201-38_para8">
In addition to these obvious demands for a modern service there are linked issues demanding a strategic response from a modern coroner system. For example, article 2&nbsp;of the European convention on human rights is about a state&#039;s obligation to protect the lives of its citizens, which the courts have ruled implies an obligation to investigate deaths. There is the White Paper entitled &quot;Civil Registration: Vital Change&quot;, and registration changes are happening now. A more weighty inquiry is needed where there are deaths capable of causing serious damage to public confidence&#151;for example, the death of the Government scientist, David Kelly. Perhaps not everyone appreciates this, but the Hutton inquiry into the allegations surrounding the death of David Kelly was also the inquest into his death, thanks to an addition to the Access to Justice Act 1999&nbsp;that was well secured by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore).
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-38_para9">
Most recently, the inquiries into the Shipman deaths provide more evidence for my arguments. The third report surveyed the present state of the coroners service and described coroners&#039; resources as varying widely. It mentioned that some coroners worked from home. It describes a situation in which there is virtually no training, and the training that is available is not compulsory. It says that coroners operate in isolation, and receive little advice or guidance. There is no leadership structure and no reasonable process for complaints and appeals. In fact, a coroner&#039;s inquest can be challenged only through judicial review. The Shipman inquiry said that coroners should have consistent quality standards, training, leadership, a wider range of investigative methods and greater powers.

As for handling of the reports in the media, an article in <i>The Guardian</i> on the Luce report carried the headline, &quot;Coroners face big shake-up after 800&nbsp;years&quot;. It said that the report recommended a package of sweeping

It talked about the &quot;forgotten&quot; coroner service, and pointed out that it needed radical change after decades of neglect. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins), who will respond to the debate tonight, is quoted as saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The shortcomings in the current system have been increasingly evidenced and it is essential that we build an effective, supportive and transparent system that commands public confidence&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041201/debtext/41201-39.htm"/>




<p><i>The Guardian</i> began an article on the third report of the Shipman inquiry thus:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;All deaths, including those that do not appear suspicious, must be investigated to ensure that murders such as those committed by Britain&#039;s worst serial killer, Harold Shipman, do not go undetected&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para0">
Dame Janet Smith, who presided over the inquiry, identified an urgent need for a more focused, professional and consistent approach to coroners&#039; investigations. She said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;There must be radical reform and a complete break from the past, as to organisation, philosophy, sense of purpose and mode of operation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para1">
In a joint statement, the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Health said that work was already under way to identify how best to reform the coroner system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para2">
Eventually, in March this year the Home Office produced a position paper proposing a coherent system based on full-time coroners with legal qualifications, closely supported by appropriate medical expertise, together with tighter rules for death certification, notification of all deaths to coroners and stronger support for scrutinising cases and investigation where necessary. A coroner and burial team was set up. In a news release, the Minister said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The proposals outlined today will introduce a new system that will combine an independent check on all deaths and a professional oversight of death patterns with, for the majority of cases, the minimum of bureaucracy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para3">
A BBC news report on the Home Office plans suggested that those changes had taken place. It said that all deaths would be referred to an independent medical examiner and that a wide-ranging review would result in the numbers falling from 127&nbsp;part-time coroners to a total of 40&nbsp;to 60&nbsp;full-time coroners. Coroners have been handed new powers to seize documents, and the reforms will change the way in which verdicts are recorded, doing away with terms such as &quot;suicide&quot; and &quot;misadventure&quot; and replacing them with a short narrative account of the facts of the death.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para4">
The Minister was reported as saying that the proposals would prevent an individual doctor from being able to ensure that someone was buried without any further scrutiny within the system. He said that that was &quot;a huge step forward&quot;. What has happened since March 2004, and what urgency has been ascribed to this policy area by the Home Office? In September the independent support group INQUEST described the position paper as &quot;aspirational&quot; and drew attention to the lack of clearly stated commitments. It expressed concern because any changes were expected to take place within existing budgets and without any new money. The Luce report, however, recommended a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 754</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>series of reforms which, it estimated, would cost an additional 10&nbsp;per cent. over and above the current &#163;70&nbsp;million budget for coroners&#039; courts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para5">
Will the Minister explain what has been done since March 2004? Which of the proposals in the position paper have been put into practice? What is still to be done before new legislation is introduced? The Luce report helpfully includes a section on what can be done without waiting for a new Act of Parliament. NHS doctors could be allocated to work in an advisory capacity with the registration service and local coroners. The existing coroners&#039; rules could be changed to reflect the recommendations on the outcome, conduct and scope of inquests. The registration service, the Home Office and the chief medical officers could give guidance on the use of autopsies. Here I interpose that in the third report of the Shipman inquiry, it is said that the immediate resort to autopsies by coroners is undesirable, and some coroners&#039; autopsies are &quot;seriously deficient&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para6">
As further examples of what can be done now, a new charter of standards of service to families could be produced. Training programmes for coroners&#039; officers should be introduced with some support from central funds, and the development of new training arrangements for coroners themselves could be started. Informal piloting of death certification changes could be started. A new coronial council could be appointed on an informal basis and asked to oversee progress with the reforms. That is an excellent idea. The report states on page 219:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;All these changes could be made in advance of new legislation and all would be very worthwhile.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para7">
I am asking for reassurance. Will my hon. Friend the Minister reassure me and the public at large? I am talking about the relatives of those who die tragically in suspicious circumstances, in the custody of the state or in a terrible disaster; the technical and expert groups such as the Office for National Statistics, which collects and publishes the data on deaths, and the Health and Safety Executive, which has responsibility for preventing avoidable deaths at work; the organisations that work professionally with the coroners, such as doctors, police and prosecutors; and the media and all those who have a legitimate interest in the process and outcome of coroners&#039; investigations?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para8">
When will we have a modern coronial jurisdiction with national coherence? Will we have a standing rules committee, a coronial council and an inspectorate? Will we have a nationally consistent complaints procedure, an appeals process and compulsory training? Can my hon. Friend tell me that defects in coroners&#039; powers as identified in the reports that have been published will be remedied, and that in future coroners will not solely be reactive, but will be able to investigate any death or group of deaths on their own initiative, making recommendations that may avert further deaths from similar causes in future?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para9">
Can my hon. Friend tell me that in future, coroners will have the back-up that they need for expert medical input and effective investigations, and that families will by right have access to reports and to investigators, and that they will be accorded the assistance and the respect to which they are entitled throughout the investigative process, including at an inquest, if one is held? Will he 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 755</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>tell me when all this will happen? Can he tell me that that&nbsp;will be soon? It is urgent. Can he tell me that the media will be able to report those actions as fact, because they will be fact?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para10">
When my hon. Friend says that he remains committed to taking urgent action, when he reassures all those with an interest in the coroners&#039; court system, especially the families of the deceased, the coroners and their staff, that he is constantly on their case, and when he says that he is determined to see through radical reform in a timely and cost-effective way, I will be satisfied that this debate is worth while, and that some good will come of it.

<a name="41201-39_para11">
The issue was brought home to me about a year ago, when one of my constituents, a Methodist minister, was criticised by a coroner after a death outside his church. It is neither appropriate nor possible for me to go into the details, but when my constituent sought my advice, all I could say was that he could challenge the finding by judicial review, or possibly by getting the Attorney-General to support a High Court application. Neither course of action was practical, given the cost involved. Ultimately, the coroner was prepared to enter into correspondence with me, and at the end of the day my constituent and I felt that justice had been done. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to recognise that this is an important issue, on which the agenda must move forward quickly.

I have been a Minister long enough now to have my earlier remarks quoted back at me. I have also been a Minister for long enough to know that it is a long way from a position paper to a fully reformed system. However, I agree that the issue is important. I reiterate the need diligently to follow through on it and again place on record my determination to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para13">
The coroner&#039;s office and death certification are, thankfully, places and systems to which we do not often have to go. When we use them, we may be upset and distressed, which is all the more reason why the Government need to ensure that the systems are reliable and effective. As my hon. Friend the Member for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Dec 2004 : Column 756</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Stafford said, the system goes back many hundreds of years. It functions as well as it does largely because of the dedication and professionalism of the staff involved. I assert that we owe it to them and the wider public to modernise the system so that it is fit for purpose and fully effective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para14">
The Government set out our proposals for reform in the position paper that we issued in March this year. As we said then, our intention is to issue a White Paper early next year. The work undertaken by Dame Janet Smith, which is contained in her third report from the Shipman inquiry, and by Tom Luce, in the fundamental review he carried out on behalf of the Home Office, has been crucial in helping to inform and work out our proposals for the way forward. We need a system that is simple to understand and easy to run. We need to close any gaps that could be exploited by those who have criminal intent or who fail to provide proper care. In particular, we must do all we can to ensure that horrific crimes such as those carried out by Harold Shipman can never happen again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para15">
To do that, we must connect a number of different but associated systems, such as the registration service and arrangements for forensic pathology. In addition, we will also need strong links between coroners and health services. It is essential that we learn from deaths of all kinds and use that knowledge to prevent avoidable and unnecessary deaths. We must also make sure that the public have a better understanding of how the system operates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para16">
We plan to reform not only the coroner system, but the arrangements for death certification. New procedures to verify the fact of death will be introduced, and the system will be the same for all deaths, whether there is to be a cremation or a burial. We will also ensure much stronger medical oversight. The new system will mean that in future all deaths, whether or not they need to be reported to the coroner, will be reviewed by medically trained professionals based within the coroner&#039;s office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para17">
Those trained doctors&#151;in the position paper, we call them medical examiners&#151;will review the medical certificates of the cause of death in all cases. They will have new powers to call for supporting documentation and make any inquiries that they see fit in order to satisfy themselves that each death is properly certified and that there is no reason for a coroner&#039;s investigation. They will also need to be able to review cases as quickly as possible, so that our new procedures do not lead to delay and additional distress for the bereaved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-39_para18">
Each medical examiner will be properly trained in death certification and will work full-time in fulfilling their duties. The checks that they make will be much more effective, and the availability of that additional medical expertise will assist lawyer coroners to interpret and understand the medical information about a death and the details of any medical treatment and procedures that the deceased may have been receiving prior to the death. All that will help coroners to decide what action they may need to take in each case. In turn, we expect that better medical information, and the greater competence and confidence it brings, to lead to a reduction in the number of post-mortem examinations.
</p>

<a name="41201-39_para19">
Families will have a crucial role in this reformed process. I know, not least from the consultations we have carried out, just how important it is for families to

Under our proposals, families will have new rights to receive information about a death and to challenge anything that seems to them to be wrong. Their views will also be taken into account when key decisions are taken about the investigation of a death. There will be new and more accessible opportunities to appeal such decisions. Although I cannot at this stage go into the details of that, I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dudley, North will appreciate that we are committed to ensuring that families have more opportunities for redress.

 I thank my hon. Friend for all that he is saying.

<p><a name="41201-40_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Later in my remarks I will show how, under plans to develop a family charter, we want to share more information with families. Of course, we want to speed up the inquest system, although in our current system it is hard to do that in cases where coroners have a backlog of cases, with all the difficulties that that entails. We need to carry out the fundamental reform, but there are things that we can do now and we will continue to do so.

In rural areas, there are sometimes very few suitable venues for coroners to hear their courts.

</p>





<p><a name="41201-40_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I am aware that sometimes locating a suitable venue for an inquest can be problematic. That remains a responsibility for the local authority.

<a name="41201-40_para1">
As all Members have emphasised, we have much to learn from the experiences of families. Indeed, some of the most instructive and compelling evidence that I have received came during two discussions that I was fortunate enough to have with the families of Harold Shipman&#039;s victims&#151;people who have more reason than most to know of the shortcomings of the present system and who expressed themselves to me with remarkable clarity and calmness given the circumstances. I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell) for arranging those important opportunities for me to meet them.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>new post&#151;a chief coroner, who will lead the service by setting and driving up professional standards, deploying coroners within the national service, and, where necessary, undertaking the most complex cases himself or herself.

<a name="41201-40_para6">
We are carefully considering the resources that we will need. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford mentioned that. Our position paper expressed the hope that, in broad terms, the changes would be cost-neutral. Further detailed analysis suggests that there may be a need to identify further funding, over and above the blocks of funding that local authorities and the police allocate to the coroner service and coroners&#039; officers. Given that those funding arrangements were designed to cope with around 200,000&nbsp;deaths a year, while the new service will be required to deal with approximately 500,000, that should not be too surprising. We are, of course, examining the efficiency savings that will accrue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-40_para7">
We are also considering some of the payments made in the current system, including, for example, the &#163;30&nbsp;million paid privately to doctors for providing certificates prior to cremation, to ascertain whether some of that money could help improve the scrutiny that families clearly expect. All that will be clearly set out in the White Paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-40_para8">
As my hon. Friend said, we can do a great deal in advance of a fully reformed system and some of that work has already started. We are working closely with coroners to increase the focus of the service on bereaved families&#151;many coroners already consult families as a routine part of their investigations. I am delighted with the way in which several coroners are taking that work forward. They are seriously considering the way in which families and others receive information about a death and how communications can be improved. I know that some coroners are reviewing the leaflets that they provide and are in discussion with groups and others who work with the bereaved to ascertain what improvements they could make.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41201-40_para9">
In the longer term, building on such work, we will develop a family charter to set out the service standards that can be expected throughout England and Wales. We are also promoting the sharing of good practice. Using modern techniques developed by the Coroners Society of England and Wales, coroners are already making far more use of each other&#039;s experience. At the Home Office-funded training courses for coroners, we are making sure that sharing good practice is built into each course.

<a name="41201-40_para10">
I pay tribute to the coroners for the way in which so many have made real strides in ensuring that their work and that of their staff meets the increasingly high standards that the public and central Government now expect. Working with local authority funders and local police forces, many coroners have made significant progress in their case management systems and their approach to inquests&#151;especially those that take a long time to arrange&#151;in reviewing their performance and making sure that they work closely with other local services. For example, many coroners have been actively reviewing the number of post mortems that they request, and others have been developing important new links with registrars and primary care trusts as well as with voluntary groups who can support the bereaved.
