 We have made no assessment of the individual contribution that social tariffs have made in specific locations.

Across Great Britain, about 700,000 households are on social tariffs, rebates or trust funds.</p>

I have met all the chief executives of the major supply companies to talk about the importance of social tariffs. Some companies are doing well and others are now moving in the right direction. We are keen that social tariffs&#151;alongside social policies such as energy efficiency programmes and the winter fuel payment&#151;should play a full part in tackling fuel poverty.</p>

 On 17 May my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced the Government&#146;s response to the public consultation on the post office network. Post Office Ltd is now carrying that forward through local implementation plans, and there will be six such plans for Scotland. The first area plan for Scotland, for the Greater Glasgow, central Argyll and Bute area, is out for local consultation. The plan covering the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency is scheduled for consultation in August next year.</p>

 I thank the Minister for that answer, but given that the Government have announced 2,500 closures across the country, can he assure the people of Edinburgh that that will be a genuine consultation? Or has he already decided on the number of offices to close, so that all he is prepared to discuss is the method of execution?</p>

 The announcement on 17 May did indicate the number of offices that would close, so the consultation, in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s area and in others, is about how that is to be implemented. Postwatch and the local authorities will be involved, and the hon. Gentleman and his constituents can be involved, but the direction of travel was set by the announcement. The reasons are clear: as a society, we are using the post office less than before. Some 4 million fewer customers a week are going through the doors of post offices, which are losing, collectively, some &#163;3.5 million a week.</p>

 I would not like to speculate on that. At the moment, eight out of 10 pensioners choose to have their pension paid into their bank account&#151;and among new retirees, that figure is nine out of 10. My hon. Friend is right to point to the trends in lifestyle that are driving many of the changes. However, we should give credit to the management of the Post Office for innovating and developing new products, such as broadband services, selling foreign currency and&#151;of relevance at this time of year&#151;the recent launch of the Christmas pre-payment scheme, which will offer a secure outlet for people who want to save for Christmas in that way.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to raise those points. I have great respect for him, and I know that he is a strong supporter of what we are trying to do. Given the technical complexity of the technology it was right and proper for the Government to select one type of competition to run. When we have done that, clearly we have to make a choice. It is worth reminding ourselves that only two other countries in the world are seeking to develop projects like this. Post-combustion technology will give the United Kingdom a potential leading role in developing this important technology, which could play a significant role in meeting our carbon reduction targets by 2050. I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s frustration. We are trying to move forward as quickly as possible on this project, but given the scale of the technology and the issue of public finance, it is right that we make these decisions appropriately.</p>

 I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman is a supporter of what we are trying to do and carbon capture generally, as I hope all hon. Members will be. In relation to his two points, we will be publishing some proposals in the very near future on aspects of capture readiness which should be included in the consenting process, and how this might work in practice. On the economics of carbon sequestration, we want to see a much more robust and strengthened trading scheme. Clearly that must involve a much higher price for carbon. We need to see how phase 2 beds in and then we have important decisions to make for phase 3, which will be the moment when we have to address the issue that the hon. Gentleman raised.</p>

 May I tell my right hon. Friend that when the Trade and Industry Committee met staff of the EU Commissioner for Energy we were told by an energy economist that what was required in the United Kingdom were four demonstration plants and 15 in Europe. To judge from what my right hon. Friend has just said to my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping), we are not going to see that kind of investment in clean coal technology. If we do not see it, we will not be able to have that technology on stream, and as a result we will meet the energy crisis much earlier than we will be able to have nuclear power stations on stream. Therefore it is important to concentrate our efforts on getting clean coal technology up and running. Has my right hon.

 I am tempted to say that the European Commission would say that, wouldn&#146;t it? The United Kingdom is willing to play its full role, but other countries in the European Union should, too. I am not aware of any EU country other than the UK that has made a commitment to funding a CCS project. My hon. Friend asks whether we can support up to four projects. I do not think that that is possible. We believe that we can fund one significant-scale demonstration project. I still believe that, having chosen this particular path of post-combustion coal and of running a competitive process which, if we had taken the advice of the Conservative party, we could not have run, the United Kingdom has the opportunity of being a world leader in this important technology. It can bring significant growth to UK manufacturing companies and engineering consultancies. We are being responsible. We are committing public money, so there will always be a limit&#151;the Conservatives may have forgotten that&#151;to the amount the public can afford to put into such technologies.</p>

The specific development benefits that we have fought for, and secured, are that all ACP regions should have duty and quota-free access to the EU market. We have achieved that, albeit with transitional periods for two products. Furthermore, we want much simpler rules of origin to maximise the benefits of that duty and quota-free access offer, and there has been significant movement in that direction, although we would have liked a little more.</p>

Secondly, the central support cost from the post office network to post office branches must be taken into account. Calculated in that way, some three out of four sub-post offices around the country are unprofitable to Post Office Ltd.

Is not the decision to change the date for announcing the closure of one in six of the capital&#146;s post offices from just three weeks before the mayoral election more connected with saving Ken Livingstone than with genuine consultation?

The figures for the first half of this year show that that use has increased to about 1 million people per month. Interestingly, almost half of those who use the service do so outside the normal office hours of 9 to 5, which shows the demand for public services outside traditional office hours, and it lays down a challenge for the Government as to how we respond.

According to a written answer given just three weeks ago, there were 2,111 security breaches by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs last year alone.

If she wants to put her views into the consultation on behalf of her constituents, I suggest that she do so. A written ministerial statement has been made to the House on the subject of the consultation. When conclusions are reached as a result of hearing from all those who put in their views to the consultation, including hon. Members, and when there are firm proposals for action, no doubt the Secretary of State for Transport will bring those matters to the House. Hon.

 As the Prime Minister reminded the House yesterday, 22 of the 25 European countries have ID cards.

However, I remind him that if we are advised by the head of the Association of Chief Police Officers, by the Government&#146;s independent reviewer Lord Carlile and by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner that there is a case for extension, and if we can be satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards, it will be right for us proceed. I hope that we shall be able to reach all-party agreement.

 I am sure that on many future occasions, in statements, oral questions and topical debates, consideration will given to the issue of data security. As I have said, in response to the immediate issue of HMRC, the Government&#146;s first concern must be to ensure that people are protected from potential damage. We must understand the facts and why the problem arose, and take action to avoid any repetition.</p>

 I am afraid that the Leader of the House has not convinced me that it is common practice for Ministers to fail to make an oral statement on consultations.

 I was thinking of suggesting that I could consider that for a topical debate on Thursday, but next Thursday there is a Westminster Hall debate on post offices.

 With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the publication of the national framework for responding to an influenza pandemic and to provide the House with an update on the progress we have made to improve the UK's ability to respond to a pandemic. I will cover overall public health strategy and our approach to the use of clinical countermeasures, such as antivirals and antibiotics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para0"><a name="07112239000274">Influenza pandemics occurred every 30 to 40 years in the previous century. The last pandemic, in 1968-69, resulted in 80,000 additional deaths in the UK. The possibility of a new pandemic is one of the most severe risks currently facing the UK. Our planning assumptions are that 25 to 50 per cent. of the population may become ill and that, in accordance with previous analysis, between 0.4 per cent. and 2.5 per cent. of those affected could die.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para1"><a name="07112239000275">So that the country will be prepared for the next pandemic, whenever it occurs, I am today publishing a new national framework. It builds upon and supersedes the UK influenza pandemic contingency plan published in October 2005, expanding it to cover a more comprehensive range of impacts and responses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07112239000276">The draft national framework was issued for public discussion in March. This final version reflects a number of issues raised during the period for public discussion and takes account of the practical lessons identified from the national simulation exercise for an outbreak of pandemic flu, Operation Winter Willow, which took place earlier this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07112239000277">So that we are as prepared as possible, the framework suggests that more emphasis needs to be placed on planning at the upper ends of possible clinical attack and complication rates. Although the pandemics during the last century resulted in attack rates at or around 25 per cent., it is important that we consider a higher &#147;reasonable worst case&#148; scenario to ensure that our arrangements are robust and resilient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07112239000278">The framework also includes the planning assumptions that describe the Government's likely position on such issues as school closures, and advice on social gatherings and the use of public places. The national framework will help organisations across government and in the private and public sectors to work together to prepare pandemic plans that can cope with a reasonable worst case scenario.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07112239000279">The framework is supported by a range of guidance. We are publishing an ethical framework for policy and planning, guidance on the provision of health care in a community setting and guidance to assist acute hospitals, social care services and ambulance services in their planning. We are also issuing for public discussion draft guidance on the following: death and cremation certification, proposing legal and other changes in the event of a pandemic; mental health services, assisting mental health trusts in developing their plans; surge capacity, managing the prioritisation of health services and patients at the peak of any pandemic; and NHS human resources guidance, dealing with the work force issues that may arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07112239000281">We are also launching a consultation on possible amendments to medicines and related legislation for use during an influenza pandemic. These aim to support the mass distribution of medicines and the maintenance of access to routine medicines at a time when front-line health care professionals will be focused on the most seriously ill. I have allocated additional funding of &#163;10 million this year to assist the NHS in developing these plans. I expect every NHS organisation to have robust plans in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07112239000283">In the event of a pandemic there will naturally be a great deal of public concern. Our planning assumption is that we will rely on voluntary compliance with national advice during that period. However, should it be necessary to invoke emergency measures, we are taking public health powers in the forthcoming Health and Social Care Bill that could be considered in the event of a pandemic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07112239000284">The development of the national framework and our response to pandemic influenza is grounded in the most up-to-date scientific evidence. The Department of Health&#146;s scientific advisory group on pandemic influenza takes into account evidence from the UK and across the world. Under its auspices, independently peer-reviewed scientific papers were published in August 2007, dealing with the clinical countermeasures and the risk of a pandemic originating from an H5N1 virus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07112239000286">It is clear from the science that good basic hygiene measures must be at the heart of our response. Using a tissue when coughing and sneezing, disposing of it carefully and washing hands often will reduce the spread of influenza, as well as of common coughs and colds. The latest public health campaign, &#147;Catch, it, Bin it, Kill it&#148;, is being launched to raise awareness of the importance of good respiratory and hand hygiene. It builds on the success of earlier campaigns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para10"><a name="07112239000287">Science has also informed our strategic approach towards stockpiling the clinical countermeasures we will need to fight a pandemic. The countermeasures will enable us to treat the symptoms of pandemic influenza, to reduce the number of complications and deaths and to reduce the spread of the virus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para11"><a name="07112239000288">To make sure that the UK has access to a pandemic vaccine I have signed advance supply agreements with GlaxoSmithKline and Baxter to deliver enough vaccine to cover the entire population. It should be the most effective vaccine against the pandemic virus. Those agreements mean that we are among the first countries to have contracts in place, and we will have a guaranteed supply of vaccine at a time when there will be significant international demand. Delivery of the vaccine is not immediate, however, as it can take a few months to develop an effective vaccine once the virus causing pandemic flu has been identified. It is important, therefore, that we obtain additional countermeasures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07112239000289">Antiviral medicines are key to our response. If they are administered quickly to all patients with symptoms, they can reduce the duration of the disease and the risk of complications. To make sure that the UK has enough of the most common antiviral, Tamiflu, we have created a stockpile to treat a quarter of the population, assuming the rate of clinical attack seen in previous pandemics and putting us on a par with measures taken in countries such as Germany and the US.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para13"><a name="07112239000290">I can tell the House today that the Government are planning to double the stock of antivirals, to cover at least half the population. We will continue to keep the level of stock under review in light of the scientific evidence, as we develop our business case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para14"><a name="07112239000291">The World Health Organisation has recommended that, in the event of a pandemic, antibiotics will be needed to prevent and treat the secondary bacterial infections that are likely to be the main cause of complications and deaths. Recommendations for the use of antibiotics are included in clinical management guidelines published recently by two medical journals, <i> Thorax</i> and the <i> Journal of Infection</i>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para15"><a name="07112239000292">The Government plan to procure 14.7 million treatment courses of antibiotics to treat and prevent the complications arising from pandemic flu. That stockpile will enable us to give antibiotics to vulnerable symptomatic flu patients, such as those with chronic conditions and the elderly, in advance of the development of secondary complications, and to treat others in the community if they develop complications. The antibiotics will also be used in hospitals to treat the sickest patients and may reduce the length of hospitalisation. The procurement of both antivirals and antibiotics will be subject to emerging scientific evidence and to normal commercial procurement procedures to ensure that we purchase those products at the best price, and achieve value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para16"><a name="07112239000293">Maintaining the resilience of the NHS and social care will be critical. We must ensure that essential NHS and social care workers on the front line, caring for people with influenza, are protected. The World Health Organisation advises that health workers should wear face masks when caring for patients with influenza and use disposable respirators when carrying out clinical procedures likely to generate fine droplets from infected patients. The Government plan to purchase about 34 million disposable respirators and about 350 million surgical face masks for the use of health and social care workers in the event of a pandemic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para17"><a name="07112239000294">Although the available medical evidence does not support the use of face masks in all settings, I recognise that people may want to have access to face masks for their personal use. The Government will explore the approach that retailers are planning to adopt when stocking face masks for sale to the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para18"><a name="07112239000295">Pre-pandemic vaccine is the only clinical countermeasure that can be used before the onset of the pandemic, but its success will depend on how much protection it gives against the actual pandemic virus, which is, of course, unknown until it strikes. The Government have a stockpile of 3.3 million doses of H5N1 pre-pandemic vaccine for health care workers. Its purchase in 2006 was an important step, designed primarily to support the health care response to the pandemic. The science underpinning the further development and potential use of pre-pandemic vaccine is cutting-edge and has just been reviewed by UK and international experts. We are actively considering their findings, and the implications for our policy, to inform future decisions, and I will update the House on any developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para19"><a name="07112239000296">The preparedness strategy for pandemic influenza represents a significant investment. In assessing the options, we will ensure that value for money is balanced with the need to be certain that the UK is properly prepared. The significant progress we have made in protecting the UK has been recognised internationally,  <br>

<p><a name="st_o187"><a name="07112239000300"><a name="71122-0006.htm_spnew14"><a name="07112239001161"><b>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b>
 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for advance notice of the statement and for the opportunity briefly to look at the national framework document published today. Although originally Ministers said that it would be published last January, I welcome its publication and the further measures that the Secretary of State announced, including the acquisition of a stockpile of face masks. He will recall that it is just over two years since we first asked his predecessor to do that. It has taken that long, but we hope the stockpile will be in place before any threatened pandemic eventuates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para23"><a name="07112239000301">I welcome, too, the Secretary of State&#146;s announcement of &#163;10 million for additional support for NHS planning. It is important that the work be done, and at present primary care trusts cannot allocate additional resources for it. The &#163;2 million for the World Health Organisation is also welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para24"><a name="07112239000302">On finance, the Scottish Executive made it clear in a recent document that this year they expect to spend &#163;5 million on pandemic preparations. From that, I deduce that the Secretary of State in England is probably expecting to spend about &#163;50 million this year. Will he confirm that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para25"><a name="07112239000303">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his remarks about the constructive engagement that began under his predecessor. I look forward to further discussions. He has responded today to some of the concerns I raised in our correspondence and I am grateful for that. None the less, I have a few specific questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="71122-0006.htm_para26"><a name="07112239000304">The Secretary of State made it clear that he is responding to scientific advice from the Department&#146;s scientific advisory group. He will be aware that the group looked at one model whose effect would have been such that even if one of the component interventions was ineffective it would none the less be possible to meet the targeted strategy, but the group noted that</p>
<a name="71122-0006.htm_brev1"><a name="07112239000862"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the impact of this combination is such that only localised outbreaks of seasonal flu proportions would be expected with all interventions effective&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para0"><a name="07112239000305">The scientific advisory group is modelling for an extremely effective countermeasures strategy, but within that there is not just a 50 per cent. antiviral stockpile, but a 75 per cent. antiviral stockpile. Although the Secretary of State says that he is not at the moment making any proposal for a pre-pandemic vaccine, the countermeasures contemplated in that model by the scientific advisory group include a 100 per cent. pre-pandemic vaccination. So will he undertake to consider in those discussions whether that is a viable model to allow further countermeasures to be put in place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07112239000306">On a pre-pandemic vaccine, the 3.3 million doses of H5N1 that we have in hand were bought not only for possible use with health care workers, but for research. The Secretary of State knows that he cannot explain why they have not been used for any research, but research into H5N1, other vaccines and, indeed, vaccine technology is a vital part of our long-term preparations. Even if a pandemic does not occur in the next year or two or three&#151;if it is 10 years hence&#151;the efforts that we take now to improve vaccine technology so that we have cell-based or even DNA vaccines to respond much more quickly to a pandemic could be something for which we will be extraordinarily grateful in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07112239000307">The Secretary of State is still buying antivirals on the basis of treatment only. Will he undertake further to consider prophylaxis, particularly household prophylaxis, for antivirals and the acquisition of a stockpile for that purpose? Will he tell the House whether he has considered the threat of resistance developing to Tamiflu and whether he contemplates any subsidiary stockpile of Relenza, for example, for that purpose?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07112239000308">The framework document is very limited in its response on critical care beds. It is quite clear from work done by the Intensive Care Society two years ago that our critical care capacity will be overwhelmed in the event of a pandemic. It called for a doubling or a tripling of critical care capacity. What steps has the Secretary of State already put in place to expand critical care?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para4"><a name="07112239000309">On school closures, the framework still pretty much says, &#147;We&#146;ll see where we get to, and then the Government will issue advice.&#148; Did not Operation Winter Willow, if it was realistic, suggest that the Government will not be in a position to decide whether schools close in a severe pandemic? Parents will keep their children at home. Schools will close. Large numbers of health care workers and others will be at home, looking after their children. We must have a strategy in place that understands human behaviour in circumstances where the pandemic is severe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07112239000310">Are the Government considering following the example set by the American Government of having not only WHO alert status, but their own view of the relative severity of a pandemic to guide the selection of countermeasures? It is certainly true that schools in America have already sent guidance to parents about what would happen at their school in the event of a pandemic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07112239000311">I am sure that what the Secretary of State said about the WHO and developing countries is very welcome, but he will know, and the House should understand, that if there is a pandemic with a high case fatality rate and as many millions of people in developing countries are immune-compromised as a result of HIV/AIDS, the  <br>

potential threat worldwide is dramatic. So it is increasingly important that, for example, the Department for International Development and the Department of Health jointly work on trying to support contingency planning and countermeasures in some of those developing countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07112239000312">People often say, &#147;We had BSE. We had SARS. We&#146;ve had one scare after another. Isn&#146;t this just another scare?&#148; Frankly, it has never been my view, as the Secretary of State knows, that this is just another scare. We had three pandemics in the last century. The characteristics of this one, with H5N1 persisting in the bird population alongside large numbers of humans, are probably more like those of 1918. The case fatality rate in 1918 was 2.5 per cent. This is a severe pandemic. It might not happen in the next few years, but it will happen at some point. Therefore, the measures that we take, as an insurance premium, remain modest in relation to the dreadful consequences of suffering from a pandemic on that scale, without those countermeasures being in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07112239000313">I have no doubt that Britain remains among those who are best equipped and have some of the best planning in place, but so we should be. I hope that we will be an exemplar to other countries, both in how we respond here to a pandemic and in how we support others, particularly the least developed countries.</p>

 I very much welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constructive remarks. To pick up some of the issues, first, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department for Transport said, when a Health Minister, that we would have a report ready in January. In essence, having the framework available now has allowed us to take full cognisance of Operation Winter Willow and to take into account the responses, because we had a closing date of 16 May for people to respond to the lessons that were learned. So the framework is better for the short delay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para9"><a name="07112239000315">The hon. Gentleman asks about the amount being spent, but may I give a hazard warning? I am perfectly willing to answer all questions on how much we spend on antivirals, antibiotics and so on after we have clinched a deal. The problem with our talking about the amount that we plan to spend is that it hampers our ability to get a good commercial deal. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the advance supply agreements, for instance, cost &#163;155.4 million over four years and the amount that we spent on H5N1 was &#163;33.4 million, but I am reluctant to give the global figures for the stocks that we are due to negotiate on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07112239000316">The hon. Gentleman mentions the scientific advisory group&#146;s option about 75 per cent. coverage. He is absolutely right that that was an option. The question is whether that is a viable model, and the scientists are still discussing the answer and whether we can use the antiviral for prophylaxis, because that very important issue is still subject to emerging science.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para11"><a name="07112239000317">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about using H5N1 vaccine for research. He knows that I said in a frank piece of correspondence with him earlier this year that I did not know why it was not being used for research, but we can discuss why we cannot use that for greater research when we have the scientists in front of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para12"><a name="07112239000318">Work is going on to look at Relenza, because of some evidence that people might become resistant to Tamiflu and because it is advisable to have two drugs available. At the moment, Tamiflu is the only one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para13"><a name="07112239000319">On critical care capacity, when the hon. Gentleman sees the surge capacity guidance, he will realise that we spend a great deal of time considering how we can deal cost-effectively with a surge that is likely to arise from a pandemic, and critical care is obviously a factor of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para14"><a name="07112239000320">On school closures, I had some wise advice from my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), who told me that when he was at school in 1957, during the Asian flu outbreak, the school was closed down. It is good to have such distinguished, wise and elderly colleagues in Cabinet to tell us about such things. Essentially, we believe that the best thing that can possibly happen is that anyone who has symptoms of pandemic flu goes home and stays there; they should not go anywhere where they might spread it. That is why we now say in the guidance that there has been a change in the assessment programme for antiviral access, for instance, for children under seven. Previously, the guidance said that they should be initially seen by a GP. We now think that we can deal with that through the national flu line service, thus avoiding parents having to take ill children to doctors&#146; surgeries, where we could get a greater spread.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para15"><a name="07112239000321">The other very important point that the hon. Gentleman makes is about the need for international co-operation, particularly in relation to HIV/AIDS and having DFID, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and our Department working together. We do that through the WHO, and it is a very important part of the partnership approach to the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para16"><a name="07112239000322">Finally, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right in saying that this is not another scare. It is very important to reassure the public that we are not making this statement on the framework because there is an impending outbreak of pandemic flu; we are doing so because there were no national plans in 1968 for Hong Kong flu, which was the last outbreak, when we just fudged everything and got through as best we could. We need to have these plans. The hon. Gentleman is right that there will be an outbreak of pandemic flu&#151;it is not a question of if, but a question of when&#151;and it is right that this country is properly prepared.</p>

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his early contact today to alert me to the statement and for early sight of the statement itself. He and the Minister responsible for public health have my reassurance that I am keen to co-operate fully on the process and look forward to hearing further about arrangements to meet with scientists and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para17"><a name="07112239000324">The statement comes just a fortnight after the outbreak of avian flu in my part of the world, in Suffolk. I fully understand that, as the Secretary of State made clear, there is not any fear of an imminent outbreak, but I guess that he would agree that we have been given a timely reminder of the absolute importance of getting a robust framework in place without delay.</p>

of strain in terms of capacity, in relation to both health and social care, in a state to cope with a pandemic flu outbreak? Is there a need to look further at whether to increase capacity in the NHS and social care?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para19"><a name="07112239000326">On international action, I note that the Secretary of State made it clear that the UK is ahead of the game. That is good to hear. However, presumably it is important, in terms of our own interests, quite apart from the interests of others, to promote effective action across Europe&#151;quite apart from globally. What co-ordinating work is taking place with other European countries to ensure that they get their plans in place effectively? A report from the WHO found that less than half of the EU countries surveyed provided defined plans for the distribution of antivirals or specific guidance on where vaccines would be stored, how they would be distributed and who would administer them. Two thirds of national plans depart from WHO guidelines on the crucial step of limiting people&#146;s movements from affected to unaffected areas. What is the Secretary of State doing to ensure that the whole of Europe responds effectively and in accordance with WHO guidelines?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para20"><a name="07112239000327">In December 2005, the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee issued a report that questioned whether the Department of Health could provide strong enough leadership in the event of a flu pandemic. It recommended the appointment of a Cabinet-level Minister, who would be responsible for co-ordinating implementation of a framework plan if there was a pandemic. Has that been considered, or is it under consideration currently? Is the Secretary of State happy that there is sufficient co-ordination with other Departments, and also, critically, with local government and public agencies? Reference has been made to the provision of resources to help the planning process. Does local government have sufficient resources to plan effectively in co-ordination with national Government?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para21"><a name="07112239000328">Finally, on the time scale, can the Secretary of State give some indication of when the meetings in which the Conservative spokesman and I are to be involved are likely to take place, and when he hopes to get a final framework in place? We are all agreed that that is of the utmost importance and we all have a shared objective to get it in place as soon as possible.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his constructive approach to the issue. He mentioned H5N1 in Norfolk. I know that he knows the medical advice, but it is probably as well if I read into the record the fact that H5N1 is predominantly an infectious disease of birds and that there is very little evidence of widespread human infection thus far, just as there is very little evidence of the kind of easy person-to-person transmission required to cause a human flu pandemic. However, H5N1 is a potential seedbed for the emergence of such a virus, which is why poultry workers in his constituency have been given the vaccine for H5N1 and offered regular seasonal flu jabs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para22"><a name="07112239000330">The hon. Gentleman asked whether the NHS will be able to cope. Yes, we are sure that it will. It will be able to cope much better for having gone through the national simulation project, Winter Willow, earlier in the year. We keep the situation constantly under review.

events such as the floods in Gloucester and my area recently. The situation, once the pandemic strikes, will of course be on a far bigger scale. However, all the evidence is that the NHS is ready to step up to the mark in these situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para23"><a name="07112239000331">The hon. Gentleman asked about effective action across the EU. He is right that there is a necessity for that. The Minister of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South, hosted a conference in July of other European member states, and there was a discussion through the WHO in Washington recently, which included most European Union member states. We are all interdependent in the European Union, which is an important reason why the EU can give a focus to dealing with a pandemic. If the EU did not exist, we could not have that kind of cross-country co-operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para24"><a name="07112239000332">The co-ordination in this country would take place through Cobra, chaired by the Prime Minister. The hon. Gentleman asked about co-ordination with public agencies. Gold command was another example of public agencies working together very well, in terms of both the security threat and the recent floods. I have absolutely no doubt that public agencies will be able to cope in the event of a flu pandemic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="71122-0007.htm_para25"><a name="07112239000333">Finally, the hon. Gentleman asked when we should have the meeting with my right hon. Friend the Minister of State and the experts and scientists. That should take place as soon as possible. I was talking to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire earlier. Perhaps we should organise a Hansard Society debate on the issue so that we can have all the available experts participating, as well as having important debates in the Chamber.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for an excellent statement. I am sure that the entire country will be pleased to hear that not only is Britain more prepared than any other country in Europe, but we are more prepared than we ever have been. The most effective and likely way of dealing with pandemic flu is the development of an effective vaccine. There are two problems with that. First, we have to develop the vaccine when we have the virus, and therefore we cannot do it yet. The second big problem is capacity for production. The biggest bottleneck we have is that, when there is a vaccine available, it will take some time to produce enough doses. What discussions has the Secretary of State had with vaccine manufacturers to ensure that there is enough mothballed capacity in the vaccine manufacturing industry in Europe and across the world to ensure that we get enough doses quickly enough when the vaccine is developed?</p>

 My hon. Friend raises a crucial point. That was an essential element of our negotiation of the advance supply agreement. We have the agreement with two companies: Baxter&#146;s and GSK. Part of that is to ensure that we get the proper level of supply, and to ensure that, in the event of an outbreak of a pandemic, the country that the vaccine is manufactured in ensures that it reaches this country and is not prevented from doing so by measures taken in the country of production. That is why we have insisted that the vaccine must be manufactured in the European Union and why we have  <br>

insisted on a clause stating that either the country of manufacture must have an agreement for sufficient supplies to the host country or that the companies must make that country aware of the agreement with this country. That is as far as we can go to ensure that we have the proper measures. The fact that we have the advance supply agreements in place&#151;only two or three countries have similar agreements, so we are one of the first&#151;means that we are better placed than most other countries to deal with the situation.</p>

In rural areas, such as the area where I live, there tends to be a good neighbourhood policy in any event, particularly in relation to elderly people and those who live alone. One of the loneliest places, from my experience, is a city with a population of millions. People may live in a block of flats but still not talk to anybody on a day-to-day basis. Perhaps advice could be given that, particularly in the lead-up to what could be an outbreak of a flu pandemic, people should be good neighbours, look more carefully at people who live around them, and provide guidance and lifts to pharmacies or GPs.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an important point, and guidance is an essential element. We are saying that if a person has any symptoms of the flu, they should go home. For the vast majority of the population, a flu pandemic will mean a couple of days in bed, and then they will be fine. The essential thing is that they do not spread the disease, so we advise them to stay at home.</p>

A person with symptoms should not go to the pharmacy to collect their drugs, as they are likely to spread the illness. They should stay at home, and a friend, member of the family or colleague will go to the pharmacy for them, collect the antiviral, which is taken in tablet form, and take it home to them.</p>

We saw it in the floods, and we see it every time there is an emergency. People are good at ensuring that they do as much for their community as possible. There can be a problem with ensuring that proper advice is given to people in isolated rural communities, who sometimes do not see a human face from one week to the next. We have to make sure that if they do not have relatives or friends nearby, someone is there and is responsible for ensuring that they receive the proper antiviral.</p>

 As has been said, effective pre- and post-pandemic vaccinations are likely to be the most important tools for limiting the severity of an outbreak. The speed at which vaccines are developed is very important. It depends greatly on international surveillance to identify any emerging pandemic, including perhaps in less developed countries that do not have the facilities. What support are our Government giving to worldwide surveillance, so that we can identify any potential pandemic?</p>

 We are completely supporting the World Health Organisation&#146;s attempts to ensure that that takes place. I have announced the extra &#163;2 million that we are providing to ensure vaccination in developing countries. We are better placed than we were when previous pandemics broke out, as there is closer collaboration with other countries and better communications. That can mean that the pandemic spreads more widely, more quickly, so it is a double-edged sword. Surveillance, the necessity of concentrating on tackling an outbreak wherever it is in the world, and ensuring that the outbreak is an epidemic, not a pandemic, are central features of trying to protect the British public.</p>

 I declare a personal interest, as my wife is a director of public health. I first questioned the attack and fatality rates in the Department&#146;s assumptions last July, so I very much welcome a fresh look at those assumptions. Why is the Government&#146;s worst-case fatality rate still only 2.5 per cent., given that among humans catching the avian variant the fatality rate is in excess of 50 per cent., and given that the Department has accepted that there are no comparable statistics for the precursors of earlier epidemics? Secondly, will the Secretary of State work with Ministers in the Department for International Development to increase production capacity in south-east Asia for pre-pandemic antiviral treatment, which might help to suppress an outbreak at source and increase global capacity for antiviral production?</p>

 All I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that we are following the best scientific advice, which is still that the upper level for deaths will be 2.5 per cent. of those affected by the pandemic. That remains the case, and that is the reasonable worst-case scenario. To take absolute precautions on the reasonable worst-case scenario, and ensure that we have what we call defence in-depth, we should move from 25 per cent. coverage to at least 50 per cent. coverage. The scientific advice is very much with us on that. The mortality rate remains 2.5 per cent. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman speak  <br>

 Inner-city communities such as mine are characterised by very high population turnover&#151;we have 30 per cent. change on the electoral register&#151;high diversity, and a very low proportion of registration with GPs. That feeds through into relatively low screening and immunisation rates across the board. That is bad enough for measles, mumps and rubella and cervical cancer; it could be catastrophic in the circumstances that we are talking about. Will my right hon. Friend assure me that he is liaising with primary care trusts, hospital trusts and local authority organisations to deal with the particular pressures on inner-city communities, where people are not registered with GPs? There is also the issue of casualised workers who do not have sick pay entitlement; we need to have a dialogue with employers, to encourage them to ensure that employees take time off when symptoms occur.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to say that that co-ordination is essential. Our plan is for the national flu line service, run by NHS Direct, to be the first port of call. GPs&#146; surgeries, and hospitals in particular, should be left for the most serious cases. Our plan is that people ring an easily accessible number and explain their symptoms. The national flu line service can then ensure that there is a supply of antivirals ready to be picked up from a supply depot. The flu friend I have talked about would then go and collect it for them. In the vast majority of cases, there will be no need to go to a GP&#146;s practice. We have to make sure that people understand that, and understand the arrangements that are in place, so that when there is a pandemic outbreak, the national health service and GPs&#146; surgeries are not inundated with people who are there because they think that the GP may be able to do something for them, when we have plans in place to ensure that antivirals can be distributed without the GP being involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="71122-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07112239000357">It is important to avoid a gap between the first and second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol. For that reason, we need to secure agreement by the end of 2009. Apart from the need to avoid such a gap, it is important that Parliaments and legislatures have time to scrutinise agreements, and perhaps even more important that businesses and organisations, particularly the energy industry, have time to put their policies into place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="71122-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07112239000358">I draw the attention of the House to the statement that we published on Monday setting out the approach that the Government believe should underpin a post-2012 framework for international action. There are four key principles. First, the post-2012 regime must fit the scale of the challenge. To avoid the dangerous impacts of climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions must peak within 10 to 15 years and fall by at least 50 per cent. by 2050.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="71122-0008.htm_para4"><a name="07112239000359">Secondly, the agreement must be fully effective, involving all countries with significant emissions. For that to be real, the Government believe that a truly global carbon market needs to develop, because putting a price on carbon is essential to incentivise new investment in energy efficiency and clean energy sources, not just for the developed world but for the developing world as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="71122-0008.htm_para5"><a name="07112239000360">The third principle is that of fairness. Developed countries such as ours have the greatest responsibility and the greatest capacity to reduce emissions. The larger emerging economies, however, also need to adopt new commitments that reflect their growth and pace of progress, ensuring that their future prosperity goes hand in hand with environmentally and economically sustainable development. Fairness also demands that richer countries play their part to support developing countries as they make the transition to clean energy technologies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="71122-0008.htm_para6"><a name="07112239000361">The fourth principle is that a post-2012 agreement must be comprehensive, addressing emissions from energy at the same time as controlling emissions from land use and, as I said to the Forestry Commission yesterday, deforestation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o209"><a name="07112239000362"><a name="71122-0008.htm_spnew8"><a name="07112239001183"><b>Mr. David Kidney (Stafford) (Lab):</b>
 With reference to fairness between the developed world and the developing world, will my hon. Friend say a little about the Government&#146;s attitude towards the transfer of know-how, technology and funding from the developed to the developing world without opening up a loophole in a future binding agreement, so that we do not all buy credits in other parts of the world for schemes that should have been undertaken by another route anyway, as part of meeting our own obligation?</p>

 My hon. Friend identifies a crucial point. Our responsibility to the developing world requires a binding commitment on ourselves and other developed countries in agreement to contribute&#151;I was about to say more than our fair share, but it is not more than our fair share because, historically, we have that responsibility. Carbon markets and offsetting can help the technological transfer that my hon. Friend calls for, but it is crucial that we avoid the outcome that he is concerned about.</p>

 I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s assurance that he will visit my constituency to speak to the Bury climate change coalition in the near future, and I look forward to agreeing a date for that visit with his office. Before we leave the topic of the carbon market, will he look again at the question of the cap on the number of credits that the Government could buy through the carbon market as a means of securing their CO2 emission targets? The response to the pre-legislative scrutiny is not strong enough on that point&#151;the Government suggested that there should be no limit to the number of credits that could be purchased.</p>

The Climate Change Bill will soon be debated in the other place and I look forward to the advice of the other place on the point that my hon. Friend makes.

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="71122-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07112239000372">The fourth principle is that the agreement must be comprehensive. It must address emissions from energy at the same time as controlling emissions from land use and deforestation. Following the preparatory committee meeting in Indonesia, I am much more optimistic that forestry and deforestation can be included within the framework conversations. There has been positive movement on that issue, although one must be cautious. All significant sources and gases must be included, not just CO2. Aviation and shipping are crucial international industries, which must be covered by a long-term framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="71122-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07112239000373">As all our constituents tell us, the UK cannot tackle climate change alone, but we believe that we are showing strong leadership by taking action domestically to reduce our emissions. We are on course to meet our Kyoto targets. That target matters above all the others and we are making good progress. There is an important message that the United Kingdom and other countries are taking around the world. We have been able to show that economic growth and increased prosperity for our peoples  <br>

are possible while cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The fear of the developing world and of many individuals is that that decoupling is not possible. The United Kingdom is in a strong position. The Climate Change Bill, introduced to Parliament last week, is the first of its kind in the world. Through domestic and international action, it will enact our target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 60 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2050. In his speech earlier this week, the Prime Minister outlined detailed measures for moving forward on that policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="71122-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07112239000374">We will continue to take significant steps to reduce major emissions and improve the lowest hanging fruit, which is energy efficiency&#151;in our homes, businesses and public sector organisations. We will promote better information and make it easy for the public to act. All the evidence from the Act on CO2 campaign shows that the public are willing to take action, and our job is to put the structures and processes in place so that that can happen. That is why we have announced that homes will have access to a one-stop green homes service, which will provide high-quality, independent advice on energy efficiency, microgeneration, transport, water, waste and related issues.</p>

The Government have chronically underfunded, and are now scrapping, the farce that is the low-carbon buildings programme, causing huge problems for the microgeneration industry. They have underspent, cut and then redirected budget commitments for energy efficiency and failed to support plans to build the world&#146;s first carbon capture and storage power station in Peterhead, Scotland, opting instead for yet another  <br>

The Government had already committed to end fuel poverty, take action on low-energy light bulbs, build zero-carbon homes from 2016 and launch a competition to build a commercial carbon capture and storage project in Britain. The most groundbreaking proposal on Monday may have been the Prime Minister&#146;s move to eliminate plastic shopping bags, but even that is to go to a forum for discussion before anything is done.

I ask the House to keep in mind the following facts: despite all the talk, UK carbon emissions are still higher today than when the Labour Government took office 10 years ago; the downward trajectory is barely noticeable. This morning, perhaps mindful of the irony of the fact that we were to have this debate, the Government snuck out a written statement announcing that they intend to expand massively Heathrow airport, without so much as a mention of climate change or carbon emissions in the consultation process. The Bali conference is only weeks away, and Britain will no longer be visiting in a position of global leadership on climate change.</p>

 The climate change levy is a very inefficient tool: like a lot of things that come from new Labour, it is a great brand but poor in its effects.

What Britain needs is dynamic industrial change&#151;change that is urgent, ambitious, clear and focused on the long term. The Prime Minister is right to join us in talking about the advent of a new industrial revolution and the opportunities that that could present, but the current pedestrian pace of change is not commensurate with the urgency of the challenge. Conservatives understand the changes that we need to make and the path that we need to take to meet this enormous challenge, but we also recognise the huge economic opportunity for Britain that this could offer. Over the next decade, UK plc has a real opportunity to lead the world. Conservative Members are not pessimists.

That is why we propose bold policies such as the introduction of feed-in tariffs for microgeneration, which are working well in Europe, the replacement of the ineffective climate change levy with a focused carbon levy, and the introduction of a waste heat levy to incentivise combined heat and power and drive innovation in the energy sector&#151;and let us not forget the reform of air passenger duty, which would move tax from the individual passenger to the efficiency of the aircraft. There is much more to come from the Conservatives, all of which will be aimed at ensuring that British business is sent clear, long-term market signals from the earliest possible date and that the long-term cost of carbon becomes embedded in economic decision making.</p>

We look forward to working constructively on a cross-party basis to enhance and strengthen it when it begins its passage through the House of Lords next week. However, we must all acknowledge that it is only a framework; it cannot deliver a low-carbon economy on its own. Without coherent, joined-up and ambitious policy to underpin it, it will be little more than an effective way to keep track of the Government&#146;s failure.

On Monday, the Prime Minister finally acknowledged that all the latest science says that an emissions reduction target of up to 80 per cent. is necessary to keep warming within the 2° target. Conservatives strongly believe that scientists, not politicians, should drive those targets. He also seemed to acknowledge his awareness that there is a flaw in how the Bill proposes to deal with raising its current reduction target of a minimum of 60 per cent. The Government are to ask the independent committee on climate change to revisit the 60 per cent. minimum target and report back with its recommendations in 2009. However, the committee will set the first 15 years of carbon budgets in 2008&#151;a year before we know what the new reduction target will be. That is nonsensical. It is vital for British business to know the targets now, before we map out how we achieve them.</p>

Any other route would not provide the clear, credible and long-term signal that business so badly wants from the Bill. Moreover, we firmly believe that the committee is insufficiently independent. Its remit is too broad and vulnerable to political influence. Its recommendations must be driven and informed by the science.</p>

 I wish the hon. Gentleman well on his visit to Bali. I was in India not so long ago. It has huge poverty, and it is a developing country. We cannot tell countries such as India, or the poorest parts of China, that they cannot develop. We want to ensure that they are able to grow in the most environmentally friendly ways possible. Developed countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America can help by sharing our technology with those countries.

 I absolutely agree with that. There are two further points. We should also bear it in mind that if we want them to grow, we will have to allow them a degree of increase in their carbon emissions. We allowed ourselves that luxury. I hope that it would not be on the same scale as ours, but the only way to ensure that is to make our cuts even deeper. We also need technology transfer mechanisms. One of the possibilities that we ought to consider is the way in which the World Bank is funding fossil fuel developments.

consider that factor, I hope that we will note that our targets have to be much higher&#151;probably beyond the 80 per cent. that has already been mentioned this afternoon. That is a worrying development, but we have to take it into account if we are to achieve the first principle set out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>

It has shown that to have a 30 per cent. chance of avoiding dangerous climate change, the UK&#146;s 50-year budget between 2000 and 2050 has to be fixed at about 4.8 gigatonnes of CO2. It also has shown that between 2000 and 2006, the UK emitted 1.2 gigatonnes of CO2, so we have already used one quarter of the budget available to us, based on our current understanding of what must be done. That shows the severity of the situation. Based on those figures, to have a 30 per cent. chance of avoiding dangerous climate change, the cuts in our emissions we need to insist on after 2012 could be as much as 9 per cent. per annum. That goes well beyond anything anyone has asked for before.</p>

Markets are seen as the greatest mechanism to deliver cost-effective reductions in carbon emissions, and we have to focus hard on how successful they will be, and on whether we should not put too much faith in them. It is quite right that low-cost options should be explored first&#151;they are the low-hanging fruit, and the biggest reductions can come that way&#151;but the history of the markets to date shows a great deal of volatility in prices for carbon. It is now back at over &#8364;20 in the emissions trading scheme, having gone down to zero at one point.</p>

If we are always going to focus on the cheapest price of carbon, we will price out some of the long-term, perhaps more expensive, things that we need to do&#151;alternative energy systems that are quite expensive to get up and running. We need to recognise what Stern said about carbon pricing: we cannot rely on markets alone to set the price. We have to do a range of other things to ensure that we do the right thing. To a great extent, we will need renewable technologies.</p>

It needs to stop funding fossil fuels immediately, and we should invest more heavily in renewables. We should follow the example of Germany and examine successful schemes, such as the feed-in tariff. There are arguments about the level at which it can be applied, but we ought to be open to such ideas, and not over- defensive about measures we have in place already. Those are working to a certain extent, but if we compare the way in which the German feed-in tariff works with the way in which the renewables obligation works, we find that the feed-in tariff delivers renewable electricity about 2 euro cents cheaper per kilowatt-hour than our own system. We should be open to new ideas. It would be an example of leadership in Bali to say that we are not going to hunker down and be protective about what we have done. We have to be open and co-operative if the Bali process is going to work.</p>

 It is the first Bill introduced into any national legislature with binding targets designed to limit and then slash national carbon emissions. Although its target of a 60 per cent. cut by 2050 is not nearly high enough for my liking, it is certainly ambitious, and its sponsors deserve praise for their political courage, their foresight and their willingness to tackle one of the most important challenges facing the world today. So, perhaps the Government will take the earliest opportunity to congratulate Senators Richard Warner of Virginia and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut on the American Climate Security Bill, which they introduced into Congress on 18 October. Yes folks, we have faffed around for so long with our Climate Change Bill that despite the fact that Friends of the Earth launched its &#147;big ask&#148; campaign in May 2005 we risk being overtaken by George Bush&#146;s America, of all places.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I do not think that it is fair to say that we faffed around. We used pre-legislative scrutiny, for which the Liberal Democrats have always asked. Of course, it is the period of the enactment of our Bill that counts. It is important to recognise the efforts of those in the US Senate who have made similar proposals. The Foreign Office has been involved in debates with the White House, the Senate and the Congress on those points. I acknowledge the importance of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.</p>

 I am pleased by the Minister&#146;s response. Al Gore and other climate change campaigners have achieved a remarkable turnaround in American public opinion, but the oil man in the White House still has his head in the sand and his boots in the air. The British Government and the EU need to apply whatever pressure they can to ensure that the Lieberman-Warner Bill is passed.</p>

I have never heard an adequate reply from Ministers. What can be done about those countries that do not or will not put a cost on carbon in their economies and seek a short-term competitive advantage in mobile industries, such as the aluminium industry? We might see a flight from stricter carbon regimes, thereby making the situation worse in such industries rather than better.</p>

Transport is the only sector of the economy in which emissions seem set to keep rising, and aviation is by far the worst offender per mile. It has more than doubled its emissions since 1990. Richard Branson is earnestly and sincerely seeking a sustainable biofuel for use in aeroplanes, but even he is not holding his breath. In the absence of some miracle &#147;get out of jail free&#148; card, we have to contain the growth in aviation. The fact that the Government support a third runway at Heathrow and are set to allow 60,000 more flights a year on the existing runways undermines their credibility on climate change.

 Restricting carbon emissions from aviation is not the same as restricting the number of people who fly. If we were to have an efficient regime whereby more people flew in full flights, and if we were to shift taxation on to flights rather than people, we could achieve both those things. Of course, we need to work at a European level. I want the Minister to confirm that he is working with colleagues across the EU to consider restricting aviation&#146;s growth rather than its massive expansion.</p>

 I absolutely agree. The example of Eurostar, which has reduced the number of cross-channel flights, is relevant. It is important that we have a joined-up transport strategy.

 In my brief speech, I want to focus on a single point: the skills needs demanded of our society by policies such as those that we are debating. My starting point is the Prime Minister&#146;s speech to WWF on Monday. He gave resounding answers to some of the important questions. First, he does get it. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) said, the whispering campaign that suggested that the Prime Minister does not understand the urgency of climate change was completely and emphatically denied by that speech on Monday.</p>

<p><a name="st_o251"><a name="07112239000442"><a name="71122-0010.htm_spnew8"><a name="07112239001225"><b>Gregory Barker:</b>

 That is a poor point. The Prime Minister runs the country and determines every aspect of our life. He made many decisions on climate change before he made his speech last Monday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="71122-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07112239000444">Let me get on with the serious issues under consideration. The Prime Minister&#146;s second answer was that our global leadership on the matter will continue. His third answer, which followed another whispering campaign, was that we will play our full part in meeting the targets set by the EU spring Council. We should remember the ambition of the three targets of 20 per cent. by the spring Council&#151;20 per cent. increased energy efficiency, 20 per cent. of total energy from renewable energy sources and a 20 per cent. cut in carbon emissions, all of which are to be achieved by 2020. If we link those targets to our Climate Change Bill and the legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, we can see what a huge challenge we face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="71122-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07112239000445">The Prime Minister has talked about &#147;a fourth technological revolution.&#148; What kind of technologies are we talking about? What will change in our lives because of those changes? We will demand greater efficiencies in existing processes. We will need technologies that allow different processes, particularly ones that do away with carbon, so we can expect a great expansion in renewable energy industries. We will need to manage raw materials more efficiently and to make meaningful use of the imperative &#147;reduce, reuse and recycle&#148; at every turn. We will need to manage finite natural resources, including water, more efficiently.</p>

In a few years, a much larger proportion of our work force will need such skills. Let us remember the drivers for putting those technologies in place. In the Prime Minister&#146;s speech on Monday, he referred to the Climate Change Bill setting five-year budgets for three Budget periods at a time&#151;a 15-year period of assurance for those who make the decisions to invest in the right technologies. The energy Bill will reform the renewables obligation to introduce new technologies, including&#151;in the jargon of the consultation on the renewables obligation&#151;the emerging technologies. The Planning Bill will speed up infrastructure projects and the Housing and Regeneration Bill will pave the way for 3 million new homes. Let us not forget the Olympics. The drivers for the big surge in skills demand are already in place, and the Prime Minister understands that.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman invites me down a side route. I shall try to reply to his question briefly. Much of the answer lies in our country&#146;s history compared with that of Germany. We have taken the renewables obligation route rather than that of the feed-in tariff ever since the non-fossil fuel obligation. We should reconsider feed-in tariffs, especially with smart meters and microgeneration, to ensure that we get much more decentralised power in this country. I believe that the renewables obligation is a reasonable mechanism. The hon. Gentleman asked why it has failed. I believe that the reason is an inefficient planning system&#151;200 or so  <br>

Going back on our commitments in the European Union was not a whispering campaign, but a campaign by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, led by Sir Digby Jones. He should never have been taken into Government, because his record on environmental matters is appalling. To choose him as an example of business was a peculiar step.</p>

I have genuine sympathy with the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood). Of course, the Liberal Democrats need to adopt our view of getting an independent organisation to consider the figure. That would enable them to settle their problems. Some say that we should have a zero carbon figure and others say that it should be 80 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="71122-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07112239000471">Let me deal with aviation. Someone who flies at the back of the plane from London to Sydney and back again uses as much carbon as someone who uses 700,000 plastic bags. But tackling plastic bags is an easy thing to do; dealing with aviation is difficult. So I bothered to get hold of the Government&#146;s document on aviation, which the Secretary of State for Transport quite unaccountably and unacceptably did not come to present in the House. Let us look at this document. It has a covering note, which does not talk about climate change until right at the end, even though the document is about aviation. However, the covering note just says that there will be another document about climate change called &#147;UK Air Passenger Demand and CO2 Forecasts&#148;. All that is given is a list of details about the figures, with no comments about what we are going to do about them. Indeed, interestingly, there is a comment about National Air Traffic Services, but no discussion of the fact that we could reduce our emissions from air transport by 11 per cent. if we simply had a single version of NATS across the European Union, instead of being divided up as we are now. That is a simple measure that the Government do not even propose in their document.</p>

The Minister talks about the loudest possible wake-up call, but it has not woken up the Secretary of State for Transport or anyone in her Department. Then we open the pages and we read the Government&#146;s words:</p>

However, the one word that is not in the document is urgency; indeed, there is no urgency in it at all. It talks about the European trading system without mentioning any of the problems that everybody else recognises must be solved before the system can deal with aviation. One would think from the document that the problems had all been solved so easily.</p>

The document does not mention that; it just says, &#147;There&#146;re more elsewhere, so we&#146;ve got to have one.&#148; The document does not mention that nearly one quarter of the flights out of London&#146;s airports go to places that are easily reached in the same time by train. For example, what are we going to do about the 30-odd flights a day to Manchester? There is no reason to have those. There is nothing about those in the document, nor is there anything about reversing the slot pricing, so that people pay more for short-haul flights and less for long-haul flights. There are none of those creative systems that one might put forward.</p>

 It is more unreasonable for their children and grandchildren to be under water. My hon. Friend does believe in the urgency of the situation, but I am afraid that we must face it much more toughly than that. Anyway, if that issue really matters, what about a transport policy that would enable people to go by train from Manchester to Heathrow? What about a transport policy that was properly tied up? What about a transport policy that recognised that we want to get people from Scotland to London fast enough for them not to want to fly in an aeroplane? What we have got is a transport policy that accepts the nonsense of Eddington that we do not need high-speed rail.

Of course my hon. Friend is right: it is very difficult to do them. Indeed, we might have to do all kinds of things that are uncomfortable, but we should at least face up to the situation. At least let us say, &#147;We&#146;ve decided in this area we&#146;re not going to do it, because we&#146;re going to do it somewhere else.&#148; I say this to the Government: do not slide out a document but then not come here so that we can ask these questions directly of the Transport Minister. Do not produce a document that is 10 years out of date in its approach, that ignores Stern and that does not back up what the Prime Minister has already said to us. That is the problem with everything else that the Government are doing. That is why I want to press the Minister who is here today, because I am a great supporter of his. I believe that he is tough enough to fight for these issues.</p>

 I welcome this timely debate, particularly as I had the honour of serving on the Joint Committee on the draft Climate Change Bill, which is further proof of the Government&#146;s unswerving commitment to the global challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="71122-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07112239000480">Britain continues to lead the way, with innovative policies and proposals, which will lead to a measurable change in our lifestyles. The green homes service outlined in the Prime Minister&#146;s speech to the WWF will be the first nationwide, dedicated service advising people on a wide range of green issues. There is undoubtedly a desire on the part of the consumer to act more responsibly with regard to their individual carbon footprint. People wish to reduce their carbon footprint, but all too often they are not given the tools with which to measure their energy output accurately.</p>

 My exact carbon footprint for this year is being calculated. However, I bought a hybrid car recently, which has not only reduced my carbon footprint but changed my driving behaviour, because I am constantly aware of how much energy it takes when, for example, driving up a hill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="71122-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07112239000483">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has spoken about the need for people to monitor their energy output easily&#151;indeed, I have just spoken of a way in which it was made easier for me to monitor my energy output. Given the technology that we now possess, it seems archaic that the vast majority of energy consumers still operate through a metering system, which merely estimates a household&#146;s energy consumption. It is impossible through that method of billing for the individual consumer or household accurately to measure their energy output on a month-by-month basis, let alone do so day by day or hour by hour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="71122-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07112239000484">I should like to mention my constituent Derek Lickorish. Formerly the chief operations officer for EDF Energy in Hove, he has also been an advocate of smart metering  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 Nov 2007">

systems for an amazing 25 years. Mr. Lickorish has seen both the benefits and the obstacles that need to be overcome before such a system for household energy management could be installed in every home. Currently, some energy companies offer consumers the choice of installing smart meters in their homes. Although some companies have agreed to sign up to such a scheme, others have not, which means that should a household change energy supplier, the smart meter would be removed. Smart meters are also currently quite expensive.</p>

Does my hon. Friend agree with the proposal that in the meantime, before smart metering is introduced, it would be right to insist that electricity supply companies provide their customers with electricity display devices? They have already demonstrated that energy consumption is reduced if consumers can simply see how much it costs them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o273"><a name="07112239000486"><a name="71122-0011.htm_spnew13"><a name="07112239001247"><b>Ms Barlow:</b>
 I shall get on to a related point about smart boxes in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="71122-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07112239000487">In order for a smart metering system to be truly effective, it would require the co-operation of all the energy suppliers in the UK. One way to circumvent that problem would be to introduce smart boxes into our homes. They would enable an individual to trace every single light that was switched on in their house, and to measure the resulting carbon cost. For the first time, the consumer would be able to make a real, measured assessment of their household energy consumption. This is one possible alternative to smart meters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="71122-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07112239000488">Many of our leading media and internet providers have already considered introducing smart boxes that could be linked to the internet to provide solid data on our energy consumption. That would make the measuring of such data much easier. If, however, we were to opt for smart metering, the organisation required would present one of the industry&#146;s biggest challenges. The energy suppliers&#146; trade association has prepared a smart metering operational framework. However, it represents only the suppliers view. A new organisation consisting of suppliers, distribution network operators, the national grid, Ofgem and, of course, the Government would have to be set up. The involvement of communications experts and providers would also be important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="71122-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07112239000489">Legal competition issues are judged by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and by Ofgem to be preventing the creation of an understanding of a reliable and cost-effective two-way communication system from authorised parties to the metering device and from the metering device to other components of the system.</p>

make decisions and potentially reduce their consumption, thereby helping to meet the Government&#146;s aspirations for carbon reduction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="71122-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07112239000495">I agreed wholeheartedly with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister who said in his recent speech on climate change that aspiration presents a wonderful opportunity for our nation and, more importantly, for our economy. Too often, the debate on climate change revolves around what we will need to give up in order to meet our targets. This has often led the discussion down a very negative route&#151;not least today&#151;and that is counter-productive to achieving our goals. I am greatly encouraged by the Prime Minister&#146;s commitment to look again at the 60 per cent. target with a view to raising it to 80 per cent, which I would support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="71122-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07112239000496">For many, the arguments surrounding climate change are nothing more than an abstract concept with little or no bearing on their day-to-day lives. Others, however, have a genuine awareness and a willingness to modify their energy output, but the tools to enable them to do so are not always there. That is why I believe that the introduction of smart meters or smart boxes would be a major step forward in reducing our individual carbon footprints. By empowering the individual, we also create a sense of collective responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="71122-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07112239000497">It is in our nature constantly to strive to move forward and to innovate in order to reach the next level of our technological evolution. Now is the time for the Government to highlight what we as a nation, and as a planet, can gain from meeting the challenge of carbon reduction. A recent poll carried out by the BBC of 22,000 people in 21 countries found that 70 per cent. of them were prepared to change their lifestyle because of climate change. The Government need to do everything within their power to enable them to do so. We are the first country to devise a scheme for quantifying our carbon footprint. Let us now continue to lead the way by introducing a scheme that, in conjunction with the proposals already set out in the Queen&#146;s Speech and by the Prime Minister on Monday, will enable us all to measure our household energy consumption on a minute-by-minute basis. Only by measuring where we are will we know how far we have come and how far we have yet to go.</p>

I suggest to the Minister that, if the United Kingdom wants further to strengthen its leading position on climate change in international forums, the time has now come to have one Minister responsible for climate change who should have Cabinet status. I have made a list of the Departments involved in this issue: the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the Department for Transport, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Treasury, the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Foreign Office. We shall shortly also have the office for climate change and the climate change committee. All of those, and other Departments as well, will have a finger in the pie. However, as my right hon. Friend pointed out, we often find the Government going off in different directions on issues such as transport. There is therefore a real need for a single person reporting to Cabinet with that responsibility.</p>

The Select Committee strongly supported the Climate Change Bill, but we must recognise that we are already running behind time in regard to meeting the target of a 60 per cent. reduction in emissions, never mind the stronger 80 per cent. target that the Committee has advocated. The Minister should think about communicating to the country the reason why we are behind time in that way, and what our citizens, our companies and our Government need to do to play catch-up and get us back on track.</p>

It is all very well for us in the House of Commons to come up with comforting ideas on what we can do domestically and in Europe, where there is commitment to dealing with climate change, but there is no point in our doing so if the world&#146;s biggest polluter is not publicly on board. I applaud the efforts of various Senators and the state of California, and the market for emissions in the north-east of the United States, but unless the United States Government are convinced and committed, now and in the future, no amount of good international discussion will move the world forward and enable it to deal with this global phenomenon.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="71122-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07112239000523">The Bill concerns the prudent management of one of the Government&#146;s public assets, the student loan book. Before I deal with its provisions, I will briefly explain the context and why the Bill is being introduced now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="71122-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07112239000524">The Government strongly believe that talent and hard work, not social background or where a person went to school, should determine success in life. We believe that no one should be held back from realising his or her potential at university because of fears of financial hardship. That is why we have been systematically breaking down the financial barriers to higher education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="71122-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07112239000525">First, we changed the nature of student loans, linking repayments directly to graduate earnings, and started collection through straightforward payroll deduction alongside income tax and national insurance once the graduate is in work and earning. Secondly, no home full-time undergraduate studying for their first degree has to pay tuition fees before they study, because there are now loans for fees. Thirdly, we have reintroduced non-repayable maintenance grants for students from low-income backgrounds, and last July my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced a significantly enhanced new financial support package for students, under which from next year two thirds of students will be eligible for non-repayable grants. In addition, we have ensured that universities are paying out non-repayable bursaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="71122-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07112239000526">Fourthly, the package that we announced for next year offers a guarantee to those in receipt of the educational maintenance allowance that if they are receiving it at the age of 16, they will be guaranteed the amount of money they will get in student financial support when they go to university. We are also introducing for the first time the option of a loan repayment holiday of up to five years to allow flexibility and choice in repayment.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way so soon. I did not realise that he was going to introduce the debate by outlining some of the measures to be taken. What arrangements will the Government make to give part-time students the same access to loans as full-time students, and also to extend that to both further education and adult students?</p>

<p><a name="st_o288"><a name="07112239000528"><a name="71122-0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="07112239001262"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 We are introducing the adult learning grants, which give for the first time an equivalent commitment to the education maintenance allowance. I am not in the business today of making future announcements, but I will say for the record that before this Government came to power there was no financial support whatever for part-time students. We were the first Government to institute a part-time student grant, and 18 months ago we increased that by 27 per cent. We also substantially increased the access to learning fund,  <br>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on the package of measures introduced this summer, which have made a fundamental difference in the level of student support. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State deserves great credit for taking this issue up so swiftly. Does my hon. Friend agree that although this will be of huge benefit to all Members&#146; constituents, it is important to communicate the changes? What steps is my hon. Friend taking to ensure that students learn directly of the new package of measures, and also that tutors in schools and colleges are as well briefed as possible this autumn when students make their choices for next year&#146;s university entrance?</p>

<p><a name="st_o290"><a name="07112239000530"><a name="71122-0012.htm_spnew4"><a name="07112239001264"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 I can certainly give assurances on that. We have launched a major communication campaign to get across the facts about the new system, including through TV, radio and online advertising. We have also made available a DVD setting out the facts for advisers and students. It is available to Members of Parliament as well, if they wish to engage actively in this process and inform their constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="71122-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07112239000531">In terms of this substantially enhanced package, it is worth saying for the record that those who predicted that the introduction of variable fees would lead to a reduction in the number of people applying to university&#151;and particularly in the number of those from poorer backgrounds&#151;are being proved emphatically wrong. Entry to university this autumn by English students is 6 per cent. higher than last year, and a higher proportion are from poorer backgrounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="71122-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07112239000532">There is now a developing consensus in the House. The Conservative party has shifted its position from opportunistic opposition to the Government stance, which we welcome; they now support our position. Even the Liberal Democrats appear to be moving. I have always said that people should judge politicians not by what they say, but by what they do, and in government in Scotland the Liberal Democrats supported a system of postgraduate repayment that is absolutely no different in principle from the system that we have in England. I understand that they are now reviewing their position for England, and one of their think-tanks has even advocated outright support for the Government&#146;s position. Therefore, I think we are creating a settled consensus.</p>

 The Minister has eventually goaded me to my feet. He knows full well that the changes in Scotland are not the same as those in England. The loan system there is not to pay for fees, so I think he should be careful in what he says.</p>

 All I will say to the hon. Lady is that exactly the same principle of postgraduate repayment applies in England and Scotland: the former student has to pay something back once they are in work and earning. That needs to be said for the record, because in the past we have often heard from the Liberal Democrats of their opposition to fees, whereas in reality they support that principle of postgraduate repayment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="71122-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07112239000535">The Government believe these reforms, alongside increased investment in higher education and the hard work of students and educators around the country, have helped increase participation in higher education to the highest ever level in this country. I am confident that it will rise further, and that is both socially and economically imperative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="71122-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07112239000536">We should be proud of our record of breaking down the financial barriers to education and widening participation, but that also brings an interesting challenge. As participation has grown, so too has the size of the Government-owned student loan book. According to the latest figures&#151;those for the year 2006-07&#151;the English loan book was valued at &#163;18.1 billion. Of that, about &#163;17 billion was accounted for by the new income-contingent loans repaid through Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. We firmly expect that the loan book will increase appreciably in the coming years. That projected growth makes it all the more important to give careful consideration to how best we can handle this large and growing public asset. The Bill concerns how the student loan book can best be managed.</p>

 This is a rerun of the debate that took place in 1997. I am sure that the Minister will recall the first student loans portfolio Bill, and I shall ask him something that I asked then. Will he put on record, at the start of this debate, the discounted rate at which the loan will be able to be sold off? Will it be 10, 15, 20 or 25 per cent.? In other words, how much is the Treasury prepared to give away in order to get this loan portfolio off its balance sheet and on to somebody else&#146;s?</p>

 The previous sales demonstrated value for money. I shall not reveal a discount rate today, but I shall set out the value-for-money framework within which we will make those judgments. Were we to reveal the discount rate today, in what will be a competitive bidding process for people to purchase the debt, we would reveal our hand at the start of the process and fail to maximise the revenue to the public sector.</p>

 As always, the Minister is engaging with the debate, and I compliment him on that. Will he therefore give us the discount rate for the 1997 sale? That is a retrospective matter rather than one that deals with what is being planned for this sale.</p>

Having commissioned expert external advice from the financial sector, we believe that we will be able to conduct sales at a price that represents good value for money for the taxpayer. I think that we can achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="71122-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07112239000562">The idea of selling student loans is not new. The Government have successfully sold tranches of student loans in the past. In 1998 and 1999 there were two sales of the old &#147;mortgage-style&#148; student loans for a total of around &#163;2 billion. The Government believe that there will be an appetite for these assets in the marketplace in respect of the Bill, not only because of the previous sales, but because of the distinctive characteristics that make student loans an attractive purchase. The loans would provide an investor with access to a new instrument with unique characteristics, allowing them further to diversify their portfolio, and a sustained income over a long period from a group of borrowers who, when taken as a whole, are considered relatively low-risk. Those features make the student loans an attractive candidate for purchase by a wide range of potential investors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="71122-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07112239000563">All transactions will be subject to a rigorous assessment that we are achieving good value for money. In making that assessment, the Government will examine the prevailing market conditions and ensure that a competitive market for the loans has been generated. The Government will also provide the market with full information about the loan book in order that the assets can be efficiently valued. The Government will ensure that there has been a genuine transfer of risk from the public accounts to the private sector. The Government will assess the proceeds that look likely to be achieved in the transaction, using full and clear market information and a comparison with keeping the loans on their books, in terms of both likely income flows and levels of risk. As with the previous loan sales, the Government will draw on specialist advice from within Departments and from appropriate external sources. We will draw on NAO guidance in our approach to assessing value for money, and these judgments will of course rightly be subject to scrutiny by the NAO in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="71122-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07112239000564">Making a sound judgment about the timing and pricing of sales is particularly important given the recent turbulence in world credit and financial markets. It is not possible to predict the potential market conditions in the future, and the market conditions will naturally vary for different sales in a long-term programme, which is what we are talking about. Our intention is that portions of the loan book would be sold at regular intervals as part of an ongoing programme, and we will closely monitor the market so that sales can be made at the right time. Decisions will, rightly, always be informed by what provides the best value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="71122-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07112239000565">The 1998 legislation, which enabled the previous sales, has been repealed, and so cannot be amended to enable sales of income-contingent loans. We are therefore introducing this Sale of Student Loans Bill, which will allow sales to take place while protecting the interests of all borrowers regardless of whether their loan is sold or retained. I give borrowers this reassurance: purchasers of loans will not be able to charge a different rate of interest; they will not be able to change the income threshold for repayments; and they will not be able to use a borrower&#146;s personal details for any purpose beyond that which is required for management of the loans.</p>

 Clearly, Northern Rock has got into serious financial difficulties recently, as we are all aware. If a purchaser of the loan book got into serious difficulty or undertook unacceptable practices, what safeguards are there that the Government would have any control over that situation?</p>

Clause 1 allows the Government to sell some or all of our obligations relating to student loans, while retaining the power to require that purchasers administer the loans in a way that meets our requirements. Clause 2 gives the Secretary of State flexibility to include provisions in sales contracts to ensure that borrowers&#146; interests are fully protected. That means that borrowers of sold loans will be entitled to the same process of mediation to which all borrowers currently have access, further underlining the Government&#146;s commitment to ensure that all borrowers are treated equally. The next two clauses extend that principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="71122-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07112239000571">Clause 5 allows the Government to insist that the Student Loans Company continue to fulfil its current functions and remain the institution that will contact borrowers about their loans. That is important. Clause 7 explicitly confirms an existing understanding that all student loans are exempt from the terms of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 because their characteristics differ substantially from commercial loans. In Clause 8, the Bill provides powers for Welsh Ministers in respect of Wales, equivalent to those it proposes for the Secretary of State in relation to England.</p>

 As I understand it, the powers given to Ministers in the Welsh Assembly are known as mirror powers, not the framework powers usually associated with legislation such as the Bill. Mirror powers are limiting and only allow Welsh Ministers to proceed in exactly the same way as Ministers in the UK. Has the Minister received any representations about changing the mirror powers to framework powers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="71122-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07112239000574">In conclusion, when the House last considered student loans the matter was of some controversy. In contrast, this is a short and mainly technical enabling Bill, and I hope that its purpose will not be misunderstood. Its provisions have no relation to future decisions on broader student finance policy, and will have no impact on the manner in which students can obtain financial support for their time in higher education; rather, the Bill enables the Government to manage efficiently a large and growing asset, and on that basis I hope it will be supported.</p>

 I had not expected the Minister to begin his peroration with a short statement in general terms on access to higher education. As he did so, however, may I briefly say that the Conservative party and the Conservative education team in Parliament are dedicated to the principle of widening access to higher education by all means? In that regard, and to reflect the intervention of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), may I add that one of the best ways of widening access is to look at modes of learning as well as at other factors? Part-time learning, modular learning and distance learning have a vital role to play in the mission of widening access and participation. However, that might be a debate for another day, Mr. Deputy Speaker, so I shall address the matters before us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="71122-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07112239000577">We welcome the principle behind the Bill. As the Minister said, it transfers risks from the public to the private sector, but in a measured and careful way. Indeed, as the Minister and the House will know, at the last two general elections the Conservatives advocated similar plans, so it is ironic that the Minister suggests that we are imitating the Government&#151;ironic that the Government&#146;s plan for the sale of student loans appears to be on loan from the Conservative party. However, when we announced our plans, we proposed that the money raised should be used to endow universities&#151;a point to which I shall return.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="71122-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07112239000578">The Bill is short and, seemingly, straightforward, but I want to bring a number of issues to the House&#146;s attention.

 Does the hon. Gentleman not think it odd that the Minister&#146;s excellent presentation of the Bill missed out a key area&#151;what will happen to the money? Does the hon. Gentleman feel, as I do, that as the Bill is a Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills matter and the money is collected from university students, at least some proportion of it should be guaranteed for the support of higher education? That may accord with his theme on endowments, although I would not necessarily agree with that specific policy.</p>

He has already suggested that further projections have been made&#151;indeed, &#147;projections&#148; was the word that he used. It would be useful in considering the Bill if the House were to have some feel for the nature of those projections. It is true that there are commercial sensitivities, but if we are to consider the Bill with the proper diligence that the House and the hon. Members currently represented here certainly would wish us to do, we should have some sense of the notional estimates that the Government have made and that their advisers have offered. Will the Minister therefore say a little more about those projections? The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough intervened on that subject when the Minister was on his feet.</p>

What proportion of the asset do the Government estimate they will need to sell to raise &#163;6 billion? What is the expected time scale for the sale of the loan book, and what are the notional volumes? The Minister said that the Government were likely to sell the loan book off in parts, but he gave us no feel for what estimate had been made of the timetable for that or the size of the parts. Again, one appreciates that there are commercial necessities in this regard, but the House deserves a little more information than we have had thus far.</p>

However, let us be frank: there will be fears and worries about this matter among existing students, potential students, families and so on. Anything that disincentivises people who have the capacity and potential to study at university or college needs to be countered.

Are they overseas companies, international companies or domestic organisations? What is their track record? Who is likely to be involved?

 I doubt that very much, but I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Does he think that there are legitimate concerns about the possibility of secondary, or indeed tertiary, sales to indeterminate groups of people? Drawing an analogy with the collateralised debt obligations, for example, there is a real possibility that, however much the Secretary of State wishes to protect students, control of the loan book will be lost to persons unknown and highly divergent from the ones to whom it was originally sold.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right: the book is likely to be sold on. That is the nature of this kind of business. The absolute assurance that the House seeks is that nothing is likely to occur that will jeopardise the circumstances of students or institutions of higher education. It would be difficult for any Minister, of any party, to predict how the situation might pan out. The book could be sold on over a period of years.

Clause 6 extends previous legislation to allow data about borrowers that is held by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to be passed to loan purchasers, or potential purchasers. The Bill makes it clear that where information is shared with potential purchasers for the purpose of considering the purchase, details must be anonymised, but of course recent difficulties were about not theory, but practice. It may be necessary for the Minister to reflect on events and consider those details once again. I do not expect him to come up with an answer off the cuff today, but we might usefully consider the issue during the passage of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="71122-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07112239000605">In the light of recent events, I would not be surprised if we came to a conclusion that was agreeable to Members across the House to strengthen protection. That would be helpful to Government, to the House, and to people affected by the legislation. It is our intention to scrutinise closely that aspect of the Bill and, if necessary, to propose amendments, if we feel that data protection is not adequately dealt with in the measures before the House. I do not want to stray into further discussion on the loss, disclosed by the Chancellor, of the details of 25 million benefit recipients. We had a word about it earlier, and it is unfair to rub salt in the wounds; I would be the last person to do that. However, I know that the Minister will have heard the story with horror, knowing that he was coming before the House today to debate the issue before us. He will be very sensitive about it, so I expect him to offer the House and the public reassurance that he will tighten the provisions of the Bill, in the same spirit as that in which I offered to assist. We have a history of working together on legislation to best effect.</p>

can therefore assume that the receipts will swell the Consolidated Fund, as the Minister confirmed that in reply to an intervention. I am certain that he will today wish to pledge to the House that higher education will get its fair share of the windfall. He would not be sticking up for his brief and defending those over whom he has stewardship if he did not do that. I would like to hear him make that firm commitment before the end of today&#146;s proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="71122-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07112239000607">I would like the Minister to speak in a little more detail, with full technical embellishments, about the position regarding Wales. He has a bit of a record&#151;not a happy one, it has to be said&#151;when it comes to dealing with legislation relating to Wales. Some of us remember the Further Education and Training Bill. It will worry him to hear that I have already received representations about the aspects of the Bill relating to Wales, on matters that were mentioned by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams). We need to be assured that those matters have been taken fully into account. Again, we will want to scrutinise that in some detail in Committee. As the Minister will recall, procedural concerns were raised with regard to the extension of powers to the Welsh Assembly when we discussed the Further Education and Training Act 2007; that was when we last faced each other in discussions on legislation.</p>

The first occasion was when, in a damascene conversion, he accepted Conservative arguments about the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s intervention powers in further education colleges. Once again today, a Conservative idea is being embraced by the Minister. It is often suggested that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but as Adlai Stevenson once said, &#147;Flattery is all right so long as you don&#146;t inhale&#148;.</p>

 The Minister will not face much dissent and argument today. It is not as if the House is rising against him. It is clear that the Opposition spokesman, the hon.

First, we are putting a lot of bundled debt, whether that is called collateralised debt obligations or structured investment vehicles, on to a market already saturated with such debt vehicles, which were the major cause of the problems that the markets began to face in August and are still facing. The market is choked up with bundled debt which is not immediately saleable. As soon as there is a credit squeeze or restriction, the Gadarene instinct of hedge fund managers to get out is impossible to realise. In the States, therefore, funds have closed down and there have been problems in this country with that debt.</p>

It is not a good time to sell. The Minister said that he has had advice that it is saleable and will be well supported by the markets, but that reflects the self-interest of those who give the advice, who are mainly people connected with the markets, who want to see them expanded and used. I am worried on that account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="71122-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07112239000612">If the debt is sold on, there is no restriction in the Bill, as far as I can see, on the purchaser selling it on to someone else. Where will the student loan fund end up? </p>

 There is concern on that point and questions need to be answered. Financial debts are sold on the markets. Risks are sold on in markets. As it moves around the market, there is a possibility that the risk may end up within an institution that is underwritten or guaranteed by Government. It could have ended up on the books of Northern Rock, for example, in which case the taxpayer would be underwriting it. The hon. Gentleman raises an extremely important point.</p>

<p><a name="st_o333"><a name="07112239000614"><a name="71122-0014.htm_spnew6"><a name="07112239001307"><b>Mr. Mitchell:</b>
 I am grateful for the intervention. It is possible not only that the debt will end up in the assets of a fund or organisation supported by Government, but that it will end up in the assets of a fund that is on the verge of collapse. A Government permission should be necessary for the transfer of the debt once it gets on to the market, because we cannot be sure where it will end up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="71122-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07112239000615">Secondly, the measure is based purely on ideology and doctrine, according to which public debt is a bad thing and private debt is a marvellous thing. It is clear that financial markets object to public borrowing because they want the privatisation of all borrowing, as well as the privatisation of credit creation, which has happened to a large extent. There is no reason why the money should not stay on the public books. The only argument that the Government put is that it reduces the public sector borrowing requirement, but that effect is purely presentational. In the main, I would argue that public borrowing is good and private borrowing is often bad; the private debt situation has produced an enormous escalation of asset and house prices, while public debt and borrowing has produced investment and economic growth, and allowed the Government to steer the economy forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="71122-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07112239000616">The equation of public with bad and private with good is nonsense. There is no reason, ideologically, for such a transfer; there is no reason to sell the asset books. All that does is pretty up the PSBR figures. There is no guarantee that the money coming in&#151;the Minister mentioned &#163;6 billion&#151;will be used for education. The National Union of Students, and the universities, I think, say that the money should go to education. I agree, but it will not&#151;it is just going to general Government funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="71122-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07112239000617">My third point is that the private sector is not buying the debt out of sheer altruism or a love of supporting the student loans programme and getting more people into university. It is doing it for solid commercial reasons, and it will have to be paid. In the current state of the market, it will have to be paid substantially more to take up the debt than it would had the crisis of August onwards not happened. It has to be well paid for the risks.</p>

I remember that when I was a university teacher in New Zealand, there was something called the post-primary student bursary, which gave students who committed themselves to going into teaching a teacher&#146;s wage to go through university. That was a marvellous institution that encouraged people to go to university. However, when the students left university, they disappeared; many went to teach in England to relieve the crisis in education at that time&#151;this was the &#146;60s. People in raincoats from the education department used to knock on my door and ask whether I knew where student Fred Bloggs was. I knew that Fred Bloggs had gone overseas, but did I know his address? Where did his parents live? Such situations give rise to problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="71122-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07112239000619">Two years ago, I purchased a fantastic palace in Grimsby and ever since I have been plagued with telephone calls from the Student Loans Company asking about the whereabouts of a girl whose name I shall not give. She was in receipt of a student loan and, apparently, absconded. I did not know the woman. She had never lived at the house; at least, nothing on the records of previous owners indicated her name. However, she had taken out a student loan and disappeared. Considerable expenditure will be necessary to trace such people and the private sector will want to be well rewarded. We may be getting money off the public books, but we will have to pay the private sector substantially to handle it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="71122-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07112239000622">If there are problems, overseas students will be difficult to trace, assuming that they have gone back to their EU country; Turkish, Swiss and Norwegian students are also going to be eligible. All that will impose an extra cost. How will that be financed? When it takes over the loan book, will the private sector toughen up on all that, and what kind of charges will it impose on the Government for providing the services to trace people?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="71122-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07112239000623">Finally, I come to my main point, which relates to anxieties to which I am sure the Minister will respond. There is the issue of the terms of the student loans. We sensibly geared the interest rate to the retail price index as we do not want massive interest charges. That gearing has reduced the interest payable on loans throughout the long period of low inflation under this Government; indeed, it has reduced it substantially on the interest rates payable in the early 1990s under the Conservatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="71122-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07112239000624">However, inflation has gone up, although not because of anything that students have done&#151;it is all due to utility prices. The interest rate is now 4.8 per cent.&#151;double last year&#146;s 2.4 per cent. I have had calls from parents in Grimsby warning me about this and saying that it will have a disastrous effect on their daughter&#146;s or son&#146;s finances. Assuming that a student loan averages &#163;15,000, they will be paying &#163;720 a year, or &#163;60 a month, in  <br>

interest before they even begin to pay off any of the debt. That will be a monstrous burden for people starting out in life; they will start life&#146;s race with a ball and chain on their foot. I hate to think of the prospect of a student who marries a student, with two student loans merged as a double burden on that household.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="71122-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07112239000625">This burden is completely unacceptable, and it is likely to get bigger. It will put people off taking out student loans and be a burden on those with loans who are starting out in life and might want to take out a mortgage, buy furniture or a car, or want to contract other debt. We have a debt-burdened society, and we are asking students to start out in it with a big debt already trailing behind them. It is not recoverable under the tribunals and enforcement legislation that we passed in the summer. That will become a political problem for my Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="71122-0014.htm_para21"><a name="07112239000626">The Minister said that it will be up to Government to vary the terms of student loans even after they have been privatised. I am glad to hear that, because they should wipe out the interest charges. I cite the precedent of the New Zealand Labour party, which promised in its 2005 election manifesto to write off interest on student loans, as it now has. The student gets a statement at the end of the year saying that a certain amount of interest is due, but it is written off and does not have to be paid. That was enormously effective and very necessary.</p>

 Surely, even as a good socialist, the hon.

 I take that correction from a fellow socialist. Of course I do not envisage that students will put it on the money market; that is what the Government are doing, not what students will be doing. Students use the loan for living. In the previous generation before student loans existed, most students struggled with enormous overdrafts or credit card debts. I am saying that the burden of debt on students for educational purposes&#151;the prime purpose of these loans is to pay the fees&#151;should be written off, as long as they stay in this country. I do not want to extend it to people who leave this country and work elsewhere having used their degree to put themselves on an international market, as that would make the burden too heavy to bear.</p>

talking about a debt incurred by the student, which they have to bear, and with which they should be helped. Ideally, they should all qualify for means-tested fees, as my generation did. The Government say that we cannot afford that, which is probably true. We cannot afford to finance with grants some 46 per cent. of the population going on to higher education. Only 4 per cent. of my generation did, and we all got grants. I had lots of doubts about kicking away that ladder, but having kicked it away, we have to try to help the students.</p>

The total student debt of &#163;18 billion is more than the gross domestic product of Slovenia, believe it or not. It represents a millstone around the neck of each student who has graduated under this Labour Government. The truth is that we do not really know what the implications of the debt will be for a whole cohort of graduates throughout their lives. We have been engaged in what essentially amounts to a giant experiment. We do not know what effect it will have on their career choices, or on their decisions about whether to have a family, get married or buy a home.

I am pleased that the Minister denied that point on the record, but I wish that he would include it in the Bill, to reassure students who are likely to have their debts sold off in future, and graduates, who will be affected by this change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07112239000639">Graduates already face a hike in the interest rates on their loans this year. The rates have doubled to 4.8 per cent., as the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) mentioned, from 2.4 per cent. last year, due to the slightly bizarre way in which the Government calculate interest rates for student loans. It is not just that they use an entirely different inflation figure for students from the one they use for other purposes, but the rate is not even averaged over the year. It is set arbitrarily on the basis of one month in March. If that month happens to be one in which oil prices are running high, and there are hikes in utility bills, for the rest of that year students will pay the cost in their interest rates. Students are concerned that this is the beginning of a domino effect. They saw fees, then top-up fees&#151;and may assume the raising of the cap&#151;and then the introduction of commercial interest rates. They would welcome the sort of assurance that I mentioned&#151;the Minister including something clearly in the Bill to demonstrate the Government&#146;s future intentions. They can always amend it later. We have seen plenty of amending legislation from the Government in the past 10 years.</p>

It is merely a short-term tactic to raise immediate revenue for the Treasury and to offload risk on to someone else. If we are to accept the Government&#146;s argument about offloading risk, are we sure that anyone would want to buy the student loan book? The loans are riskier than the mortgage-style loans that were sold, and it takes longer to pay them off. They were income contingent, so if income levels drop the loan repayments will dry up. Any investor would be gambling on the future of England&#146;s economy.</p>

 The hon. Lady and I broadly agree, but she is on slightly shaky ground with her last point. I suspect that the opposite is true. The loans would be a relatively secure product to buy. The risk is spread widely and the record of defaulting is small. I would think that they would be an attractive proposition. However, the hon. Lady made a good point about when they will be sold, to whom, on what time scale and in what chunks.</p>

 Let me develop the point. What about those students from the European Union whom we have discussed? That is especially relevant as more students move around. What happens if students move abroad? Are they more or less likely to default? With a free market in higher education across Europe, are we sure that such loans will always be a secure investment? I am not quite so sure. Those points need to be explored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07112239000643">What requirement is there for HMRC to pursue those students who fail to pay back their loans? If the buyers of the student loan book are to rely on HMRC&#146;s competence to realise the value of their purchase, this week will have fatally undermined the price of the assets on offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07112239000644">The hon. Member for Great Grimsby referred to debt bundles, and he made a good point. With the lack of liquidity in the financial market today, there is a serious question about whether any bank would want to take on the risk of buying the student loan book. If banks are loth to invest at the moment, there is a risk that the Government will have to sweeten the deal heavily to interest buyers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07112239000645">A number of hon. Members have asked how large a discount the Government will need to give to investors and what proportion of the book they will sell to raise the &#163;6 billion. The Minister has consistently said that he cannot answer because that would reveal all the Government&#146;s cards to investors, but the cat is out of the bag. We know that the Government&#146;s finances are tighter this year and that there is a greater squeeze on spending. Selling the student loan book under those circumstances is rather like advertising on lastminute.com: &#147;The plane leaves in 24 hours, all tickets must go. Any price accepted.&#148; We should perhaps be a little concerned that there is a risk that the Government will put in far too great a sweetener, which would lower what is good value for money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07112239000646">How will the Government decide what is good value for money? How will we know what they have done to establish that? If the Government do not reach a deal that is good value for money, will they postpone the sale, or proceed anyway? They will need to receive a capital amount to balance the books this year. The Tories did at least postpone the sale in 1996 when they failed to obtain a good price for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07112239000647">The problem is that the Government&#146;s record is not good. The forthcoming National Audit Office report on QinetiQ, which we expect to be published tomorrow, is a prime example. A large stake in the defence firm was sold at rock-bottom prices to the Carlyle group and then floated on the stock market, which made the group a hefty &#163;300 million profit. That is a prime example of what happens if we do not ensure that we get value for money at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07112239000648">If the Government succeed in selling the student loan book at a level they believe to be fair, will they undertake to report to the house on the details of the sale before proceeding with further sales? That is the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) made when he asked the Minister to put on the record the discounted rate for the previous sales. I accept that we will not know all the details before the sale, but if the House is to have confidence in what the Government are doing we need to know the success rate that they have achieved so far. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07112239000649">From the investors&#146; point of view, it is not clear how they will know exactly what they are buying unless the Government intend to release much personal data about the loans. The Minister said that all the information for potential purchasers would be anonymised, but I cannot understand how investors could genuinely appreciate what they were buying without knowing far more about those who owe the debt. That raises concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07112239000650">What will happen if students default on their payments? The hon. Members for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) and for Great Grimsby asked about that. Will HMRC pass on information about individuals to the new owners of the debt? What data will be passed to them? What safeguards will be in place? Will HMRC or the new loan owner be responsible for chasing up those who default? How will the relationship work? How will the data be transferred? I presume that the Minister does not want the Opposition to give him details of a reliable courier company, and that a better system will be used in future. There was some hubris in the Government&#146;s reference to their intentions on data protection in the Q and A that the Department released. I suspect that no hon. Member will be as ready to accept the Government&#146;s reassurances about the matter now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07112239000651">What will happen when the initial purchaser sells on the debt? The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) made that point in interventions. Are the Government genuinely saying, as the Minister told me in private, that they will undertake to draw up a new agreement and contract with any new purchaser, all the way down the line, regardless of the way in which the debt is broken up, the number of people to whom it is sold on and whether it is sold here or abroad? What data protection will be in place as the debt is passed along the chain?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07112239000652">The Government trespassed on principle long before we reached this point, when they decided to impose large debts for higher education on students just as they start out in life. There are few points of principle in the Bill, but it contains several holes that leave graduates in uncertainty. I hope that the Minister will turn his mind to them in Committee. However, for now, we are content to let the measure through.</p>

 We are nearing the end of a bad week in Parliament for the Government. However, at last a Bill has come along that we can describe as reasonably sensible. It will have my support today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07112239000654">I have a circumscribed role in higher education as, first, a member and officer of the all-party university group and, secondly&#151;the Minister and certainly the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) will be interested in this&#151;a relatively newly appointed governor of a Welsh higher education institution. We shall watch that interface with interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para14"><a name="07112239000655">However, given that it is more than a decade since my service as a Minister with responsibility for higher education, it is not appropriate for me to debate contentiously or dilate on details of the past. I can say fairly that I floated the idea of doing something along the lines that the Bill suggests and that I have supported the principle of doing so ever since. I welcome the widespread consensus that has been achieved on that. If we consider the reasons for not doing that at the time, it is fair to say that, in the early days of student loans, there was less experience of the repayment compliance. Since then, there has been greater refinement of financial instruments and, perhaps most importantly, the underlying asset has escalated in value. The asset, allowing for another year&#146;s issue of loans, would now approach roughly &#163;20 billion. That is four or five times the value of a decade ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para15"><a name="07112239000656">However, the Bill is essentially a Treasury measure. It is not about the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills or about education. It needs assessing for its economic impact and, as several hon. Members who contributed interestingly said, the critical issues are the conditions and timing of any sale that the Treasury makes or drives. There is no more explicit disclaimer of the Department&#146;s involvement than that in paragraph 42 of the explanatory notes, which states:</p>
<a name="71122-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="07112239000876"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No aspect of this Bill will create a material impact on borrowers, higher education institutions or employers.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para16"><a name="07112239000657">If that is the case, one is driven to wonder what on earth the Minister, much as I like and respect him, is doing discussing the Bill. Where is the Treasury, which is in effect controlling the legislation? However, we are pleased to see the Minister here and he explained the Bill very well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para17"><a name="07112239000658">The Bill&#146;s primary importance is economic, although there may be secondary implications for students and the sector. It is clear from this week&#146;s events that even if&#151;this would be an impossible task and I do not anticipate that it will take place even in the near future&#151;the Government could sell off, at one gulp and at an early date, all the student loans, the total proceeds would fall below the total amount of current Government lending to Northern Rock. In a sense, things have not gone down the pan, but that is at least the scale of the commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para18"><a name="07112239000659">It is perfectly proper for Ministers, whether Treasury Ministers or Education Ministers, to say that the sale of a loan as a Government asset&#151;a loan is of course an asset&#151;is an alternative to further Government borrowing. Indeed, doing so may introduce some welcome flexibility in the Government&#146;s financial affairs. I have no difficulty with that. However, my hon. Friends and others are right to say that we are entitled to ask the Minister to give some indication of the deal that his Department has done to recover the proceeds from the Treasury. For example, are we talking about an enhanced capital programme for higher education institutions? If we are, will it be a genuine enhancement of the resources available to higher education or will it merely be a substitute for others that would have been available?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para19"><a name="07112239000660">Those are general questions about the Bill. There are also some interesting technical questions that are worth probing more in Committee and to which a number of hon. Members have already referred in interventions or speeches. There is an interesting and essential tension between the number and nature of the safeguards available as far as student confidentiality is concerned and the number of players involved. Ministers have rightly fallen back on the overriding guardianship role of the Secretary of State. It is worth noting that the Secretary of State&#146;s obligations are set out clearly in paragraph 15 of the explanatory notes. I should make it clear that those obligations fall on him, and are not demitted to individual civil servants, whether senior or junior.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para20"><a name="07112239000661">One of those obligations is to ensure that correct repayments are taken. A second one is to protect borrowers&#146; personal data and to make arrangements to allow borrowers to discuss issues that have arisen in the course of their borrowing. Those are entirely proper public functions that sit with the Secretary of State. We cannot have arrangements that are seen to muddy those responsibilities, either within the Department or with regard to the subsequent control of the loans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para21"><a name="07112239000662">I mentioned this in an intervention, so I will not speak about it at length, but we know from the history of collateralised debt obligations that loans can easily be, and in fact are likely to be, chopped up and repackaged, and can involve a large number of players, some of whom, even if we know who they are, are likely to be outside the jurisdiction of this country and the Secretary of State. At best, when all those people are involved, sensitive data can leak. Indeed, there will be people looking for that to happen, perhaps in order to relate the names to other credit references that they may have. At worst, the data could be actively abused. At any rate, it is clear that the audit trail is bound to lengthen unless it is controlled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para22"><a name="07112239000663">The next issue is the nature of the risk being transferred. In a sense, that is as long as a piece of string, and whatever risk is being transferred will have to be made explicit to potential purchasers, who will make their own judgment on it. If we consider the old mortgage-style loans, we will remember that there has always been provision for mortality&#151;which, sadly, occurs&#151;and for other non-repayment because the conditions had been fulfilled for writing off the loan after a finite period of years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07112239000664">I have some sympathy with the comments of the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) about this matter. There are now issues about the susceptibility to changes in economic conditions and the potential for default. I hope that the Minister will say something about the experience of active default as opposed to the writing off of a loan under permitted conditions in the existing arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07112239000665">The Minister and I have previously debated the merits or otherwise of the old mortgage-style loans that I used to operate, and I do not want to reopen that debate. I am certainly not saying that we should bring them back now; we move on. However, for borrowers, the terms and obligations attached to those loans were fairly clear. That might not be the case with income-contingent loans, not least because the level of income might not be clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07112239000666">I say to the Minister&#151;as I would say to his Treasury colleagues if they were supporting him on the Front Bench today&#151;that if one is prepared to take a big enough discount, anything, even a sub-prime mortgage, can be got away at a price, but it will only be a severely discounted one. I believe that the Minister is right to keep his powder dry, despite the blandishments of the Liberal Democrats, about the precise conditions under which he is going to sell. I would be the first to complain if he engaged in a fire sale of this very valuable asset. However, he needs to know what he wants to sell, and purchasers will need to know what they want to buy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para26"><a name="07112239000667">This brings me to a further issue. I am sorry if this point is something of a King Charles&#146;s head for me, but I make no apology for repeating it, because I believe that it is important. There is the potential&#151;not the actuality&#151;of a scandal in the making over the question of outstanding student loans that are outside the Secretary of State&#146;s jurisdiction. The Minister has been perfectly reasonable and reassuring in relation to loans within the British envelope. Most people pay PAYE, and most student loans are recovered through Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. We understand from what the Minister has said today that, thank goodness, there has been no breach of security in that regard. We accept his assurance  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 Nov 2007">

<notus-date day="22" month="11" year="2007" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>22 Nov 2007 : Column 1409</b><br>
and we are pleased about it. However, a significant minority of loans are given to qualifying persons who are not British nationals, including European Union students and those from within the European economic area, and to British nationals who subsequently become resident abroad and do not pay UK income tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para27"><a name="07112239000668">The convenient arrangements involving recovery through the Revenue do not apply in those cases. As I understand it, the Student Loans Company is responsible for the collection of those debts, in accordance with the rules. Incidentally, it is also responsible for any voluntary payments that people might make to wipe off their debts, which is welcome. The Minister should tell the House whether there is a material sign of any differential impact between home graduates, if I may call them that, and those resident overseas. I would not be surprised if there were growing evidence of default by those who have passed outside the range of the Revenue and are now difficult to pursue. Without wishing to make a derogatory remark, I must point out that this is similar to the problems of enforcing judgments against foreign drivers, for example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para28"><a name="07112239000669">The Minister needs to take this issue seriously. If word gets out on the street that someone can take out a student loan in the United Kingdom&#151;we are obliged to offer it&#151;but that they do not need to pay it back because they have moved out of the system or because they are a Brit who has moved abroad, in effect to escape from the loan, that would be very bad news. It is disadvantageous to our own resident students, and it makes less money available for other public purposes in the long term. I hope that the Minister will say something about compliance in the context of foreign-resident, as opposed to home-resident, graduates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para29"><a name="07112239000670">This will obviously be a Committee point, but I think we should consider whether purchasers will be obliged to take a proportion of accounts of persons who are resident abroad as part of the package, or whether it is conceivable that a separate package might be offered consisting of persons who are exclusively resident abroad&#151;Student Loans Company cases, rather than Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para30"><a name="07112239000671">Perhaps the Minister will allow me a hypothetical example which I think is at least worth considering. If a Lithuanian bank felt able to secure a package of loans extended only to Lithuanian nationals who had come to the United Kingdom to study, and then to attack them under Lithuanian debt laws and get a faster rate of return than it would by going through the front door&#151;in other words, the Student Loans Company&#151;that would be a differential and might even attract some concern in Europe. If nothing else, it should be considered whether there is any distinction in practice that makes the position of students either easier or more onerous depending on whether they are resident in the United Kingdom or abroad&#151;whether as an English, or British, national or as a foreign national&#151;that would amount to a loss of that famous and desirable concept, the level playing field. To put it simply, it would not be fair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="71122-0015.htm_para31"><a name="07112239000672">Although the Bill is narrow, a number of Members have referred to some of the wider policy contexts. As we are lucky enough to have an Education Minister present, I think it reasonable to make a few brief comments of that kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para0"><a name="07112239000673">There are major long-term issues in the Bill, for all that it is Treasury-driven and will be Treasury-directed, which relate to the real world of students and, indirectly, to the health of higher education institutions and the overall health of the sector. As my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) has said in the past, once the Department has settled down after its initial separation from the other education Department, it needs to make an early start on appraising the impacts of the present fee regime ahead of the 2009 review. In fairness, the Minister has quoted figures for recruitment which will be relevant to that, and which I welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07112239000674">As a whole, the present position is encouraging. The Conservatives, too, are interested&#151;certainly I am interested&#151;in access for people who, although they are from disadvantaged backgrounds, have the same potential as, or even greater potential than, some of their counterparts. We need to discover whether there are differential impacts, not just according to social class or income but relating to the pattern of offers among part-timers and mature students.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07112239000675">The other day I went to talk to a group of sixth-formers. I was a little disappointed when someone who seemed bright enough to qualify for university said very definitely, &#147;I am not going.&#148; When I asked,, Would you mind telling me why?&#148;, the reply was, &#147;I am worried about debt.&#148; That was a one-off&#151;it may have been the word on the street, and it may not be typical of students collectively&#151;but it is depressing nevertheless.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07112239000676">The Minister may be aware&#151;it has featured in earlier debates&#151;of my concern about the cumulative effect on marginal tax rates of income tax&#151;perhaps even paid by quite junior people at higher rates&#151;national insurance contributions and student loan repayments. I can never remember what the acronym is supposed to stand for, but some social scientists have referred to members of the so-called iPod generation, who incur, in effect, a marginal tax rate of over 50 per cent. at a very young age, which I think is worrying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07112239000677">That also plays into wider issues to do with life profile and life chances. People who are repaying onerous student loans might at the same time be founding households or thinking for the first time about taking out a mortgage&#151;and, as we all know, they ought to be thinking about their pension, too, when there is a chance that compound interest will give them a worthwhile pension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07112239000678">In saying that, I do not seek to subvert anything the Minister has done. A good job was done collectively in Committee on proposed higher education legislation in getting a better student package. I am happy in some respects about that. We cannot anticipate the review, but we should emphasise that it is important and that it is about sustaining access and at least controlling the burdens on graduates even if they have a better future income stream.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07112239000679">There are questions to do not only with the conventional model of higher education students, but also with part-time and mature students. I will not today open up the issue of payments through higher education institutions for qualifications of equivalent or lower quality, although that is a concern of mine&#151;about which I have written to the Secretary of State&#151;because of some of the impacts on some institutions and types of study.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07112239000680">There is also the whole area of comparison with further education. The Minister was not quite right when he said that nobody has ever helped in that area before, because career development loans have been available for many years. In a sense, they are a private sector risk&#151;a managed and reduced risk. However, the scale of the commitment to CDLs pales in comparison with the size of the student loan book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07112239000681">Part-timers at higher education institutions have, at last, been able to avail themselves of loans in certain circumstances, which is welcome, but some recent work has come to my attention through City and Guilds&#151;the Minister might have seen it, too&#151;confirming my long-standing belief that FE is left standing in terms of student support, however great its economic contribution might be. I hope that that will be addressed, and that the Minister will take those disparities seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07112239000682">As I move on in my parliamentary career, I can reflect as well as&#151;I hope&#151;look forward. It is a strange fact that the Education Act 1962 marks the beginning of the concept of the student support package and the mandatory award. I was an undergraduate at that time. Since then, the whole body of measures has gathered barnacles, accretions, qualifications, embellishments, derogations and further advantages. Let me give a simple example: it was not until approximately 1990 that the first student loans were added to supplement the grants package, and Ministers have now brought back the grants package to supplement the loans. The concept of an entitlement, or mandatory award, attached to a first course of undergraduate study at a higher education institution has, however, persisted; but the time is fast approaching for us to take a fresh look not only at student finances, although that is important, but at the whole of the financing of post-compulsory education at higher and further education level and also embracing training and the important and growing area of continuing professional development. None of that is included in the Bill, as it is a technical, enabling Bill, which is all right as far as it goes&#151;at least we hope that there is none of that, and that such changes to the system might only have crept in inadvertently.

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07112239000684">The Bill had an inauspicious start as far as Wales was concerned when it was trailed in the draft legislative programme and described as &#147;England only&#148;. It has now been properly described as extending to England and Wales. Indeed, we have received more support and information from the Wales Office than we have had previously when dealing with similar Bills. The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) mentioned the Further Education and Training Act 2007, which led to confusion when the intention was not to give Welsh further education colleges the power to award foundation degrees. We are all gaining experience in this type of legislation.</p>

Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) asked where the money raised by the sale of the student loans book would go. When he was making that point, I wondered where any sum raised by the sale of the Wales student loan book would go if Ministers in the Welsh Assembly Government used the powers that are intended for them. Would the money stay with the Assembly or be taken back to Westminster? If the money stayed with the Assembly, what could the Assembly use it for?

 This is my first contribution from the Front Bench, and it is a great privilege to follow the many thoughtful speeches and interventions in the debate today. We have had a short but interesting debate, which has at times made me think that the major parties are conducting a love-in rather than a debate.

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07112239000694">Much has been made recently of the Xerox Chancellor and the magpie Budget, but the sale of student loans goes back much further and could be described as Labour&#146;s original sin. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) said, my party first proposed the sale of student loans back in 1996, and it was implemented in 1998 and 1999 by the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) in an attempt to stay within Government spending limits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07112239000695">If those on both sides of the House could continue to work effectively in pursuit of sensible policies, especially Conservative ones, it would be good for the image of Parliament and for the country. I therefore applaud the Government for once again recognising a bright idea that has emanated from the Conservatives. I hope that that sets a precedent for a future in which our policies regularly slip unchallenged past the House. Even the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather), in a thoughtful contribution, made it clear that her party would not oppose the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07112239000696">The Bill is a sensible and rational piece of legislation, although I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), who pointed out that this is a Treasury Bill, not a higher education Bill. The sale of the student loan book is consistent with our belief in further public-private collaboration, and it will enable the Government to capitalise on a growing public asset without affecting borrowers or taxpayers. It could even have the added and totally irrelevant but enjoyable side benefit of irritating the left wing of the Labour party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07112239000697">Speaking of the Labour left, I notice that an early-day motion from the usual suspects has already called for the uncosted abolition of interest on student loan repayments. It would be useful if the Minister could let us have an estimate of the cost of that policy. Perhaps he could tell us how many nurses or teachers would have to be sacked if the Government implemented the policies of their Back Benchers.</p>

 The Minister may be aware of the early-day motion tabled by some Labour Back Benchers&#151;I described them as the usual suspects&#151;that calls for the abolition of interest on student loan repayments, which would raise costs for the Treasury significantly. I wondered whether he could advise us how much that would cost, perhaps in terms of how many nurses and teachers would need to be sacked. In any case, I advise him to keep an eye on the left wing of his party, so that it does not lurch too far to the left.</p>

experienced in data protection, given this week&#146;s calamity&#151;a point made powerfully by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para20"><a name="07112239000701">The National Union of Students has already stated its concern that the Bill may be a step towards students paying commercial rates of interest. I do not believe that it is, and it should be noted that students still enjoy a favourable interest rate that is pegged to inflation. There is little for students to worry about in the Bill, which probably explains why they have not been more vociferous in their representations to hon. Members. Students may be more concerned, however, that the average graduate debt is &#163;15,000 and takes some 13 years to pay off, as the Minister recently informed me in a written answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para21"><a name="07112239000702">Like the hon. Member for Brent, East, we recognise that financing a university education can be a challenge for many students and their families. We welcome the fact that the Bill enables the Government to preserve the low interest rate that students currently enjoy. In that context the point made by the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) is relevant in making sure that we are communicating directly with students on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07112239000703">The Minister, in his opening remarks, was right to say that it is prudent to consider the timing of any sale of the loan book. I understand that passing the legislation does not necessarily mean an immediate sale. As many hon. Members have said, in the light of the Northern Rock fiasco and the dark economic clouds over the banking sector and the economy, that is a particularly relevant and important concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07112239000704">There are questions on which I hope the Minister can shed some light. I understand that the proceeds from the sale are already accounted for in the comprehensive spending review. Perhaps he can tell the House whether there is a time limit on when the sale must be undertaken. If putting the revenue into the comprehensive spending review means that the money must be raised within three years, does that weaken our negotiating position in getting the best deal? My hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings made a good point when he asked how much of the &#163;6 billion is already accounted for in the comprehensive spending review and where it is allocated. If the Government do not raise the expected sum, what impact will that have on the Government&#146;s spending plans?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07112239000705">I remind the Government that the student loan book is a public asset and taxpayers will expect a reasonable price from any sell-off. The Government must avoid the temptation to cash in too quickly for the sake of the public sector borrowing requirement and pressure to raise funds. It was absolutely right for my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) to remind the Minister that the former Chancellor of the Exchequer sold a large portion of the gold reserves for a quarter of the price that we could have got shortly afterwards, even if in doing so my hon. Friend slightly changed the flow of my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings. As the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) pointed out yesterday, the Government undervalued QinetiQ to the tune of &#163;300 million.</p>

expressed by the hon. Members for Great Grimsby and for Brent, East, this sale is a good deal for whichever commercial entity wins it. The House should note that these loans are not sub-prime mortgages. Graduates are likely to move directly into employment and begin repayment quickly. These loans are an attractive asset for banks, providing a continuous income over a long period from a low-risk group, collected securely through the tax system. They will also diversify the banks&#146; portfolios and give them direct contact with an important socio-economic group. The Government have a strong hand to play and we will watch to ensure that they play it well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para26"><a name="07112239000707">It is worth remembering that the first two sales of student loans failed to reach the estimated value. Valuations of &#163;1.6 billion and &#163;1.5 billion raised a combined total of just under &#163;2.1 billion when sold. Does the Minister expect to lose as much as a third of the face value with this sale, as the Government have on previous occasions? Is that what he suggested in his opening remarks was good value for money?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para27"><a name="07112239000708">According to the figure we have been given, the sale will involve &#163;6 billion-worth of loans from the current &#163;18 billion, but I am not clear whether that is the amount that the Government expect to receive into Treasury coffers or whether that figure is negotiable. I again remind the Government that these are public assets and Parliament expects full disclosure on how the sale will be handled and conducted. However, I am sure that we can deal with many of these questions in Committee rather than detain the House too long this afternoon.</p>

Member for Great Grimsby. I accept that some form of subsidy will be inevitable to make the project commercially viable, but the expense of repayment should decline as the loans are repaid. Can the Minister inform the House what the impact of paying interest subsidies will be on the total revenue the Government will ultimately receive?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="71122-0016.htm_para29"><a name="07112239000714">In a written answer to the hon.

 My hon. Friend might like to reflect on the fact that the nature of the interest subsidy is contingent.

Friend suggests. Taking into account the face value of the sale and the subsequent interest subsidy payments, what proportion of the &#163;6 billion will the Government ultimately keep? What proportion of it has been accounted for in the comprehensive spending review?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="71122-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07112239000718">Can the Minister tell the House which loans will be selected for sale? Will the selection be random or systematic, according to a formula such as whether the loans are high or low risk? What is the total number of loans to be included in the package to bring the value up to &#163;6 billion?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="71122-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07112239000719">Many Members referred to trust in their contributions. Recent events have further undermined the Government&#146;s reputation for competence&#151;throughout Government, not just in the education sector. Several Members asked about data protection, about which the public have some doubts, so what assurances can the Minister and the Government give graduates that their personal details, including bank account information, will not be lost, leaked or liquidated accidentally? The public will not have been completely reassured by the Minister&#146;s opening remarks. Can the House be assured that such information will always be encrypted and not moved around on CD-ROMs?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="71122-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07112239000720">Can the public trust the Government to spend the proceeds of the sale wisely? There have been countless examples across Government, including in education, of profligate and wasteful spending. Indeed, some people might even say that unnecessarily splitting a Department and renaming the remnants constitutes just such waste. If that were not enough, there are many other examples of waste, as recent reports have shown; Lancaster university has already warned us about the frivolous way in which the Government splash the cash. A commitment from the Government to reinvest the revenue raised from the sale would be extremely welcome. In a powerful intervention, the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) said that he wanted some of the money spent on higher education&#151;as did some other contributors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="71122-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07112239000721">I, too, hope that at least some of the money can be spent on our higher education sector, which is, as the Minister knows, vital to the UK economy and should be given every reasonable support. However, the money resolution makes it clear that all the revenue will disappear into the Consolidated Fund. Can the Minister tell the House how much of it will go to higher education? A small part could be used to reinvest in institutions that will be devastated by the impact of recent cuts. Over the summer, the Government sneaked out a &#163;100 million cut in funding to institutions dedicated to part-time and mature students. Help to institutions such as the Open university and Birkbeck college, both of which provide a valuable service to the UK economy, would be extremely welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="71122-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07112239000722">I am sure that, as my hon.

doing so would undermine negotiations, could he perhaps disclose the number of interested parties with whom he has already had preliminary discussions? If he genuinely fears undermining the negotiations, I shall not push that matter, as it is vital that the Government are not hampered in their efforts to obtain maximum value for money when the assets are sold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="71122-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07112239000723">It is important to respond to the powerful contribution from my hon.

Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie), and the Minister needs to offer considerable reassurance on that issue. My hon.

The sale is evidence that closer co-operation between the public and private sectors provides the most effective way to manage the growing student debt portfolio. The revenue that the Bill will raise, and should continue to raise, is welcome. Despite reservations about selling on loans, information security and how the Government will spend the money, we believe that the proposals in the Bill are sensible, and we will therefore not hinder its progress on Second Reading.</p>

Genuine commitment to widening participation requires consistency in decision making. I charitably remind him of the Conservative party&#146;s flip-flopping on student fees. When tuition fees were first introduced in 1998, the Conservatives advocated full top-up fees, with no protection. By the time we took the legislation through the House before the last general election, the Conservatives were opposed to variable fees. Now, they are in favour of the Government&#146;s position. Indeed, they now tell us that they want the review on the cap to be brought forward, which would be irresponsible. Some Conservative Members, such as the right hon.

 I accept that last point, and given that the hon. Gentleman previously did my current ministerial job, I know that he is very knowledgeable on such matters. I certainly agree that it is critical that we have as much information as possible about how the new system is working before the independent commission in 2009. That is why the shadow Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills is neither right nor justified in calling for that commission to be introduced before we have the full, substantive body of evidence before us.</p>

We legislated on the sale of mortgage-style student loans in 1998&#151;well before the commitment that the Opposition gave in their last general election manifesto. We believe that this is the right thing to do. It sensibly transfers risk from the public sector to the private sector and ensures that students and graduates are not affected in any way, shape or form.</p>

Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), who chairs the Innovation, Universities and Skills Committee, made an interesting contribution. He argued that the proceeds from the sale of student debt should be hypothecated to my Department. I will come back to that point later, but I have to say that the money will be paid into the Consolidated Fund and will support all Government expenditure. That is in line with the principle by which loans are repaid at the moment, and it would not be in anyone&#146;s interest to breach the principle.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman speaks with integrity on these matters and I hear what he says about the money being paid into the Consolidated Fund. Members on both sides of the Chamber have expressed doubt about the timing of the sale. This would not be a great time to sell, as I am sure he realises. Given the Government&#146;s financial problems, I suspect that the matter may be decided well above his pay grade. We do not want a sale to go ahead that is not in the interests of the public, universities or students.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman referred to the extra-sensory powers of the hon. Member for Daventry, who anticipated the next point that he was going to make. The hon.

possible value for money for the taxpayer. The Bill gives us the ability to sell. All that we have set out so far in the comprehensive spending review is our intention, over the coming three years, to sell &#163;6 billion of student loans. If market conditions are not adequate or appropriate, and do not ensure value for money, sales will not go ahead. I can give that categorical commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="71122-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07112239000736">We heard welcome comments about establishing a cross-party consensus, if we can, so that everything possible is done to ensure confidence in the safety of personal data. I refer back to what I said in my opening contribution. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor made his statement this week. Lord Triesman, the Minister with responsibility for intellectual property and quality, has asked the Student Loans Company to review its operations and data management processes. No breaches of data protection protocols have occurred in respect of student loan administration and we are certain that no data have gone missing in respect of student loan administration. However, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs has initiated a wide-ranging review of its security processes and procedures, and we are undertaking a review of student loans and all Departments are reviewing their data management processes. If the hon. Gentleman wants to make further suggestions in Committee, I will be happy to consider them.</p>

 I am grateful for the tone of the Minister&#146;s remarks. It seems that this is a dynamic situation. Fraudsters are becoming ever more sophisticated and it might be necessary to look at the matter more closely in Committee, given the events of the last few days. I am happy to accept his suggestion that we could do that on a bipartisan basis, but it might involve taking further advice and making amendments to the Bill to build in extra security&#151;purely because it is important that we reassure the public, students and potential students.</p>

Gentleman made a point about ensuring that a fair allocation of the Bill&#146;s proceeds goes to my Department. That is a decision for the Treasury, and I will not reveal discussions that take place between my Secretary of State, colleagues in the Treasury, the Chancellor and me. I ask the hon. Gentleman to judge us by what we have done in the past. During the Conservatives&#146; last eight years in power, there was a 36 per cent. real-terms cut in per-student funding rate for higher education. Under this Government, there has been a 23 per cent. real-terms increase in the higher education budget. Across the country, virtually every vice-chancellor I speak to acknowledges that universities are undergoing a big expansion in their finances; that is in stark contrast to what they experienced before 1 May 1997.</p>

Clearly, the sales anticipated over the comprehensive spending review period are not for the whole loan book; we are talking about a long-term  <br>

 Is it not also self-evident that the value obtained for a particular tranche of loans is a function of the size of that tranche? It may be quite easy&#151;and sensible&#151;to get small amounts away, and to leave some of the bigger bulk for later. In other words, it is not just a matter of initiating the programme. The Minister and the Government should not be in too much of a hurry to try to sell the bulk.</p>

 Let me again make it clear that we will act prudently and responsibly in undertaking the sales. The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings asked who was likely to purchase the loans. We believe, based on the advice that we have received, that a wide range of investors will be interested in buying bonds based on the loans, because they are a new asset class that will diversify investors&#146; portfolios and meet specific investor needs, for which there is a market. Those investors are likely to include pension funds, banks, insurance companies and fund managers; they will buy different loans according to their risk appetite.</p>

Members for South Holland and The Deepings, and for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams), asked about the implications for Wales and the Welsh Assembly. As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire knows, student support policy and ownership of the Welsh student loan book was devolved in 2006. As responsibility for student loans in Wales has been devolved to Welsh Ministers, it is important that the provision applies equally to Wales. Any decision on the future sales of the Welsh loan book must be made in Wales by Welsh Ministers. Clause 8 gives Welsh Ministers the power to make those decisions. Welsh Ministers are keen to ensure that the powers are in place, so that they can ensure that maximum value for money is achieved for Welsh student loans. The Bill will enable Welsh Ministers to decide when it is appropriate to use the powers, bearing in mind the relevant economic and value-for-money considerations.</p>

It would not be right to talk about the level of proceeds ahead of a rate. There will be a competitive process to maximise value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather), who leads for the Liberal Democrats, asked me to write into the Bill our future intentions with respect to fees and student finance. That would not be the right thing to do. We should stick to our policy of having an independent commission in 2009 and not prejudging it. That is the position of the Government, not of the Opposition. The right hon. Member for Wokingham has said that we should lift the cap now, and a Liberal Democrat think-tank says the same. We need to be responsible and stick to our policy.</p>

Following a sale, the Government plan to include provision within the contract that the SLC will continue to carry out the administration and enforcement of the loans that have been sold, and will continue to have all direct day-to-day contact with borrowers. That should give significant reassurance.</p>

We will not sell at any price. He made some important comments about students who travel overseas or students from elsewhere in the European Union. We need to be clear that loans to EU citizens for tuition fees started only in 2006-07. The first graduates will begin repayment from 2010. For that reason, those loans will not be part of the early sales of the loan portfolio.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="71122-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07112239000749">We are putting in place with the Student Loan Company a comprehensive system for collecting loans. The principle of income-contingent loans means that we will collect repayments according to purchasing power in the country where the borrower is resident. That is important. No one will be able to avoid repaying because a good local salary does not meet our &#163;15,000 threshold simply as a result of the currency rates. We will ensure that enforcement across the EU will be possible under EU law by taking action in the UK courts&#151;from memory, I think EC directive 1441 deals with that.</p>

There will be protection and transition. No university will lose out in cash terms at the end of that period. That is the right priority.

 With no sense of irony at all, I welcome the Minister to the Dispatch Box today, especially as it was touch and go as to whether either of us would make it to the Chamber, given the curtailment of Government business. The issue of the future of Britain&#146;s most popular recreational fish does not appear to have found any favour on the Opposition Benches. That will come as some surprise to the 1 million sea anglers in England, Scotland and Wales, although perhaps we should leave that matter for another day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07112239000776">It is ironic that, if the Minister had not been able to make it here on time&#151;I am delighted that he has&#151;the Whips Office had chosen my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) to take his place. He is an angler, and I am sure that he would have agreed with every word that I have to say. To have done so, of course, might have contravened the words that he might have been required to read out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07112239000777">This is an Adjournment debate; we are not limited by time, and I know that that will please everybody here. I am genuine in my congratulations to the Minister, who is a friend of mine. In his other role as Minister for the South East, he has impressed many people with how he has worked in the region with local communities struggling to deal with the aftermath of the July floods. I thank him for his two visits to my constituency; he will be aware that it is impossible to visit Reading without being harangued by fisherman, although in the case that I am thinking about they were freshwater fishermen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para15"><a name="07112239000778">I look forward, particularly in my capacity as Labour&#146;s angling spokesman, to the day when I can offer similar praise for the decision that my hon. Friend has made as Minister with responsibility for fisheries. Sadly, as a result of his decision to go back on the commitment made by his predecessor to increase, in the interests of conservation, the minimum landing size of bass, I am not here to praise the Minister but to challenge him&#151;which is, after all, the purpose of this House. His announcement of 25 October on retaining the minimum landing size for bass at 36 cm rather than increasing it to 40 cm and then to 45 cm by 2010, as recommended by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science just two years ago, flies in the face of scientific evidence and has been greeted with understandable anger and dismay by hundreds of thousands of sea anglers, as well as by conservationists. He himself admitted that his decision was based on looking after the short-term interests of the inshore fleet rather than the long-term interests of the species and the environment. I want to tease out those points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07112239000779">It is worth reminding the House that the recreational sea angling sector in England and Wales is worth more than &#163;1.3 billion a year to the economy and provides 19,000 non-subsidised jobs. The entire commercial fleet employs only 12,000 people, with considerably fewer in the under-10 m inshore fleet. We should be concerned about the impact of any decision on jobs, but let us not forget the devastating impact that unsustainable fishing  <br>

has had on all sectors, both commercial and recreational. The livelihoods of charter skippers, who take anglers to sea and depend on healthy fish stocks to maintain a viable business, are every bit as important as those of the commercial fleet. Everybody suffers when a fishery collapses, as we saw in the Grand Banks off Newfoundland and in the American striped bass fishery, or as was nearly the case in respect of North sea cod stocks. Future generations will not remember kindly those politicians who duck the challenge of creating the sustainable harvesting of the resources of our planet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07112239000780">The nub of the argument is that we were promised that Britain&#146;s most popular fish in terms of its sporting and eating potential would be managed sustainably, and primarily as a recreational species. That was a promise made in Downing street, and it should be kept. In 2002, the Prime Minister&#146;s strategy unit commissioned a report on the benefits of recreational sea angling. That report, &#147;Net Benefits&#148;, was eventually published in 2004, to wide acclaim. It said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07112239000781">Among its recommendations were:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07112239000782">That was followed by the findings of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, which looked at &#147;Net Benefits&#148; and, in a consensual report on an all-party basis, said:</p>
<a name="71122-0018.htm_brev20"><a name="07112239000914"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We strongly support the Strategy Unit recommendations to develop the recreational sea angling sector.

By 2004, we had No. 10, the Government and an all-party Commons Committee moving in the same direction, and it is fair to say that there were reasons to be cheerful. Rarely for a policy, the process survived the 2005 general election; in fact, it was enhanced by it. In Labour&#146;s &#147;Charter for Angling&#148;, the Minister&#146;s predecessor wrote:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para25"><a name="07112239000788">At this point, it is fair to say that the sea angling community was fairly content with my party, and with the direction of travel in respect of the policy of conserving valuable species. The Minister&#146;s predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), made good that promise when he launched the DEFRA consultation in 2005 to increase the minimum landing size for bass, in order to produce a sustainable fishery with more and bigger bass for the commercial and recreational sectors. That proposal was based on sound science and in the interests of conservation and the environment. It followed a report from CEFAS, which made it perfectly clear that the sound policy to adopt, which would maximise the yield per recruit, would suggest that</p>
<a name="71122-0018.htm_brev26"><a name="07112239000920"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;gains...can be made in all areas by increasing the size at first capture up to about 44-48 cm...At a size of 40 cm at first capture, YPR gains will be small, but significant gains...will be achieved&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para26"><a name="07112239000789">in the long run. In respect of the impact on the commercial fleet, the report says that under a scenario of a 40 cm minimum landing size with no discard mortality,</p>
<a name="71122-0018.htm_brev27"><a name="07112239000790"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;landings were significantly reduced in the short term...but subsequently recovered to levels similar to, or above, the status quo&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para27"><a name="07112239000791">assuming, of course, mesh netting controls and bass nursery areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para28"><a name="07112239000792">To summarise the matter of policy, it was quite possible to put together conservation measures that would deliver more and bigger bass for the commercial sector and the recreational sector. The question that all sea anglers are asking is, what has changed? What changed the entire direction of travel of policy from 2002 onwards in the past few months? I go back to CEFAS. It is DEFRA&#146;s main agency, and leading scientific body, by which Government policy is informed, and from which it is derived. A presentation was made on 1 October by Mike Smith of CEFAS, which said quite clearly that the</p>
<a name="71122-0018.htm_brev28"><a name="07112239000921"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;analysis...indicated that increasing the age at which bass were first exploited would improve long-term yields and boost recruitment to the spawning stock&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para29"><a name="07112239000793">On a general summary of benefits, it says:</p>
<a name="71122-0018.htm_brev29"><a name="07112239000922"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The chief policy benefit has been the acceptance that protecting juvenile fish stocks works&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para30"><a name="07112239000794">The optimum spawning size for female bass is 42 cm. It is a simple act of conservation science that every species should be given the opportunity to breed once. Not to allow that does not promote sustainable fishing policy. Not to do so would not be in the interests of the environment, or in the interests of the oceans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="71122-0018.htm_para31"><a name="07112239000795">The consultation was launched. There was a predicable outcry from the commercial sector, but then there was an outcry from that sector when conservation measures had to be introduced in the American striped bass fishery and in the Grand Banks in Newfoundland. The commercial fishermen now welcome those measures, which were put in place to sustain the stocks and allow them to recover. It is important that as politicians we take the long-term view, not the short-term one. My hon. Friend the Member for Exeter took the long-term view in his statement in 2006 when he announced the conclusions of the consultation and his intention to increase the bass minimum landing size to 40 cm from 36 cm, and then on to 45 cm, beyond the optimum spawning size. The DEFRA press release contained quotations from the Minister&#146;s predecessor. He said:</p>

 As we have until half past six, I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. What has changed is that the Government have not responded with an alternative. My difficulty with the minimum landing size as a stand-alone measure was that the purpose is surely to get professional fishermen to change the sort of gear that they use. As a stand-alone measure, the minimum landing size does not achieve that, but as part of the bass management plan it does. That is why I am nodding, why I am pleased that the hon.

Leominster has raised an interesting point. We need to weigh in the balance the impact of establishing nursery areas. We also need to weigh in the balance the impact of increasing mesh size from 80-90 mm, say, to 100 mm.</p>

Those shallow inshore waters are most vulnerable to commercial exploitation. Not only do we need nursery areas and increased net sizes, but, if we are to do the right thing by long-term fisheries conservation, we need to limit inshore netting and trawling in some of those sensitive areas.

That difference means doubling the weight of the sea bass, which is a valuable species for recreational fishing. Just as people spend a lot of money to catch quality salmon&#151;far more than salmon would ever fetch on a fishmonger&#146;s slab&#151;people will spend a lot of money to enjoy quality recreational bass fishing on the fly, by bait or by using lures, plugs and spinners.</p>

Global warming means that stocks of juvenile bass have risen to some extent, but the recreational fishery is undervalued if only stunted bass are available through the removal of a great proportion of the stock at too early a stage in its life.

 I congratulate my hon.

I am grateful to him for his invaluable work in raising the profile of angling in general and, in particular, for his active involvement with sea angling representative bodies.</p>

I announced on 25 October that the minimum landing size for bass would not be increased from the current EU size of 36 cm to 40 cm. I made this decision after full consideration of the evidence and following a meeting with the fishing industry and angling representatives. I brought together the anglers and representatives of the industry for a presentation by scientists at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science&#151;CEFAS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="71122-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07112239000824">Before making this decision, I was aware that the consultation on the issue had generated some 2,800 responses. That is a large postbag for a fisheries issue.  <br>

<notus-date day="22" month="11" year="2007" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>22 Nov 2007 : Column 1432</b><br>
The replies demonstrated that views were generally polarised between anglers who were strongly in favour of an increase and commercial fishermen who strongly opposed it. Against that background, whatever decision was reached was likely to be contentious. With this in mind, my approach was to ensure that my decision took proper account of the science and all the other evidence. I was also clear that I would not reach a decision until both parties had had a chance to put their case to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="71122-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07112239000825">The meeting that I convened at the beginning of October gave me the opportunity to hear the views of those who have been closely involved with the debate. Commercial bass fishermen and bass anglers made it very clear to me how important bass was to them. The meeting also gave an opportunity for the scientific advice on bass stocks to be fully debated. This advice from CEFAS scientists has been that the bass stock appears to be fished sustainably and that a succession of successful year classes, together with a suite of effective management measures, has resulted in a doubling of bass stocks since the mid-1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="71122-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07112239000826">That view is endorsed by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea&#151;ICES&#151;whose report I have here. ICES advised the European Commission in 2004 that bass stocks around the UK coast appeared to be fished sustainably. For example, it reported:</p>
<a name="71122-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="07112239000930"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The prognosis for sea bass stocks in the English Channel...is that fishing mortality levels are sustainable...spawning stock biomass levels are as high or higher that they have been over the previous 20 years and that strong year classes continued to be sufficiently frequent to ensure that recruitment maintains both yields and the stock.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="71122-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07112239000827">The same report also noted that the package of bass conservation measures introduced in the UK in the 1990s&#151;including the creation of 37 key bass nursery areas, which we closed to directed fishing for bass&#151;had met their objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="71122-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07112239000828">The science&#151;from ICES in 2004 and our own scientific advice&#151;has remained consistent since the consultation. However, the circumstances in which I am making my decision have changed. My hon. Friend was right: I am particularly concerned about the impacts on the under-10m fleet in the short to medium term. It is difficult to quantify the impact on the profitability of individual vessels, but it is clear that bass between 36 cm and 40 cm makes up an important share of the catch for these vessels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="71122-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07112239000829">Our regulatory impact assessment identified that, with an increase to 40 cm, the costs to the industry would have been around &#163;1.4 million in the first year, with reduced landings for three to four years, and subsequently recovering to the levels that pertained before the increase. This sector of the fleet has faced a number of additional pressures this year in relation to the availability of quota species. Inshore netters fishing for sole, cod and plaice have been particularly affected in 2007, and, as a non-quota and plentiful species, bass is an important displacement stock for those fishermen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="71122-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07112239000830">I am also concerned about the effects of any increased minimum landing size on discards of bass&#151;when fish are thrown back into the sea, often dead. That is a key issue for fishermen and for managers, and the European Commission has recently produced proposals to reduce the number of discards in key fisheries. The largest discard impact would have been on trawlers in the  <br>

eastern English channel. At 40 cm, an estimated 55 tonnes of bass would have been discarded&#151;and would probably have died&#151;from UK inshore trawlers each year out of an average trawl catch of around 230 tonnes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="71122-0019.htm_para21"><a name="07112239000831">Finally, when I reached my decision I bore it in mind that we now had a clear indication that other member states and the Commission would not support an increased MLS, as we had originally hoped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="71122-0019.htm_para22"><a name="07112239000832">I have heard the argument, which my hon. Friend advanced, that the MLS should be increased, as it is currently set below the spawning size for bass. I should clarify that although 42 cm is the average size at which female bass will have spawned once, it is not necessary to introduce an MLS of 42 cm to ensure stock sustainability, given the current scientific advice that the bass stock is being fished sustainably at a MLS of 36 cm.</p>

 Having been a member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee and having conducted investigations of fisheries in the past, I think it fair to say that scientific advice is not constant, but varies significantly over a period.

 In making decisions of this kind, we have to weigh the competing demands. I am trying to explain why I reached my decision within the competing demands represented by the wishes of anglers who have presented the powerful case articulated by my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West and the representations made to me by fishermen. I will, however, make some further points which are relevant to what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="71122-0019.htm_para23"><a name="07112239000835">I too have heard the argument that an increase in the MLS would have generated an increase in angling activity which would outweigh the financial impact on commercial fishermen. I have some sympathy with that argument, and I accept that managing fisheries to take account of anglers&#146; requirements could develop the sport and lead to increases in angling-related expenditure on items such as tackle, bait, travel and accommodation. Bass anglers have made that point as part of their case for an increase, and my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West referred to it as well. Our analysis was less certain: despite the large increase in the stock in recent years, the evidence that we had on bass angling showed that the number of bass anglers over a similar period had not changed significantly. Our analysis also showed that many shore anglers would not see the benefits from an increase, as most bass inshore measure less than 40 cm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="71122-0019.htm_para26"><a name="07112239000839">Counting the number of recreational sea bass fishermen must also be looked into carefully. I cannot believe that the figures are as constant as suggested, given that I am told by people&#151;even by one of my neighbours&#151;that they fish regularly and often invite friends, who are therefore introduced to the sport in a way that might mean that they are not counted in the statistics.</p>

They are not spawned on the moon and exported down to Britain. Bass is a sporting species. Many trout, salmon and coarse anglers, for example, enjoy bass fishing, but they might not appear in data. From my extensive contacts in the angling world, it is my contention that bass angling is becoming more popular but is at risk as people are frustrated at the lack of availability of decent-sized bass to catch. Baby bass angling has not got a strong future, and that is where we are at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="71122-0019.htm_para29"><a name="07112239000845">The measures include a review of the current series of 37 nursery areas around the coast of England and Wales, which have proved so successful in protecting juvenile bass. We will also be considering having more nursery areas where significant new juvenile populations of bass require protection as a result of climate warming causing bass to spawn further north and with greater success.
