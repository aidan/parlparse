That is also a concern of the United Nations, whose Secretary-General continues to express anxiety about the matter. I can assure my hon.

Again, Britain has been at the forefront of cancelling debt. For example, the United Kingdom alone has cancelled &#163;2.8 billion.

 No, I reject that, and I shall give an example from the past seven days showing why what my hon. Friend says is not the case. Last week in Darfur I had a meeting with a Sudan Justice Minister and the inability of the Sudan ministries to take action to ensure the safety of their own population. In that regard, it is essential that we give leadership on the responsibility to protect. The international community has a responsibility, but individual Governments also have the responsibility to work with the international community. In Sudan, we have so far put in &#163;60 million to support the creation of a UN international peacekeeping force. The problem has been the unwillingness of the Sudanese regime to participate effectively. As a consequence, there is a continuing deterioration in the situation of the citizens of Darfur and of Sudan in general. So no, we are not second-class citizens when it comes to arguing this case.

 I simply say that, of course, there is considerable concern across the international community and the hon. Gentleman is right to identify it. It is important to make it clear, particularly in this House, that, yes, the United Kingdom is greatly concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe, but that those concerns are shared by the whole European Union, by the African Union&#151;sadly, those concerns have not always been expressed as loudly as they might be&#151;by the United Nations and by the whole international community. It is very important that we recognise that this is not a bilateral dispute between Britain and Zimbabwe; this is about the whole international community expressing concern about a very dangerous and deteriorating human rights situation. We will keep up the pressure through all those bodies.</p>

Canthe Secretary of State say specifically why John Bredenkamp, close family members of the regime and other members of it are not on the travel ban and do not have personal sanctions against them? Why is food aid still allowed to be used as a tool of manipulation by the Zimbabwean Government? Has Robert Mugabe been relieved of his honorary knighthood?

We are urging that we should use the opportunity identified by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Trade of the new Human Rights Council to focus discussion on the worrying and deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe.

I also remind him that although I have seen reports in certain sections of the British news media, I have not seen any attribution to Morgan Tsvangirai of the words that the right hon. and learned Gentleman used about the British Government walking by on the other side.

 My hon. Friend speaks very wisely, if I may say so. Successive Foreign Secretaries in this Government have been guided by three concerns when dealing with Zimbabwe. First, we have given priority to the interests of the people of Zimbabwe, and we have done everything in our power&#151;in ways that the Government of Zimbabwe could not manipulate&#151;to help, support and aid them, not least through direct food aid, and so on. Secondly, we have always acted in ways that would promote reform and genuine democratic dialogue in Zimbabwe, although we have been careful not to give Mugabe an excuse to act against those in Zimbabwe who are prepared to stand up to him publicly, as that would be to put them at further risk. We have always tried to be guided by what those people have said was the balance to be struck between supporting them and not putting them at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="70320-0002.htm_para1"><a name="07032039000083">Thirdly, the Government have been guided consistently by the fact that Mugabe has always used any stance taken by the UK as an excuse to stir up support among people elsewhere in Africa&#151;and I suspect that this may be one of the reasons other African Governments stay their hands in respect of Zimbabwe&#151;for claims that the dispute is between the old colonial power that wants to take back power and to interfere with Zimbabwe, and Zimbabwe&#146;s heroic revolutionary Government. Sadly, those claims have much too much resonance in Africa. That is why we have always tried to make sure that we deprive Mugabe of that excuse, while remaining strong in condemnation of his actions.</p>

There may be a time for the matter to come to the Security Council, but the Human Rights Council is the right place for discussion now.

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70320-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07032055000011">People in the United Kingdom like birds. About 210 species of bird breed in the UK every year, many of which are rare. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has around 1.1 million members. Last Januaryup to 470,000 people took part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, and it is estimated that 2.85 million people regularly go birdwatching. This love of birds and nature contributes greatly to local economies, helping to attract tourists and day visitors, often to remote parts of rural England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70320-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07032055000012">Shropshire, like Devon, has its fair share of birdwatchers. Let me record my thanks to Shropshire&#146;s &#147;twitchers&#148; for their support for my campaign to obtain county wildlife status for Priorslee lake, home to the occasional visiting purple heron and pectoral sandpiper.</p>

It may be an inconvenient truth for unscrupulous local authorities and developers, but birds matter.</p>

That may be because the climate in continental Europe is becoming warmer, which means that birds have no need to migrate so far, and engage in so-called short-stopping.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70320-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07032055000015">There is also pressure on breeding birds; when feeding and nesting cycles begin to change, it creates new life challenges for all our feathered summer visitors, who may return to find the best breeding sites occupied by resident birds, and the first flash of caterpillars already gone. Much important monitoring work is undertaken by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which owns or manages 200 nature reserves. I am grateful for its support for my Bill, and to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The Government rightly made bird populations one of their quality-of-life indicators, but that indicator all too often reveals that some birds, particularly those on farm land, have yet to recover from the major declines of the 1970s and 1980s. It is therefore incumbent on us all, including the Government, to do all that we can to protect and nurture species that are few in number, as well as those that are plentiful, but whose loss would diminish our countryside and our great nation.</p>

new homes in Shropshire in the next decade, or the excessive new homes target for the rest of England and Wales? Britain&#146;s most common and best-loved birds that breed in hedgerows and trees all too often fall victim to developers and local authorities, who remove trees and hedges without due diligence and rightful consideration of birds&#146; nests and the important breeding season. Just imagine if there was no more symphony of the song thrush, no more rhapsody in yellow of the blue tit, no more Mendelssohnian accompaniment of the blackbird, no more red rapturous reaches of the robin, and no more soprano sonnets of the swallow. Imagine a world without birdsong&#151;a desolate landscape, souls unrevived, a gnawing and bereft silence. The Bill seeks to give added protection to those and other birds and their nests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70320-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07032055000017">Under the provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, it is an offence deliberately to damage or destroy wild birds and their nests, with certain exceptions, for which a licence is required. However, it is not an offence to do so if the accused can demonstrate that they were unaware of the consequences of their actions. The Bill would close that loophole by making reckless damage an offence, and it would require local authorities, developers and others to be far more careful in their local development, particularly in breeding season.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70320-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07032055000018">I remind the Minister for Local Environment, Marine and Animal Welfare that introducing an offence of recklessness in wildlife legislation would not be an innovation. Some offences in schedule 1 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, as amended, include &#147;recklessness&#148;, but the schedule does not apply to the more serious offences of destruction and reckless damage of birds&#146; nests. We might also look to Scotland, where the Scottish Parliament has rightly given birds added protection. The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 and the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 amended the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, making reckless damage an offence north of the border. Scottish legislation says that all birds, and their nests and eggs, are protected by law, and it is an offence, with certain exceptions, to intentionally or recklessly take, damage, or destroy or otherwise interfere with the nest of any wild bird while the nest is in use or being built.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70320-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07032055000019">The next time that colleagues see birds flying north, they should reflect that they might just be flying north to escape the weak wildlife laws in England and Wales. Closing the loophole would make it easier to deal with unscrupulous individuals who kill protected birds, sometimes rare species, and then claim that it was an innocent mistake. One example of such an occurrence was the shooting of a bittern, a rare heron, of which there are only about 50 breeding males left in the country. The individual who shot the bird claimed that he thought it was a pheasant.</p>

claiming that they thought it was a rook. Demonstrating intent in such cases is difficult, so closing the recklessness loophole would make people far more careful when shooting birds. That change could help, too, to protect rarer birds that nest on industrial sites, quarries and wasteland such as the black redstart, the UK population of which consists of fewer than 100 pairs. Other species that nest in those areas, usually near water, include the little ringed plover&#151;another scarce bird&#151;and the sand martin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70320-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07032055000021">That leads to the thorny issue of enforcement. While I welcome the fact that the Countryside and Rights of Way Act increased penalties for wildlife crime&#151;offenders now risk being jailed for up to six months or being fined up to &#163;20,000 for damaging sites of special scientific interest&#151;those laws must be enforced, and the police, Natural England and the Countryside Council for Wales must take wildlife crime far more seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70320-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07032055000022">In conclusion, will the Minister consider introducing measures to require local authorities and developers to carry out nest surveys before commencing works? The survey need not be complicated, but, if a development is likely to impinge on a habitat with nesting birds, surely developers should have to demonstrate that a bird survey had been undertaken. Will the Minister work with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds to agree what constitutes the breeding season? Currently, the breeding season is not defined in UK law, but the law does give protection to a nest while it is being built or is in use. That confusion does not help to reduce wildlife crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70320-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07032055000023">Bird populations should become quality-of-life indicators for local authorities, perhaps audited by the RSPB or by local wildlife trusts, and wildlife crimes should become performance indicators for police forces. Unless that happens, wildlife crime will continue to remain low on the police&#146;s list of priorities. There should be a standard police reporting format, which would allow greater transparency and traceability of action taken&#151;or not taken&#151;by police forces. The Government say that they want to save the planet, but if they cannot save the thousands of trees and hedges that are destroyed each year, and the bird species that rely on them, what real hope is there for any of us? Mankind does not own nature&#151;we are its custodians&#151;so it is the duty of all of us, including Government, to ensure that birds throughout England and Wales live to sing another day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="70320-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07032055000034">I am sure that the whole House will join me in paying tribute to William Wilberforce&#146;s 20 year campaign to secure the first piece of legislation to make slavery illegal. To put that in perspective, Parliament, prior to that legislation, had already passed over 100 laws accommodating the slave trade. Those laws allowed slaves to be treated by the courts as property, not as people. Many died and, yes, some were murdered, in the most criminal circumstances, with no redress.</p>

 No, and I will make that clear in my speech, as the hon. Gentleman did in the debate in Westminster Hall, which I read. The most horrific circumstances were described there, and we are grateful to the hon. Gentleman for holding that debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="70320-0004.htm_para24"><a name="07032055000037">William Wilberforce was the parliamentary leader of an abolitionist movement that embraced thousandsof people, from all walks of life. It became a mass movement of popular discontent against a barbaric and inhuman trade. Parliament had to accept the will of the people and the cause of the abolitionists. This bicentenary is an opportunity for us all to remember the millions who were sold into slavery, and also to remember the people who were horrified by the inhumanity and indignity of slavery and whose values of fairness and social justice led them to fight slavery. They included slaves and former slaves, Church leaders, Quakers, politicians and countless ordinary citizens who signed petitions, marched, lobbied and campaigned for change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="70320-0004.htm_para25"><a name="07032055000038">Some of those are remembered on the stamps which the Royal Mail is issuing for the anniversary on Thursday.

In Freetown in Sierra Leone, I saw where the slaves liberated by the Royal Navy came ashore via the freedom steps&#151;such a contrast to the point of no return.

They stressed to me the importance of looking forward as well as looking into the past. They felt that their school history lessons did not teach a proper black history or give enough attention to black achievements. &#147;Yes&#148;, they said, &#147;we should reflect on the past, but we should also look to the future.&#148; This year, we are considering important changes to the school curriculum. It will incorporate the study of the slave trade as a compulsory element of our history curriculum, with all slavery&#146;s brutality and inhumanity, and not just as an element of our colonial past.

The estimated value of that criminal activity is approximately $32 billion. The ILO says that 218 million children were trapped in child labour in 2004, of whom 126 million were in hazardous work.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the Deputy Prime Minister and a huge pleasure to agree with almost everything he said. That may be a rare event, but it is welcome. If William Wilberforce could have known that 200 years after the passage of the abolition Act a debate commemorating it would not only take place but be introduced by two Yorkshire Members of Parliament, one of them representing Hull, in a spirit of cross-party agreement for which he always fought, he would be proud.

The tale of his work&#151;and, importantly, that of his allies, as it was not simply his work&#151;is a truly inspiring story of high ideals pursued in spite of almost every conceivable adversity, and of enormous feats of argument that were all too often preceded by despair as to whether progress could ever be made.

 The hon. Gentleman has managed to put that on record without my needing to stagger into the controversy. William Wilberforce approached the abolition of the slave trade&#151;and, indeed, many other matters&#151;in a far more evangelical way than the Church of England at that time. He took up the cause and made it a Christian cause, but it was the Quakers and evangelicals in general, rather than the established Church, who helped to set him on that path, so the hon.

For him, the passing of the Act was the outcome of a 20-year parliamentary struggle. Almost every year for two decades he had introduced similar proposals in the Commons, only for them to be rejected because of powerful economic and political opposition, or to be thwarted because of war or hostility to the French revolution and social upheaval.</p>

There was much debate about this issue, but yes, the slave trade was thought to be very important to the economy of this country. William Pitt, when he was Prime Minister, said that 80 per cent. of Britain&#146;s overseas income was derived from our West Indian colonies, although not necessarily from the slave trade, the profitability of which was often disputed. That said, it was clearly profitable enough for alot of people in Liverpool and Bristol to engage init. However, through the existence of slavery, the plantations were clearly enormously profitable, at times, because of the immense European demand for sugar in the 18th century.</p>

The course of slavery winds a long route throughout history, and when we consider events before 1807&#151;the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned this&#151;it is with deep regret that we have to acknowledge an era in which the sale of men, women and children was carried out lawfully on behalf of this country, and on such a vast scale that it became a large and lucrative commercial enterprise. No wonder Wilberforce cried out, in his speech in the Commons in 1791:</p>
<a name="70320-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="07032039000311"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Never, never will we desist till we have wiped away this scandal from the Christian name, released ourselves from the load of guilt, under which we at present labour, and extinguished every trace of this bloody traffic, of which our posterity, looking back to the history of these enlightened times, will scarce believe that it has been suffered to exist so long a disgrace and dishonour to this country.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70320-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07032039000224">Those are words that we need to remember in the present day, as the Deputy Prime Minister said, in the case of modern slavery, to which I shall also return in a moment.</p>

 My right hon. Friend mentions the stoic perseverance of many individuals. I ask him to join me in acknowledging the contribution made by John Newton, the slave trader who became an abolitionist and parish priest of Olney, the town in which I now live.</p>

<p><a name="st_o120"><a name="07032039000226"><a name="70320-0006.htm_spnew3"><a name="07032039000455"><b>Mr. Hague:</b>
 This is becoming an interesting geographical and historical tour. John Newton was important partly in persuading William Wilberforce to continue in politics rather than lead a life of religious seclusion and that Christian principles needed to be put into action. Newton constantly counselled the abolitionists, so he played an important part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70320-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07032039000227">It is worth noting that the fight against the slave trade was also an early campaign against racism. It was an important attribute of the abolitionists that they set out not only to end the slave trade, but to demonstrate that former slaves could live freely and prosperously with equality between every race. They pioneered the free colony of Sierra Leone and gave much support to the leaders of Haiti, who had thrown off their colonial masters. The abolitionists believed not only in the relief of suffering but the establishment of racial equality. It must have been the first campaign of that kind.</p>

 I am sure that the right hon.

 That is an important point, because the campaign was not just a parliamentary campaign. Thomas Clarkson played an enormous part in the powerful extra-parliamentary campaign. In a world with so many recording devices of every kind, it is hard for us to imagine a political world without film or photographs, and no documentary of what was happening. The campaigners of the time had to establish facts that had never been nailed down and come up with statistics that no one had ever assembled. They had to persuade people of something that was true even though other people were prepared to say that the opposite was true.

Elizabeth Heyrick was one of the foremost women campaigners for the abolition of the institution of slavery after the slave trade itself had been abolished. We must remember, too, that we are unable to mention the bravery of numerous slaves: history is silent about that, because their actions were not written down at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70320-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07032039000235">We should also be proud that one of the great achievements of the abolitionist campaign was political engagement through the mobilisation of public opinion. Once people in this country realised that the nature of the slave trade was incompatible with the values that they upheld, they acted in their hundreds of thousands. Petitions signed by men and women with no vote and thus no method of lobbying Parliament flowed from all corners of the country. One petition from the inhabitants of Manchester measured 7 m in length, and the masses of anti-slave trade tracts that were distributed were vigorously read. People attended lectures and meetings, and Thomas Clarkson&#151;already mentioned by the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) and one of Wilberforce&#146;s indispensable allies&#151;covered 35,000 miles in seven years on speaking tours. Even with all the modern forms of transport available to us today, we would still consider that to be a large total. Clarkson took with him shackles and other instruments from slave ships, along with samples of African cloth to show that an alternative and civilised trade could be substituted for slavery.</p>

 It turned out that women were in a powerful position to impose that boycott, for the reasons that the hon. Lady set out. In the 1820s, the even more radical campaign to abolish the institution of slavery itself came to the fore in towns such as Leicester, Sheffield and Birmingham, with women as its pioneers.

Slavery is out of sight for most people, as it was 200 years ago, but the world faces a parallel challenge nevertheless: to confront a ruthless industry that exploits vulnerable people for financial gain. Just as the baton was passed from the abolitionists to other Parliaments and nations around the world, who followed suit in outlawing slavery, so now it rests with the Governments and Parliaments of our time to deal with modern slavery, which today reaches across every continent and culture, profiting from a range of industries in agriculture, textiles, construction, mining, domestic services and prostitution, to name but a few.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70320-0006.htm_para13"><a name="07032039000243">Human trafficking, the most talked about manifestation of modern slavery, is the medium by which that age-old practice permeates even the life of modern-day Britain, as the Deputy Prime Minister said. It exists very much as a product of the 21st century and operates in loose global networks, lurking among the unprecedented movements of people, information and capital that characterise today&#146;s global economy and which help mask illegal practices. Human trafficking works best for its instigators across national boundaries, exploiting cultural, social and linguistic differences to isolate individuals and allow criminals to exercise complete control. Recruitment companies or trusted acquaintances offering work and hope for a better future, bogus marriage agencies and gangs targeting lone travellers as they enter new countries are just a few examples of how vulnerable people can be caught in the human trafficking trap. There are of course more barbaric methods: intimidation, threats to families and psychological abuse, followed by violence of a quite unimaginable kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="70320-0006.htm_para14"><a name="07032039000244">The problem is growing locally and internationally. It has many links with other criminal operations, such as money laundering, drug smuggling and document forgery. In scale, it rivals and surpasses other illicit trades, equalling the illegal arms industry and trailing only narcotics in size. According to some estimates it generates nearly $10 billion a year in revenue, which is a staggering figure to have to put on a market dedicated to the buying and selling of human beings. In terms of people, it is estimated that between 600,000 and 800,000 men, women and children are trafficked across international borders each year. According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime no country in the world is immune to the problem, whether as a country of origin, destination or transit.</p>

A fortnight ago, an official at the Lithuanian Ministry of Information declared that Britain is the No. 1 destination for gangs smuggling sex slaves from countries such as his own. Last year, when our police conducted a four-month operation to tackle sex trafficking, they rescued 84 women&#151;a small number in the scheme of things, but the list of their countries of origin tells its own sorry tale of the trail of misery. Those 84 women came from Albania, Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, India, Iran, Jamaica, Kenya, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Namibia, Poland, Rwanda, Russia, Slovakia and Thailand.</p>

That can be achieved by a concerted and determined effort to disrupt the forces of demand and supply. Supply-side measures should be aimed at increasing the risks of capture, while simultaneously empowering vulnerable individuals through education and the increased provision of assistance, advice and protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="70320-0006.htm_para17"><a name="07032039000247">As long as the demand&#151;or the end use&#151;remains, cold-blooded people will always find unscrupulous ways to profit from the trade in illegal goods, be they arms, narcotics or, in this case, slave labour. Thus the only way truly to end the modern slave trade willbe to wipe out the demand. In parallels with the 18th-century sugar boycott, consumer groups can voice their abhorrence at slavery by purchasing certified fair trade goods such as tea, coffee, clothing and other consumables. A greater focus on educating the public is required, using innovative approaches such as the &#147;truth isn&#146;t sexy&#148; campaign, which uses beer-mat messages to alert young people to the realities of sex trafficking, and which will have its cross-party launch later this evening. As traffickers have now infiltrated a range of British towns, cities and the countryside, it is impossible to overstate the importance of bringing awareness to the consumers, businesses and communities in those places where the victims are forced to labour.</p>

Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), the shadow Home Secretary. That touches on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) a moment ago: certain actions affecting our own borders need to be taken. We hope that, at all ports of entry, our immigration officials will be permitted to conduct separate interviews for women and children travelling alone with an adult who is not a parent, guardian or husband; that co-ordination will be strengthened between relevant Departments and the Serious Organised Crime Agency in order to guarantee a coherent approach; that the Government will ensure that every police force and local authority has a strategy for dealing with suspected victims of trafficking; and that victim protection will be increased by setting up a dedicated helpline for those who have been trafficked. I hope, but I am not sure, that the Government will propose something that we have proposed for a long time: a UK border police force with specialist expertise to intercept traffickers and victims.</p>

Among other endeavours, it now produces on an annual basis an influential report on trafficking in persons. Other countries, including our own, should act with the same levels of commitment. The international community should work together to identify the countries that are the most vulnerable to human trafficking, be they a place of origin, transit or destination, and provide the assistance and encouragement needed, with prevention, law enforcement and victim protection where appropriate. Diplomatic channels should be used to put pressure on countries that ignore the problem. In extreme cases where co-operation is not forthcoming and no measurable improvement is made, assistance in non-humanitarian or non-trade-related areas could be withheld as a last resort. Our embassies and consulates should also take on a more active role, raising awareness through education and information programmes.</p>

They include people such as Sister Ann Theresa, a Catholic nun who established an underground network of safe houses throughout the UK for the victims of traffickingfor sexual exploitation, and journalists who have investigated the horrors of human trafficking at first hand, thus bringing the reality of the crime to the mainstream media, such as Nicholas Kristof of <i> The New York Times</i>. There are also campaigns such as Stop the Traffik, a global coalition of charities, schools, community groups, businesses, faith groups and clubs that has taken its inspiration directly from the work of the early abolitionists of 200 years ago and demonstrated a similar zeal and commitment. All these groups and individuals are leading the way, but we will start to challenge the traffickers&#146; dominance only when we secure the support of Governments throughout the world, voluntary organisations and the public at large.

There would be no more fitting way to mark the bicentenary than by renewing the abolitionists&#146; commitment to tackle the slave trade by practical action. In 1807, the House of Commons arrived rather late in offering to put the full power of the state behind the abolition movement. We in this Parliament, in modern times, must ensure that we bring all our collective political will to this struggle, thus helping to foster the involvement and education of our society to extinguish, in the words of Wilberforce,</p>

trade supply chain was the collection of slaves from interior Africa. They were tied into columns, loaded with 40 or 50-lb stones to make it harder for them to escape and marched hundreds of miles to the sea. Some came by canoe to the slave ports. They were tied up in canoes and lay in water for days in the bottom of boats with their faces baked by the sun. Like my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, I have visited one of the slave ports: Elmina Castle in Ghana. When the slaves reached the slave ports, they were put into stockades, sometimes by the thousand. At that point, about 20 per cent. of them died. They were then packed into galleys on ships where they lay side by side in spaces measuring 5 ft by 3 ft. Over the course of the slave trade, at least 450,000 black Africans died as a consequence of the Atlantic passage alone. They were packed in galleys and lay in their own urine and faeces during the weeks that it took to cross the Atlantic. They were sometimes released once a day, but sometimes not at all.</p>

 There is no doubt that both Africans and Arabs were involved in the slave trade, but I am going to move on and say that it was not Africans and Arabs who made massive fortunes or who founded an industrial revolution out of the slave trade. The slave trade was brutalising both to the slave and the slave holder, and I want to touch on that point before closing my remarks this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="70320-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07032039000266">As well as the sheer brutality and cruelty of the Atlantic slave trade, which lasted more than 300 years, it is important to stress how much it was part and parcel of British economic life for more than 300 years. The three great slave-holding ports were Bristol, Liverpool and London. Between 1630 and 1807, when the slave trade was abolished, 2.5 million Africans were bought and sold by Bristol slave merchants. Many of the wonderful houses, buildings and monuments that can be seen in Bristol today were built from the profits of the slave trade. As a man called Roger North, an attorney-general under James I, said of Bristol in the 17th century:</p>
<a name="70320-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="07032039000318"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;All men that are dealers, even in shop trades, launch into adventures by sea, chiefly to the West Indian plantations and Spain. A poor shopkeeper that sells candles will have a bale of stockings, a piece of stuff for Nevis and Virginia and rather than sail, they trade in men.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="70320-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07032039000319">The splendours and the beauty of a city like Bristol were built on the trade in men.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70320-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07032039000267">Liverpool was another great slave port. By the 1780s, two fifths of British slave ships were built in Liverpool. It became the largest slave ship construction site in Europe, squeezing Bristol out in the league table of slave trading ports. Huge fortunes were made from the slave trade by banks and manufacturers. To provide a few examples, there were the Heywood brothers, Arthur and Benjamin, who made their fortune in the slave trade. Arthur Heywood went on to found a bank, which became the bank of Liverpool, then Martin&#146;s bank and eventually Barclays bank. Thomas Leyland, another huge slave trader from Liverpool, served four terms as the city&#146;s mayor. He set up Leyland&#146;s bank, which became Bullins bank and eventually the Midland bank. Many mayors and MPs in Liverpool were slave traders, including the Gladstones. John Gladstone was a sugar planter in Guyana, who wrote a pro-slaver column in the Liverpool<i>  Mercury</i> and his son, of course, went on to grace this House as William Gladstone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="70320-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07032039000268">In London, my city, people sometimes minimise or discount its involvement in the slave trade, but it was involved in it for longer and deeper than any other part of the British Isles. In the years before 1698, theRoyal African Company shipped 100,000 Africans to the colonies. Fifteen Lord Mayors, 25 sheriffs and38 aldermen were shareholders in that company. The South Sea Company traded in slaves with South America. One of the many people who made fortunes from the company before the South Sea bubble burst was Thomas Guy, a bookseller, who used his fortune to  <br>

William Beckford, MP, owned 22,000 acres in Jamaica; his two brothers and his sons were also Members of Parliament. The Bishops of London were major slaveholders in Barbados. Another major slaveholder was Humphry Morice MP, governor of the Bank of England from 1727.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="70320-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07032039000270">My point is that the slave trade was not an aberration until, kindly, people woke up and realised that it was wrong. The slave trade was part and parcel of British economic and political life for more than300 years. I have mentioned the major ports&#151;Liverpool, Bristol, London and Glasgow&#151;but small ports around the country did a little slave trading too: Barnstaple, Bideford, Dartmouth, Exeter, Plymouth, Poole, Portsmouth and Whitehaven. We are not talking about an aberration that occurred on the fringes of British society; we are talking about something that was part and parcel of it for 300 years.</p>

 My hon. Friend speaks of a 300-year legacy. Between 1837 and 1918, half a million Indian indentured labourers went to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Guyana. Could that not be classed as an extension of the barbarism that led to profiteering in the City of London and elsewhere?</p>

 The history of Indian indentured labour is not as well known as it should be, but those labourers were certainly in a position of quasi-slavery. In fact, they were brought in to take over from slaves who would no longer do the work and ran up into the hills, where my family come from, to survive on subsistence agriculture.</p>

I do not want to take anything away from William Wilberforce, but the abolition of the slave trade, like any great social movement, was not a purely parliamentary process. The slave revolts, which happened all over the Caribbean, played their part in 1790. Haiti was the first country to abolish slavery, following a revolution under the leadership of Toussaint L&#146;Ouverture. There were rebellions in Grenada, Dominica, St Vincent, Tobago and Barbados, and finally, in 1831, there was a massive slave revolt in Jamaica led by Sam Sharpe.</p>

importance cannot be overestimated. Again, I do not wish to take anything away from Wilberforce, but it would do a disservice to the British people to understate the extent to which not just parliamentary leadership but a massive popular agitation createdthe conditions for the abolition of slavery. In 1792, Parliament received 500 anti-slavery petitions; by 1830, it had received 5,000. Between 1826 and 1832, the House of Lords received 3,500. In an era when people did not have the vote, that was the only way in which they could make politicians aware of what they felt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="70320-0007.htm_para13"><a name="07032039000277">Nowadays, humanitarian liberal issues are sometimes derided as issues for the chattering classes and the London intelligentsia, but the remarkablething about the agitation against slavery was that it covered all parts of the country. In 1789, the <i> Leeds Intelligencer</i>, a newspaper, reported a collection of &#163;18&#151;it does not sound much, but it was a huge amount in those days&#151;in support of the campaign against slavery. It was collected by farmers in Yorkshire who, as the <i> Leeds Intelligencer</i> put it, had been</p>
<a name="70320-0007.htm_brev2"><a name="07032039000320"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;informed of the injustice and inhumanity of the slave trade by pamphlets&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="70320-0007.htm_para14"><a name="07032039000278">Reading about the popular agitation, it is remarkable that it involved ordinary people from all corners of the country. Once they learned the facts, they rose up against slavery, signed petitions and supported people such as Wilberforce. There was no self-interest involved; they were just genuinely moved by the inhumanity of a barbaric trade. In recent years, in the Make Poverty History campaign, ordinary and church people were swept up in the campaign against poverty in Africa, and in many ways, the anti-slavery agitation was the Make Poverty History campaign of its day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70320-0007.htm_para15"><a name="07032039000279">There were, of course, also the abolitionists&#151;the lawyers and campaigners here in London. There was Granville Sharp, Lord Mansfield and his very important finding in the Somerset case, Thomas Clarkson, and William Wilberforce with his 20-year campaign. Of course, we are commemorating the abolition of the slave trade, but slavery itself was not finally abolished until 1833. This House debates modern-day slavery and modern-day forced labour, which are terrible things, and we need to take action in the spirit of Wilberforce and others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70320-0007.htm_para16"><a name="07032039000280">If we were to draw a lesson from the abolition of the slave trade, it would be this: like all great popular movements, it did not start in Parliament, although, in a sense, it ended in Parliament. It is a credit to ordinary, British people across the country that they were prepared to rise up against slavery. It was, in its origins, a popular agitation, although it was led by Quakers, evangelists, and religious people. Abolition was essentially due to popular agitation, as well as a parliamentary Act. Contemplation of the brutality of the slave trade ought to remind the House of what happens when we dehumanise people and say that they are not human beings. When we read about how slaves were treated in the middle passage, on the plantations, and even by their owners in London, we are shocked, but the people involved at the time were not shocked, because they did not see the slaves as human beings. Indeed, one of the achievements of the religious campaigners against slavery&#151;the Quakers and so on&#151;was that they stressed the essential humanity of slaves.</p>

There is a comforting view of the history of the slave trade&#151;I suspect that most people in the country subscribe to it to some extent&#151;that goes roughly as follows: of course, the slave trade was a terrible episode, but it was a long time ago.

Tobago, described in detail. He was the first person to analyse the economics of the slave trade and the triangular movement between west Africa, Europeand the Caribbean, showing how that led to the accumulation of capital, which formed the basis of investment in early industrialisation. The slave trade was, as the hon. Lady eloquently said, at the centre, not at the periphery of the British economy. It was something in which all parts of British society were implicated&#151;it was not just a few roughneck captains and the odd aristocrat who had plantations in the Caribbean&#151;and it was the basis of the prosperity of the Church and, one should add, of the royal family. The hon. Lady mentioned Members of Parliament, but she understated her case, because in 1720, it was recorded that 420&#151;not 40&#151;Members of the House of Commons invested in the South Sea company, which was the main financial vehicle for investment in the slave trade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="70320-0007.htm_para22"><a name="07032039000287">As the hon. Lady said&#151;and this is important&#151;there was not a wonderful moment of enlightenment when Britain was suddenly converted to the abolition of slavery. Tellingly, the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks made reference&#151;and he has written brilliantly on the subject&#151;to the first and greatest Prime Minister in the Conservative tradition, William Pitt. May I allude to perhaps the greatest Prime Minister in the Liberal tradition&#151;W. E. Gladstone, behind whom there is a rather unfortunate history that is not widely known? It is not just that he entered the House as a Tory&#151;I do not think that that meant a great deal in those days&#151;but that his maiden speech was a passionate defence of slavery. He made that speech 25 years after the abolition of the slave trade, because his family owned plantations, and he believed that he should justify that practice. That is how he began his political life&#151;it was not just a personal idiosyncrasy but a reflection of the view among much of the British establishment that although the slave trade was sordid, we had got rid of it, and there was nothing inherently wrong in owning slaves and profiting from them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70320-0007.htm_para23"><a name="07032039000288">It therefore took a great deal of time finally to eradicate slavery. My final point about its history was made eloquently by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. It was not just liberal white abolitionists who were involved in the movement against the slave trade, as black slaves contributed enormously to their own emancipation. There were slave uprisings, and freed black slaves in Britain such as Equiano agitated and contributed to the movement. The hon. Lady missed one small detail in the story, as a key factor that provoked the uprisings in the Caribbean was the French revolution. It is often forgotten that some of the French revolutionaries were black and, for the first time, the French revolution promoted the concept that all men&#151;women were not included at that time&#151;were equal, which was a devastating conceptto unleash on a slave society. It was only when Napoleon&#151;who, among his less attractive attributes, was a virulent racist&#151;re-imposed authority that the slave uprisings were finally brought under control. That was a key stage, and it was the black revolutionaries who did much to create the climate of opinion leading to abolition.</p>

The obvious response, which is the one that I tend to give, is that, put in a very crude way, that is not a helpful suggestion because clearly, in any sensible ethical system, one cannot apologise for things that happened 10 generations ago.

It is the third largest source of illegal income, after drugs and illegal armaments transactions. There are probably about27 million people who are directly involved in slaveryin quite a narrowly defined sense.

The reason is that millions of people who were engaged in subsistence living, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, have suddenly entered the modern economy and are freely available in vast supply. The result is the phenomenon to which the Deputy Prime Minister alluded when he cited the case of the British traffickers who have been dealing in people. The figures that he gave were between &#163;2,000 and &#163;10,000, I think. Traffickers can acquire people who are equivalent to slaves for &#163;100 in the countries of origin. There is enormous scope for mark-ups; that is what is driving the trade and why it is expanding so virulently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70320-0008.htm_para5"><a name="07032039000296">The next question is what we do about it. Many of the arguments have already been touched on. As the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks suggested, it is partly about border protection and controls. That is one dimension, but the other is that of ensuring that trafficked people who are intercepted are properly protected. For the past few years, Liberal Democrats have been pursuing the issue of the signing and ratification of the European Council resolution on this matter, which provides an extra degree of protection for trafficked people. We know that the Government have reservations about that, notably on the 90-day reflection period, but I wonder whether Ministers could summarise in the wind-ups where we currently stand with this argument. Our belief, looking at the experiences of countries such as Italy which provide that degree of protection, is that it has not acted as a pull factor in the way that the Government feared. In fact, the Italians have been able to make 100 times as many prosecutions of traffickers on the basis of the laws that they employ.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="70320-0008.htm_para6"><a name="07032039000297">I turn finally to a point that has not yet been made, although the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington hinted at it in her peroration&#151;that is, whether we sufficiently acknowledge the role of the black community in Britain and the extent to which, in a country that once had slavery, we now fully accept our own black citizens as complete equals and accept them with dignity. It is a very mixed story. Over my lifetime, we have moved away from open and explicit racial discrimination, which was common and openly advertised. We do not have ghetto-style segregation, as in the United States. We have social trends such as very high levels of intermarriage between white and black people, which indicates at least a degree of optimism about the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70320-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07032039000298">There is however a negative side that we must be open and honest about. Despite successes in many activities, there are still serious problems with discrimination. For example, the Metropolitan police have tried harder than most institutions to get rid of racism, but over the past few days Ali Dizaei&#146;s book has pointed out that many of the practices of the past still persist. In the past few weeks, we have seen a report showing how entrenched the differences are in educational performance. Ever since I came into the House, I have taken a personal interest in young offenders, and I go regularly to Feltham to pursue the issues there. The minute one goes into the place, it is very striking that 65 per cent. of all the prisoners are from ethnic minorities, and the vast majority are black. Clearly, something has gone fundamentally wrong with the way in which black youth is being dealt with in British society that perpetuates this disadvantage.</p>

That is what slavery was about; it illustrates the brutality involved in the slave trade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70320-0008.htm_para12"><a name="07032063000007">We would do well to ensure that, this year of all years, all the children in schools in this country and around the world begin to understand what the slave trade meant&#151;the brutality and the horror of it, as well as the bravery of those who campaigned against it, and the even greater bravery of those who took part inthe slave rebellions in Africa, the Americas and the Caribbean. As the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks pointed out, their names were not recorded in most cases. They led apparently useless rebellions, but word got through and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said, evil was eventually outed and defeated. However, it took a very long time to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70320-0008.htm_para13"><a name="07032063000008">Slavery was not a neutral occupation. As my hon. Friend pointed out, Members of Parliament were deeply involved in the slave trade. It was a central core of British life. We have only to look at the names of the buildings and roads in Bristol, Liverpool and London. In Bristol, we find Colston hall, named after a great slave owner, and Whiteladies road, where white ladies went to buy black boys as their slaves. That was all part of British life, and defeating it was a great achievement. The profits from the slave trade were astronomical. One of the most formative books that I have ever read is the wonderful work by the late Dr. Eric Williams, &#147;Capitalism and Slavery&#148;, which I think was his PhD thesis when he was at the London School of Economics. In it, he describes the riches that the City of London and other places made from the slave trade.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is quite right about Edward Colston, who was notorious in Bristol as someone who earned a great deal of his wealth from the slave trade. A number of places in the city are indeed named after him.There is, however, a lot of mythology surrounding Whiteladies road and Blackboy hill. There is no evidence whatever that they were in any way linked to the slave trade.</p>

 There is no evidence to the contrary, either. A couple of weeks ago, I was at an interesting meeting to commemorate the abolition of the slave trade, and I had a long discussion about this with some extremely learned people. Gus John and Alex Pascall both assured me that Whiteladies road had that connotation. We should think about these things quite carefully, and about the history of the slave trade and what it meant to so many people.</p>

William Beckford became the first English millionaire MP. I think that there might be quite a few millionaires in the Chamber, or at least in this building, at the moment, but I am not one of them&#151;[Hon.

Interestingly, however, their involvement in that campaign did not have much direct connection with the slave uprisings going on at the same time. They saw their campaign as a campaign in Britain. At the same time as a high moral stance was being taken by Britain against the slave trade, the slave uprisings taking place all over the Caribbean and the Americas&#151;partly in response to the French revolution but also in response to other factors&#151;were being brutally put down by the British Army, while the British Navy was stopping the slave trade taking place on the high seas.

We are also aware of very poor people, mainly from south Asia, being transported, virtually, into economic zones in the Gulf states and other places and forced to work for low wages, with no trade union or other rights.

 I do not always agree with much of what the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) says, but I am broadly in sympathy with the points that he made this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70320-0009.htm_para0"><a name="07032063000026">I should begin, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) did, by declaring an interest. In 1983, when we commemorated the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery, as distinct from the slave trade, I published a short life of William Wilberforce, which is now sadly out of print. <i> [Interruption.] </i>My right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks has the field to himself. When I was writing the book, I became increasingly aware of what a great man William Wilberforce was. I do not detract from what people have said about others, including Thomas Clarkson, Granville Sharp and John Venn. The list is long and many anonymous people made a genuine contribution, especially the slaves themselves. However, William Wilberforce was the parliamentary spearhead and an extraordinary man&#151;unprepossessing in appearance, short of stature, physically frail, yet with an indomitable spirit. He fought tenaciously, suffered many setbacks and, for 20 long years, embodied the abolitionist cause in this place. It is good for us as Members of Parliament to reflect on what a man who never held high office, nor ever aspired to it, could achieve by his persistence and&#151;as Sir Samuel Romilly said at the time when slavery itself was finally abolished&#151;by his sheer goodness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="70320-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07032063000027">Wilberforce was not a party man. Some of my colleagues like to claim that he was a Tory, but he was not; he was an independent Member of Parliament. He was a very close friend of William Pitt, but, as I have said, he never aspired to high office. He was the absolute embodiment of what an independent-minded Member of Parliament can be, and his work is an example to us all of what such a man can achieve. I believe that he was the greatest Back Bencher of all time; I do not know whether my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks has come to the same conclusion&#151;we shall have to wait for his book to be published to find that out. Wilberforce is certainly one of the pre-eminent figures in the parliamentary roll of honour, which includes Shaftesbury, Joseph Arch and many others. On almost exactly the same date asthe Bill to abolish the slave trade received Royal Assent&#151;25 March&#151;it is good that we are reflectingon what one of our past parliamentary colleagues achieved by his campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70320-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07032063000028">Wilberforce was an inspiration. He was the conscience of the nation. He was not, of course, solely concerned with fighting to abolish the slave trade, although that is what he will always be most remembered for. He was a great Christian campaigner  <br>

who wanted to bring his own particular religious fervour to the attention of people, believing that he had something to transmit to them. He was a great friend of Pitt, as I have said. He was also a great admirer of Fox. Pitt and Fox stood together with him against this ghastly trade. One thing he lamented about Pitt and Fox was that they did not have his religious conviction and fervour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70320-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07032063000029">We already have a fine portrait in the Palace of Westminster, and I would like us to have a special commemoration of William Wilberforce to mark this 200th anniversary. I have on my desk at home a little ashtray&#151;one should not say &#147;ashtray&#148; these days, of course&#151;which was produced by Wedgwood in 1983 and which reproduces the famous image of the black man in chains with the slogan around it:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70320-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07032063000030">That gave great inspiration to Wilberforce. I would love it to be reproduced as a plaque, and for it to be placed in the Members&#146; Lobby among the memorials to Prime Ministers, because Wilberforce achieved more than most of the Prime Ministers whom we rightly commemorate and revere in the Central Lobby today. It would be a splendid commemoration of this 200th anniversary if we could do something like that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70320-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07032063000031">Members have referred to the fact that what Wilberforce achieved 200 years ago in spearheading this campaign was not the end; of course it was not. However, we can draw various lessons from it that are highly relevant for today. One of them I would take from the speech that Wilberforce made on 18 May 1789, when he truly launched the parliamentary campaign. Sitting around him were Members who&#151;as earlier speakers have reminded us&#151;derived great wealth from the slave trade. However, Wilberforce in his campaign did not seek to castigate or attack his colleagues. He was prepared to accept that many of them were ignorant of the slave trade and what it all meant. He was prepared to give them that benefit of the doubt and to seek to enlighten them, and all his other colleagues, as to how great an evil this was. We can sometimes learn from that&#151;that we must not attribute the worst motives to everybody. In trying to enrol them in a cause&#151;whatever it may be&#151;we must show them that we will give them the benefit of the doubt, but that, having set the facts before them, we want them to join the campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70320-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07032063000032">The campaign that we want everyone to join todayis the one referred to by a number of colleagues: the campaign against human trafficking and the exploitation of men and women by others for profit. In those days, some Members of Parliament benefited from the slave trade, but I do not suppose that a single Member of Parliament benefits from these awful things today.

Last year, in my capacity as Chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, I presented in Northern Ireland a report on organised crime in the Province. Particularly apparent, apart from the dimension of paramilitary involvement, was the very important part that human trafficking was playing in the criminal&#146;s apparatus. Human trafficking was joining counterfeiting of goods, smuggling and all the other illicit and revolting things, such as money laundering and fuel laundering. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I am glad that at this point, the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) has entered the Chamber. He played a valuable part in that inquiry, and it was very significant and disturbing that human trafficking was becoming part of organised crime in Northern Ireland, too. It is doing so throughout the United Kingdom, and we must do everything that we can to root this evil out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70320-0009.htm_para8"><a name="07032063000034">One of the worst things that any of us have heard of in recent months is the stories of young girls&#151;they have been referred to today by other speakers&#151;some in their early teens, from eastern Europe and elsewhere who are brought here and used as instruments of pleasure by evil men, sometimes assisted by evil women. That has got to be attacked. So when we mark a very notable occasion&#151;the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade is one&#151;we want to do two things. Yes, we want to give thanks and to take a quiet pride in what was achieved through this place, although not entirely and solely. In her moving speech, the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), made that plain; nevertheless, we can all take pride in what was achieved here, whichever part of the House we sit in and whatever our political or personal background. There is always a time for giving thanks and celebration, but celebration is hollow and giving thanks is barren unless we also rededicate ourselves to attacking the descendent evils of the slave trade and slavery.</p>

Member for Islington, North reminded us&#151;but shackled in a different way. We have no right to call ourselves a truly civilised society unless we do everything to root out that evil that is still in our midst. I hope therefore that as a result of today&#146;s debate there will be a new dedication throughout the House to attack the descendent evils of slavery and the slave trade that still disfigure society today.</p>

should first say that I am angry about not being taught my history in school. It was almost as if black history and the important contribution by African people were deliberately left off the agenda. I ask myself why that was so. Perhaps some answers may emerge in the debate today. March 25 2007 is an important anniversary, but many of those in slavery did not get their freedom until 1838 and, as we have heard today, slavery and discrimination sadly continue to the present day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70320-0009.htm_para10"><a name="07032063000037">I wish to talk about discrimination in education. Bernard Coard&#146;s report in the 1970s, which is still relevant today, described a multitude of factors that combined to depress the achievement of black boys. He identified three factors that caused that. First were low expectations on the part of black boys about their likely performance in a white-controlled system of education. Second came low motivation to succeed academically because black boys felt that the cards were stacked against them. Third came low teacher expectations that affected the amount of effort they expended on black boys&#146; and those boys&#146; own image of themselves and their abilities. Such discrimination still exists today and that report is still very relevant today. Black students are given harsher reprimands for the same misdemeanours as their white counterparts and, as we talk about the historical context of slavery and its legacy, we must also consider modern education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70320-0009.htm_para11"><a name="07032063000038">Sunday will mark 200 years since the British abolition of the slave trade or, as some call it, BAST. It was an important step but, as we have heard, Britain was just playing catch-up to a growing revolt. Slavery in the British empire came to an end after a rebellion led by a Jamaican slave called Sam Sharpe. He was the Martin Luther King of the 19th century, opting for non-violent passive resistance to slavery. Many other people will not be mentioned today but should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70320-0009.htm_para12"><a name="07032063000039">As we mark this year, we must think about our legacy as a Government and as British society. It is important that we teach in context what happened so that we may understand the legacy of slavery today. I use legacy as a term to define what has been passed to the present, and those enslaved gave their tomorrows for our todays. All aspects of black history must be mainstreamed into the national curriculum. The Government&#146;s recent announcement that the story of the slave trade would be taught in schools is a small step forward. I am happy that we are having this debate: we must not forget that the British economy was built on the backs of those who suffered in slavery, but I would love an end to be put to Black History Month. I want black history to be amalgamated into the general history of the country, so that it is talked about and celebrated every day.</p>

My constituency of Brent has the largest number of African-Caribbeans in the country, and I am sure that young people there would love to learn about the Jamaican Sam Sharpe, who triggered rebellion among thousands of slaves by telling them that they were free, even when they were not.

Friends the Members for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington and for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn). For instance, the banks were directly linked to the slave trade: Barclays was established by two plantation owners who traded in slaves, and Lloyds began as a centre where runaway slaves were collected before establishing itself in 1692 as a insurance business covering slaves, slave ships and the plantations. Will history courses teach that, or will they concentrate only on the capture of innocent Africans? We must tread very carefully.</p>

They could involve trafficking for sexual purposes, domestic servitude, forced labour or forced marriage, or, as has more recently been discovered, the use of Vietnamese boys in the suburbs&#151;not the inner-city areas&#151;to look after cannabis farms and to water plants. There is confusion about what is trafficking and what is smuggling. Trafficking is about being duped or deceived. Often victims of trafficking are offered what seems to be an appealing opportunity to go abroad. Thousands of girls and boys are driven away by violence, rape and murder in Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07032063000071">I came back from Romania this morning, where I went underground to look at this whole subject and to see what drives women in some of the poorest areas in Romania away from those places. They live in the most squalid, appalling conditions&#151;worse than I ever saw when I was a community worker in east London40 years ago. I am talking about the kind of squalor that people in this country would not leave their animals in. There are mud floors, concrete walls that have split, rat-infested rooms, no electric lights, no fridges, no water and a lot of drink and drunkenness, which is driving young girls out of their homes into the arms of their lover boys, as they are called. They are then brought to Spain, Italy and the UK. It is an appalling picture. One of our EU countries&#151;I have a lot of affection for Romania and Bulgaria&#151;is a centre for such girls, who see no way out of their lives other than to be trafficked and to come to this country to be used for sex.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07032063000072">Those involved in trafficking are essentially business men, aiming to make profits by offering a product for sale where there is demand for it. People trafficking has grown and the demand is still growing. There seems to be an endless supply. As long as there is poverty and appalling abuse at the other end, girls and boys&#151;Members should not think that it is just girls; it is boys too&#151;will be trafficked through to the western areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07032063000073">To deal with this new scourge, a huge range of advisers, consultants, officials, fledgling international organisations and non-governmental organisations have grown up. I went to Vienna last year to a conference. I was the only MP there. There were 450 officials, and I do not think that any of them had ever actually seen a victim. They were most concerned with getting money for research. They were concerned about the legal aspects of whether countries could prosecute, and they loved attending conventions. It was like there was a huge circus-load of people who apparently went round the world attending conventions and making comments. There were always papers being given. Trafficking seems to have produced an awful lot of experts and, although some of them do a lot of good work, few of them are victim-oriented. They are just involved in the organisation and conventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07032063000074">The best way to halt the vile trade in people is to make life nasty for the traffickers. I welcome the fact that the action plan is coming out so soon&#151;mind you, it was promised last summer, but it is good that it is coming out later this week. It has to make life nasty for traffickers. If traffickers do not have life made nasty for them, they will go on doing trafficking, because the demand is so great. If we make life nasty for them in this country, we have to persuade our European partners to make life equally nasty for them in their countries, otherwise those involved will just the switch  <br>

the location of their trafficking. If we can make it nasty enough, they will switch from human trafficking to other forms of crime, but at least we will have got human trafficking off the agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07032063000075">We have to realise that Wilberforce&#146;s achievements have a shadow cast over them, because of these new forces of evil and slavery. I believe the best people to help to stop this new form of slavery are, first, the immigration services, then the police and the victim-based non-governmental organisations and shelters. Although there is plenty of law to shop traffickers, according to a parliamentary question that I asked on 23 October last year, as well as one that I asked on9 January this year, only 30 traffickers were sentenced last year. I am not making any criticism of the Government at all, but it is an indictment that, in the context of the massive numbers of women involved, the thousands of traffickers, the hundreds of non-governmental agencies and this debate today, only30 traffickers were sentenced. That requires some comment, or some thinking about. How are we going to improve that situation? There are thousands of traffickers living and working in Britain.</p>

We have had successful operations in relation to people coming into this country, such as Operation Pentameter. We are leading Europe on providing for victims and ensuring that people are recognised at ports. This must be an international issue and it needs to be dealt with through international action. We are making great progress, and we are recognised as a leader in Europe.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 22 February 2007; Vol. 457, c. 403.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07032063000077">I am not quite sure who recognises us as a leader in Europe. How are people going to be recognised at ports? Is this a sort of beauty parade? Will officials say, &#147;There&#146;s another trafficker?&#148; What do they do when they see the traffickers? If traffickers are recognised, what are we going to do with them? They may have served a prison sentence or have a criminal record,but we cannot just send them back if they are fromEU countries. I am concerned, because how will immigration officers be able to do anything just because traffickers are recognised? Perhaps the Minister did not fully think through that remark.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07032063000078">How well are immigration officers doing? They are our front-line staff at ports of entry. What information do they receive and from whom, and when they get their information what can they do with it? Can they put somebody who has been convicted of trafficking back on the next plane? Have they got the power to do that? What about the human rights of the person who was guilty of trafficking some way back? Bad track records will not prevent other EU citizens from coming into Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07032063000079">On my recent visit to Europol, in The Hague, it was stressed that there was indifferent communication and that there were different priorities between the 27 EU countries. The information provided by Britain was criticised. I am sure that the Minister will be concerned, as I was, that Europol was not entirely complimentary about the British approach to Europol  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Mar 2007">

and to providing information to it. There are 500 or so Europol staff and they are only as good as the questions they ask or the information that they are given. Until there is a minimum common standard in relation to the accuracy of fingerprinting, DNA, and photographic as well as gun profiles, the measures taken will be useless. There are 27 countries with 27 lots of criminals. Unless we get accurate information, people with appalling criminal records are going to come in and out of Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07032063000080">I was particularly concerned about how, as a result of the action plan, criminals from those countries would be apprehended at Heathrow, and about whether they would be sent back, or followed. Are there teams of people in all ports of entry waiting to see who is coming through and do intelligence officers then follow that up?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07032066000001">The answer is that that does not happen. The fact that the convictions of only 30 traffickers have been managed should worry the whole House. If there has been a failure to apprehend the criminal gangs at ports of entry and there is no hope of apprehending victims of trafficking or slave children, what chance do the police have of finding either the victims or the gangs?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07032066000002">Although I have expressed concern about immigration officials, I make no criticism of them at all&#151;they are powerless. The idea that we will stop trafficking through any of the ports of entry is pure moonshine. The gangs and victims are going through passport control and the immigration service, so the police have to chase everything up&#151;when the horse has bolted, bring in the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07032066000003">Until the introduction of Operation Pentameter, which has received considerable and well deserved publicity, there was little focus in this country on the new forms of slavery. I pay tribute to Operation Pentameter. Every one of the 55 police forces was involved in the three-month operation during which84 victims of trafficking were discovered, 12 of whom were minors. However, who are they? Where are they now? Why do we not have a permanent Operation Pentameter? Why is not every policeman trained so that he is aware of, and able to look out for, human trafficking? Should not every police force have a designated unit that focuses on trafficking? Should there not be a national focus under one commander? When the action plan is published, I am hoping to hear that something along those lines will be introduced, but the measure must be permanent. There is no point in having operations that last for three months and are then closed down because they are too expensive or difficult. Once the trafficked people are found, the problem is what to do with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07032066000004">One of the ways of getting a better sense of perspective about the scale of the trafficking problem would be to establish an independent national rapporteur or investigation bureau on human trafficking, as is the case in the Netherlands. I had the good fortune to visit that body recently and I was impressed by its independence. It conducts research on human trafficking in the Netherlands, produces statistics and figures and works with the police and Government agencies. The important aspect of the system is that the rapporteur is responsible for reporting on national statistics and emerging issues and the matter is debated annually in Parliament. There are thus actual figures to show what is going on in that  <br>

According to a written answer, the total number of people chargedby the Crown Prosecution Service for the offence of human trafficking under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 was 132. However, let me cite further the reply, because it contained some rather interesting figures. I apologise for asking so many questions, but they show up the lack of available information. The reply said that the establishment of the United Kingdom human trafficking centre led to a multi-agency operation</p>

 I quite understand that, but the point is that the numbers are trivial. Only 132 people have been charged with trafficking, yet we believe that tens of thousands of people have been trafficked. The can of worms has barely been opened. I find it difficult to be complacent about the situation and to suggest that the Government have a good track record. I am delighted that they have started to address the problem, but they have only just started. I am worried about the figures. While 132 people were charged, only 30 have been convicted, so we are talking about tiny numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70320-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07032066000009">The fact that more people are charged with the trafficking of people under immigration legislation than the Sexual Offences Act is a good illustration that the Government see human trafficking as a problem relating to immigration rather than human rights. In answer to a question that I tabled in June 2006 onchild trafficking, the Government said that at least12 defendants were charged in three separate cases involving female victims of trafficking between the ages of 15 and 18. Ten of them were convicted and received lengthy sentences.</p>

Every time that I ask a question about the new forms of human slavery, the anticipated answer is that the POPPY project is dealing with the matter. Let us consider the reality of the POPPY project. It is rightly given tremendous and continuous publicity. Every time a Minister answers a question about this issue from the Dispatch Box, POPPY pops up. I do not want to trivialise POPPY&#146;s achievements, but the project must be viewed in perspective. POPPY has only 25 beds, which are in London alone, and a further 10 emergency beds, if required. I am told that when Operation Pentameter was in force, POPPY&#146;s places were nearly full. However, once Pentameter ceased, the number of referrals fell. When I made an inquiry about four months ago, the number of women in the care of POPPY was down to 16 out of a possible 35.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para0"><a name="07032066000021">There are a number of reasons for that. First, one has to be over 18 to go to POPPY; under-18s are turned away. Secondly, under-18s go into local authority care. POPPY deals only with trafficking or slavery for sexual exploitation. Victims of forced labour or domestic servitude or forced marriage are turned away. POPPY provides unconditional support only for a so-called reflection period of four weeks. It works only in London, so there is no equivalent POPPY project for people in Manchester, Birmingham or Sheffield. If I am wrong about that, perhaps the Minister can put me right. It works for a short period of four weeks and if support is to last any longer, the victim has to offer information about their traffickers; otherwise, they are asked to leave. I do not believe that that has been a very successful approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07032066000022">Up to 4,000 women a year are trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation. The POPPY project mapping report, &#147;Sex in the City&#148;, shows evidence of off-street prostitution in 22 London boroughs. An estimated80 per cent. of people working in brothels, saunas and massage parlours are non-British nationals&#151;80 per cent. of prostitutes come from abroad. It is rather like restaurants; people seem to want a choice, whether it be Indian or Chinese. They go for a range of people who have been trafficked into this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07032066000023">What happened to the women in the POPPY project? Nobody knows. Have they been sent back home or integrated into this country; and what has happened to the 277 referrals? Nobody knows. I must say that I am increasingly concerned about where all the women have gone to. What about the 3,800 whom POPPY did not deal with? What has happened to them? POPPY says that it is looking after as many people as it possibly can, but the attitude in Britain towards trafficked people is very different from thatin Holland or Italy. As Britain is about to sign the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings, should we not be planning a slightly more constructive approach?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07032066000024">The Minister boasts that the POPPY project provides protection and assistance to adult victims, safe accommodation and a range of support services, but I wonder whether the House knows that women in the POPPY project who have entered the UK illegally do not have access to medical care. They are not entitled to any medical care whatever if they are illegal entrants. Many face multiple problems, including physical ones, and sexually transmitted diseases, yet they are not entitled to medical facilities. Does the Minister know that; will she deal with it in her winding-up speech?</p>

When she said that, was she aware that 4,885 girls aged between 15 and 19, and 6,170 boys sought asylum in the UK in 2005&#151;about 11,000 children? According to the Home Office website, in 2005, out of 2,835 decisions, 700 were refused. I am not sure what has happened to the other 7,000. The numbers do not add up.

 I would like to offer the hon. Gentleman some reassurance. I received a letter this morning from the director of children&#146;s services in Liverpool, telling me that Liverpool is one of two centres in the UK to take unaccompanied children coming into this country to seek asylum. I was informed that there was a panoply of provision for those children that was equal to anything that we would provide for our own children. The director of children&#146;s services wrote to ask me for further assistance, but he also took the opportunity to outline the Government&#146;s plans for a network of centres throughout the UK for these children in order to ensure that when they arrive they are adequately taken care of and protected.</p>

 That is very reassuring, but it cannot be reassuring to the boys who were watering the cannabis plants, because they were illegal immigrants. They were failed asylum seekers and they were not going to be looked after. The problem is that we are talking about 10,000 children who applied for asylum, but the figures do not square up. I am delighted to hear what the hon. Lady says, but the figures do not square with what the Government are producing in relation to where these young people are. The truth is that nobody cares about them because they have no family or friends here. They are victims and it is up to us to ensure that they are protected.</p>

This is a highly recognised and responsible organisation and its report appeared in all the national newspapers for one day, but where have those 48 children gone? We need to do some detective work. I am delighted that some are being looked after, but an awful lot of them are not, and when they go missing they get re-trafficked.

I met some of the top professionals&#151;from police chiefs to mayors&#151;trying to get to grips with the problem, which remains intangible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07032066000032">What could the Government do? For starters, they could withdraw their reservation in respect of immigration and nationality on the 1989 UN convention on the rights of the child. In an answer to my parliamentary question of 26 February 2007, the Home Secretary stated that the Government believed that without the reservation on the UN protocol, the interpretation of the convention might come into conflict with domestic legislation on migration&#151;but that does not square with signing up to the European convention, whose purpose is to protect children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07032066000033">What this debate should achieve is the highlighting of the extent of the problem in Britain. What weknow about trafficking leads me to believe that we have seen a tip of an iceberg. Although we should certainly congratulate the Government and the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety&#151;unfortunately, he has just left the Chamber and did not hear my compliment&#151;who is responsible for trafficking, my conclusion is that there still an immense amount of talk and a large number of meetings, but little to be seen on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07032066000034">The fact that up to 800.000 people each year are trafficked in one way or another; the fact that Lithuania says that Britain is a No. 1 destination for sex trafficking; the fact that 48 children can go missing in the care of local authorities; the fact that Operation Pentameter found 84 women in three months; the fact that 15-year-olds from Vietnam, who got into Britain illegally, are growing cannabis in the suburbs of our towns; and, finally, the fact that Britain has been unable to mount very many successful prosecutions all highlight the fact that human trafficking is still way ahead of the Government. The traffickers must be splitting their sides with mirth at the pedestrian, clumsy, inflexible and bureaucratic way in which the Government, the police and immigration officers are proceeding. When the Minister publishes his action plan, can we be sure that he will make life as difficult as possible for traffickers and better for victims, and that he will decide how we should respond to the trafficking of children into Britain?</p>

We have got rid of the old form of slavery&#151;lifelong deprivation of rights and freedoms&#151;but today we have a new form of slavery that is growing fast. It is related to ever increasing demand from an affluent society that is prepared to buy children for sex, domestic slavery, begging and the growing of cannabis. While society may have outlawed traditional slavery, the new forms of exploitation prey on the most vulnerable, the poorest and the least educated. All the evidence suggests that trafficking in human beings is now more profitable than arms dealing or drug trafficking. It is a criminal  <br>

 It should be borne in mind that there were other Members of Parliament before Wilberforce. Many people forget that we nearly abolished slavery during the English civil war. Another character who presided here for a long time, and who was responsible for stopping the movement towards the abolition of slavery, was Oliver Cromwell. When he became Protector of England he saw the commercial opportunities presented by slavery, and persuaded the House not to abolish it. Many of the early slaves were white, and many were from Ireland.</p>

<br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Mar 2007">

<notus-date day="20" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>20 Mar 2007 : Column 733</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07032066000043">Wilberforce was born in 1759, in a house in the high street in Hull. His father died when William was quite young, so he spent much of his early life with his aunt, who was under the influence of John Wesley and the Methodist movement. It is significant that the religious element continued throughout Wilberforce&#146;s life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para18"><a name="07032066000044">At 17 Wilberforce went up to St John&#146;s college, Cambridge. Reading a bit about that time, I noted that he was shocked by his fellow students&#146; hard drinking. Not much has changed about young people going up to university! He went on to represent the city of Hull as its Member of Parliament, having been elected in 1780 at the tender age of 21. It was a hard-fought contest, and Wilberforce&#146;s election cost the exorbitant sum of &#163;9,000. I found that interesting, especially in the light of Hayden Phillips and our current discussions of how elections are paid for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07032066000045">When Wilberforce entered the House he supported the Tories, although he was an independent. In 1784 he converted to evangelical Christianity, and joined the &#147;Clapham set&#148; referred to by the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks. At that point he decided to follow the social reform agenda in Parliament, and was asked to campaign particularly against the slave trade. It is estimated that between 1776 and 1807 Britain trafficked about 1 million people. Wilberforce had a huge issue to tackle, and was up against the establishment view. That was described eloquently by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington when she spoke of banks and Members of Parliament with an interest in the slave trade. The Society of Friends had been campaigning against the trade for some time, and had presented petitions in 1783 and 1787. Wilberforce introduced his Bill against the trade in 1791, but it was easily defeated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para20"><a name="07032066000046">We must not dwell only on Wilberforce, however, because many other parliamentarians&#151;and people outside Parliament&#151;were instrumental in the abolition campaign. In an intervention on the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, I mentioned the sugar boycott. That was of particular interest to me because Hull contains Wilberforce House, the first museum in the world to be dedicated to the anti-slavery movement. It is about to be reopened following the investment of a huge amount of money to prepare it for the 2007 celebrations. There is a stand providing information about the sugar boycott and the role played by women in choosing not to buy or cook with sugar. Thomas Clarkson, whom many Members have mentioned, said that when he travelled around the country,</p>
<a name="70320-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="07032066000205"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there was no town, through which I passed, in which there was not some one individual who left off the use of sugar&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07032066000047">That shows that action was not taken just in Parliament, and that ordinary people, when they heard the facts about the slave trade, were so appalled that they wanted to do their bit. For the first time, a campaign for the boycotting of a commodity was initiated by ordinary people. Of course, it was to happen again in years to come: I remember the boycotting of products from South Africa in the 1980s in support of the anti-apartheid movement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07032066000048">The success of the sugar boycott eventually led to the establishment in the 1820s of female anti-slavery groups in many British cities, involving notable female  <br>

abolitionists such as Elizabeth Heyrick, who called for a total ban. The slave trade was abolished in 1807, and a month after William Wilberforce died in 1833 Parliament passed the Abolition of Slavery Act, which gave all slaves in the British Empire their freedom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para23"><a name="07032066000049">As well as campaigning against slavery, Wilberforce had a range of other interests, including animal welfare. He was involved in the setting up of the charity that is now known as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para24"><a name="07032066000050">Having described William Wilberforce&#146;s role as a Hull MP and his pivotal role here in Parliament, I want to say something about Hull. As a port city with a strong maritime and trading background, it has always had an eye to the rest of the world. William Wilberforce stood up to the slave trade, but Hull was different from Bristol and Liverpool, much of whose wealth was built on the trade; Hull did not have that slave-trade background, so it came to the issue with clean hands. Obviously, that might be because Hull is on the wrong side of the country, but I like to think that there was some principle behind that, too. Those principles have been followed in some of the work done in the past few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para25"><a name="07032066000051">In 1982, Hull became the first city in the west to twin with a third-world city, Freetown, in Sierra Leone. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister talked about his recent visits to Sierra Leone and what is going on there. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, mentioned that the world&#146;s first colony for free Africans was set up in Freetown in 1792. To return to Hull in the 1980s, the then leader of the council, Alderman Patrick Doyle, thought that it was important to build a link with Sierra Leone, and so he twinned Hull with Freetown. That link has gone from strength to strength over the years; eight of our schools are now actively twinned with schools in Freetown, and there are further links with churches and hospitals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para26"><a name="07032066000052">Hon. Members will know that Freetown is still recovering from a lengthy period of considerable turmoil, and there is much scope for development in Sierra Leone. Later, I shall talk about one of the projects taking place in 2007 to link further children and young people in Hull with those in Sierra Leone. Hull was the first local authority to sign up to Amnesty International, and Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela are freemen of the city.</p>

 I should like to put it on record that what Hull has achieved is wonderful. It is really remarkable, and I wish that other authorities throughout the country would follow the lead of its authority; if more authorities did so, we would all be in a much better place. My own local authority resisted any such twinning on the basis that there was no economic parity between the two communities. If twinning just comes down to economic parity, we will not go anywhere. There is so much that we can learn culturally, and my hon. Friend is demonstrating that in her speech.</p>

<p><a name="st_o181"><a name="07032066000054"><a name="70320-0011.htm_spnew6"><a name="07032066000246"><b>Ms Johnson:</b>
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and she is absolutely right&#151;if we considered the issue purely on grounds of economics, perhaps it would not be the route to take, but we all recognise that we have an international responsibility. Hull has been proactive in looking further than the end of its nose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para27"><a name="07032066000055">For several years, William Wilberforce lectures have been held in Hull. Last year, James Coleridge Taylor, head of the National Commission for Democracy and Human Rights in Sierra Leone, was the key speaker. The Wilberforce lectures celebrate Kingston upon Hull&#146;s historic role in combating the abuse of human rights, as personified in the work of William Wilberforce. This year, there are a number of lectures; this Sunday, there will be a lecture by the Prime Minister of Barbados, who is coming to Hull, and later in the year the Archbishops of Canterbury and of York will take part in the lectures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70320-0011.htm_para28"><a name="07032066000056">The fair trade movement is a key way of trying to deal with the factors that allow slavery to continue today. A few years ago, I attended a meeting about young children who were slaves in the cocoa-growing industry in Africa; fair trade and the work done by the makers of Divine chocolate and other products are really important. It is about consumers making a positive choice to put their principles into practice. Hull was awarded Fairtrade city status in March 2005, and that was achieved through the hard work of grass-roots people in Hull&#151;the Churches, the schools, the One World shop, and the university. That sent the signal that Hull is serious about marking its proper place in the world, and behaving properly and responsibly towards the rest of the world. I am proud that we have a strong fair trade tradition in Hull.</p>

Friend the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned the Wilberforce Institute for the study of Slavery and Emancipation, or WISE, which has been established at the university of Hull. Its patron is Desmond Tutu, who said of it:</p>

Tragically, slavery and the violation of human rights are still with us in the 21st century. The institute will be a beacon that will continue to throw a light on issues that are too often overlooked.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para0"><a name="07032066000058">The institute brings together the study of history, law, politics, anthropology, medicine and genetics. Its funding launch was held at Downing street and was hosted by Cherie Booth, and it was opened in 2006 by the President of Ghana. We in Hull are very proud of that institute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07032066000059">Hull is holding 34 weeks of celebrations to mark this important anniversary. We started off with the fair trade fortnight at the end of February, and the celebrations will run all the way through to October, ending in black history month. As I have mentioned, one of the main events, the opening of Wilberforce house after a &#163;1.6 million refit, will be held this weekend. It is a wonderful building, and it now has an education unit to allow schoolchildren from the area to attend courses in the house, and I am proud of that. I looked at Wilberforce house&#146;s website just before this debate, and it says that all the courses for this year are solidly booked; there is no space at all. It is heartening that all schoolchildren in Hull will be able to accessthe museum. One of the lectures is titled &#147;William Wilberforce&#151;the role of the individual&#148;, and it is interesting that one individual can change history. We often hear young people saying, &#147;Well, it doesn&#146;t really matter. We can&#146;t do anything,&#148; but actually they can.</p>

range of topics, and include films about the role of football in post-civil-war Sierra Leone, the story of a former child soldier, and the life of the city&#146;s market traders. The films will be shown by the British Council in Freetown and in Hull. Work is under way with one of our secondary schools, the Winifred Holtby school, and real links are being built between young people in Hull and Sierra Leone. It will mean young people from different parts of the world talking to each other, but having so much in common.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07032066000061">I should mention the Wilberforce Women event. At the end of 2006, women in Hull were invited to attend photography workshops and submit photographs that they had taken, or that had inspired them. The pictures were made into greetings cards, and the women wrote personal messages inside. In February, the cards were personally delivered to women in Freetown, Sierra Leone, which, as I have mentioned, has important links to Hull. The process is now being repeated; women in Freetown are submitting their photographs and personal messages, which will be hand-delivered in Hull. Local Hull photojournalist Lee Karen Stow and fine art photographer Fiona Caley will spend two weeks delivering basic photography skills to the women of Freetown. The finale will be an exhibition of all the photographs and messages sent between the women of the two cities at the Ferens art gallery in Hull in October 2007.</p>

I must just mention that the guest beer in the House of Commons last week wasthe William Wilberforce Freedom ale. There is also William Wilberforce Freedom fair-trade coffee, which is produced in my constituency of Hull, so there are commemorative projects of that kind, too. Finally, I point out that the local paper, the <i> Hull Daily Mail</i>, is running a petition on some of the issues on slavery that we still face today. The petition reads:</p>
<a name="70320-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="07032066000207"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I urge governments and international bodies to work together to better understand the Transatlantic Slave Trade, address its impact on countries and communities around the world, and work to end slavery for all time.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07032066000064">I am proud that we are doing so much in Hull. Bristol and Liverpool are hosting events to mark the abolition of the slave trade, but Hull has a particular role to play as the place from which William Wilberforce came. Despite everything, it has remained true to the principle of an international perspective&#151;a belief that we are all brothers and sisters in the world together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07032066000066">The debate has been marked by a number of excellent speeches, including the historical tour de force by my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague). He has an advantage over most of us, because he has written a book on William Wilberforce and thus researched the subject. My hon. Friends were a little unkind in asking him penetrating, detailed questions that they would not put to a professor of history, but it is a mark of his great talent that he could deal with them brilliantly. I was taken, too, with the forthright, informative and thought-provoking contributions from the hon. Members for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) and for Brent, South (Ms Butler).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07032066000067">It is right that we should hold this debate to celebrate&#151;that is the key word&#151;the bicentenary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act 1807 but what, in fact, are we celebrating? First, and obviously, we are celebrating those men and women who made individual contributions to the great cause of the 18th and 19th centuries&#151;people such as William Wilberforce, Granville Sharp, James Ramsay and Thomas Clarkson, as well as thousands of ordinary people, many slaves and freed slaves who supported the campaign against the slave trade. They had the moral passion, the sheer tenacity, dedication, fortitude, vision and single-mindedness to overcome tremendous odds and setbacks too numerous to mention to achieve their goals. When they started their campaign, nothing was inevitable or predetermined. They campaigned to abolish the slave trade&#151;that took them 20 years to accomplish&#151;then they went on to abolish slavery throughout the British colonies, which took them a further 26 years. Secondly, we are celebrating places with connections to those great social pioneers&#151;the towns and villages the length and breadth of the country that take immense pride in their famous sons and daughters. The obvious example is William Wilberforce, with his roots in, and political representation of, the great city of Kingston upon Hull, but there are many others&#151;notably Thomas Clarkson, who was born and raised in Wisbech in the Isle of Ely in my constituency of North-East Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07032066000068">As well as spatial connections, there are connections primarily among Christian groups and denominations, which came together in common cause and buried sectarian differences to provide a united and coherent front. Chief among those denominations, as we have heard many times in the debate, were the Quakers, whose selfless and self-effacing devotion to the campaign cannot be overstated. They were closely followed by evangelists and Anglicans such as Thomas Clarkson. Indeed, the first meaningful and formal anti-slavery group&#151;the committee for effecting the abolition of the slave trade&#151;was established in 1787 and was composed of nine Quakers and four Anglicans. In an intervention, the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) told the House that all Anglican bishops were against abolition, but my research did not show that that was the case. The bishops may have opposed abolition, but many ordinary Anglican communicants, including Thomas Clarkson, were very much involved in the movement.</p>

At the time, however, there were no easy and fast means of communication, let alone decent overland transport: no telephone, no photography, no television, no telegraphy or e-mail; no trains or automobiles&#151;just a slow and rudimentary postal service, horse-drawn coaches and one&#146;s trusty nag. We should certainly celebrate the incredible fortitude of all those involved who overcame those massive challenges to persuade others and change public perceptions. We should celebrate, too, the role of our fledgling parliamentary democracy in that process. Although the campaignwas unacceptably protracted in today&#146;s terms, it was nevertheless one of the earliest examples of public opinion overcoming powerful vested economic interests through the use of petitions and lobbying&#151;a point well made by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. Finally, we should celebrate the forerunner of human rights pressure groups and mark the establishment in 1823 of the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery, which later became the Anti-Slavery Society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para11"><a name="07032066000070">There is therefore much to celebrate in this bicentenary year, but paramount is the contribution of the key players. Abolition was without doubt a people process, and although much of the praise has rightly gone to William Wilberforce, I trust that the House will forgive my indulgence if I share with it the massive contribution of Thomas Clarkson, who was born in 1760 in Wisbech in my constituency, the son of John Clarkson, headmaster of Wisbech free grammar school. Thomas Clarkson is, without doubt, that Georgian gem of a town&#146;s most famous son, and Wisbech town centre is dominated by a 70 ft-high monument to him, which was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and erected in 1881 following public subscription.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para12"><a name="07032066000071">Thomas Clarkson showed immense intellectual promise as a young man at St. John&#146;s College, Cambridge university, which is my alma mater. By strange coincidence, as the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North said, it is the college that William Wilberforce attended. I do not know whether Wilberforce and Clarkson knew each other at college, but it is remarkable that the two central figures in the campaign went to the same Cambridge college. Clarkson entered a Latin essay competition in 1785. The essay question was, &#147;Is it lawful to make slaves of others against their will?&#148; The research that he did for the essay changed Clarkson&#146;s life, as it challenged him to consider the question of the slave trade. After winning the prize, he decided to go to London to have the essay translated and printed in English. When he stopped at the village of Wadesmill, which is now on the A10 somewhere in Hertfordshire, he experienced what he called a spiritual revelation from God. He wrote:</p>

James Ramsay and Granville Sharp. In May 1787, Clarkson was one of the three pioneering Anglicans, along with Granville Sharp and William Wilberforce, who formed the committee for effecting the abolition of the slave trade&#151; a small non-denominational group that lobbied for greater public and parliamentary support. Clarkson agreed to play a leading part in the affairs of the committee, and he took responsibility for collecting information and researching the issues to support the committee&#146;s case. He faced much opposition from supporters of the trade in the many of the cities that he visited, as the slave traders were an influential group and the trade itself was seen at that time as legitimate, lucrative and responsible for the prosperity of ports such as Liverpool and Bristol. Indeed, on an early visit to Liverpool in 1787 he was attacked and nearly killed by a gang of sailors who had been paid to assassinate him. He only just escaped with his life. In the same year, 1787, Clarkson published his pamphlet, &#147;A Summary View of the Slave Trade and of the Probable Consequences of its Abolition.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para15"><a name="07032066000074">Clarkson was very effective at giving the committee a high public profile, spending the next seven years riding around England promoting the cause and gathering evidence. The sheer magnitude of this endeavour takes one&#146;s breath away. He covered some 35,000 miles, mainly on horseback. History does not tell us whether it was the same horse, but I doubt it, poor thing&#151;I am sure he changed horses frequently. In the course of his journeys he interviewed almost 20,000 sailors and people involved in the trade. He obtained equipment used on the slave ships, such as iron handcuffs, leg shackles, thumb screws, instruments for forcing open slaves&#146; jaws, and branding irons, which he showed in his publications and at the many public meetings at which he spoke.</p>

 Mrs. Woollard has also contacted me and I have replied to her. We cannot claim to be doing as much as Hull, but perhaps the resources of Fenland district council and Wisbech town council are not of comparable magnitude.

He got together a support group to initiate a huge signature gathering operation for petitions to Parliament, and he met local newspaper editors to persuade them to print articles against the trade. All the time he continued to write against the slave trade, filling his works with descriptions that he had heard first hand from sailors, surgeons and others who had been involved in the traffic, such as the account of a sailor who had served aboard a slave ship, which was published in 1789 as &#147;An Essay on the Slave Trade&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07032066000081">In the previous year Clarkson had published his &#147;Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade&#148;, which was printed in large numbers. These works provided a firm basis for the first and ground-breaking abolitionist speech that William Wilberforce made in the House of Commons on 12 May 1789, which was mentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister and by my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks.It was Clarkson&#146;s research that formed the basis of the 12 propositions in Wilberforce&#146;s speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07032066000082">As the House heard earlier in the debate, Wilberforce introduced the first Bill to abolish the slave trade in 1791, but that was easily defeated by 163 votes to 88. As he continued to bring the issue of the slave trade before Parliament, Clarkson continued to travel and write anti-slavery material, and played a huge role in generating favourable public opinion towards the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07032066000083">This was the beginning of a protracted parliamentary campaign during which Wilberforce introduced a motion in favour of abolition almost every year. Between them, Clarkson, Wilberforce and the other members of the committee and their supporters were responsible for generating and sustaining a national movement which mobilised public opinion as never before. Parliament, however, refused continually to pass the Bill, and the outbreak of war with France effectively prevented further debate for many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07032066000084">By 1794 Clarkson&#146;s health was failing and he was suffering from exhaustion. He retired from the campaign and spent some time in the lake district, where he bought an estate at Ullswater and became a friend of the poet William Wordsworth, by an incredible coincidence another old Johnian. In 1804, when the war with France appeared to be almost over, the slave trade campaign revived again. After 10 years, Clarkson&#146;s temporary retirement was also over, and he once again got on his horse to travel all over Great Britain to canvass support for the measure. He seems to  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07032066000085">After the passage of the Slave Trade Act in 1807 Clarkson&#146;s efforts were directed mainly towards ensuring the enforcement of the Act and seeking to further the campaign in the rest of Europe. He travelled to Paris in 1814 and Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, with the aim of arriving at an internationally agreed timetable for abolition. After 1823, when the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery, laterthe Anti-Slavery Society, was formed, Clarkson once again travelled the length of the country, coveringsome 10,000 miles, activating the vast network of sympathetic anti-slavery societies that had been formed. This resulted in 777 petitions being delivered to Parliament demanding the total emancipation of slaves. When the society finally adopted a policy of immediate emancipation, he and Wilberforce appeared together for the last time to lend their support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07032066000086">In 1833 the Slavery Abolition Act was finally passed. Wilberforce died just three days afterwards, knowing that his life&#146;s work had come to fruition. Clarkson lived on for a further 13 years. Although his eyesight was failing, he continued to campaign for the abolition of slavery, focusing on abolition in the United States. At the grand old age of 80, he was the principal speaker at the opening of the anti-slavery convention in Freemasons hall, London in 1840, attended by 5,000 people, where he was accorded a silent standing tribute. With typical modesty he told the audience:</p>
<a name="70320-0012.htm_brev3"><a name="07032066000209"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I stand before you as a humble individual whose life has been intimately connected with this subject. I can say with truth that though my body is going to decay, my heart beats as warmly in this sacred cause as it did at the age of 24 when I first took it up, and I can say further with truth, that if I had another life given to me to live, I would devote it to the same object&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="70320-0012.htm_para24"><a name="07032066000087">Possibly because of a public spat with Wilberforce&#146;s sons after Wilberforce&#146;s death, and perhaps because one of his later books rather over-egged his own contribution to the abolition movement, Clarkson&#146;s place in history seemed to be completely eclipsed by that of Wilberforce. However, in 1996, 150 years after his death, a fitting monument to him was unveiled in Westminster abbey&#151;most appropriately, next door to that of his lifelong friend and colleague, William Wilberforce.</p>

It took place at a time in history when the majority of people worldwide were ignorant of its true nature or saw no moral wrong in it. Its economic success&#151;I say that because it provided a lucrative trade and business for many people over about a century&#151;was based on co-operation with Arab traders and some local African tribes; we now learn of the role that the Ashanti tribe played in this grotesque trade in modern  <br>

 I should like to share with the House two perspectives on slavery that relate to my own spheres of activity as a Member of Parliament. I start by paying tribute to my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. I am absolutely delighted that he has encouraged the House to spend time discussing this important matter and supported it in doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para0"><a name="07032066000092">Sitting for a Merseyside constituency, I feel that it is important not to let this occasion pass without the House stopping to consider the city of Liverpool&#146;s connections with the European slave trade. Indeed, many of my right hon. and hon. Friends and other Members have already mentioned it. No city can claim to have been more inextricably linked with that abhorrent practice. At its height, Liverpool controlled 80 per cent. of the British slave trade and 40 per cent. of the European slave trade. Considering those figures, it is no exaggeration to say that Liverpool was one of the forces that drove the entire transatlantic slave trade. London, Bristol and Hull played an important role, but Liverpool was in a league of its own. That trade penetrated every aspect of city life and every level of society&#151;16 of Liverpool&#146;s mayors were slave traders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07032066000093">Liverpool built, owned, manned, insured and repaired the ships that took African people from their homes and families, transported them across the seas and sold them into a life of servitude. Liverpudlians and their countrymen enjoyed the tobacco, sugar, cotton and coffee that those ships brought withthem on their return voyages. The merchants and businessmen grew wealthy through that shameful trade, fuelling the growth of the city and the region. Several Liverpudlians, including John Newton, went on to play a prominent role in the abolition of slavery, but it is important to remember that Liverpool continued to profit from the slave trade long after 1807. Once established, many of the trading posts in west Africa went on to serve Liverpool as she became the second city of the British empire. During the American civil war, cotton from the southern plantations was so important to Britain that ships were built in Liverpool for the Confederate navy so that they could run the Union blockade of the south.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07032066000094">The slave trade is not merely a matter for Liverpool&#146;s history; it has left its mark on the present city in so many ways. We cannot&#151;and indeed should not&#151;forget it, because there are so many visible reminders everywhere. Liverpool Lime Street railway station was  <br>

built on the profits of slavery to facilitate the transport of cotton from the docks to the mills of Manchester. The design of the town hall incorporates a friezewith depictions of Liverpool&#146;s trading connections, including motifs depicting African people&#151;not shown as ambassadors of their respective states but as commodities available for sale in our city. Earle street, New Bird street, Dorans lane and numerous other streets are named after slave traders. Even Penny lane, made famous throughout the world by the Beatles, is said to be named after James Penny, who owned slave ships and vocally opposed abolition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07032066000095">What of the legacy? This year, Liverpool celebrates its 800th anniversary and prepares to became European capital of culture next year. We have many wonderful things about the city to celebrate: the iconic waterfront, the magnificent twin cathedrals, a proud shipping heritage, successful football teams, the Beatles, and the musicians and poets of the 1960s. However, we are what we are because of the slave trade. We have become a world-class city on the back of the strength and intellectual acumen of people from another continent, and we owe a great debt to the people of Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07032066000096">How does a nation repay that debt? Liverpool has come some way towards acknowledging the part that it played in the slave trade. In 1999, the city council passed a motion formally apologising for it. A museum and study centre dedicated to the subject will open in the city later this year. All our children need to know where they came from and must be encouraged to reach out and share what we have with those from whom we have taken so much.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07032066000097">That brings me on to my second area of interest as chair of the all-party group on the west African Mano river region, which is principally concerned with the development and welfare of the five countries along the banks of the Mano river in west Africa: Sierra Leone, C&#244;te d&#146;Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal and Liberia. It was from that part of Africa that the slave traderstook so many individuals from their families and communities, and it was that part of Africa to which freed slaves were later returned. However, just as Liverpool continued to profit from the slave trade long after it was abolished, so west Africa continued to remain impoverished and exploited.</p>

Slaves freed by Britain initially returned to Africa through that country&#151;many chose to settle there. From the appropriately named port of Freetown, the Royal Navy conducted its anti-slavery patrols; indeed, it continues to patrol the seas off Sierra Leone today. Unfortunately, life for the former slaves in Sierra Leone offered little comfort, and that prospect has remained largely unchanged for their descendents. There exists a direct relationship between prosperity and poverty. In such places, where so many still have so little, people are cheap enough to buy. They are bound by the shackles created by their own poverty. It was only when I visited Sierra Leone that I began to understand for myself that slavery was still very much alive 200 years after it was supposedly banned. Sierra Leone is recovering from a wretched war; unemployment is rife, at 90 per cent; and there are thousands of abandoned children roaming the streets. The reality in  <br>

impoverished countries is that the only commodity that is readily available is a body, and bodies are cheap. Unfortunately, child prostitution is rife. It is immensely distressing to visit that beautiful country and look beyond the facade of sewage-strewn streets to see beautiful faces who daily pay the price of the rape of their nation that took place centuries ago.</p>

Children there have asked me to take them home and they would be sent here willingly by many parents who are bereft of the opportunity to feed and clothe their own offspring. Liverpool city council is managing hundreds of children who are sent to this country unaccompanied to seek asylum. As a parent, I can understand why mothers in Sierra Leone and other desperately poor countries would want to send their children here. Here, children can go to school, and can expect to eat each day and to receive health care. In Sierra Leone, a quarter of children die before they reach the age of five.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07032066000100">Our challenge as a Government and a nation is to return the wealth gained on the back of the African continent to the descendents of those African nations, not just through our money, but through our skills and intellectual property.

Our Government have said that we will retain a presence in the country until 2015. We need to stay to send a clear signal to the despicable rebel leaders, who chose to exploit their own people for their own ends, that the country is protected.</p>

Under its global skills partnership, 900 schools in the UK have been linked with counterparts in 80 different countries. This year, one of its themes is slavery. Some school twinning programmes are relatively straightforward. However, twinning in some countries is incredibly difficult, as communications, visits and security all militate against a successful twinning. Despite that, the British Council is working with communities across the UK to form strong links between our communities and those challenged countries in Africa.</p>

I am sure that many of us who watched &#147;Comic Relief&#148; last week were not at all surprised to see that more than &#163;40 million was raised in one evening. Sixty per cent. of that fund will be spent on supporting projects throughout Africa that are designed to protect and educate children and their mothers. Thousands of people in this country have decided to make a much bigger commitment, however, and to respond personally to the expressed needs of different African countries.

I had never been to Sierra Leone before, and it was a profoundly distressing experience. I saw the unimaginable deprivation common to the most challenged countries on the planet. The desperately poor people, the thousands of raped women andthe 30,000 child soldiers were among the legacies of15 years of civil war. I doubt that I could have survived such calamities had I not asked the head teacher of a local school how he managed. He replied, &#147;Life happens. Life goes on.&#148; And it does.</p>

From that visit, the Waterloo partnership was born. The partnership brings together the people of Waterloo in Sierra Leone and Waterloo in Liverpool. The two communities have made a 20-year commitment to each other and, unlike aid agencies or Governments, we will remain together come what may. None of us is paid, and we choose to work together in the one hope that together we will grow closer and stronger because, irrespective of where we are and who we are, people throughout the world have the same aspirations. We want the same things: a good education for our children; sufficient food to eat; and the means to support ourselves. That does not include selling our bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07032066000106">So far, the Waterloo partnership has raised &#163;150,000. Crucially, we have sat down together to talk about the projects that we can achieve together, and about how we can tackle the problems that we face so that we do not return to the past. In partnership, there must be equal giving and taking. We can learn so much from our brothers and sisters in Sierra Leone about tolerance, forgiveness and living in religious harmony, and about teaching and farming practices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07032066000107">The Waterloo partnership is facilitating a cultural and educational exchange. So far, 11 teachers from Waterloo have travelled to Sierra Leone on the first of many school exchange visits. That will be the basis of our schools twinning programme. We want to twin all our schools, and we want all our children to learn about each other. We want them to understand their common roots.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07032066000108">In addition, we have involved the business community in helping us to deliver some of the bigger aspirations of our brothers and sisters in Waterloo, Sierra Leone. Those include equipping all the schools there. That is beyond the means of the Sierra Leone Government&#151;only a third of the children in Sierra Leone go to school at the moment&#151;but it is not beyond the means of Colin Crooks and his great team at Green-Works. Colin rang me after hearing a BBC World Service broadcast covering one of the Waterloo partnership visits. He is in the fortunate position of receiving thousands of chairs and desks from some of  <br>

the leading companies in the UK that prefer to recycle them rather than send them to landfill. He came with me to Sierra Leone last month, and surveyed every school in Waterloo. He has now put together a business plan to produce bespoke furniture for the schools there. Crucially, that project will generate vitally needed employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07032066000109">I must take this opportunity to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his support; he is a wonderful socialist. He came out to Sierra Leone last month and visited Waterloo. He was received by thousands of delighted residents, children and representatives of different community groups, including the Waterloo Handicapped Association. That marvellous group of men, most of whom are wheelchair-bound, subsequently wrote to John to thank him for his time and for sharing with them his stories about his disabled father. In their letter, they also expressed their profound hope that he could help them to find work. Generating employment lies at the heart of the work of the Waterloo partnership, because without work, people become vulnerable to being traded, just for their bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07032066000110">In addition, the Waterloo partnership is seeking to build the largest library in west Africa. This was a good idea put forward not by the Waterloo partnership in Liverpool but by the good people in Sierra Leone. I was interested in helping them with a capital project of their choosing. However, they did not choose a project involving sewerage or water; they chose a library, because a generation had missed its education. Many of us regard people in Africa as belittled and cowed by their experience, but they are actually just like us. They have huge aspirations and desires, and those will be accomplished by their ambition for a library. When asked for such a comparatively small thing, who would not rise to the challenge? I am proud to represent a community of people who really want to deliver the largest library in west Africa. We want to deliver a facility that we would be proud of in this country, because our brothers and sisters over there deserveno less.</p>

They can never be absolved completely, however; they were mighty sins. But we do not do this merely to appease guilty consciences. I believe that reaching out is important if we are to create communities with integrity and cohesion at home. We are living in a globalised world in which issues such as slavery, prostitution and the trade in drugs, weapons and people are fundamentally linked with matters concerning economics, population, immigration, labour supply and the state of our society.</p>

 The range of speeches in the debate has shown a balance between dwelling on the offence and commemorating its abolition. I was born within 5 miles of Pier Head, I lived briefly in a tobacco baron&#146;s house in Glasgow, and I now represent a constituency in Aberdeenshire, from which some of the richest plantation owners originated. I guess that I have made a journey through the UK that has quite a lot of close connections with slavery and the slave trade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07032066000115">In light of the speeches made by the hon. Members for Brent, South (Ms Butler) and for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), it is worth recording that, in 1796, 30 per cent. of the estates in Jamaica were owned by Scots. In 1817, 10 years after the abolition of the trade, 32 per cent. of the slaves in Jamaica were owned by Scots. We must acknowledge and face up to that. On the back of that trade, Glasgow claimed to be the second city of the empire, but I guess that, in that context, it is a pretty close call between Liverpool and Glasgow. Subsequently, Glasgow became one of the great powerhouses of the campaign to abolish slavery altogether, so there was some recognition among the population of Scotland that abolishing the slave trade was not enough; the condition of slavery needed to be abolished. It is a slight irony that some of the campaigners&#151;not Wilberforce&#151;wanted to abolish the slave trade only because they thought that the lack of supply might make the slave owners treat their slaves better. I guess that one must start with half the argument before the other half becomes the logical conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07032066000116">Having read up on the subject, it is probably worth putting on record some of the arguments put forward. James Ramsay, a cleric, made the following ironic comment against slavery:</p>
<a name="70320-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="07032066000210"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Had nature intended negroes for slavery, she would have endowed them with many qualities which they now want. Their food would have needed no preparation, their bodies no covering; they would have been born without any sentiment for liberty; and possessing a patience not to be provoked, would have been incapable of resentment or opposition&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para24"><a name="07032066000117">Because they are just like us, however, they did not comply and fought for and ultimately won their freedom, as has been pointed out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para25"><a name="07032066000118">The arguments put forward in the campaign still make pretty harsh reading. The committee on behalf of the plantation owners stated:</p>
<a name="70320-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="07032066000211"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the African trade is so blended with our commerce, and so interwoven with our general interests, that if at any time, through neglect, mismanagement, or misfortune, this nation should be deprived of its benefits, it will then suffer a very great and irreparable loss, a maim in its commerce, dignity, and power, of which it is impossible it can ever recover.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para26"><a name="07032066000119">That is a damning comment, and it was an argument put forcefully in defence of slavery and the slave trade at the time, with, I guess, campaigning zeal. That shows why it took more than 20 years to secure abolition.  <br>

Like other Members, I am grateful that Scotland is acknowledging its role, and that several events are taking place in and around Glasgow and my city of Aberdeen that will enable the present generation to focus on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para27"><a name="07032066000120">Another legacy of the way in which African slaves were treated is racism. They were treated as sub-human: the animals were probably better looked after than the slaves in transit. It is heart-breaking to read that not only were the conditions abominable but that family connections and loyalties were totally disregarded: families were split up, sold and moved around different plantations, never to see each other again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para28"><a name="07032066000121">Slavery has a long history. Greek and Roman civilisation&#151;in which the origins of European civilisation lie&#151;were founded on slavery and slave ownership. It is probably true that Aristotle and Socrates would not have had the time to think their philosophies through if they had not had the labour of slaves. We must acknowledge that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para29"><a name="07032066000122">Sadly, as others have said, slavery has not been abolished. The United Nations estimates that 27 million people are effectively enslaved today. The International Labour Organisation says that 12.1 million people are in forced labour of one form or another. In the spirit of the commemoration, we must take that issue forward and give a lead on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para30"><a name="07032066000123">With regard to trafficking, a lot of the focus, as the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) pointed out, is on the sex trade and sex traffic. In fact, about 50 per cent. of those who are trafficked are men and 50 per cent. women. In the sex trade, it is 98 per cent. women and2 per cent. men. Men and boys are still being sold into slavery in a variety of different ways, and that needs to be addressed. Clearly, however, this country is at the receiving end of a great many women who have been trafficked or sold into slavery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70320-0013.htm_para31"><a name="07032066000124">It is shocking to read that women from eastern Europe and the Balkans, including places such as Moldova, have effectively been sold into slavery for cash by their own families&#151;their brothers, fathers and supposed husbands. That is knowingly done on the clear understanding of what is happening. The girls are deceived and told that they are going to take up a job or opportunity. Only when it is too late do they realise into what they have been sold. In some cases, they might have had a good idea that they were being sold into some dubious activity, but they probably thought that they would have free choice and opportunity, not be imprisoned, brutalised, beaten and denied any of the revenue generated. Even worse, they can effectively be sold into slavery and then be told that they owe the slave owner money for the cost of getting them where they are and for their keep. Therefore, all the money that they earn is taken, and their reward is to be beaten, raped and denied their basic requirements.</p>

As the Deputy Prime Minister knows, the cross-party advisory group that he has put together discussed the importance of signing that convention. It would be impossible to commemorate the abolition of slavery and not be a signatory to the convention. Forty-six or, if we count Montenegro, 47 countries are potential  <br>

signatories. At present, 34 have signed, and Britain is one of those countries that have not. It is true that only five countries have ratified, and that 10 are required to do so for the convention to be implemented. If one looks at the countries that have not signed, however, one sees that we are not in the best of company. The major countries that have not signed are Russia, the United Kingdom and Spain. France, Germany, Italy, all the Scandinavian countries and most of the countries where the trafficking originates have signed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07032066000126">I very much welcome the fact that we are going to sign the convention, but having tried to find out exactly what the Government&#146;s reservations are, I hope for clarification soon of their timetable for ratifying and of the final legal framework. Until the convention is ratified, people who are trafficked do not appear to have any recourse. They are constantly told that they are illegal immigrants and have no rights, and that is one of the threats used to keep them quiet. They are told, &#147;No one is going to help you, because you should not be here anyway.&#148; They need to know and understand, if we can communicate with them at all, and if they can gain any information, that the United Kingdom has ratified a treaty that gives them rights: at least 30 days&#146; grace plus, possibly, reflection time, and no conditions on whether they testify in relation to how they are treated. It would be helpful if the Minister were able to tell us a little more in her reply. We need to find out shortly what the conditions are and what will be the passage of time between the signing and ratification of the convention by the United Kingdom. That would make a good and sound connection between the commemoration and the current situation. </p>

It required such extraordinary expenditure of effort that perhaps it inevitably gained a resonance, whereas nowadays there are so many campaigns and means of campaigning that it is difficult to raise one abovethe rest and achieve such change. Nevertheless, engagement that involves people on the ground matters more than anything if a campaign is to be effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07032066000128">Points have been made about the inequalities that persist between Britain and Africa, and the descendants of slaves and the countries in which slavery operated. Much remains to be done. The International Development Committee, which I chair, had an informal briefing this morning from the Strategic Foresight Group. Its ideas about and analysis of the causes of division, terrorism and extremism are interesting. It also makes some practical suggestions about tackling that. It pointed out that, in the United States, which, as nobody needs telling, is the world&#146;s largest economy, a significant proportion of households in 29 states have an income of less than $25,000&#151;a per capita income of $10,000 to $15,000. Of course, the group acknowledged that that would be a high salary in African terms, but it is a low income in the United States. The group made the point that Pentecostal Christianity and white supremacist groups have grown in precisely the states where such pockets of low-income earners are abundant. That shows thatthe legacy of slavery survives where there is racial discrimination and deprivation.</p>

It can be difficult to know where blame lies when there is poor quality local leadership. I believe that we should apologise unreservedly and show shame for our actions, but that we must also challenge, and acknowledge that the world cannot go on trading apologies instead of delivering leadership and action that move things forward and create change. There must be a partnership between us and the leadershipin the communities that we are considering. Our approach is not to tell countries what to do&#151;we are not neo-colonialists&#151;but to work with them and help them achieve what they want to do. That requires integrity, good governance and transparency. The good news is that, where that exists, we are beginning to see benefits.</p>

More poor people live outside Africa, but the proportion of the population of Africa that is poor is much higher than elsewhere. Those people live in the middle of great wealth, which is not properly shared in some African countries.

The best testament to the end of slavery that we could provide is to drop our protectionist barriers, if we genuinely believe in free trade, and open our markets. We should also provide the capacity, through aid for trade, for developing countries to flourish in their own way so that they can access their markets in real terms, not only in theory. That means delivering the Doha round. If that does not happen, we must find another, better way of ensuring that such partnership can continue.</p>

It may not be all our fault&#151;I believe that we have now got our approach right&#151;but we must deliver our part of the bargain before we can honestly expect the countries of Africa to get their fair share of the world&#146;s resources and an ability to participate as full and growing partners who are not dependent on aid. Dependence on aid is neither in their interests nor in ours. Escape from aid dependency restores dignity, and the restoration of dignity abolishes aid dependency. It is a perfect circle, if we can only break the current cycle. It is up to us to deliver&#151;we have not yet done so.</p>

 It is an honour and a privilege to speak in the parliamentary debate on such a great historic occasion. I found the speeches of my hon.

I am sure that their ancestors will be looking down with pride on their great-great grandchildren.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07032066000135">I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague). His exposition of the life of Wilberforce was a tour de force. I thought fora moment that I had strayed into a viva voce examination for a PhD thesis, such was his aplomb in dealing with interventions on all sorts of historic details. I hope that I shall not be tested on my historical knowledge to the same extent, and that I shall not be found wanting.</p>

Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) raised, and that confronts us today in the United Kingdom and Europe&#151;the modern-day slave trade of human trafficking. Through the phenomenon of globalisation, victims are lured to this country by promises of work. They are then effectively enslaved into sex work. The Home Office figure for the number of women and girls who have been trafficked here is estimated to be 4,000. The Home Office probably minimises the figure, so perhaps the true number is much higher. One of the problems with ascertaining figures is that we are considering a secret trade. That makes it hard to glean numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07032066000137">I pay tribute to the Government for agreeing to sign the Council of Europe convention against human trafficking. It is the first step to according victims the status of victim rather than that of immigration offender. However, unlike 200 years ago, when Wilberforce and Parliament led the world, today we lag behind other parts of Europe in our treatment of victims. As we heard from my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, they are certainly victims. He cited the tragic case of the 15-year-old Lithuanian girl who was lured by the promise of a summer job selling ice creams in Sheffield but was then sold on and on, and brutally raped on many occasions.</p>

It catalogues the abuses suffered by women trafficked for sexual slavery across Europe. The author, Cathy Zimmerman of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, had interviewed 207 women in14 European countries, aged between 15 and 45. The majority were between 18 and 25. I was deeply shocked by the report. To my surprise, a huge number of the women had suffered serious head injuries from brutal beatings by the people who imprisoned them. Another interesting finding showed that 60 per cent. of the women had been physically and/or sexually abusedin their home country before being trafficked. That perhaps indicates that the trafficked women who arrive on our shores and at our airports were already vulnerable women in their home countries.

unemployed. That is one of the factors that push women out to seek a better life for themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07032066000139">However, to return to the figures, 95 per cent. of such women are physically and/or sexually abused during their trafficking experience. Let me list some of the examples of suffering that were given to the researchers. Some were kicked while pregnant. Others were burned with cigarettes. One was choked with fire. Another had a gun held to her head. We simply cannot imagine what that must feel like, or the physical and psychological damage that those women endure on their journeys and at their destination in this and other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07032066000140">It is unsurprising that those women suffer long-term physical and psychological consequences. More than half of them had symptom levels suggesting post-traumatic stress disorder&#151;levels that we normally see in people who have suffered extreme terror or extremely violent events. They suffered headaches, fatigue, dizziness or memory loss equivalent to what the most acute 10 per cent. of sufferers in the population experience. One interesting aspect of the research was that they were re-interviewed and that that showed that their physical health improved after between 30 and60 days in the care of non-governmental organisations or medical services and social services, but that it took longer for their mental health to improve. It improved after 90 to 100 days&#151;after about 3 months in care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07032066000141">That research is vital if we want to know about what the practical realities of ratifying the convention will be. Clearly, if such women are so psychologically and physically damaged, there will be implications if we want them to participate in the legal and administrative process by, for example, naming their attackers or enslavers and by co-operating with the authorities in order to bring those evil people to justice. Such women need time to recover their faculties and their emotional strength. Specialist health services are needed, too, as these women are a unique type of victim of crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07032066000142">Last year, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I was then a member, conducted a major inquiry into human trafficking. The subsequent report was published in October 2006, and I recommend it to Members. One of the recommendations was to do with the signing of the convention, of course, but the report also stated that we should look beyond the minimum reflection period of 30 days, and the Amnesty report gives us reasons why these women need more time to learn to trust the authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07032066000143">One of the issues that the inquiry uncovered wasthe lack of specialist legal advice and, in the case of children, the lack of specialist support for &#147;an appropriate adult&#148;&#151;to use the legal term. We found that there was a wide variety of organisations and people&#151;NGOs, police officers, Home Office officials and immigration officials&#151;who could deal with people who had been trafficked, but that there was a lack of a joined-up and co-ordinated approach from those different agencies.</p>

victims from non-EU countries, and that people from outside the EU had to claim asylum in order to get the minimum level of support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07032066000145">There is a lack of awareness among immigration staff. Some of the people who were being picked up were being treated as immigration offenders, instead of victims of this vile crime. When we sign the European convention, repatriation will breach the principle of non-return under articles 13 and 14 of the convention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07032066000146">I am curious to hear from the Minister about the statistical research, and specifically about the 4,000 figure given by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker). As far as I can see, that has not been formally published, and I think everyone involved in this debate would be interested to know about the statistical basis on which such figures have been extrapolated.</p>

<p><a name="st_o190"><a name="07032066000147"><a name="70320-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="07032066000255"><b>Meg Munn:</b>
 I understand from my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling that that figure is now some years out of date. Greater numbers of people are being trafficked. Clearly, getting the statistical information right is very important.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. That figure was first announced in a meeting with the Joint Committee only in March or April last year. That was the best available evidence at that time, and I am sure that the situation has moved on since then. It is hard to estimate the numbers of unaccompanied minors, people in private fostering arrangements and children. The police told us that 10 years ago 85 per cent. of sex workers working in brothels in the United Kingdom were from the UK. That has now been completely reversed: 10 years on, 85 per cent. are from outside the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para21"><a name="07032066000149">We visited the POPPY project. I agree with the hon. Member for Totnes that it is a wonderful project, but it is also far too small to cope with the huge demand and the huge and complex needs of the victims. I hope that the signing of the convention will mark the beginning of the end of such problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07032066000150">The UK is doing some things to combat the modern-day slave trade of human trafficking. I mentioned in my intervention on the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks the fingerprinting work done by consulates and embassies in highly vulnerable countries. That fingerprinting&#151;and the collection of other biometric data&#151;gives the UK authorities something to go on; if a child presents themselves to social services, we can trace them back to their country of origin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07032066000151">I am also interested in the work that the Home Office has done with PunterNet, a website for men who use prostitutes. I must admit that until I participated in the inquiry I was not aware that such sites existed, and I have not dared to surf for it on the internet because I am worried that access might be denied on the parliamentary network. Conflicting advice is coming from the Home Office&#151;on the one hand men who have sex with women who have been trafficked and therefore do not consent could be prosecuted for rape, while on the other hand, there is an encouragement on  <br>

PunterNet to men to come forward if believe that the women they are sleeping with may have been trafficked. That is a confusing situation to put such men in, and we need clarification so that more so-called punters come forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para24"><a name="07032066000152">I pay tribute to the Home Office for setting up Reflex, the multi-agency task force to tackle immigration crime, as well as the human trafficking centre and the Serious Organised Crime Agency. However, more victims in the recent period have been arrested and deported than traffickers have been prosecuted. Recommendation 136 of our report is that more should be done to bring such people to justice and to seize the assets of traffickers. There is nothing more criminal than profiting from the trade in, and movement of, another human being. There is also no central database of victims and no clear statement of what should happen to them once identified. When our action plan is published, I hope that it will deal with many such issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para25"><a name="07032066000153">We met the women at the POPPY project. They talked to us about what happened when they were involved in the court process to bring their attackers or imprisoners to justice and they were promised that they would be able to give evidence from behind a screen: in one case, the judge decided not to use a screen and the victim, who had been forcibly imprisoned, had to give evidence facing her enslaver, which was highly traumatic, of course. I also ask the Government to look at making trafficking one of the police performance indicators. We all know that what gets measured gets done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para26"><a name="07032066000154">Italy provides a shining example of what can be done, with good will and with investment, to tackle the trade and to stem it. We have heard a lot of analysis of some of the problems, but when we visited Italy we heard the beginnings of some of the solutions in terms of tackling the modern-day slave trade. Italy has a convention called Article 18. It is a legal framework that gives victims protection under the law. It was introduced in 1998, so Italy has had almost 10 years of offering, effectively, asylum&#151;a residency permit for six months&#151;to people who come forward and co-operate with the police, and provide information about their captors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para27"><a name="07032066000155">The Italian authorities have a centralised database, so they were able to tell us that between 2000 and 2004, more than 7,000 women claimed a residence permit under the scheme. That is a huge number. Some 4,000 gained a permit, and nearly 6,000 got vocational training. The authorities were also able to tell us the country of origin of these women: 52 per cent. were from Nigeria, and the rest, as we would expect, were from Romania, Moldova, Albania and Ukraine. Interestingly, the authorities said that the women from Africa and Nigeria were the least likely to co-operate with the police in bringing their attackers to justice. I do not know whether that is for cultural reasons, or because of a particular power in their home country, but there certainly seemed to be a problem with getting women from Nigeria to co-operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para28"><a name="07032066000156">In 2003, the Italian authorities also increased the legislative penalty for &#147;selling or purchasing slaves&#148;, as they call it, from eight to 20 years in prison. That penalty can be increased by up to 50 per cent. for trading in minors aged under 18. We have heard today from Opposition Members about the number of such  <br>

people arrested in Italy. In 2004, there were 412 arrests, and in 2005 there were 356 arrests. There is a single, central, national free-phone number for victims&#151;or to enable ordinary citizens to provide information&#151;which is printed on bus tickets. More than 500,000 calls have been made, but more than two thirds of them have come not from victims or punters, but from ordinary citizens. Such people include those living in apartment blocks who have seen or heard something, or those who have done so while driving past, and who believe that some form of dodgy dealing is going on behind closed doors or on the streets, and that that information should be passed on to the police. That shows us what ordinary citizens can do when the authorities empower them to show awareness and to say, &#147;We will have zero tolerance of trafficking&#151;this modern slave trade&#151;and we will have justice and social justice for victims.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para29"><a name="07032066000157">That advice line gives 24-hour legal, psychological and medical information, and it monitors what happens to such people after the calls are made. Help is also provided by the International Organisation for Migration in the form of grants to help victims return home. However, it is very important that those women should not be sent home and straight back into the hands of their traffickers. While we were there, we heard some anecdotal evidence. When the UK was deporting nationals, the police would be phoned at the airports. Sadly, however, in some of the countries to which we were deporting people, the traffickers would be telephoned to be told that a particular person was on her way back. She would then be met at the airport and her bonded debt would be paid out in a brothel in Albania, Romania or Moldova.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70320-0014.htm_para30"><a name="07032066000158">We also saw the various awareness campaigns that were being run. Such campaigns are happening in the UK, which is also funding them in the countries of origin. Super-8 film clips are shown of children growing up and being looked after by their mothers. The mothers are then shown standing on the streets of Rome in their underwear. Such footage is very hard-hitting. The campaign slogan was, &#147;Don&#146;t burn your life&#148;. Research was also conducted in the countries of origin. Of course, nobody thinks that they are going to be a victim of traffickers; however, it emerged that 85 per cent. of women did think that they would travel to another country and get a job there. Given the huge numbers of people who are looking for work in western Europe, they are extremely vulnerable. </p>

Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) and I went for a night out with a local non-governmental organisation representative in Rome, a city in which I lived for a year as a student. I know some of the main prostitute runs in Rome, and in fact, I was propositioned myself as a 19-year-old, standing on the main Christopher Columbus boulevard outside Rome. There is a long tradition in Rome of street prostitution, and as a 19-year-old it was terrifying to have someone stop in a car next to me and invite me to accompany him.</p>

Italy with them. We went out with a big box of condoms, and leaflets printed in every African and eastern European language that one can think of that gave the addresses of sexual health clinics. However, that is a &#147;softly, softly&#148; approach to these women and girls. When they go to the clinic in town, they are immediately told, &#147;You have rights under article 18. You can claim residency and social justice in this country.&#148; They can claim protection, and many of them do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07032066000161">We also heard what happens to such women afterwards. They are given shelter in a network of safe houses and, crucially, information on finding work. Most of them have transferred to the work permit scheme. So Italy adopts an holistic approach to the victim, and it offers the UK and the rest of the Europe the beginnings of a model. However, investment and commitment are also needed, and it takes a long time to gain the trust of these women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07032066000162">Each generation and century has its own challenges and has to defeat the dark forces that challenge our common humanity. Wilberforce, as we have heard, introduced his first Bill against the slave trade in 1791&#151;in the 18th century. It took him 16 years finally to get the slave trade abolished, in 1807, but even that Act did nothing to free those who were already enslaved. They had to wait until 1833&#151;until the Slavery Abolition Act, which granted freedom to all slaves in the British empire&#151;another 26 years. Between 1791 and 1833, a whole generation of people were enslaved, born into slavery, and lived and died in slavery before Wilberforce&#146;s great achievement and the achievement of the 1833 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07032066000163">Human progress may be slow, but when it comes, it comes for good and stays for good. In the 20th century, it took the campaigner against genocide and holocaust survivor Raphael Lemkin many years before his term for the great crime against humanity&#151;genocide&#151;was accepted by the new United Nations and recognised and confirmed in law in 1951. He wanted to impose on nations a duty of responsibility to protect those who suffer genocide, and a responsibility on other UN nations to protect them. Yet still no action has been taken collectively by that body on all the huge and terrible genocides of the 20th century&#151;be it Cambodia, Rwanda or Bosnia&#151;or of the 21st century, in Darfur. Will human trafficking be the great challenge to our still young 21st century? The forces of globalisation of trade, and the availability of ever easier and cheaper flights, raise endless possibilities for communication and leisure, but also for abuse, criminality and modern slavery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07032066000164">If human trafficking is not to define our centuryas slavery defined the 18th and 19th centuries and genocide defined the 20th, we must act now. Strong laws, strong protection and recognition of our shared and common humanity across borders, gender and race are indeed principles of which Wilberforce himself would have been proud. They are the principles of human progress, for which Members in all parts of the House will doubtless continue to fight.</p>

In some of the arguments that were put forward 220 years ago, we see precursors of other debates, such as poverty wages for suppliers of imported goods. It is still argued that if we do not import them someone else will. On CO2 emissions, people ask why we should cut our emissions when others do not.

I hope that, in 220 years time, when the descendants of those who take part in this debate look at <i> Hansard</i>, they will find that some of us have said something useful and on the right side of the argument.</p>

and our country&#146;s part in it. The right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce), a colleague of mine on the International Development Committee, mentioned the role of my city, Glasgow, in the slave trade. Any hon. Members who have visited Glasgow will probably have attended or at least passed by the impressive neo-classical façade of our gallery of modern art in Queen&#146;s street. The building has had a varied history. Until a few years ago, it was the Stirling library and it has also been a telephone exchange, a bank and a stock market, but when it was originally built in 1778, at the then staggering cost of &#163;100,000, it was the town house for William Cunninghame, a prominent Glasgow tobacco baron.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07032066000186">Cunninghame headed one of the three major syndicates that controlled the flow of tobacco into Scotland. He developed a string of outlets and representatives in the tobacco colonies, which bought tobacco from the planters and stored it until his ships arrived. His trading system was one of the most efficient and swift in the north Atlantic and it yielded enormous profits. The tobacco barons of Glasgow were the London billionaires of their day. Cunninghame&#146;s mansion is one of Scotland&#146;s finest houses, but it stands today as a reminder of our city&#146;s links to tobacco cultivated by enslaved people, and the profits tobacco yielded to the major Scottish merchants who dominated the trade throughout western Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07032066000187">At the beginning of the 18th century, Glasgow was a poor town on the wrong side of a poor, isolated country on the fringes of Europe. Scotland&#146;s main trading partners were the Baltic states across the North sea and Scotland&#146;s ruling classes had been bankrupted by their investment in the disastrous Darien scheme in 1690. But by the end of that century Glasgow was transformed into the second city of the empire, at the forefront of the new industrial society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para26"><a name="07032066000188">The greatest rate of development, outpacing anything seen in the rest of the United Kingdom, occurred between 1740 and 1790, when Glasgow found its niche in the business of slavery. Slaves were never auctioned in Glasgow, but the city benefited by directly supplying the American colonies with manufactured goods, linen cloth and iron, without which they could not survive. The ships then returned to the UK with colonial goods, mainly tobacco from Maryland and Virginia, but also sugar and other exotic products from the Caribbean. For that, the traders had the Navigation Acts to thank, which were the backbone of the British empire until they were repealed in 1799. Essentially,all manufactured goods to be consumed in the British empire had to be produced in Britain and conveyed between Britain and its colonies in British ships. In that fashion, British shipping and British industry were promoted to the detriment of the colonies, which was one of the main reasons behind the American revolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para27"><a name="07032066000189">Streets in Glasgow, such as Glassford street, Buchanan street, Virginia street, and Jamaica street, are all named after either tobacco merchants or colonies. Even today, the city centre is still dotted with the mansions of tobacco merchants. Glasgow and Scotland&#146;s wealthy pre-eminence in the world was based firmly within the British empire system. Far from being involved in the slave trade to a lesser extent than England, Scotland&#146;s smaller size and greater levels of  <br>

poverty meant the impact of that obscene and wealthy trade was actually greater on Scotland than anywhere else in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para28"><a name="07032066000190">All the components&#151;huge disparities in wealth, unfair trading rules with heavy protectionist policies and exploitation of labour without protection&#151;were present to permit slavery on an industrial scale for the dawning of a new industrial age. Slavery in the horrific form known in 1807 may be in our past, but those components of exploitation are still with us in the modern age, aided by globalisation and modern day conflicts. Until we tackle all those injustices, we will not see an end to the modern versions of slavery in this world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para29"><a name="07032066000191">Just as in the 18th and 19th centuries, we have a tendency to view the problem through the prism of a few world leaders or western campaigners, and we do not recognise that many of the advances of recent times are due to the struggles of thousands of ordinary people throughout the developing world. In her excellent contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) pointed out that a truly grass-roots campaign for change took place, both in the colonies and in this country, with hundreds of thousands of people participating. Today&#146;s debate gives us an opportunity to recognise and salute their invaluable contribution, both now and in the past. We must examine how we need to change if we are truly to give freedom to everyone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para30"><a name="07032066000192">As has been noted, some of the symptoms of modern-day slavery are not hard to find. Sadly, human trafficking is evident in just about every town and city in western Europe. The figures that we have discussed today are probably only very rough estimates&#151;700,000 people affected by slavery worldwide, with perhaps 4,000 adults and up to 5,000 children in the UK at any one time. What is clear, however, is that the problem has been escalating at an incredible rate over the past 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para31"><a name="07032066000193">The Government&#146;s response over the past 12 months shows that they are stepping up to the mark. They have agreed to sign the European convention, and they have also put in place the new human traffic incentive in Sheffield, the home city of my hon. Friend the Minister for Women and Equality. I am sure that she will say more about that when she winds up the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para32"><a name="07032066000194">The success of the Pentameter operation in a few short months last year showed the scale of the challenge. As a nation, we must devote suitable resources&#151;and time&#151;to the problem, through our public and voluntary agencies. I also welcome the announcement that the Home Office is due to make later this week about a UK-wide assistance scheme. I want to recommend to Ministers, and especially those in the Home Office, the success of the individualised-case approach that has been taken in Glasgow. The Trafficking Awareness Raising Alliance project is a partnership initiative involving Glasgow city council, Strathclyde police, the Scottish Executive, the voluntary sector and the Home Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para33"><a name="07032066000195">In many ways, the Tara project mirrors the POPPY project that was mentioned earlier. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) said, both projects give women a reflection period, in which they can recover and consider their futures. They also allow  <br>

those women to assist the police authorities, and all that is vital if we are to have any way of tackling the problem effectively. I also want to reiterate what my hon. Friend said about the good examples in Italy, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, where reflection periods are standard and there is much greater access to refuge assistance. Higher rates of prosecutions and convictions are secured in those countries, but it is inevitable that the trade will continue to flourish here if we do not put in place adequate deterrents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para34"><a name="07032066000196">However, by its very nature, trafficking is hidden. There is increasing evidence of people being trafficked to work as domestic slaves, which makes detectioneven more fraught. I share the concerns that the Government&#146;s plans to prohibit migrant domestic workers from changing employers may aggravate that problem. When they announce the plans later this week, I hope that the Government will take account of the effect on other policies, and ensure that more barriers are not put up to giving the most vulnerable people in our country adequate protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para35"><a name="07032066000197">We also need to ensure that all our public agencies are made aware of trafficking. I was interested to hear about an experiment in Edinburgh, where airport parking attendants have been trained by the police to spot trafficking gangs hanging around, waiting for their next human collections. The attendants have passed on valuable evidence to the police, and I hope that a similar system could be developed at all our airports and ports, to make use of the knowledge that staff have of the way that people travel in and out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para36"><a name="07032066000198">I turn now to something that has been mentioned in the debate already, but which I believe is very well worth saying again. We need to drive home to the clients of prostitutes the sort of abuse that they may be maintaining. There is no supply without demand, and we need to alter the focus of prosecution. The clients of prostitutes should know better: they should know that the people involved&#151;many of them under the ageof 18&#151;are often in abusive relationships, or suffer dreadful abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para37"><a name="07032066000199">However, slavery is not confined to western Europe or the west in general. Last month, I visited Ethiopia with the International Development Committee, and one of the local organisations that we visited carried out work to protect young children from poor rural areas who had been sent to towns and cities in the hope of a better life but who had often ended up as mere chattels. Child labour and bonded labour are still prevalent in many areas of Africa and Asia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70320-0015.htm_para38"><a name="07032066000200">We need to continue to assist the Governments in the countries involved, and organisations such as the International Labour Organisation and the Institute of Migration, to find ways to tackle the abuses effectively and to change the way that society tolerates such behaviour. People need basic labour rights, but we have to put in place the mechanisms to enforce them. Free and independent trade unions were an essential component in our own development as a democracy, but too frequently they are overlooked as a means of tackling abuses such as trafficking.</p>

They are still to be found, and it is the disparities and lack of economic opportunity to which they give rise that create so many opportunities for the human traffickers. Despite the fine words of the past few years following the start of the World Trade Organisation&#146;s Doha round, we are still far away from delivering even a small amount of trade justice to the poorest nations. Time after time, we create or sustain systems thathave been used to exploit. They have exploitedthe weaknesses in regulation in the poorest countries, the tax havens that take billions of pounds away from the world's poorest, and the dumping of our unwanted food. Those systems have also enjoyed the fruits of the &#147;brain drain&#148; or been used to support corrupt and undemocratic regimes. Some western Governments are already shying away from the aid commitments that they made in 2005, claiming that they are too expensive&#151;but the question surely is, too expensive for whom?</p>

Today, we are being asked to challengeand change our version of the status quo, and to acknowledge that all of us still benefit economically from coerced or exploited labour somewhere on the planet.</p>

Should we apologise for the Croke Park stadium massacre in Ireland, or the Rorke&#146;s Drift incident? Should the fire brigade apologise because the Pudding lane fire in 1666 was not put out in time and led to the great fire of London? Political correctness seems to creep in occasionally. However dark our history, is it for today&#146;s leaders to apologise for events with which they have no direct connection? Perhaps the symbolism attached to such events makes it appropriate to comment on them. We certainly have much to learn about them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07032071000004">The debate is certainly worth having; it is not only a reminder of what has been achieved over the past 200 years but a stark reminder of how far we still have to go. Passing a law to abolish slavery shows a nation&#146;s intention, but implementing it shows a nation&#146;s commitment. When I was researching for the debate, I found&#151;no doubt like other Members&#151;interesting references and snippets of information. We have just celebrated St. Patrick&#146;s day. St. Patrick was a slave. He was born in Roman Britain and taken to Ireland as a slave. He must have grown accustomed to the place because he returned and was involved in the Church, and is remembered on 17 March. Aesop is another slave who has not yet been mentioned in the debate. The inspiration for his famous fables was drawn from his period of slavery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07032071000005">Many historical incidents reflect aspects of slavery and the slave trade, but the most important thing to remember is that slavery is not just connected with Africa. It forms a darker chapter in the developmentof every world civilisation. In the book of Exodus, which may be one of the first detailed accounts of a movement to free slaves, we read how Moses led the Israelite slaves from ancient Egypt. Other Members have mentioned that slavery formed part of life in the ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman empires. Even the Vikings participated in slavery. Japan had advanced laws governing slavery from the eighth century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07032071000006">In all those civilisations, there were common factors in slavery. Enslavement could be the punishment for a crime or the consequence of a debt. Prisoners of war could be enslaved. Even more seriously, some people were born as slaves and grew up already part of the slave operation. As Rome expanded, entire populations were enslaved and we pay tribute to many people who opposed their slavery. The name of Spartacus will be familiar&#151;he led the revolt in the third Servile war&#151;but we should pay tribute to many others across the globe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07032071000007">The middle east is probably responsible for one of the oldest slave trades. Male slaves were used as servants, soldiers or labourers by their owners and the practice continued until the 20th century. Closer to home, although slavery in the form of the trade of serfs was made illegal in England in 1102, it was used as a punishment by Cromwell&#146;s new model army to deal with Catholics in Ireland. Their land was confiscated and they were sent to the West Indies. Serfdom resurfaced when &#147;personal servants&#148;, as slaves were called, were brought from Africa in the 18th century&#151;the aspect on which most of the debate has focused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07032071000008">We stand alongside many other European countries, including Portugal, Holland and France, as the main perpetrators of slavery, robbing Africa of its people and developing what is now referred to as the triangular trade that linked Europe, Africa and the new world. As has been said, until 1772 the legal status of slaves was unclear. The first challenge came fromJames Somerset, a runaway slave whose owner wanted to pack him off to Jamaica. However, because he had been baptised in England, he could take his case to the courts and the judge decided that under common law slavery had no legal status, which meant that the 14,000 or so slaves in England at the time were emancipated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07032071000009">The British anti-slavery movement, under the Quakers, did not begin until 1783. In May 1787, the committee for the abolition of the slave trade was  <br>

formed, and included various people we havealready heard about today&#151;Joseph Woods, William Wilberforce and Granville Sharp. From 1789, abolition Bills were repeatedly proposed until eventuallyGeorge III approved one on this day 200 years ago. But, of course, the measure did not free the slaves. It simply made the slave trade illegal. As has been mentioned, slaves were not freed until 1833. It is interesting to note that the Church was not exempt from participating in the trade. In 1834, following the emancipation of slaves under an Act of Parliament, the Bishop of Exeter received compensation of &#163;100 per slave. He was forced to set free 665 slaves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07032071000010">The supply of slaves, mostly from Africa, and the demand in the Americas is at the heart of today&#146;s debate. It is estimated that about 15 million people were shipped from Africa. Sadly, about 15 per cent. of them died while being captured or on route. The great majority were shipped to the Americas. When I visited the national museum in Tobago quite recently, I was astonished to read some of the extracts and accounts not only from some of the slaves that had been freed, but, more hauntingly, from some of the traffickersand the traders, who had labelled slaves in various groups&#151;almost like cattle stock. They referred to the slaves&#146; strengths, co-operativeness, brains and so forth, depending on what part of Africa they had come from. That is how advanced the trade had become.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07032071000011">The growth of the colonies fed the appetite for slaves. Jamestown led the way by writing into law the rights of slave ownership. With Canada and Mexico banning slavery in 1810, a complex network of escape routes to allow slaves to depart from the colonies, either north or south, was created by people who were trying for abolition. Harriet Tubman was one of the foundersof what was called the underground railway, which allowed slaves to move either north or south and get away from their owners. The slavery issue was not reconciled until the American civil war. There are many factors that one could say led to the dividing of the nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07032071000012">I was pleased to hear the Deputy Prime Minister pay tribute to the replica of the Amistad, the slave ship that sailed in 1839, with a host of slaves on board. That replica is coming to the United Kingdom shortly. The original ship set out from the African slave factory in Lomboko, which is now Sierra Leone. While it was heading towards Cuba, there was a mutiny and the slaves took over the ship. They did not know where they were going. They wanted to return to Africa, but they were misled by the Spanish who were still on the ship and ended up heading up the coast of the United States. The ship was eventually stopped by the USS Washington&#151;by the American navy. There followed a long and public battle, which eventually led to a judgment by the Supreme Court. Thanks to a former President, John Quincy Adams, that represented a major breakthrough for the abolitionists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07032071000014">It is a welcome sign of the times that the press in that day had the freedom to make such comments, but the extract is also an indication of the society of the day,in which slavery was so accepted that the President wanted to interfere with a court case simply to ensure the status quo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07032071000015">Such events cut the nation in two and clearly led to the civil war. It was not until after the civil war, under Abraham Lincoln, that the 13th amendment was signed to declare slavery unlawful. However, although the law changed, attitudes did not, and from that time blacks were considered to be second-class citizens. As we know, there was segregation, and it was not until the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s that blacks obtained legal protection from racial discrimination. Sadly, the slow speed of reform is perhaps at the heart of the problems that exist in the United States, which have galvanised attitudes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07032071000016">Of course, the oppression of individuals, countries and races is not limited simply to blacks. We should pay tribute to those who were caught up in the Japanese labour camps, such as those involved in the Burma railway, the concentration camps in Nazi Germany and the Russian gulags. We should not forget the heroes who fought and, in many cases, died to challenge the regimes that advocated those forms of slavery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07032071000017">Let me move on to the challenges that we face now. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen), who spoke with passion about the problems of human trafficking, as did other hon. Members. The idea of slavery has not disappeared; it has simply gone underground. Despite various acts by the United Nations, including drafting article IV of the universal declaration of human rights, which explicitly bans slavery, it is still a problem today. A UN report suggests that the victims of slavery come from some 127 countries throughout the world. The major destinations of victims include wealthy countries in western Europe, north America and the middle east. As has been said again and again, women make up 70 per cent. of worldwide trafficking cases and sexual exploitation is a factor in 87 per cent. of those cases, while forced labour is another factor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para19"><a name="07032071000018">People are encouraged to leave their home countries under false pretences. They are enticed by being told that a better life is ahead of them. They are promised work in the hospitality or domestic work industries,but once they reach their destination, their official documents are removed and they are forced into either bonded labour, or prostitution. I understand from the police that about 4,000 people are involved in some form of forced prostitution in the United Kingdom at any one time. The gangs behind the trade buy and sell women for between &#163;2,000 and &#163;8,000. Even though the individuals are given a small amount of money, they are hugely in debt, so they can never get out of the circle of distress in which they find themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para20"><a name="07032071000019">I am pleased that the Government have taken a number of initiatives. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 introduced a new offence of trafficking someone into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation, while the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 criminalised the trafficking of people for any form of exploitation. Although I was encouraged by the words of the Deputy Prime Minister, we must&#151;this has been repeated time and again&#151;finally ratify the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings. Ratification is long overdue. The convention addresses the standardsof living that are capable of ensuring individuals&#146; subsistence, access to emergency medical treatment, translation and interpretation services, and counselling and information. We should be providing such vital things, given that our colleagues across the water in Europe have already agreed to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para21"><a name="07032071000020">The Conservative party is in tandem with other parties on this matter. We have made major announcements on tackling human trafficking, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) pointed out. We not only want the Council of Europe convention to be signed, but believe that we need to establish a UK border police force with expertise in intercepting traffickers and victims at our borders. We think that there should be separate interviews at all airports for women and children travelling alone with an adult who is not a parent, guardian or husband. We should strengthen co-ordination among the relevant Government Departments and the Serious Organised Crime Agency to tackle the problem. We should also ensure that every police force has a strategy to deal with suspected victims of trafficking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07032071000021">In conclusion, it has been a sobering debate, allowing us to reacquaint ourselves with the challenges of the future as well as to celebrate some of the successes from the past. Britain can certainly be proud of its actions in righting many of those wrongs, but let us not forget that slavery takes many forms and that, despite the progress made in removing the legitimate and overt forms of slavery, it is now the illegitimate and covert exploitation of slavery that still exists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07032071000022">There is much work to be done and if Britain isto continue as a beacon for human rights, we must recognise the advances in transport and communication that have led to the development of a truly global challenge in respect of the trafficking of humans. If we are finally to stop the appalling trade of human traffic, we must have an international effort. We celebrate the anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade, but let us use this opportunity to recommit ourselves to tackling slavery in the horrible and horrendous form that it has taken&#151;and always will take.</p>

was a blemish on our history, but it is important that we remember it, because it is part of this country&#146;s history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07032088000002">On the other hand, I want to make it quite clear that I agree with the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) that there is no cause for apology. I note that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, when visiting America recently, apologised on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland for the part that it played in the slave trade. There is an irony, of course. Although Belfast was well placed as a port on the right side of the United Kingdom to have benefited from the slave trade, because of the strong evangelical Christian influence in Northern Ireland at the turn of the18th century, it did not do so. Indeed, there was a very strong lobby against slavery in that part of Ireland&#151;northern Ireland&#151;at that time. There are certainly plenty of other things that, if he had wanted to, the Secretary of State could have apologised for, but I will not go into those tonight, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as you would probably call me to order for digressing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para25"><a name="07032088000003">The historic decision that was taken illustrates the role that can be played&#151;and was played&#151;by someone who was strongly motivated and able to use the advantages of the climate of the time in which he lived and the support that he gained. Much has been said in the House today about William Wilberforce, but as has been pointed out, he was not alone. At the age of 10, he was influenced by his meeting with John Newton, the slave trader turned parson. Then he met Thomas Clarkson. I cannot provide the same detail about Thomas Clarkson&#146;s life as the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), but one thing that we do know is that at a time when much that happened in the slave trade was buried beneath the surface&#151;we did not have the media of today&#151;he risked life and limb to find out about the methods and facts of the trade, which he brought to Wilberforce&#146;s attention. Wilberforce studied those reports to establish the effect of the trade first on the slaves themselves, and secondly on Africa and the colonies to which they were taken. He then made up his mind to oppose it in the House of Commons by means of parliamentary procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para26"><a name="07032088000004">Wilberforce was helped by a strong evangelical Christian climate. There were the Quakers&#151;who have already been mentioned&#151;the Methodists and, in the Church of England, the Clapham sect, all of whom created a climate that encouraged people to abhor the slave trade and the way in which it denigrated and damaged fellow human beings. Wilberforce was also helped by the courage of Africans who used the opportunities available to them. We have heard today about Sam Sharpe, the Baptist preacher in Jamaica who persuaded slaves there that it was not right to lie down under slavery, and about Equiano, who wrote an autobiography that had a great influence in the United Kingdom. Wilberforce was not alone, and those who were with him used all the methods that have been described today: lobbying, slogans, trade bans and, indeed, propaganda. Clarkson recognised more than anyone else that a human interest story, a story of individuals and the way in which they had been affected, could capture people&#146;s hearts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para27"><a name="07032088000005">Twenty-odd years before he succeeded in his aim, Wilberforce stood in the House of Commons and said:  <br>

Let the consequences be what they would, I from this time determined that I would never rest until I had effected its abolition.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para28"><a name="07032088000006">That determination and strength of character enabled Wilberforce to take on the establishment. As we have heard, Lord Mayors of Liverpool benefited from and lobbied for the slave trade. Members of Parliament were bought by the colonists, who spoke of economic ruin if the trade was not allowed to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para29"><a name="07032088000007">It is significant that Wilberforce succeeded in persuading the House to act against the economic and political interests of our country in order to do away with a great evil. A mere Back Bencher, described by the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) as an independent, was able to have that degree of influence because of the determination with which he had set his face against the slave trade. I wonder whether today&#151;given that the House of Commons has handed much of its power to other bodies in Europe and elsewhere, and given that even the power that does rest here has been absorbed into the Executive&#151;it would be possible for a campaigning Back Bencher to turn around the country&#146;s economic policy in the face of established interests. I doubt it very much.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para30"><a name="07032088000008">As other Members have pointed out, slavery is still with us. As long as there are people who are strong and people who are weak, there will be opportunity for slavery. Human beings and human nature being what they are, those weaknesses will be exploited. When we go on holiday and see the great pyramids in Egypt, we are seeing monuments to slavery; indeed, we can see monuments to slavery in our own civilisation, built by people who were enslaved and used as economic tools at various times in world history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para31"><a name="07032088000009">Today, of course, there are still strong people who exploit and take advantage of those who are weak. Numerous examples have been mentioned, but I shall give just two. The first is pertinent to Northern Ireland. When the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs looked into the subject of organised crime,it considered the role that paramilitaries play in exploiting people who are trafficked into the United Kingdom and who are either used for cheap labour or sexually exploited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70320-0016.htm_para32"><a name="07032088000010">Of course, the problem is not unique to Northern Ireland&#151;organised criminals are doing the same in other parts of the United Kingdom&#151;but if we are to convince people in Northern Ireland that there will be an end to paramilitarism, and that the ill-gotten gains of paramilitarism will not remain with people who exploit human weakness, we must robustly take those people on, whether they have political influence or not. It may mean making hard decisions in the so-called peace process, but it is important that the message goes out that people who engage in such activity will face the full brunt of the law and will lose their ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para0"><a name="07032088000011">On that point, I hope that the change in the organisation of the Assets Recovery Agency will not diminish the ability of the authorities in Northern Ireland to take away from those who gain from the sex trade and from using trafficked individuals.

players in the organised crime market and leave those at a lower level, who nevertheless gain from such trade. We seek assurances from the Government that that will not be the case. Of course, sentences must be severe, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07032088000012">My second example is a form of slavery from which we in this country benefit to a certain extent. It is indentured labour, which is sometimes found in this country. For example, in the Morecambe bay incident, in which people brought into the country by gangmasters were exploited for very low wages, we saw that people can become victims of what is virtually a slave trade. We also benefit from cheap consumer goods, and some good investigative reporting has been done on that subject; sometimes, people work in conditions that are little short of slavery. I listened to what the hon. Member for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin) said about free trade, but if there are no conditions attached to trade, it can help to further exploitation, because it gives freer access to western markets, and provides an even greater incentive to those who want to exploit labour in third-world countries&#151;it encourages them to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07032088000013">There is one other form of slavery that I want to mention, but I do not want to detract in any way from the suffering of people who have been subject to slavery through the ages. Slavery means the weak, the vulnerable and the desperate being exploited, and I believe that the Government have created a climate in which many people in this country will find themselves enslaved, not by having their freedom taken away from them, but by the addictions to which they are prone. Opportunities are being put in their way. Powerful arguments have been made by Government Members for 24-hour drinking and a casino-type society. We are providing opportunities, because of the powerful economic arguments that have been advanced, for people to become enslaved to their addictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07032088000017">Although William Wilberforce was born in Hull, and was Member of Parliament for the city, he campaigned in Clapham and he spent most of his life in Battersea in my constituency. He had a large house&#151;Broomwood house&#151;on land that now occupies a whole ward of my constituency in the area known as &#147;Between the commons&#148;, which accommodates 800 houses. In those days, however, there was a single house, the site of which is commemorated by a plaque at 111, Broomwood road. The gardens, however, were far larger. On Friday, I shall visit a local school that is located where those gardens used to be, to talk to year 5 children about the history of slavery. I will be able to speak in local terms, because one can almost imagine William Wilberforce in the oval library in Broomwood house&#151;sadly, it no longer exists&#151;persuading many of the people with whom he campaigned and talking about tactics. That is where he plotted most of the campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07032088000018">William Wilberforce is remembered in Battersea in the Wilberforce estate, which includes Wilberforce house, Clarkson house, which commemorates thegreat extra-parliamentary leader of the abolitionist movement, and Buxton house, which commemorates the later leader who achieved the abolition of slavery. Pitt and Burke houses commemorate Tories involved in the campaign, and Sheridan house commemorates a Whig involved in the campaign. It is a paradox that Wilberforce was a Tory. He was the son of merchants in Hull, but most of the Tories opposed his campaign to abolish the slave trade, and he had to rely on the Whigs for support. Having enlisted their support, he drew inspiration from Christians in the Clapham sect, which was centred on Holy Trinity church. He himself provided inspiration for Battersea&#146;s early socialists, who were proud of the fact that he lived in the area. Battersea produced the first black mayor in this country&#151;John Archer, who was the grandson of a Barbadian slave and became mayor of Battersea in 1912. The area also produced the first black Labour MP, Shapurji Saklatvala, some 10 years later. It is an area that is proud of its association with William Wilberforce and it has done its best to take forward the tradition that he established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07032088000019">The Clapham sect was involved in far more than the anti-slavery campaign, although that dwarfs all the other issues on which it campaigned. It is interesting to know that members of the sect won their campaign to abolish bear baiting and bull baiting. They campaigned for village schools, with some success. They werethe first prison visitors. They campaigned against pornographic books. Their campaign for smallpox vaccination had almost as much effect as their most famous campaign. Later they founded the colony of Sierra Leone, which became a home for freed slaves. William Wilberforce was their parliamentary leader and the towering figure in the anti-slavery campaign, but many other well known figures such as Thornton were members of the Clapham sect, who deserve to be remembered for their part in the great campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07032088000020">As we have heard many times, the slave trade was abolished in 1807, but it took until 1833 before slavery itself was abolished. William Wilberforce died only three days after the abolition of slavery, but he had time to record his disgust at the fact that &#163;20 million, which must have been a huge amount in those days, was paid in compensation to slave owners. That was the price that Parliament paid to get rid of slavery.</p>

As the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) said, he was a Back Bencher. It would be good to think that Back Benchers could achieve even a small part of what Wilberforce did, with no ministerial career behind him and no great weight of authority in the House, only his own passion and conviction. Rather than a politician, he was a campaigner of pure heart. He never demonised the slave traders themselves. Most of us, and certainly I, if I were involved in a campaign against the slave trade, would demonise the slave traders, but William Wilberforce said:</p>
<a name="70320-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="07032088000101"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I mean not to accuse any one, but to take the shame upon myself, in common, indeed, with the whole Parliament of Great Britain, for having suffered this horrid trade to be carried on under their authority. We are all guilty&#151;we ought all to plead guilty, and not to exculpate ourselves by throwing the blame on others; and I therefore deprecate every kind of reflection against the various descriptions of people who are more immediately involved in this wretched business.&#148;</p>

Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) spoke about all the things that the Prime Minister made apologies for, suggesting that that was becoming too politically correct, but he cannot have thought for a moment that it was some kind of political correctness to make an apology for the slave trade. We need only look back at the words of William Wilberforce to see that we should conduct the debate in the spirit of contrition for what is past and of determination to make sure that we in Parliament play our part in ending slavery for good.</p>

 It is interesting to follow the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton), who was quite parochial in his remarks about various personalities from his constituency who played their part in historic events years ago. I will be similarly parochial about the role that the city of Bristol, which I represent in Parliament, played in events200 years ago. The hon. Gentleman mentioned one of my predecessors, Edmund Burke, who bravely spoke against slavery while being the Member for Bristol, which was one of the reasons why he had to flee the city in 1780 and not contest an election again in that particular seat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07032088000025">The question of slavery is undoubtedly an emotive issue for present-day Bristolians, and its legacy has been much discussed in the city. Bristol was one of the country&#146;s three principal slaving ports. Once the royal monopoly on slavery that restricted the slave trade to London was lifted in 1698, Bristol merchants entered into the slave trade with some enthusiasm, I haveto acknowledge, although by the middle of the18th century the city was overtaken by Liverpool as one of the principal slaving ports in the country. As well as the slave trade itself&#151;in economic terms, it is a moot point as to how much prosperity the slave trade brought to the city, because many slaving voyages ended in a net loss&#151;the city prospered from the trades associated with it, such as sugar, tobacco and brass.  <br>

Many of the slave plantation owners in the West Indies had a direct link to Bristol and contributed much to the city&#146;s wealth. Ironically, the compensation that they received once full emancipation took effect in 1838 contributed further to the city&#146;s prosperity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07032088000026">Contrary to what many people believe, very few slaves passed through the city of Bristol, although many became servants there. In north Bristol, in Henbury churchyard, there is the grave of Scipio Africanus, who is buried there. In the city centre, we commemorate one of the few known slaves apart from Scipio Africanus, who was known as Pero and was the slave of a West Indies plantation owner who lived in the Georgian House in the centre of my constituency.</p>

The legacy of slavery and the racism that is associated with it is a very hot topic in my constituency at the moment; indeed, it has been a big topic of discussion in the city for many decades. Some significant progress has been made. The hon. Member for Battersea said that the first black mayor was in his borough. Bristol can claim the first Afro-Caribbean lord mayor&#151;Jim Williams, who was a Labour councillor and became lord mayor of Bristol in 1990. I was pleased to play my part in the election of the city&#146;s first black Afro-Caribbean-origin lady councillor&#151;Shirley Marshall&#151;in my constituency in 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07032088000028">The question of how to commemorate the events of 200 years ago has been the subject of much debate in the city. How do we balance a recognition of the shame of the city&#146;s association with slavery, which is much referred to by people from outside the city, with a commemoration of the blow for civil rights and human dignity that this Parliament made in 1807? In fact, the city and people of Bristol played a role in both aspects. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07032088000029">In the mid-1990s, when I was a councillor for the city centre of Bristol, a couple of Labour councillors and I mounted a campaign to ensure that the city owned up to its rather shameful past as regards its association with the slave trade, because there was nothing to be seen in the city&#146;s museums that reflected it. That led to an exhibition in the Georgian House, which has been open to the public for about a century and was owned by the Pinney family, who were big plantation owners in Nevis in the West Indies. That led to a larger exhibition in the Industrial museum, which will lead in turn to an exhibition later this year in the British Empire and Commonwealth museum next to Bristol Temple Meads station. The new city of Bristol museum, for which I have campaigned for about15 years, will open in 2009, on the back of investment from the city council and the national lottery. It will have a permanent gallery showing the warts-and-all story of Bristol&#146;s role in the slave trade.</p>

 Has the hon. Gentleman any idea of how much new slavery there is in Bristol? Has he any idea of how many women and children there are who have been trafficked? I am not in any way demeaning what he is saying, but slavery is not dead, and it is certainly pretty active in Bristol.</p>

and I recognise his passionate commitment to raising the issue of human trafficking. He and other hon. Members have mentioned prostitution, and that is certainly an unfortunate feature of a major city such as the capital of the west of England. In my constituency, unfortunately, there are women of various nationalities who are there, either because of their drug dependency or no doubt because they have been trafficked into the area, to satisfy the quite awful needs of some men in the city of Bristol. That is a matter of shame for all of us, and a reminder of the lack of human dignity that some people have to face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07032088000032">How Bristol should face up to the events of 200 years ago is a matter of great debate there. Some people wish to erase all memory of the city&#146;s role in the slave trade by altering street names and the name of our concert hall, and by not allowing a shopping centre to make even a convoluted reference to merchants. The hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), who is no longer in his place, mentioned the role of Edward Colston in the city of Bristol, and that, too, is a topic for debate at the moment. I believe, however, that the way to deal with the past is not to erase it from our memory but to recognise it, debate it and interpret it wherever we find an association with the past that is linked to slavery, be it a statue, a hall or a shopping centre. Wherever we find a link, however tenuous, we should interpret it so that people can understand the issues of the past, deal with them and relate them to what is happening today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07032088000033">The hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) mentioned the apology that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had made on behalf of all of us in this regard. The question of an apology has also been a topic of debate in Bristol. I do not believe that the present generation of Bristolians or their elected representatives can apologise for the actions of people who were alive in the city 200 years ago. We cannot transfer guilt on to those people, particularly as only a minority of the citizens of that time participated in the slave trade or had a direct interest in the West Indies. Moreover, many ordinary Bristolians campaigned against the trade. It is better to recognise all facets of the trade and to understand our legacy. The city council has, none the less, debated the question of an apology and issued a statement of profound regret, which was in a tone similar to the one issued by the Prime Minister on behalf of the nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para17"><a name="07032088000034">I want to talk briefly about the role of the city in the events of 200 years ago. As early as 1783, the Society of Friends in Bristol first mounted a campaign against the slave trade in which some Bristolians were engaged. On 27 June 1787, Thomas Clarkson first arrived in Bristol to gather the evidence that many hon. Members have referred to today. That evidence was subsequentlyused by Wilberforce in his parliamentary campaign. Clarkson&#146;s 1808 two-volume account of his campaign was entitled &#147;The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave-Trade by the British Parliament&#148;, which was rather a long title for a series of memoirs. In it, he noted that Bristolians were not at all proud of the trade that was taking place in the city. He said that</p>
<a name="70320-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="07032088000102"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;every body seemed to execrate it, though no one thought of its abolition.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07032088000035">In Bristol, aided by Mr. Thompson, the landlord of the &#147;Seven Stars&#148; pub, which still exists in the city centre, Thomas Clarkson was escorted around the public houses where seamen were recruited to go on slaving voyages. That formed the basis of the evidence that he gathered to campaign against the slave trade in the country, and which he fed to Wilberforce for his campaign in Parliament. The evidence of maltreatment of the seamen aroused almost as much moral outrage at the time as that of the maltreatment of the captives. There were tales of floggings, burnings with hot pitch, branding with tongs and throwing people overboard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07032088000036">In 1787, a local committee was established in Bristol for the abolition of the slave trade, bringing together Quakers, Anglicans and dissenters, as well as leading public figures in the city. Clarkson then left to gather further evidence in Liverpool. In Bristol, the debate raged for the next 20 years between the abolitionists and the West Indian interests that wished to perpetuate the slave trade. I have to say that my parliamentary predecessors did not play a particularly distinguished role in 1807 in the passing of the Act that we are commemorating tonight. The 1830 election, however, was fought directly on the issue of the continuance of slavery, and competing Whig candidates&#151;one for emancipation and one against&#151;stood. Sadly, the forces of emancipation were defeated&#151;though certainly not disgraced&#151;by 3,378 votes to 2,843. Of course, thatwas on a very limited pre-1832 franchise. The Act to emancipate slaves became one of the first passed by the reformed House after 1832.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07032088000037">The abolition of the slave trade in 1807 is arguably the first blow for human rights by any national Parliament on behalf of the peoples of other countries. In opening the debate, the Deputy Prime Minister referred to the teaching of history in our schools, as did other Members. I have spoken on black history month a couple of times since being elected a Member of Parliament, and I share with the hon. Member for Brent, South (Ms Butler), who is not currently in her place, the hope that black history issues will be integral to the new history curriculum, and I am assured that that has been the case in Bristol schools for many years. I shall invite all the schools in my constituency to come and see the exhibition in Westminster Hall. Cabot school in St. Paul&#146;s in my constituency has already had an exhibition and commemoration of present-day and historical black heroes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07032088000038">There is much cynicism about politics, but 2007 provides an opportunity for us to remind people of the good that politics and Parliament can do, as well as to remind them of how much good can be achieved by those who campaign outside Parliament. When I studied history in school, I learned of the success of the Anti-Corn Law League compared with the failure of Chartism. I was not taught at the time of the success in 1807 of the campaign from outside Parliament to end the slave trade. On Sunday, in Bristol, as in Hull and Liverpool, there will be a service in the cathedral to commemorate the events of 200 years ago. Across the city, the bells will be rung, by contrast with when they were rung on the many occasions that Wilberforce&#146;s attempts to abolish the slave trade were defeated. When those bells fall silent, all of us in Bristol will have an opportunity to have a period of quiet contemplation  <br>

 It is a profound honour to wind up for the Opposition in a debate that has never failed, in any speech, to be interesting and informative. Members of the House have displayed terrific knowledge of and commitment to the issues. This is an especially proud moment for me as a council member of the Evangelical Alliance, which represents 1 million Christians in the UK, all of whom are immensely proud of the evangelical William Wilberforce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07032088000040">Whatever our individual backgrounds, few of us, when we contemplated a parliamentary career, were unmindful of the history of this place. For whichever side of the House we were destined, we were moved by the thought of being physically connected, through our mere presence as Members, to some of the Acts and events that shaped the country&#146;s destiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para23"><a name="07032088000041">Among those Acts, the measure that we remember tonight takes its place as one of a series in the19th century that would change us as a people and a society for ever, etching compassion for the victims of a new and harshly constituted urban environment into law for our towns and cities, workplaces, prisons and schools. However, the fact that the measure that we remember tonight holds a special place in our history recognises its reach beyond these shores and celebrates the character of the man most associated with it&#151;William Wilberforce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07032088000042">Before I speak about William Wilberforce and his achievements, let me acknowledge some key themes of the debate. I welcome most warmly the opening speeches by the Deputy Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague). Both spoke with commitment. The Deputy Prime Minister spoke from deep knowledge of his constituency and of what Wilberforce means to him. My right hon. Friend gave a remarkable performance, even for him, demonstrating complete mastery of his special subject. Anyone who took him on about Wilberforce on &#147;Mastermind&#148; would come off second best. Two fine opening speeches were followed by a series of others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70320-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07032088000043">Praise for William Wilberforce is not a zero sum game. It neither denigrates him to recognise that he was not alone in the quest to rid our country and the world of an evil trade, nor does it devalue the efforts of others to appreciate that his importance as the right man in the right place at the right time changed history faster than it might have been changed. We do not need to justify our opinions of Wilberforce and his role in the abolition movement by trying to defend him against charges that he never heard or by feeling aggrieved that others are not mentioned in the same breath when the roles of those most involved are discussed.</p>

Granville Sharp; Olaudah Equiano; Ottabah Cugoano; John Newton; the Clapham sect; William Knibb, and Elizabeth Heyrick, who led the Leicester sugar revolt and appeared from time to time as a representative of the thousands of women in this country who supported the abolitionist movement. Thousands of nameless people responded to petitions and the work throughout the country. We also heard about the Maroons in Jamaica. All are valued and honoured in the House. We acknowledge that the culmination of William Wilberforce&#146;s life and work could not have happened without the contributions of many others, for whom he was an outstanding focus and catalyst.</p>

It was considered, well rounded and not only displayed a knowledge of the miseries of slavery, which she conveyed, but made a thoughtful contribution on its legacy. We are in her debt and I hope that she chooses it as her speech of the week on Mr. Andrew Neil&#146;s programme in a couple of days. She and the hon. Member for Brent, South (Ms Butler) spoke with a particular understanding, which&#151;forgive me&#151;I cannot reach, not only because of what they said and how they said it, but because of who they are and whom they represent. The fact that the House includes them and others who have their background is a great honour for us. They both conveyed that in a remarkable way, for which I thank them.</p>

He described some of the messiness involved&#151;how the Royal Navy simultaneously patrolled the seas to stop the slave trade and took part in quelling the slave rebellions in the islands. Life is not consistent, and it is messy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07032088000048">Our debate today is not a celebration&#151;and it is certainly not a celebration of the end of slavery. Many colleagues have spoken knowledgeably and movingly about the tragedy that is modern-day slavery in all its many forms. It never went away. Slavery is not simply an act or a series of acts that physically enslave or control. Slavery begins in the mind. It is an act of oppression and domination springing from a perversion of the human spirit which, cruelly, can only value the freedom in one if it deals in the loss of freedom in another. That is why the slavers of today have simple common cause with those of yesteryear, and that is why, sadly, slavery crosses all human boundaries&#151;race, faith, colour and nation. It is everywhere.</p>

trafficking and our understanding of where it begins, enough is being done. That was also asked by the hon. Members for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) and for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin), both of whom made reference to the worries that they have and wondered whether operations such as the Poppy project are doing enough&#151;and whether we can ever do enough. Have we perhaps found the answer to the question that is so often posed in schools: &#147;If William Wilberforce were alive today, what cause would he be involved in?&#148; Perhaps the answer to that is human trafficking, and making sure that our policies deal with it a lot more effectively. My hon. Friend the Member for Totnes raised the issue of human trafficking with great passion, and I hope that he will receive proper replies to his detailed questions, either in the debate or by letter if they cannot be answered tonight.</p>

We could have pointed to the problem of child soldiers around the world, and particularly in Africa. In 2006, the United Nations estimated that more than 250,000 children were actively involved in armed conflict. That problem is most critical in Africa where up to 100,000 children, some as young as nine years old, were estimated to be involved in armed conflict in mid-2004. Forcible abductions, sometimes of large numbers of children, continue to occur in some countries. We could also have picked up on any number of examples of people&#151;children especially&#151;being taken into work, such as starting as domestics and being put into bondage and slavery, or being fooled into taking a job and then finding themselves involved in prostitution.</p>

The many Members who spoke about that with passion and concern made their points very well, particularly my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07032088000055">Wilberforce was a brilliant man who fancied a career in politics and was clever and wealthy enough through family to buy a seat in the Commons. So far, so corrupt&#151;like virtually any other of his age. Had he simply latched on to a cause in order to make his name and used this cruel trade for his own advancement and enrichment, we would be right in being embarrassed at the attention paid to him and his role, notwithstanding his success. However, that is not the case. Even in that age, as now, that an able politician should give up the chance to get on in the party and aspire to office seemed decidedly odd. As we know from our own experience, the able colleague who leaves mid-career to &#147;spend more time with the family&#148; appears to be using code that the Westminster village understands all too well. They are either up to something, have been up to something, or were never up to the job in any case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07032088000056">That is why Wilberforce was so special. All the evidence suggests that here was a man who had a wonderful political career and future, but who changed his life completely, and with it the course of history, because of Jesus Christ and a profound process of conversion. It is well documented&#151;there is evidence from Wilberforce himself, and from contemporaries hostile and friendly&#151;that his process of conversion included a period of reflection, familiar to millions around the world, on the point of life and the use of his talents. As his character changed, his attention turned to slavery, and he spent more and more time with those of similar mind. He resolved to take up in Parliament the cause of ending the slave trade, which was a necessary precursor to the abolitionist&#146;s aim: ending slavery itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07032088000057">The passage of time should not dim our understanding of what an undertaking that was. The wealth of more than one great city, as we have heard from a number of Members today, was built on cruelty to others. Throughout the attempts to end the trade, the serious impact on the country and on individuals was used as a counter-argument, in a way not dissimilar to the use of tariffs today to protect the European Union or the United States from the impact of the trade in goods from poorer countries. There is always a good argument for profit. This was a grown-up debate, in which Wilberforce was on the &#147;wrong&#148; side. He was more than a maverick&#151;he was a dangerous one. There was no political gain to be made, as has been mentioned. There was no certainty of a happy ending when he took on the fight; no suggestion that, as in a film, he would triumph for right in the final reel. He faced, as nameless others did in that cause&#151;and as nameless others have done since in every cause worth fighting against tyranny&#151;a failed career and an unsung death.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07032088000058">However, Wilberforce carried on, and it was 20 long years before he succeeded. He succeeded not only because his cause was just, although it was. He succeeded not only because he was a great orator, although he was. He succeeded not simply because he and his friends had mobilised hundreds of thousands of people in a mass campaign in a manner never seen before, although they did.

However, this, too, was an act of courage. The Christian Church in this country did not have clean hands. Good Christian men and women turned their backs on those in need, and Wilberforce&#146;s bravery in confronting them was as profound as was his bravery in politics. The achievements of the Clapham sect andof the evangelical movement in reforming social conditions have had a profound influence on the nation. Shaftesbury, Fry, William Booth, Barnardo and the unsung who worked with them and inspired them deserve their commemoration and thanks, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07032088000060">I turn finally to legacy. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North told us about what is happening in Hull and its commitment to fair trade; what a remarkable way to build on a legacy. The hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas), in a moving and wholly compelling contribution, described not only what her city has been through, but, through its twinning with Waterloo, what it is doing for the future. All those who listened to her will be pleased that they did. What a remarkable way to carry on from that past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07032088000061">The right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) raised the issue of Doha, as did the hon. Member for Glasgow, North, and how that could be an adequate legacy if we could take on the need for trade. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), in his contribution from the Front Bench, dealt with the elephant in the room&#151;the difficult issue of an apology&#151;and several other colleagues also mentioned it. I take the view that it is very difficult to apologise on behalf of others. If people do not want to apologise for the slave trade and the shame that it brought on this country, they must come from another planet, but the issue is not the words used or who apologises to whom. It is about what we do with what happened, and about responding with sincerity and integrity to the shame of the past. More than one hon. Member got the balance right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07032088000062">The hon. Members for Brent, South and for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington talked about the need for a greater pride in black history, and perhaps the dangerous legacy left from slavery in the culture of young men and violence. That took the debate into difficult, but typically brave territory that needs to be confronted in a society such as ours. If only all the legacies of slavery were dealt with by the good hearts of people in places such as Waterloo and if only it were not as difficult in some areas as it is. The hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) made a strong contribution, as did the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07032088000063">It is not the knowledge of history that shames us. When people talk about whether we should have this debate and remember slavery, it is the lack of knowledge that shames us. We are not responsible for the past, but we are responsible for what our children learn now. With an understanding of the trade, its rise, fall and rise again, they will learn that the attitudes  <br>

behind it are not past attitudes, but present-day ones. Greed is predominant. There is money to be made from exploitation and cruelty, so support those who fight against greed and exploitation wherever it arises&#151;from children kidnapped into sex slavery in eastern Europe to Chinese workers who give their life savings to agents who see them dead in the back of a wagon or on the sands of Morecambe bay.

The first involves raising awareness of the bicentenary and the transatlantic slave trade, and also of Britain&#146;s role in both the trade and its abolition. I believe that today&#146;s debate has played an important part in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para25"><a name="07032088000070">The second phase of activity involves the commemoration of those who suffered as a result of the slave trade, those who struggled for abolition and those who ensured that the new laws were enforced. The third phase involves tackling the legacy of slavery, with issues arising from the slave trade including poverty and inequality on the African continent, contemporary slavery in its various forms, and inequality and discrimination in Britain today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para26"><a name="07032088000071">I shall deal with those three phrases in more detail. Slavery has long existed in human societies, but the transatlantic slave trade was unique in terms of the destructive impact that it had on Africa. It is estimated that more than 12 million people were transported, and that some 2 million died due to the inhuman conditions in which they were transported and the violent suppression of any onboard resistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para27"><a name="07032088000072">It is tempting just to stick with the statistics and to skate over the barbaric practices that were integral to every part of the slave trade. We must also recall that the slave trade brought huge wealth to this country and caused terrible suffering to the slaves taken from Africa and to the communities left behind, with effects that still live on today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para28"><a name="07032088000073">I am indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), who went into some of the details of the slave trade and what it meant. It is important that we recognise what went on, and her speech was very moving. As other hon. Members have said, it brought home to us the connection between today and the slave trade of previous centuries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="70320-0018.htm_para29"><a name="07032088000074">Professor James Walvin has written extensively on slavery. He has stated:</p>
<a name="70320-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="07032088000105"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;From first to last, slavery was a system characterised by brutality...that had far-reaching ramifications for three continents: for the Americas, whose economic potential was tapped by generations of imported Africans, for Europe, which orchestrated (and benefited) from the whole system, and of course Africa, for which massive loss of population, with attendant violence and upheaval, caused incalculable and long term damage. But Atlantic Slavery had even more profound consequences....for it was...the means by which the West emerged to a position of unrivalled economic and political dominance.&#148;</p>

The Act was the resultof a long and often fraught parliamentary battle by committed parliamentarians supporting the abolitionist cause. However, that battle would not have been won without the efforts of the enslaved Africans and the ordinary citizens who fought for abolition. It is also important to recognise the efforts of the men of the Royal Navy, some of whom were freed slaves. They enforced the Act, and some of them gave their lives in that enforcement.</p>

Department for Education and Skills is runninga national competition for schools. Entitled &#147;Understanding Slavery: The Big Conversation 2007&#148;, the competition is designed to educate children about the slave trade and abolition. We are also looking to embed teaching about the slave trade in the curriculum permanently. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is currently consulting on a new draft secondary curriculum which, for the first time, will include the slave trade as a compulsory element in the key stage 3 history curriculum.</p>

Much of the commemorative activity centres on Britain&#146;s port cities&#151;Liverpool, London, Hull and Bristol&#151;which were the focus of the slave trade.

campaigners, but of having been born exactly 200 years after him. I reflected on how I would be feeling if something I had campaigned on for nearly 20 years was at last to be achieved. I do not share the same length of time in Parliament as William Wilberforce, but my experience gives me an interesting perspective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para1"><a name="07032088000084">The abolition committee was created in 1787, as Members have said, and was made up of opponents of the slave trade including the Quakers, with William Wilberforce as its parliamentary champion. It included Thomas Clarkson, about whom we learned in more detail from the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss). In 1789, Wilberforce made his most famous abolition speech in which he used powerful, passionate and emotive language to put his case forward, shaming Parliament for allowing that inhumane trade to occur in its name. I shall not quote extensively from the speech, because other Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton), have beaten me to it, but Wilberforce ended it by saying:</p>
<a name="70320-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="07032088000106"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A trade founded in iniquity, and carried on as this was, must be abolished, let the policy be what it might, let the consequences be what they would, I from this time determined that I would never rest till I had effected its abolition.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07032088000085">Wilberforce introduced motions on the abolition of the slave trade almost every year until the Act of 1807 and, as the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks told us, at 4.30 in the morning, on Second Reading, the Commons voted by 283 to 16 to abolish the slave trade. What shines through reports of the debates is the emphasis on justice and humanity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para3"><a name="07032088000086">Not only should we admire Wilberforce for his persistence in continuing his campaign year in, year out, we must commemorate, too, the resistance of those who were enslaved. There is no doubt that the role they played in seeking to gain their freedom was crucial. The autobiography of the former slave, Olaudah Equiano, written in 1789, furthered the cause of abolition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07032088000087">Yesterday, I was in Birmingham and was privileged to spend some time looking at the archives and the materials on the slave trade compiled by Dr. Andy Green. The role of the Quakers was central to the fight for abolition and many other Christians were involved, particularly those in the non-conformist churches. That was certainly true in Birmingham. There is also evidence of how visits to the city by former slaves, black abolitionists, influenced public opinion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para5"><a name="07032088000088">Today, we have heard today stories from around Britain. My hon. Friends the Members for Battersea and for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin) and the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) all spoke of their experience in their area. I, too, have looked into experiences in my city, Sheffield. Many local merchants profited from the trade by manufacturing metal chains and shackles and agricultural equipment for the slaves to work the land in the plantations. However, Sheffield also voiced its strong opinion for the abolition for the slave trade. The city sent two significant petitions to Parliament: one in 1789 involving over 700 metal workers, and one in 1793 involving 8,000 signatures, which amounted to between 25 and 30 per cent. of the local adult population&#151;an enormous feat by any standards. I pay tribute to the staff of Sheffield archives, especially Ruth Harman, who provided me with that information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07032088000089">The 1807 Act was a significant achievement, making the trade in slaves illegal on British ships. Slavery, of course, remained a reality in British colonies. Campaigning for the abolition of all forms of slavery continued up and down the country, including through co-ordinated boycotts of trade products, petitions and so on&#151;something that my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) described vividly. Both Sheffield and Birmingham had ladies anti-slavery societies, which were very active. The ladies of Sheffield have certainly continued to be active, as I am sure hon. Members will know. Their techniques included writing poems and hymns, and, in Birmingham, selling bags into which they put information about the reality of slavery. They collected a large amount of money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07032088000090">In 1833, the emancipation Act was passed, but a further period of apprenticeship followed, with many slaves only finally free some five years later. It is incredible that slave owners were compensated with&#163;20 million, while the slaves received nothing. It is important to note that the slavery societies continued. I looked yesterday at records from the Birmingham society from 1918-19, when it was still campaigning on this issue throughout the world. Although the passing of the Act abolishing the slave trade 200 years ago was a landmark event, it was not the end of slavery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para8"><a name="07032088000091">I now come to the issue of human trafficking. Human trafficking is one of the main forms of modern slavery. It is an appalling crime, where people are treated as commodities and traded for profit. The problem is extensive. That was rightly raised by the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen), my hon. Friends the Members for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) and for Glasgow, North, and the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack). As with the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, the British Government are seeking to lead the way in tackling the problem, both domestically and internationally. We have a comprehensive approach to human trafficking, involving legislation, enforcement, international co-operation and support for victims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para9"><a name="07032088000092">I should tell the hon. Member for Totnes, who asked a lot of questions, that the UK human trafficking centre, which is based in Sheffield, was established in autumn 2006 to support the overarching aim of moving the United Kingdom on in its prevention and investigation of the trafficking in human beings. It is built on the approach that developed through Operation Pentameter, to which a number of Members have referred. It will provide a response to trafficking on a national level and consists of a multi-agency representation. It will work with police forces and other agencies, while also working with the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which will combat trafficking on an international level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para10"><a name="07032088000093">Hon. Members asked about the level of support. Many are familiar with the POPPY scheme, which provides secure accommodation. I reassure hon. Members that we have given additional money to the POPPY project to develop further outreach measures. As my hon. Friends are now aware, the Government will sign the Council of Europe&#146;s convention on human trafficking and will publish their own action plan.

We recognise that there are ongoing problems and concerns. We want to work with other countries and to learn from practice elsewhere. We want to have the best possible response to the dreadful crime that was so well described by so many hon. Members today. The Government take the issue seriously and have wanted to be in a position to have a plan to move towards ratification. Clearly, I cannot give the right hon.

 I certainly will. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister said clearly&#151;I think that it was on the record&#151;that he is in favour of that.

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07032088000098">One thing that emerges from the history of the abolition of the slave trade and the abolition movement is that Parliament matters; it makes a difference. The passing of the 1807 Act on the abolition of the slave trade marked the beginning of the end for the transatlantic slave trade. It was not only parliamentarians, but enslaved Africans and ordinary citizens throughout the country, who brought about the change. However, the passing of the Act was not the end of slavery. Although the legalised trade in human beings has been abolished, it persists today in contemporary forms such as people trafficking.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the future of the Better Healthcare Closer to Home project. The purpose of the debate is to enlist the Minister&#146;s support in bringing to an end more than a decade of limbo in the national health service in my constituency of Sutton and Cheam and the wider south-west London area. That decade of limbo has compromised improvements in services and undermined investment in the local NHS estate. In particular, it has delayed the long-overdue replacement of St. Helier hospital, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake). That hospital was conceived in the 1920s and built in the 1930s, and it is not fit for the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07032092000004">How have we come to this particular pass, and why have we been stuck in limbo for so long? There are many aspects to the situation, but I want to trace events back to the publication some years ago by the Epsom and St. Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust of what it called a clinical services strategy. The strategy envisaged shaking up the way in which services were provided to safeguard accreditation by the royal colleges. It involved closing maternity services in Epsom hospital and moving them into St. Helier hospital, which became a particular focus of the plans and, especially, of public opposition to them. Suffice it to say, these plans received a lukewarm reception within the trust and a hostile reception from my constituents, which led to the review sinking without trace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07032092000005">After several years of reflection and the coming and going of three chief executives of the trust, new plans started to take shape. They were entitled Better Healthcare Closer to Home, and, in 2004, a consultation process started, which involved a succession of stakeholder events and pre-statutory consultation on a grand scale&#151;so grand, indeed, that many of the meetings took place at the Epsom grandstand itself. The proposals were groundbreaking. They envisaged a new model of care in which more health care would be delivered through primary care. The idea was to invest in primary care, establish a network of local care hospitals and build a new critical care hospital to replace the existing Epsom andSt. Helier hospitals. However, a lack of detail about the purpose of the local care hospitals, the services that were to be provided in them and their locations left the spotlight on the location of the critical care hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07032092000006">Throughout the process, other Members of Parliament and I questioned the affordability of the whole enterprise and whether it would be possible to make the sums stack up so that it would be possible deliver the vision of the Better Healthcare Closer to Home project. At the end of 2004, the majority of respondents to the consultation exercise backedSt. Helier as the site for the critical care hospital.At that stage&#151;after, rather than during, the consultation&#151;the possibility of the Sutton site in my constituency becoming the preferred site started to emerge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07032092000007">Over the Christmas period in 2004, a report was written by the project manager who had been leading the process. In January 2005, it went to the boards of Sutton and Merton primary care trust, East Elmbridge and Mid Surrey primary care trust and the Epsom and St. Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust. I cannot help but conclude that it went to those bodies so that they could rubber-stamp the decision, rather thanlisten clearly to the many voices and representations opposing the recommendations in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07032092000008">The Better Healthcare Closer to Home project was approved. It envisaged five local care hospitals, with a critical care hospital on the Sutton site. That decision was reached despite the report itself, which showed that the economics of the plan did not stack up, with more patients and income being lost by locating it at the Sutton site than would have been lost if it had been located at the St. Helier site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para21"><a name="07032092000009">There then followed a year of work, drawing up the detailed business case, including the commissioning of the Prince&#146;s foundation for the built environment to embark on a community engagement and planning project, costing in the region of &#163;60,000&#151;probably more&#151;to devise a plan for the Sutton site. It was an attempt to cajole the local community to buy into something that it did not wish to accept. At the same time as the local NHS was pressing ahead with the detailed business case, the Department of Health was considering what to do with the request from the London borough of Merton to call in the decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para22"><a name="07032092000010">Finally, in December 2005, the Secretary of State gave her answer to the question. She issued a direction to the local NHS to draw up plans for a critical care hospital to be located at St. Helier. &#147;Hallelujah&#148; was the cry at the time, but it was a very short-lived cry of good cheer, because another year went by and although the local NHS was initially suffering from shock from the Secretary of State&#146;s decision, it soon regrouped. After five months, it told the Secretary of State that, for planning and legal reasons, the St. Helier option could not be pursued.</p>

<p><a name="st_o209"><a name="07032092000011"><a name="70320-0019.htm_spnew3"><a name="07032092000052"><b>Siobhain McDonagh (Mitcham and Morden) (Lab):</b>
 I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for not having asked him earlier whether I could intervene. Is he also aware that through a freedom of information request, we discovered that the health service never accepted the Secretary of State&#146;s advice about St. Helier? Quite the contrary: right up until the decision was finally withdrawn by the Secretary of State, building surveyors and structural and engineers were being instructed to go ahead with the Sutton site&#151;the Secretary of State&#146;s suggestions were flagrantly ignored.</p>

<p><a name="st_o210"><a name="07032092000012"><a name="70320-0019.htm_spnew4"><a name="07032092000053"><b>Mr. Burstow:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Lady, who I know has also campaigned on this issue for a number of years. She is right to highlight the ignoble nature of the conduct of some local elements in respect of decisions about this issue and the attempt to thwart the wishes of local people and the Secretary of State&#146;s direction by pursuing a completely contrary course of action. The freedom of information request provides clear evidence of that. Frankly, the planning and legal obstacles put in the way of the people&#146;s wishes and the Secretary of State&#146;s direction were red herrings. They were a distraction from what should have been happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para23"><a name="07032092000013">By August 2005, NHS London entered the stage and the planning and financial issues came to the fore. Those were cited yet again as a reason for revisiting the whole matter. At that point, the Secretary of State agreed to withdraw her direction and hand the matter back to the local NHS for a review of the affordability of the whole plan. That review has now reported and it concluded that the Better Healthcare Closer to Home project was not affordable. Indeed, when set againstthe backdrop of payment by results, practice-based commissioning and the introduction of independent treatment centres, it is hard to see how the local health economy could ever have afforded those proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para24"><a name="07032092000014">The review now proposes a smaller number of local care hospitals, centred on existing NHS estate, and a local general hospital rather than a critical care hospital. Furthermore, the review is now to continue through to June to recommend the preferred location for the general hospital somewhere within the London borough of Sutton&#151;either at the Sutton or St. Helier site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para25"><a name="07032092000015">The review raises a number of questions, though not necessarily questions for the Minister to answer tonight. I wish to lodge those questions with him, but I am also posing them for the people who have conducted the review. For example, will the new plans be viable, given that Surrey primary care trust is no longer seen to be part and parcel of driving the changes forward and is not expected to commission services arising from the project? Indeed, will the income and activity generated from within Sutton and MertonPCT be enough to ensure the sustainability and deliverability of the proposals under the guidelines issued by the Department in respect of the use of the private finance initiative and capital funding?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para26"><a name="07032092000016">There are further questions. If the St. Helier site does emerge as the preferred site for a general hospital and a local care hospital is co-located there, what happens to the Sutton site and the range of services, including mental health services, currently provided there? Is there a spectre of that site being disposed, perhaps without regard to the longer-term needs of the community for community-based facilities, particularly health care facilities? Is the outlined coverage of local care hospitals right, given that the plans envisage moving from five to four such hospitals, leaving the south and west of the borough&#151;and particularly my constituency&#151;largely uncatered for?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para27"><a name="07032092000017">Finally, and most important, there is the future of accident and emergency services. The review envisages an A and E department that does not deal with major trauma, but it is far from clear where it will sit on the emergency care spectrum. Indeed, at present it is not clear what the emergency care spectrum looks like, so it is hard to enter into a meaningful debate about where A and E will sit on that spectrum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para28"><a name="07032092000018">Many of my constituents are alarmed at the prospect of St George&#146;s taking on the role of a major trauma centre. They draw attention to the congested road network, fearing delays as their loved ones are carried in ambulances past St Helier to St George&#146;s. The evidence will have to be compelling and the case persuasively made if my constituents are to be convinced of the need of a change of status for the accident and emergency department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para30"><a name="07032092000020">I said that my purpose in seeking the debate was to enlist the Minister&#146;s assistance. Given the Secretary of State&#146;s previous involvement, I hope that he will be prepared to do three things. First, I ask him to meet me, and other local Members of Parliament on both sides of the House, to explore further how we can ensure that the NHS is not left in limbo for another10 years, or indeed for another year or more. Secondly, I ask him to act expeditiously, and not to let a year go by between local decisions and the Secretary of State&#146;s intervention in or confirmation of such decisions. Finally, I ask him to recognise that there are lessons to be learned from this sorry saga about effective consultation, board-level accountability and decision making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para31"><a name="07032092000021">As I go around my constituency consulting people about the proposals, I often ask those who might be expected to have some knowledge of the workings of their local health service questions such as &#147;Who is the chief executive of your local trust? Who is the chair of your local trust board? Who are the members of your local trust board?&#148; No one knows. Who are these people who make decisions on our behalf, behind whom many hide and who are ultimately not accountable to us, the local people, for decisions that affect our lives?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para32"><a name="07032092000022">The fact that the review of Better Healthcare Closer to Home has concluded that the proposals for a critical care hospital are not sustainable&#151;and, I dare say, were never sustainable&#151;calls the whole process into question. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of pounds have been spent on consultation, consultants, stakeholder events, staff salaries, public meetings and citizens&#146; juries&#151;and for what? There should be an inquiry into just how much has been spent and how much time has been wasted on this enterprise to date. I ask the Minister to consider that request seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="70320-0019.htm_para33"><a name="07032092000023">I hope that after waiting for so long, my constituents and hard-working NHS staff will see light at the end of the tunnel, and that rather than its being a train coming down the track towards them, it will be a new hospital and better health care closer to home, which is what they all want.</p>

 I will begin with the last point made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow). I think that he described what everyone seeks to achieve: the best possible outcome for his constituents, and for those of my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh).

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para0"><a name="07032092000025">Some of the matters raised by the hon. Gentleman have a long history, to put it mildly. He referred to &#147;a decade of limbo&#148;, but I hope that that description is not entirely accurate, for I see signs of progress and development. I trust that the hon. Gentleman can at least vouch for us in the Department when people claim that we push decisions through without adequate consultation. There has certainly been plenty of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para1"><a name="07032092000026">As we can see, the issue of change in the health service gives rise to a huge amount of debate and a great deal of passion among communities across the country. At times, it can be difficult to accept change, and because of the difficulty of the arguments, the subject can provoke powerful reactions from key stakeholders and members of the public. In the face of uncertainty and anxiety in our communities, all of us Members of Parliament face a duty to grasp the difficult issues of health service change. We do our constituents a disservice if we do not tackle the issues head-on, particularly when doing so may lead to health progress and human progress in our constituencies. A different configuration of health services can lead to better health care and more lives being saved, so the issues are very difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para2"><a name="07032092000027">Of course, we must not jump to conclusions, and we must ensure that there is a thorough process, but I think that the hon. Gentleman would agree that there has been no jumping to conclusions in the case that he raised. Nevertheless, a process is under way. I will come on to the specifics that he raised in a moment, but first I want to put it on record that when we talk aboutthe reorganisation of health services, people jump to the conclusion that it is all about money. That is the characterisation, but it is important to point out that many of the changes that we consider making to our health service stem from a desire to improve the quality of care. We want to provide the best possible care, according to modern standards, within the resources available. Money is often a secondary consideration; an attempt to drive up quality often lies behind changes that are proposed, and there is often clinical consensus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para3"><a name="07032092000028">It is a fact that lifestyles, society, medicine, technology and the NHS itself have all changed over the past 60 years. Patients now have greater choice in where they are treated and when. They have better information on health services, expectations have risen and there is an increasing focus on safety and quality. The public tell us that they want appropriate services that are available at times and in places that are more convenient for them. As far as is possible, they look for services in their communities that are closer to their homes. That, of course, is a key driver behind the project that affects the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para4"><a name="07032092000029">Change is nothing new in the national health service. The NHS has always responded to change and the latest treatments by organising itself to deliver the care that is needed. It is up to us to respond to drivers for change; if we do not, services will not keep pace with changing times, we will not keep improving, and we will not make full use of the benefits of new medical technology and the possibilities that arise from delivering safer surgery closer to patients&#146; homes. Those benefits mean quicker recovery times and shorter stays in hospital. The Department&#146;s White Paper, &#147;Our health, our care, our say: Making it happen&#148;, reflected those changes, and suggested  <br>

moving towards a greater concentration of specialist services for people who need them, while providing more care closer to people&#146;s homes for treatments that simply no longer require a hospital visit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para5"><a name="07032092000030">To come to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns, the Better Healthcare Closer to Home project in his borough and elsewhere in the locality is an example of how the national health service is responding to changes locally. Health services around Sutton have been grappling with not only the need to modernise and improve, but the need to ensure that services are clinically safe and financially viable in future. Epsom and St. Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust faces the challenges normally associated with a split site, including issues to do with the supervision and training of doctors, sustaining viable clinical rotas and duplication of services. I accept that the hon. Gentleman acknowledged some of those issues this evening and, more broadly, in the work that he has done on the subject, as has my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden. He is right to say that the case has a history; let me rehearse some of the details for the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para6"><a name="07032092000031">The Better Healthcare Closer to Home project dates back to 2003, and involved proposals for local care hospitals supported by one new critical care hospital, which was to be at either Sutton or St. Helier. There was a comprehensive consultation over a three-month period that ended in November 2004. In January 2005, the trust boards then involved&#151;Epsom and St. Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, East Elmbridge and Mid Surrey PCT and Sutton and Merton PCT&#151;met separately and agreed to proceed with the proposed model of a network of local care hospitals supported by a single critical care hospital. They endorsed Sutton, as the hon. Gentleman said, as the preferred site for the development of the critical care hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07032092000032">However, in March 2005, Merton overview and scrutiny committee referred the decision to the Secretary of State for Health who, at the end of 2005, responded to the referral, as the hon. Gentleman said, concluding that the arguments over the siting of a critical care hospital were finely balanced. She decided that it was right to give priority to the needs of communities suffering social and economic disadvantage and to ensure that major redevelopments should contribute to the broader regeneration of disadvantaged areas. She therefore asked the national health service locally to develop plans for the new critical care hospital on land opposite St. Helier hospital. However, it became clear that, for planning reasons, it was not possible to develop the site and there were no viable options for development of the existing St. Helier hospital site either. My hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden has put her observation on the record, and has raised a pertinent issue for the further consultation.</p>

 In that further consultation, and given my request for proper examination of the original consultation, I hope that the freedom of information request submitted by the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) will be considered by the Minister, as there is a powerful and compelling reason to look critically at the decision making that took place. The issue has been grappled with for far too long, and action has not been forthcoming.</p>

 I apologise, Mr. Speaker. Any review should consider whether it is appropriate for a hospital trust to be the lead organisation in a consultation, because producer interest is a problem. It is far better that those consultations are undertaken by primary care trusts or regional strategic health authorities than by the hospitals themselves. If that had been done, it might have prevented the fudge at Sutton hospital.</p>

 Given the point that we have reached, it is extremely important that all the relevant information is in the public domain so that people can make a decision based on it. There is no possible argument against full transparency in the conduct of the debate. I accept the point made by my hon. Friend, but it is important not only that there is transparency but that there is a full, inclusive debate about what is the right decision for patients in her constituency and in the constituency of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. There should be no question of partial or vested interests dominating that debate, as the time has come for a full and open discussion before a decision is made locally.</p>

The Secretary of State withdrew her original decision in August 2006, following the planning concerns that had arisen, and wrote to the then chief executive of NHS London, informing him and asking him to review the proposals for a new critical care hospital. NHS London was asked to ensure that particular attention continued to be paid to the needs of disadvantaged communities, given the determination to tackle health inequalities. I am pleased that the review has been used as an opportunity to engage positively with local stakeholders and address their specific issues. I hope that that is the experience also of the two hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para11"><a name="07032092000042">The review concluded that there should be a general hospital in the borough of Sutton with an accident and emergency service, but that that should be different from the critical care hospital that was originally proposed. The review also concluded that since the original proposals were put forward there had been a number of significant developments, including those in clinical practice, which have an impact, and that the population to be served is significantly less than was thought in the original programme because of changes in the assumed numbers of patients from Surrey who would travel into London. Also, the acute capacity created by the originally proposed critical care hospital would be more than required now, because of reduced patient flows and more services provided in community settings. More work will be done to decide where the hospital should be situated and on the full range of services to be provided there. The hon. Gentleman asked a range of further questions, which he said needed to be answered as part of that work. Without providing him with a full answer this evening, I shall simply say that he is right that there should be clear answers to those important questions. That is properly part of the local debate on those issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07032092000043">The review also concluded that the provision of health services in Surrey, and particularly the range of services to be provided at Epsom hospital, should be determined by the Surrey primary care trust following the Fit for the Future public consultation that is scheduled to start later in the spring. Further work detailed in the review report now lies ahead and is scheduled to be complete by June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para13"><a name="07032092000044">The hon. Gentleman asked that the Department and the health service locally act expeditiously. That is the desire all round. It is not for us to dictate a timetableto the local NHS, but there should be a general recognition that it would be helpful to bring the considerations to an expeditious conclusion. The hon.  <br>

Gentleman&#146;s point is on the record and will be heard by those who need to hear it. He asked whether I would meet him and colleagues. I should point out that that is properly the responsibility of the London regional Minister in the Department, but I will take that request back. We want to ensure that the process moves ahead, but it must be a local process, not one run by the Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07032092000045">The hon. Gentleman asked me to comment on the lessons learned. As I said at the beginning, all health care reconfigurations raise difficult issues and we learn lessons from all of them. Sir Ian Carruthers has been conducting a review for the Department of the handling of reconfiguration processes in the health service. We can always raise our game and do better, and we will reflect on the lessons to be learned. The important thing is that the process leads to the right conclusions for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="70320-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07032092000046">It would be inappropriate for me to say anything further at this stage, other than to add that if there are emerging proposals that require public consultation, I would urge both hon. Members to engage in that debate. I pay tribute to them for the way that they have continued to press us for what they believe is rightfor their constituents. We all hope that the processwill deliver certainty soon to the residents of their constituencies&#151;</p>
