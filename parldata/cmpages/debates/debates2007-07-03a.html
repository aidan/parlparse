 I thank my hon. Friend for her kind remarks. She raises a very important point; it is one of several very serious humanitarian issues on the Gaza strip. I was hoping to be able to raise the matter with the Egyptian Foreign Minister, whom I was due to meet tomorrow. However, I will not be able to do so because he will be back in Egypt, but I will certainly take it up with him when I speak to him on the telephone, as I hope to do in the near future.</p>

 I accept what my right hon. Friend said about the importance of supporting the emergency Government, but will he also accept that it is important that we are not seen to be one-sided? If at all possible, we need to maintain some dialogue with Hamas, who were after all elected. If we are going to get a solution, it is necessary to try to redevelop a national consensus among Palestinians. Does he agree that we should do what we can to encourage that, rather than maintaining the divisions that currently exist?</p>

 The bedrock of the Government&#146;s approach over the next months and years will be threefold: first, to be unstinting in our support for a two-state solution in the middle east, which I think is the position that commands support on both sides of the House; secondly, to support those who are committed to peaceful progress in the region; and thirdly, to support the economic and social development across the occupied Palestinian territories, including the humanitarian work that my hon. Friend referred to.</p>

We did so with those members who were committed to peaceful progress and, as I say, that is an important bedrock for the sort of change that we need to see.</p>

discuss the issues at genuine length, but one has to be careful about drawing parallels. Where the Northern Ireland experience can be used, we should of course draw on it, but I would not want to be drawn into a simple export from one part of the world to another, both of which have deep and complex histories associated with them. Having discussed other issues with the hon. Gentleman, I think that he would agree that it is important that we remain part of an international process. The work that we are doing in the EU and with the Quartet is an important component of our work in the region.</p>

 I too congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on his appointment. Does he not agree that in the months before the recent terrible events in Gaza and the west bank, one of the brighter initiatives was the Mecca agreement between Fatah and Hamas? Would it not be a good idea for the Government to support every measure possible to get those two parties back round the table in Saudi Arabia to re-implement the Mecca agreement? This time there should be one difference: an international body should supervise the implementation of that agreement to make sure that the provisions are acted upon.</p>

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman makes an important point. First, it is important that there should be unity and a negotiating partner on the Palestinian side. The partner needs to be committed to the existence not just of the two-state solution, but of the other state that needs to be party to that: Israel. Secondly&#151;I hope that he will take this in the right way&#151;it is incumbent on me and the Government to be extremely careful about how we lecture others on the way in which they form coalitions and partnerships. The violence in Gaza, directed against President Abbas, has cost more than 100 lives. I choose my words carefully when I say that I very much hope that President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad will develop institutions capable of representing the aspirations of all Palestinian people. We need to support them in that.</p>

 One of the most important prospects for dialogue is the dialogue that could be undertaken by Tony Blair.

What can Her Majesty&#146;s Government do to get him over that hurdle and handicap?</p>

 From my experience of the former Prime Minister, he is more than capable of looking after himself. The reaction of leaders from across the region has been significant and positive. The mandate of the former Prime Minister is important and he will be able to develop it under his own steam. In the telephone calls that I have had over the last four days with regional leaders, they have welcomed his appointment and are looking forward to his active engagement in the arena as someone who has real knowledge of the issues that confront anyone who seeks peace for that part of the world.</p>

This November will mark 40 years since the passage of resolution 242, which marked the start of the UN engagement, which led, in 2002, to the commitment in Security Council resolution 1379, I think it was, to a two-state solution. As I said, the bedrock of our approach will be first to pursue that two-state solution, secondly, actively to support peacemakers in the region and those committed to peaceful political progress, and thirdly, to ensure that we have what the new Prime Minister has called an economic road map, as well as a political road map, for the future&#151;and that it includes the humanitarian issues that I referred to earlier.</p>

It is important to put it on record that in the last month there have been about 180 or 190 rockets launched into Israel from the Gaza strip. I am sure that he will understand when I say that the suffering of Palestinians on the one hand, and the fear and insecurity felt by many Israeli citizens on the other, need to be addressed together, and they can only be addressed through mutual recognition, which will be vital to long-term stability in the area.</p>

I think that it is right to say that one issue that unites people across the House is the determination to pursue a two-state solution, and that can only be pursued with people who are willing to recognise that the other state has a right to exist.

 The hon. Gentleman is right; this is a very serious situation and one which the United Nations has been trying to address.

He told me that he was pretty confident that there is not a large amount of smuggling coming over the Syrian border in that part of Lebanon, but he could not give those guarantees for the northern part of Lebanon. That is a very long and very porous border, as the hon. Gentleman says. We have been urging the Syrians, and everyone else, to turn the rhetoric about wanting stability in Lebanon and in the middle east into reality by doing their best to promote peace in that area and not to support rejectionist groups and Hezbollah, paid for by Iran, that are intent on causing destruction and mayhem.</p>

Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), and I hope that we will enjoy a similar relationship with her? Her predecessor wrote to me last month explaining that the Government were pursuing the question of non-British companies investing in Burma through the British Virgin Islands. Requests were made for that claim to be investigated by the local authorities there, so can she tell me what progress has been made?</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments and congratulate him on his work on the all-party group on Burma; that group is widely appreciated throughout the House.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, my first, most important and most solemn duty is to pay tribute to the five members of our armed forces who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past week. Corporal Paul Joszko of the 2nd Battalion the Royal Welsh, Private Scott Kennedy of The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, and my constituent Private Jamie Kerr, also of The Black Watch, were all killed on patrol last Wednesday in Basra. Captain Sean Dolan of the 1st Battalion the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters and Sergeant David Wilkinson of 19 Regiment Royal Artillery were killed at the weekend in Afghanistan. They served their country bravely, and the whole House will join me in sending our sincere condolences to their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70703-0003.htm_para3"><a name="07070334000155">May I also pay tribute, Mr. Speaker, to the professionalism of our police, emergency services and security services over recent days, and applaud the heroism and vigilance of ordinary members of the British public? We owe them all a great debt of gratitude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70703-0003.htm_para4"><a name="07070334000156">All Members of this House and all the people of this country have a shared interest in building trust in our democracy, and it is my hope that, by working together for change in a spirit that takes us beyond parties and beyond partisanship, we can agree a new British constitutional settlement that entrusts more power to Parliament and the British people. Change with a new settlement is in my view essential to our country&#146;s future. For we will meet the new challenges of security, of economic change and of communities under pressure&#151;and forge a stronger shared national purpose&#151;only by building a new relationship between citizens and Government that ensures that Government are a better servant of the people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="70703-0003.htm_para5"><a name="07070334000157">Let me pay tribute to the contribution to our thinking&#151;and to the wider constitutional debate&#151;that has already been made by parliamentarians in all parts of the House. Because I want this process to be one in which we consult and involve not only all political parties but the people of this country, what I propose today is not, and should be seen not as, the final blueprint for a constitutional settlement, but a route map towards it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07070334000158">The route map seeks to address two fundamental issues: to hold power more accountable and to uphold and enhance the rights and responsibilities of the citizen. While constitutional change will not be the work of just one Bill or one year or one Parliament, I can today make an immediate start by proposing changes that will transfer power from the Prime Minister and the Executive. For centuries, they have exercised authority in the name of the monarchy without the people and their elected representatives being consulted, so I now propose that in 12 important areas of our national life the Prime Minister and the Executive should surrender or limit their powers, the exclusive exercise of which by the Government of the day should have no place in a modern democracy. These are: the power of the Executive to declare war; the power to request the dissolution of Parliament; the  <br>

power over recall of Parliament; the power of the Executive to ratify international treaties without decision by Parliament; the power to make key public appointments without effective scrutiny; the power to restrict parliamentary oversight of our intelligence services; power to choose bishops; power in the appointment of judges; power to direct prosecutors in individual criminal cases; power over the civil service itself; and the Executive powers to determine the rules governing entitlement to passports and the granting of pardons. I now propose to surrender or limit these powers to make for a more open 21st-century British democracy which better serves the British people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07070334000159">Let me set out the measures, the details of which are included in a Green Paper published today by the Secretary of State for Justice. While constitutional change should never limit our ability to deal with emergencies and should never jeopardise the security of our forces or any necessary operational decisions, the Government will now consult on a resolution to guarantee that on the grave issue of peace and war it is ultimately this House of Commons that will make the decision. I propose, in addition, to put on to a statutory footing Parliament&#146;s right to ratify new international treaties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07070334000160">We will also consult on proposals that this House of Commons would have to approve a resolution for any dissolution of Parliament requested by the Prime Minister and that, while at present members of Parliament cannot decide whether the House should be recalled, for the first time a majority of Members&#151;and not just the Prime Minister&#151;should have that right, subject to your authority, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07070334000161">The House of Commons should also have a bigger role in the selection of key public officials. I propose, as a first step, pre-appointment hearings for public officials whose role it is to protect the public&#146;s rights and interests, and for whom there is not currently independent scrutiny. That includes the chief inspector of prisons, the local government ombudsman, the civil service commissioner and the commissioner for public appointments. For public offices where appointments are acknowledged to be market-sensitive, the Chancellor is setting out today how pre-commencement hearings will apply to new members of the Monetary Policy Committee, including the Governor of the Bank of England, and the chairman of the Financial Services Authority. I also propose that we extend pre-commencement hearings in this House to utility regulators and other regulators. I propose that we review too the arrangements for making appointments to NHS boards, and it is right that this House of Commons vote on the appointment of the chair of the new independent Statistics Board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07070334000162">I can announce also that from now on the Government will regularly publish, for parliamentary debate and public scrutiny, our national security strategy. It will set out for the British people the threats we face and the objectives we pursue. I have said for some time that the long-term and continuing security obligations on us require us to co-ordinate military, policing, intelligence and diplomatic action&#151;and also to win hearts and minds in this country and around the world. So following discussions over the last few months, I have decided to establish within Government a national security council, charged with bringing  <br>

together our overseas defence and security, but also our development and community relations efforts, to send out a clear message that at all times we will be vigilant and we will never yield in addressing the terrorist threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07070334000163">As the security agencies themselves recognise, greater accountability to Parliament can strengthen still further public support for the work that they do. So while ensuring necessary safeguards that respect confidentiality and security, we will now consult on whether and how the Intelligence and Security Committee can be appointed by, and report to, Parliament. And we will start now with hearings, held in public wherever possible; a strengthened capacity for investigations; reports subject to more parliamentary debate; and greater transparency over appointments to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07070334000164">The Church of England is, and should remain, the established Church in England. Establishment does not, however, justify the Prime Minister influencing senior Church appointments, including bishops. And I also propose that the Government should consider relinquishing their residual role in the appointment of judges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07070334000165">The role of Attorney-General, which combines legal and ministerial functions, needs to change. While we consult on reform, the Attorney-General has herself decided, except if the law or national security requires it, not to make key prosecution decisions in individual criminal cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07070334000166">To reinforce the neutrality of the civil service, the core principles governing it will no longer be set at the discretion of the Executive but will be legislated by Parliament&#151;and so this Government have finally responded to the central recommendation of the Northcote-Trevelyan report on the civil service made more than 150 years ago in 1854. The frameworks for granting pardons and for issuing and withdrawing passports should also be set not by Government but by Parliament. And I propose that we reduce the advance sight that Government Departments have of the release of statistical information from as much as five days currently to just 24 hours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07070334000167">Even as we now reduce the power of the Executive, we will also increase their accountability. Following the decision to revoke the provisions that previously allowed special advisers to give orders to civil servants, I am also publishing a new ministerial code today that provides for a new independent adviser to supervise disclosure and whom I can ask to scrutinise ministerial conduct, including conflicts of interest. I propose that we reinforce the accountability of the Executive to Parliament and to the public with a statement in the summer, prior to the Queen&#146;s Speech, on the provisional forward legislative programme, and this will start this month. Annual departmental reports will be debated in this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07070334000168">But just as the Executive must become more accountable to Parliament, Parliament itself must become more accountable.

reform. A statement on the reform of local government will propose a new concordat between local and central Government. We will fulfil our manifesto obligation to publish our review of the experience of the various voting systems introduced since 1998, and the House will have a full opportunity to discuss in detail, and to vote here in this House on, the legislation that flows from the European Union amending treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07070334000169">Just as we have appointed Ministers for each region of England, I propose that, to increase the accountability of local and regional decision making, the House now consider creating Committees to review the economies and public services of each region, and we will propose a regular Question Time for regional Ministers. But while we will listen to all proposals to improve our constitution in the light of devolution, we do not accept the proposal for English votes for English laws, which would create two classes of Members of Parliament&#151;some entitled to vote on all issues, some invited to vote on only some. We will do nothing to put at risk the Union. I am reminded&#151;[<i> Interruption.</i>]</p>

 I am reminded of the statement in 1999 by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), the shadow Home Secretary, who said that English votes for English laws would cause constitutional chaos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07070334000172">The right of all the British people to have their voice heard is fundamental to our democracy and to holding public institutions to account. Britain is rightly proud to be the pioneer of the modern liberties of the individual. I think it right to make it a general rule that in these areas there is independent oversight of authorities and accountability to Parliament. I encourage the House to agree a new process for ensuring consideration of petitions from members of the public. Disengagement is too often reflected in low turnout in elections. Britain is unusual in holding elections on weekdays, when people are at work, and the Secretary of State for Justice will announce a consultation on whether there is a case for voting at weekends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07070334000173">The Government will also bring forward proposals to extend the period of time during which parties can use all-women short lists for candidate selections, and to give more time for all parties in this House to take up this new right, if they choose. While balancing the need for public order with the right to public dissent, I think it right&#151;in consultation with the Metropolitan police, Parliament, the Mayor of London, Westminster city council and liberties groups&#151;to change the laws that now restrict the right to demonstrate in Parliament square.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07070334000174">The measures that I have just announced represent in my view an important step forward in changing the way we are governed, but it is possible to do more to bring Government closer to the people.</p>

power directly to the people, and I propose that we start the debate and consult on empowering citizens and communities in four areas. The first is powers of initiative, extending the right of the British people to intervene with their elected local representatives to ensure action, through a new community right to call for action and new duties on public bodies to involve local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07070334000176">The second is new rights for the British people to be consulted through mechanisms such as &#147;citizens juries&#148; on major decisions affecting their lives. The third is powers of redress, and new rights for the British people to scrutinise and improve the local delivery of services. The fourth is powers to ballot on spending decisions in areas such as neighbourhood budgets and youth budgets, with decisions on finance made by local people themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07070334000177">At the same time, we must give new life to the very idea of citizenship. All in this House would acknowledge that there are very specific challenges we must meet on engaging young people and improving citizenship education. I hope that there will be all-party support for a commission to review this and make recommendations. Although the voting age has been 18 since 1969, it is right, as part of that debate, to examine, and hear from young people themselves, whether lowering that age would increase participation. Consultation will take place with you, Mr. Speaker, and through the Leader of the House, with this House as to whether the Youth Parliament should be invited here in this Chamber once a year, on a non-sitting day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07070334000178">What constitutes citizens&#146; rights, beyond voting, and citizens&#146; responsibilities, such as jury service, should itself be a matter for public deliberation. As we focus on the challenges that we face and what unites and integrates our country, our starting point should be to discuss together and then, as other countries do, agree and set down the values, founded in liberty, which define our citizenship and help to define our country. And there is a case that we should go further still than this statement of values to codify either in concordats or in a single document both the duties and rights of citizens and the balance of power between Government, Parliament and the people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07070334000179">In Britain we have a largely unwritten constitution. To change that would represent a fundamental and historic shift in our constitutional arrangements. So it is right to involve the public in a sustained debate about whether there is a case for the United Kingdom developing a full British Bill of Rights and duties, or for moving towards a written constitution. Because such fundamental change should happen only when there is a settled consensus on whether to proceed, I have asked my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice to lead a dialogue within Parliament and with people across the United Kingdom by holding a series of hearings, starting in the autumn, in all regions and nations of the country, and we will consult with all the other parties on this process.</p>

democracy and a stronger sense of shared national purpose. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o99"><a name="07070334000181"><a name="70703-0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="07070334000394"><b>Mr. David Cameron (Witney) (Con):</b>
 I join the Prime Minister in paying tribute to Corporal Paul Joszko, Private Scott Kennedy, and Private James Kerr, all of whom died in Basra, and to Captain Sean Dolan and Sergeant Dave Wilkinson, who were killed in Afghanistan. They died serving their country. I join the Prime Minister, too, in his praise for the work of the police, the emergency services and the security services and also in thanking the public both for their bravery and for their vigilance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07070334000182">I thank the Prime Minister for his statement today. Let me begin by congratulating him on becoming Prime Minister. He has achieved his long-held ambition, and I hope that there will be opportunities for us to work together, not least on the issue of terrorism and the safety of our people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para22"><a name="07070334000183">The British system of government and politics needs real and lasting change. The country is too centralised, Parliament is too weak, Ministers do not give straight answers and people feel shut out of decision making. That is why we need change. We welcome much of what is in the statement: the national security council was in our policy review; confirmation hearings&#151;one of our proposals; and neighbourhood budgets are in the Sustainable Communities Bill being taken through the House by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd). But we have to ask this of the Prime Minister: he says he wants to decentralise Government, but is he not the one who has imposed 3,000 central targets on our public services and local government? He says he wants to strengthen Parliament, but how can we forget the 10 years that he has spent on new ways of trying to avoid Parliament, with his stealth tax changes not even mentioned in his Budget? He says he wants all his Ministers to give straight answers, but when he was Chancellor he did not answer a single question about the tax credit system for which he was responsible for more than two and a half years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07070334000184">The Prime Minister says he wants to restore trust in politics, but surely he has to recognise that he has been at the heart of the Government who have done more than any other Government in living memory to destroy trust in politics. He says he wants to get to the truth. In that case, I have to ask him why he opposes holding an inquiry into Iraq where, above all, we must get to the truth. That is why, when it comes to restoring trust in politics, we simply do not see that the Prime Minister can be the change this country needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para24"><a name="07070334000185">Let us look at the detail. There are three key relationships: between Government and Parliament, between different parts of the United Kingdom, and between politics and the people. On Parliament, in May last year I said that Parliament should vote on peace and war and on international treaties, so I am glad the Prime Minister will be introducing that; it has our full support. In June this year, I called for real power for Select Committees. The Prime Minister said a lot about the Intelligence and Security Committee, but there was little in the statement about other Select Committees. Will they be getting more power? Three years ago, we sponsored a Civil Service Bill. Can the Prime Minister confirm that what he was talking about in his statement is a full civil service Act?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para25"><a name="07070334000186">Does the Prime Minister agree that in changing the relationship between Government and Parliament, we should go further? Is it not time to give the House of Commons the right to determine its own timetable? Is not that the absolute key to restoring power in Parliament?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para26"><a name="07070334000187">I listened carefully to what the Prime Minister said about electoral reform. I have to say this: as a Prime Minister who was not elected by the British people, he must understand that any attempt to alter the electoral system without the consent of the people will be seen for what it is&#151;an attempt to change the rules to suit one party&#146;s interests and to cling to power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para27"><a name="07070334000188">As the Prime Minister did, let us turn to the relationship between different parts of the United Kingdom. Today, the situation is that neither he, nor I, nor any Member of the House has the right to vote on hospitals, schools or housing in his constituency or in other parts of Scotland, yet he is able to vote on hospitals, schools and housing in my constituency. We already have two classes of MP. Is it not the case that the only effective way to solve that problem is to give MPs in English constituencies the decisive say in the House on issues that affect only England? The Prime Minister has had 30 years to come up with answers to the West Lothian question, and I have to tell him that Question Time for regional Ministers just does not cut it. Does he not see that the failure to answer that question is actually putting the Union at risk?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para28"><a name="07070334000189">Now let us look at the third and most important relationship&#151;that between politics and people. Part of the Prime Minister&#146;s answer will clearly be the Bill of Rights and duties, but surely at this most serious of times we need greater clarity about the Human Rights Act 1998. Is it not the case that it is now almost impossible to deport foreign nationals who may do this country harm? That is why we believe a proper British Bill of Rights should mean replacing the Human Rights Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para29"><a name="07070334000190">On the subject of things that have sapped trust in politics, why have the Prime Minister&#146;s Government systematically taken more power from local councils and given it to unelected regional assemblies? The only people who were asked their views about that&#151;people in the north-east&#151;gave a resounding no, so why does he not recognise today that regional assemblies are costly, unnecessary and unwanted and should be scrapped?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="70703-0004.htm_para30"><a name="07070334000191">Above all, how can the Prime Minister possibly restore trust in politics if he will not give the people the final say on one of the biggest constitutional questions of all&#151;whether to sign up to what is in effect the European constitution? He talks about citizens juries. Why not have a jury of all our citizens and ask them to give their verdict on that issue?</p>

Does he accept that real power for Parliament means the House of Commons&#151;not the Government of the day&#151;determining its own agenda?

 As far as the European referendum is concerned&#151;and we have discussed it in the last few days&#151;there is no other country but Ireland that is putting forward a proposal to have a referendum. The last Conservative Government did not have a referendum on Maastricht; they never had a referendum on previous treaties. I believe that the Conservative leader is making a grave mistake if he believes that this constitutional debate about the future of the country and the relationships between legislature, Executive and judiciary should be overshadowed simply by a debate on an issue that we will investigate in detail in the House of Commons when the legislation comes before the House in the next few months.</p>

If the Conservative party wishes to continue to push that, it has to take into account the fact that the Executive would owe their authority to two different groups of people: on one occasion, to all Members of the House and on another occasion, simply to some Members of the House. That is why the shadow Home Secretary said in 1999 that it would cause constitutional chaos and why the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) said only a few weeks ago:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="70703-0005.htm_para11"><a name="07070334000208">This is indeed a comprehensive statement and it is therefore not possible to deal with it all in detail in the time available, but we will give a considered response to the Green Paper. My starting point is that reform of our constitution is long overdue and that the United Kingdom deserves a constitution that is fit for the challenges and standards of contemporary Britain. If we are to restore public confidence in our political system, we must be both innovative and inclusive. I therefore welcome the proposals with regard to the prerogative powers and the principle that they should rest with Parliament. However, the Prime Minister used the words &#147;surrender or limit&#148; when describing what he proposed to do, and there is obviously an issue about what is to be surrendered and what is to be limited, and in what way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="70703-0005.htm_para12"><a name="07070334000209">I support the Prime Minister&#146;s determination that Parliament should have the final word in issues of peace and war, but I notice that he observed that that should be done by way of resolution. Will he consider whether that should be put on a proper statutory footing? I also support the intention to establish a national security council, but from where will members of that council be drawn? Will they simply be drawn from the Ministries or will there be opportunities for Members of Parliament to serve on the council? I also believe&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

 I also believe that we should all welcome the Prime Minister&#146;s intention to make the intelligence and security oversight much more transparent. As for Parliament square, it has been a source of great discomfort to many Members, on both sides of the House, that there has been such a limitation on legitimate protest so close to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="70703-0005.htm_para13"><a name="07070334000212">The Prime Minister did not mention in detail a strengthened Committee system. Does he have any proposals to strengthen the powers of Select Committees? He did not mention electoral reform&#151;other than in the context of fulfilling a previous manifesto commitment. Does he understand that, for many people, the reform of the constitution in essence requires electoral reform? There should be fixed terms of Parliament. The best way in which to deal with those matters is through a written constitution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70703-0005.htm_para14"><a name="07070334000213">On the issue of English votes for English laws, does the Prime Minister accept that once devolution is properly established in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, it will be impossible to ignore the role of Members of Parliament from those three nations here in Westminster? That is an issue that simply cannot be dismissed. Finally, will the Prime Minister accept that if the public are to be properly engaged in the matters that he has outlined so comprehensively today, a constitutional convention would be the best and most effective way of ensuring it?</p>

The third is the reform of the right to demonstrate outside Westminster&#151;I understand that he is prepared to support a change in the way that we carry that out. Fourthly, I believe that he supports all the measures that we are bringing forward that will change the royal prerogative.

Of course I am open to discussing the implications of devolution for our constitution, but I think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman would agree that English votes for English laws would mean that we would no longer have one United Kingdom. As for the constitutional convention that he proposes, let me tell him that a constitutional convention of the great and the good is not as good as hearings that will be held in all parts of the country, that will involve people in different communities of the country, and that will be led by the Secretary of State for Justice after consultation with the other parties.

It is the second function to which we can now turn our attention. If we have a national security strategy, and if there is a debate on that both in Parliament and in the country, and if there is a power to call witnesses and to report on that, I believe that that second important job of a Select Committee, which is to inform the country of the good work that our services are doing, can be best achieved.

 I warmly congratulate the Prime Minister on his splendid statement that will reverse that damaging tendency of at least 50 years of concentrating more and more power in the hands of the Executive and the Prime Minister. I particularly welcome, on behalf of the 1,300 people who work in the Office for National Statistics in Newport, the news that the chairperson of the board, whoever he or she may be, will be elected by Parliament. That comes after the decision last night to accept the Lords amendments to the Statistics and Registration Service Bill, which will do a great deal to strengthen the validity of national statistics.</p>

I hope that there will be common ground, despite some of the earlier comments on future constitutional changes. In particular, I agree with him about the royal prerogative.

Colleagues may think that those cases have inspired me to bring forward this measure at this moment, but that is not the case. In the context of some of these high-profile cases, it is true that judges have expressed the view that the present law is very unsatisfactory and unfortunately sends a signal to the public that one way of becoming supremely rich in one&#146;s own right is to marry someone who is very rich, stay with him or her for a few years and then walk off with half the proceeds.

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="70703-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07070344000019">Let me make one final point. I said that the most important anomaly that I was addressing with this Bill was a legal anomaly. I believe that to be the case, but the measure also resolves a curious geographical anomaly. In other major common law jurisdictions such as the United States and Australia, the option to sign pre-nuptial contracts exists and they are indeed enforced in law. That is also the case in a number of European Union countries where Roman law applies. One might think that the need for a pre-nuptial agreement would not be so great in such countries, because the relevant principle of Roman law states that, if a marriage is dissolved, the assets belonging to each party when the marriage was contracted are reserved to that party. Any dispute over distribution applies only to assets and liabilities that were accumulated during the course of the marriage. That principle applies in Scotland, which also has a legal system based on Roman law. Although the need for this measure might be less great in some other EU countries, the option nevertheless exists for their citizens to use it. It does not exist in England or, indeed, in Scotland.</p>

 I quite understand why someone who had been in a relationship for 20 years&#151;a marriage that had ended suddenly in acrimony and bitterness&#151;might want legal reassurances before entering a new marriage. They might wish to be reassured that whatever assets they were taking with them would not be abused by the new party.

I look forward to our exchanges across the House, and I look forward even more to having the opportunity to work together to improve the legislative, regulatory and political framework in which the NHS seeks to deliver services to patients. Despite her travails in her post, it was always the Secretary of State&#146;s predecessor&#146;s great privilege, and often pleasure, to meet NHS staff, as it is my great privilege and pleasure to do so. If ever one becomes tired or distressed by what happens here at Westminster, one need only visit doctors, nurses and other health care professionals around the country to be astonished at, as well as immensely respectful of, what they achieve and the way in which they go about their tasks.</p>

All those proposals are included in our document, which I will leave on the Table for the Secretary of State to enjoy.

The House and the public will be shocked that members of a profession dedicated to saving lives should, it is at least suspected, conspire to take lives in an indiscriminate act of terror. I hope that the House shares my view that we should not let the action of a tiny, extremist minority ever prejudice our positive view of the way in which thousands of Muslim and overseas doctors form an integral part of health care in this country. NHS employers are responsible for ensuring that doctors meet the requirements for clinical practice and, for example, in language proficiency. Checks on those entering the United Kingdom include visa and criminal record checks, for which the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office are responsible. It is important to note&#151;I am sure that the Secretary of State has already done so&#151;that the code of practice for the recruitment of health care professionals from developing countries includes Iran, Iraq and Jordan, which are countries from which the UK has agreed not actively to recruit. I am sure that the House will understand if, when he responds to our debate, the Secretary of State will explain how that code of practice and the highly skilled migrants programme have been applied, and what checks are undertaken on medics who come here.</p>

 As my hon. Friend knows, reconfigurations are taking place throughout the country, especially in south-east England. Will he consider asking the Secretary of State if it is possible to call a halt to them for the moment as they are an attempt to impose one-size-fits-all structures on local health services? The Princess Royal hospital in Haywards Heath is 15 miles south of one the biggest airports in the world, five miles from a major motorway and located in a changing area where thousands of new houses will be built. It is to have its accident and emergency and maternity services taken away from it and transferred to an impossible place to get to in Brighton. Does my hon.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, and I entirely agree with his point. The new Prime Minister has stated that he must listen to what the public and NHS professionals are saying throughout the country, but he cannot do that in circumstances where&#151;as is happening in many places&#151;top-down reconfiguration of services is being forced upon local health care economies. I was recently in Hastings in my hon. Friend&#146;s part of the country. The ways in which the reconfigurations are to be applied raise serious questions both of the evidential basis for them and of access considerations in respect of the services that will result. I will say more about that.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman believes that reconfiguration should be halted and the medical profession should be listened to. However, what he recommends is the opposite of what is being said by Professor Roger Boyle, national director of Heart Disease and Stroke? He said that reorganising services could lead to 500 fewer deaths, 1,000 fewer heart attacks and 250,000 fewer serious complications such as stroke. Does the hon.

 We have always argued that it is necessary to develop services; I am unsure whether the hon. Lady attended our debate on acute services reconfiguration. She is confusing the necessity for service development with the question of whether local access to services should consequently be abandoned. I have had discussions with Roger Boyle. I entirely agree with, and have argued for, propositions such as that patients suffering from a stroke should be admitted directly to a specialist stroke unit where they can access early scanning for possible thrombolysis and early stroke care. That would address a large proportion of the figures that Roger Boyle&#146;s cites. There is also the issue of access to primary angioplasty; a smaller number of specialist units will be required in order to provide access to such services. However, for such  <br>

We do not know to what extent, because the Department of Health has failed to publish the patient access survey that it commissioned at great expense. But we do know that the introduction of the out-of-hours contract was a shambles, according to the Public Accounts Committee.

 We have made it clear throughout that we agree that services must be developed, but that must be done in response to the changing needs of patients and the development of technology. Where community hospitals are concerned, it is not only the Conservatives who argue that they are an integral part of the delivery of care closer to the patient: the Government said so in the White Paper published in January 2006. That White Paper presented the rhetoric of support for community hospitals and that is why the Government ostensibly provided for a new capital fund to allow community hospitals to be developed. But too much of that money has been siphoned off to primary care centres and too little is being delivered. At the same time as the fund was being established, too many community hospitals did not have the revenue to enable them to continue to work. So community hospitals are being shut down in Cornwall, Devon, Wiltshire, near Bristol, Norfolk and Kent, and the list goes on. There are probably a hundred more that are still under threat because the Government have not delivered on the promises made in the White Paper at the beginning of last year that services would continue to be commissioned&#151;including diagnostic services close to patients, out-patient clinics and, most importantly in some respects, access to in-patient services that allow step-up and step-down services to be provided.</p>

First, we must make sure that those who are in college training to be therapists find posts and are employed in the community. Secondly, I do not think that we are going to join up the services terribly effectively, given the present arrangements at the centre. It is not the job of those at the centre to join up services: instead, we should take budgets closer to the patient, allow GPs and PCTs to have access to those budgets, and make clear their responsibilities for commissioning services for young people with speech and language needs. That will mean that parents in particular will have someone to talk to, through whom they can access services. It should be as simple as that.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the test of service reconfiguration is safety? Sir Ian Kennedy is the chairman of the Healthcare Commission, and he said the other day that people should keep an eye on safety considerations. Against that background, can my hon. Friend understand why my constituents in Banbury feel so desperate? They have had a consultant-led obstetrics and maternity unit for a long time, but it is to be taken away from them. The nearest consultant-led unit will be an hour away in Oxford, a distance of 26 miles. My constituents understandably feel that that will downgrade rather than enhance safety and access to NHS services.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that very important point. We have argued in this House many times that both safety and access need to be considered when one is talking about maternity services. Safety is an essential element of quality of care, and choice and access are highly desirable elements, but the evidence base of safety is absent from service reconfigurations such as the one affecting his constituency. We are happy to see that the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), still has his Front-Bench place. He is the Minister responsible for maternity services, and we have asked him many questions about how great should be the distance that people must travel between, say, a birth centre or a midwife-led unit and a unit providing consultant-led obstetric care. He does not know the answer and has provided no guidance, but at the same time the Department of Health is driving ahead with service reconfigurations across the country. Ostensibly, those reconfigurations are about safety, but no evidence is produced to support that. I do not see how one can have safety without evidence.</p>

 Most of the reconfigurations of obstetrics and gynaecology services are going ahead not because the NHS wants fewer women to give birth in fewer hospitals, but because the royal colleges have said that consultants need a certain amount of labour-ward cover and experience of births to continue their professional development. If the hon. Gentleman were a woman in labour who had had to wait 12 hours for an epidural anaesthetic, he would know that being in a local hospital is no comfort if that means that she has to compete with people brought in from the trauma department. It is much better for a woman to give birth in a hospital with a dedicated obstetric anaesthetist, but not all hospitals across the country have one.</p>

 The hon. Lady should have attended our debate on maternity services, when we made it very clear that of course we must have proper risk assessment, and that mothers giving birth in places of relatively greater risk must have access to proper obstetric care. I am aware that, around the country, managers are representing the case for service reconfiguration by saying that, as a minimum, there should be 40 hours of consultant cover on labour wards. They make direct reference to what the Healthcare Commission said happened with the 10 tragic maternal deaths at Northwick Park and, in general, they say that there must be 2,500 live births at each hospital. One then asks how many live births there were at Northwick Park at the time, and the answer is 5,000. Another maternity unit had recently closed and a substantial amount of responsibility and additional births had been transferred to Northwick Park, and the transfer was not well organised. In fact, it was tragically badly organised. So there are issues to consider that are different and separate from the mechanistic approach of insisting on 40 hours of consultant cover on labour wards. We have to deal with the evidence, not just with simple management assertions that are driven as much by the European working time directive and financial pressures as by genuine evidence of clinical safety.</p>

 Two years ago, during the general election campaign, my hon. Friend came to Hornsea and visited people there to join the campaign to save the hospital.

Friend was barracked by a Labour councillor at the event that we held. Since that time, the primary care trust has formally made the decision to shut every single bed at Hornsea cottage hospital and to betray local people.

among the things that he needs to do. He needs to start by working with primary care and especially family doctors. GP- bashing, which seems to have been the preoccupation of Ministers, has to stop&#151;it is no good going down that path. Hamish Meldrum, the new chairman of the British Medical Association, has said: </p>
<a name="70703-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="07070344000198"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are experiencing an unprecedented volume of misinformation, half-truths and politically- inspired doctor-bashing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="70703-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07070344000064">That does not mean that one should just let GPs do as they like, but we know that GPs will respond if they have the right framework and incentives. The clearly required principal incentive, which has not been present in the new contract, is empowerment, professional autonomy and the ability to take decisions as senior public service and clinical professionals about real budgets, real commissioning and real opportunities to shape services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="70703-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07070344000065">Today, the NHS is not a primary care-led service but a centrally controlled service. The top-down initiatives are not working. Measures such as the 48-hour access target have been counter-productive, driving patients and practices into an absurd 8.30 am telephone scramble. Choose and book has been hopelessly mishandled and has compromised the freedom to refer that GPs always had.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="70703-0008.htm_para4"><a name="07070344000066">Out-of-hours services under the new contract have de-emphasised the role of general practitioners. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford will recall that we had to fight that one too, because GPs simply did not form part of the out-of-hours service in south Lincolnshire, and we had to persuade Ministers to involve them. I know that I have mentioned the hon. Gentleman, but I will not give way: we are just agreed about that issue, and we will settle it on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70703-0008.htm_para5"><a name="07070344000067">Things can be changed. Let us take practice-based commissioning. Ministers, after a decade, have finally realised that the fundamentals of fundholding need to be brought back. GPs can take control of the commissioning of services, and that should include the commissioning of out-of-hours services. They can integrate those services more effectively with their own services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="70703-0008.htm_para6"><a name="07070344000068">The Department has also failed to publish an urgent care strategy, despite the fact that, at the beginning of last year, the White Paper stated that one of the jobs for 2006 was to produce such a strategy. I do not know whether the Department has admitted it to the Secretary of State, but it should have been done last year and it has not been done yet, and we are in July. We need an urgent care strategy which says to patients, &#147;It is very straightforward how you access urgent care. If it is an emergency, you ring 999.&#148; Some of our concerns about accident and emergency services would be met by such a strategy. We understand, however, that if someone is in an ambulance with a paramedic, they may not necessarily go to the local A and E, but instead go to a specialist centre for trauma, stroke and heart attack. Apart from that, however, we need a much more integrated urgent care structure. If it is not a 999 call and an emergency, the call should be made to 0845 4647, which would offer access not just to NHS Direct but to the necessary core handling and triage that determines whether an emergency response by an ambulance, a doctor response through the out-of-hours service, or a nurse or emergency care practitioner  <br>

 I share my right hon. Friend&#146;s concerns. Furthermore, he represents a part of the country that secures the lowest per capita distribution of resources. The Select Committee on Health made it clear, as we had argued, that there should be a review of the resource allocation formula to make it fairer in distributing resources relative to the burden of disease. It is interesting that the Secretary of State&#146;s predecessor handed him one admission of our arguments. Only the week before last, the right hon. Lady said that the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation should be given Bank of England-style independence. She acknowledged that we were right and that it had been the subject of political interference. In a letter to me on her last day in office, she also accepted our argument that the principal cause of variation in health-related need in the burden of disease is age, so as an urgent measure I look forward to an independent review of resource allocation to deliver a fairer distribution across the country.</p>

We need care closer to home to mean exactly that, and not have services taken away that people have relied upon for a great deal of time. We need to know whether the Prime Minister has any substance to add to what he said in passing at the outset of his leadership campaign, or does he, as it turns out, have hidden shallows to him? Where in the Government amendment is the recognition that they must do better? If that is what the new Prime Minister said in his leadership campaign, why is it not reflected in the Government&#146;s self-congratulatory amendment?</p>

Some 4 per cent. said that morale was good and 30 per cent. said that it was moderate. However, 41 per cent. said that it was poor and 25 per cent. that it was very poor. That is nearly two thirds.</p>

Even in his own Department, morale is low. Direction and leadership are badly needed, and we must have greater autonomy for health care professionals to re-empower and motivate them. We must have accountability to patients exercising choice and a public voice on these issues. We need evidence for the policies that are being pursued rather than simply a slash-and-burn pursuit of the Government&#146;s fiscal targets, which are delivering inequitable access to care in too many parts of the country. Not least, we need strong commissioning decisions taken closer to the patients and stronger primary care-led commissioning in urgent care.</p>

Will the Secretary of State, on his first outing, accept that that is fundamentally true&#151;as the Prime Minister appeared to in his leadership campaign&#151;and tell the House that he feels we must do better in getting value for money for the vastly increased resources that, to give the Government credit, have been introduced to the NHS?</p>

It is my genuine belief that, without a change of Government in 1997, the NHS would have weakened and withered with each subsequent year of neglect. That would have strengthened the position of those who oppose the whole concept of a national health service that is free to all and based on clinical need rather than the ability to pay. The mantra of such people is that no matter how much investment is put into the NHS, it will never work because of the principal basis on which it was founded.</p>

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his appointment, and I wish him luck for the future; I am sure that he will do a marvellous job for the NHS. Surely the real issue is the need to improve access to primary care, and therefore to improve capacity in primary care. Has he had a chance to read the report on the future of pharmacy that was produced by the all-party group on pharmacy? What plans does he have to ensure that pharmacists and general practitioners work together more closely to increase capacity in both primary care and community services, so that we can improve patient outcomes across the board and reduce some of the pressure on hospital services?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right: we can go much further as regards the 10,000 pharmacies in this country offering services. We can go much further on access to primary care services, too; I will come to that subject in a moment. Thanks to medical developments, we are all living longer, and the number of people over 85 is set to increase by two thirds by 2026. Technological advances mean that operations that were once considered miraculous are increasingly commonplace. I cite the case of the heart transplant given last week to 18-month-old baby Zoe Chambers, who is from Hull in my constituency. We now live in a far more consumer-oriented culture, where customers rightly expect goods and services to be provided at times convenient to them.</p>

We need to ensure that our provision is flexible and responsive enough to meet the demands of hard-working families, who face competing demands on their time. In 1997, surgeries were frequently shut at the times when patients needed them most, such as lunch time, after work and at weekends. It was hard to make an appointment, and the surgeries were often in a squalid state of disrepair. Since then, more than 3,000 GP premises have been rebuilt or refurbished. Nine out of 10 patients can now see a GP within two working days, and more than three quarters of patients say that they are seen as soon as they think it necessary. In 1997, just half of patients said the same thing.</p>

The centre does not provide such access because it is a national pilot or because it is in receipt of special funding; it is simply responding to the needs of its patients. The business case is clear, and the local personal medical services contract with the PCT provides for the practice to develop its service in this way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70703-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07070344000113">We have invested more money in GPs through the GP contract, but this has been more money for better services. The quality and outcomes framework part of the contract pays GPs according to how effectively they care for their patients. This includes preventive work like gauging blood pressure more regularly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70703-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07070344000114">The contract also incentivises better access. There are now around 90 NHS walk-in centres and 46 NHS treatment centres, including six commuter walk-in centres, offering free advice and treatment to all comers, without registration or an appointment. The centres are easy to access and they are open 365 days a year. They make a particular difference in improving services for the most vulnerable. We are closing the gap between GP referral and treatment times, so that waiting times are at an all-time low and more people are benefiting from earlier relief of symptoms, less anxiety and more convenient care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70703-0009.htm_para7"><a name="07070344000115">We have also made it easier for patients to choose where they have their treatment. Patients needing a referral for elective care can now select from four different hospitals. Greater choice leads to better local services, and by making sure that funding follows the patient we have stimulated the development of more responsive, patient-centred services. One million people are seen by the NHS every 36 hours, and 1 million additional operations are now carried out each year. The maximum out-patient waiting time is now 11 weeks for over 99 per cent. of patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70703-0009.htm_para8"><a name="07070344000116">In-patient waiting lists are down by 476,000 since 1997, to the lowest figure since comparable data were first collected. The average wait for in-patient treatment is now six weeks. Virtually nobody is waiting more than six months for an operation. Cataract operation waiting times have fallen from two years to just three months, and waiting times for heart operations are also down to less than three months.</p>

In 1997, over a third of all suspected cancer patients had to wait longer than two weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70703-0009.htm_para10"><a name="07070344000118">The service has been transformed since 1997, and this achievement has been a Herculean feat. I do, however, recognise that the financial turnaround and the reform programme have been delivered at some cost to staff engagement and public confidence. While those who use the NHS testify in ever greater numbers to its excellent treatment and improved resources, the public as a whole is not yet persuaded. The latest survey by the Healthcare Commission independently questioned 80,000 people with recent experience of in-patient treatment, and 92 per cent. found that treatment either excellent, very good or good, and only 2 per cent. found that it was poor.</p>

and the public and creating a system that is publicly accountable locally, as well as through the elected Government. My predecessors have already taken significant steps towards creating an independent, self-improving NHS, steadily removing power from the hands of politicians and transferring it to clinicians. In 1999, we created the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to give clinical guidance on what the NHS should and should not do. We also established the Commission for Health Improvement, which is now the Healthcare Commission and is soon to merge with the other independent regulatory bodies that we have created. There are now 67 foundation trusts independent of Whitehall, accountable to their members and making their own decisions on how best to serve their patients.</p>

However, the treatment needed for the NHS then, when the whole system was in intensive care, is not the same as the treatment that it needs now, when it is well on the road to recovery. Of course targets have their limits. With targets, there is always a risk that Governments end up improving only the health care standards that they can measure. Targets can also have adverse effects if they are not properly researched and informed; and the top-down performance management that goes with them leads the NHS to look up to Whitehall rather than outwards to its patients and local communities. That is why we are determined to move away from targets as we transform the NHS from a top-down bureaucracy to a bottom-up, self-improving organisation with power in the hands of patients, their advocates, crucially GPs and other primary care staff, and of course staff themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07070344000135">The heart of the NHS will always depend on effective collaboration by professionals around the needs of patients. That is why we placed a duty of collaboration on all providers in the NHS family. In future, a key measure of the quality of care given by every provider will be not only performance but the partnership established with the rest of the health service. With more than 600 organisations in the NHS, we need to ensure that each patient has a clear path to follow so that they can obtain the right treatment at the right place and time. Primary care trusts have already been given the authority and finance to develop and commission services around local needs, meeting national quality standards without being locked into historical practice.</p>

That was an enormous gap, which amounted to almost criminal neglect of the health service. The results were clear for all to see. I remember people coming to see me who had to wait three or four years for hip or knee joint operations; the cancer survival rates were appalling compared with other European countries; and so on. The Conservative party has nothing of which to be proud in its record in government. However, the picture that the Secretary of State painted of what has happened since is too rosy and I want to raise some specific issues. I hope that he will take them seriously and reflect on them, especially the important matter of equitable access to services, which the motion rightly covers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07070344000146">The motion is broadly uncontroversial&#151;it is pretty much motherhood and apple pie. I am sure that the Government will vote against motherhood and apple pie, but we will support the motion because we agree with its content. Of course, it is easy to make the commitment, but much more difficult to achieve the motion&#146;s objectives. It is crucial to consider the way in which policies and proposals affect and influence the prospects of achieving equitable access. Like the Conservative spokesman, I want to acknowledge the extraordinary role that staff play in the NHS. We are remarkably lucky as a country to have such a dedicated work force and we all rely on their work. They are a dedicated group of professionals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07070344000147">Before considering equitable access, I want to highlight a part of the motion about which I am concerned. It is the Conservative proposal in their policy document, which I have read, and in the motion for a shift towards practice-based commissioning. There are limits to the extent to which it is sensible to proceed in that direction. Several organisations have expressed concerns about the impact of too much reliance on that. A couple of years ago, the Sainsbury Centre produced a report on the potential impact of practice-based commissioning on mental health. It stated:</p>
<a name="70703-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="07070344000201"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Plans to allow GPs to commission a wider range of mental health treatments will result in substandard care&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07070344000148">The report referred especially to the previous fundholding scheme, which operated under the Conservative Government, and the risk of neglect of patients with severe and enduring illnesses. If we are holding a serious debate, it is important that the Conservatives understand and recognise the potential risks of practice-based commissioning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07070344000149">In June last year, the Audit Commission criticised the Government&#146;s plans for practice-based commissioning. It said that the scheme risked &#147;exacerbating financial pressures&#148;, &#147;widening inequalities&#148; and &#147;wasting money&#148;. Those conclusions were based on where practice-based commissioning had been initiated and appeared to be working well. There are, therefore, concerns about the scheme, and conflicts of interest could arise when GPs can commission services from organisations that they set up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07070344000152">Let me deal with equitable access to services and the related issue of health inequalities. The Secretary of State referred in his deputy leadership campaign to his specific concerns about health inequalities. I therefore know that he genuinely takes that seriously and I hope that the need to reduce inequalities will be a top priority for him. In 2002, the Government made a commitment&#151;with which, I am sure, he is familiar&#151;that by 2010 they would reduce inequalities in health outcomes by 10 per cent., as measured by infant mortality and life expectancy at birth. That is a legitimate direction in which to try to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07070344000153">However, this year&#146;s departmental report highlights a shift in the other direction: health inequalities in our country are increasing. On infant mortality, it stated that the gap had widened and that the rate for routine and manual workers was 18 per cent. higher than that for the total population, compared with 13 per cent. in 1997-99. The Department&#146;s statistics for 2001-03 show that among the most affluent, there were 2.9 infant deaths per 1,000 live births compared with 8.9 per 1,000 live births among the poorest members of our community. That is a stark contrast between the life chances of people born in good circumstances and those born in our most disadvantaged communities. I am sure that all Members are concerned about that and we need to find ways to reduce that gap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07070344000154">The gap in life expectancy has increased, and it has done so most among women. The relative gap among women has increased by 8 per cent.; among men, it has increased by 2 per cent. Again, the Department&#146;s statistics for 2001-03 found that in the best area in the country&#151;east Dorset, for some reason; it is a reasonably affluent area&#151;men could expect to live to the age of 80, whereas in Manchester they could expect to live to the age of 71.8. That is a stark difference, which we should all find unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07070344000155">Do those differences have anything to do with the health service or are they all to do with much broader factors? Clearly, many factors such as poverty, deprivation, lifestyle and so on, play a part, but health care is relevant. Let me draw the Secretary of State&#146;s attention to programme budgeting&#151;a new development that the Department has pursued&#151;which enables us to compare areas and consider not only how much is spent on each specialty, but the outcomes in each specialty. We can therefore ascertain the effectiveness of the money in each area of the country. A recent report concluded that there was a clear link between spending and health outcomes. If we commit resources where they are most needed, we can achieve improvements in health and longer life expectancy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07070344000156">On the same issue of equitable access, I want to deal with access to GPs. In the least deprived PCT areas there are 62.5 GPs per 100,000 of the population, while in the most deprived there are just 54.2 per 100,000. Thus the areas with the greatest health problems have the fewest GPs as a proportion of the population. It is the wrong way around. All that points to a failure of policy&#151;given that the Government highlighted the importance of the matter and set a target for reducing health inequalities in 2002, moving in the opposite direction is unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07070344000157">What are the prospects for reversing those trends? I would like briefly to look at the issue of choice. There is a risk, which many people highlight, that increasing  <br>

choice actually has the effect of accentuating inequalities, the argument being that the middle classes can exploit those opportunities while others cannot. There is a very good report by the Institute for Public Policy Research, called &#147;Equitable Choices for Health&#148;, which highlighted the potential risks. It referred to a pilot in London&#151;the London patient choice project&#151;in which disadvantaged people were given help with transport and given advice by patient care advisers about how best to exercise choice of hospital, treatment and so forth. The conclusion was that the pilot had had a positive impact on reducing inequalities. It had empowered people, particularly those at the bottom end of the income scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07070344000158">However, the report also pointed out that when the Government rolled out patient choice nationally, none of those support mechanisms was in place. There was no help with transport and no guidance on how people should exercise choice. The IPPR&#146;s conclusion was that under the Government&#146;s scheme, choice was likely to increase inequality. I hope that the Secretary of State will further examine those conclusions from the research and consider how best to ensure that choice actually empowers the least powerful in society, rather than accentuating differences in health outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70703-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07070344000159">I need to deal with the impact of deficits. The Secretary of State has perhaps arrived at a good moment because his predecessor had a pretty tough year. She made a political commitment to ensure that the NHS as a whole was in balance by the end of the financial year. She achieved that, but there are questions about the price that was paid to do so. The Health Committee drew attention to the fact that in the efforts to clear deficits some serious soft targets were hit. Particular attention was drawn to mental health services, which have been cut back in many parts of the country, including my own county of Norfolk. It is the same with public health programmes. Cutting back on alcohol prevention work, smoking cessation work and other programmes often hits the most disadvantaged people and again has the effect of accentuating inequalities in health outcomes. If the Secretary of State is serious about his commitment to reducing inequalities, those are the sorts of issues with which he needs to deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70703-0011.htm_para0"><a name="07070344000160">I also want to draw attention to the extent of geographical variation in access to health care&#151;the so-called health care lottery. It is often said that one of the risks of moving towards a more decentralised system&#151;one that I favour&#151;is that we end up with a postcode lottery. Well, the fact is that we already have a postcode lottery with a vengeance under the existing highly centralised system. Another problem is that there is no local accountability to achieve any change. One example of variation in access to services is care of the elderly. There is massive variation in how the criteria are interpreted from one area to another, so that people in one area can get access to free long-term care for the elderly under the NHS, but people in another area cannot. The Secretary of State should also look further into audiology&#151;another example of where the variations are enormous. Hundreds of thousands of people are on a waiting list for digital hearing aids. In some parts of the country, there is no wait at all&#151;the Health Committee looked into that&#151;while in other areas people are waiting two or  <br>

more years for access to and the fitting of a digital hearing aid. Reassessments for people who have had an analogue hearing aid and who want a digital one can involve a wait of up to 260 weeks or five years.</p>

People living in the no-access areas who have money are okay because they can ultimately pay for the treatment, but people who have no money go blind. It is as simple as that. I would hope that we all find that completely unacceptable, yet it is happening now and it needs to be dealt with. The excuse provided by many PCTs is that they are waiting for a ruling from NICE. In fact, NICE has provided a rather unfavourable ruling, which leads me to question the criteria that it follows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70703-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07070344000162">Variations across the country are enormous. The subject of dentistry and orthodontic waiting times may have been mentioned in an earlier sedentary intervention. The waiting time is enormous in some parts of the country. More general access to NHS dentists is another problem. In some areas, it is almost a thing of the past. Many people moving to a new area can often simply not get access to an NHS dentist.</p>

The Conservatives have campaigned vigorously over recent years against reconfigurations, hospital closures and so forth, but I believe that the inevitable consequence of their proposals will be to make reconfigurations and closures more rather than less likely. The critical issue then becomes: who decides under Conservative policy if and when a hospital should close? As I have already said, the Conservatives propose a substantial shift of budgets towards practice-based commissioning, very much giving power to GPs rather than to PCTs. They also propose a significant shift towards using the private sector while their document also endorses, of course, the principle of payment by results. The inevitable consequence will be that some hospitals will become unviable. The Conservative spokesman referred to the importance of care closer to home, which is again likely to make some hospitals unviable.</p>

 As I have already outlined in some detail, there is a real risk that, in achieving the result that the Conservatives say they are concerned about, we might lose local hospitals even though they are socially important for delivering care to a particular area, because of the drift of the market following decisions made by GPs. There would be no powerful local body with a role to play in such arrangements.

I urge the Government to recognise the value that local communities place on those institutions. There is, perhaps, something rather nebulous about it, but they are seen as very important local institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70703-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07070344000176">It is remarkable how much money is raised by local communities for their community hospitals. On Sunday, I took part in the Great London Run to raise money for Wells hospital, which is now run as a charitable trust. That is an interesting development, and one that the former Secretary of State highlighted in Parliament last year when launching the White Paper. The idea of social enterprises of that sort running the local cottage hospital is an attractive proposition that ought to be explored further. If we close those local units, we lose the community involvement, the fundraising effort and the voluntary money that is going into our health service. We also lose a valuable local institution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70703-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07070344000177">The motion rightly draws attention to the importance of choice in maternity services. There is a sense at the moment that the funding of maternity services is unbalanced. We now have a remarkable situation in which 23 per cent. of births involve a caesarean section&#151;</p>

 It is now 24 per cent. The World Health Organisation says that when we get beyond about 15 per cent., we achieve no health benefits, yet we are committing enormous resources to caesarean sections for the 24 per cent. of women who give birth in that way. Only 3 per cent. of women give birth at home, compared with about 30 per cent. in Holland. There is something wrong there. That suggests to me that women are not effectively being given a proper, informed choice&#151;</p>

 The hon. Gentleman might say that, but the remarkable difference between this country and Holland, where women are given a full opportunity to make a choice, suggests something rather different.</p>

There is an urgent need for that to be reviewed. I would be grateful if the Minister would also respond to a concern about independent sector treatment centres. There was a report in the press last week that two proposed new independent sector treatment centres had been cancelled. I would be interested to find out whether that suggests a change of approach, or whether the Government have at last recognised that it is not sensible to impose these private sector treatment centres from the centre. Such decisions should be made locally.</p>

Local accountability and local responsibility are absolutely crucial and provide the best way to secure services that are relevant to the local area, combined with national entitlements for citizens so that they know what to expect from their health service. In his statement today, the Prime Minister talked about devolving power in the delivery of public services. Will that be a reality in the health service? It is badly needed.</p>

She will be remembered for having the courage to tackle the difficult issue of NHS deficits and pulling that off, which many Members on both sides of the House thought that she would not achieve. I hope that she enjoys her time on the Back Benches, but I hope that it will be a limited time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70703-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07070358000003">Access to health care has improved around the country, and in my Swindon constituency. Local plans are under way to improve it still further. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) has once again shown a fondness for picking isolated cases and testimonies, then manipulating and exaggerating them. For example, he mentioned the reorganisation of NHS Direct, and criticised the Government in a sweeping statement for reducing the number of call centres. In fact, that was a patient-led change. People&#146;s habits change, medicine changes and organisations change over time. NHS Direct was reorganised because more people were using the web service, and fewer people were using the telephone service. It was rightly reorganised because people&#146;s habits and demands had changed, and the hon. Gentleman should pay attention to that. His criticisms, both today and in previous Opposition day debates, are empty, and they do not add up to an holistic health policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70703-0011.htm_para20"><a name="07070358000004">Fay Howard, a councillor and a nurse in my constituency, works at the Great Western hospital, which was built by Labour and opened in 2003. She is part of an NHS team treating more patients more quickly with better outcomes and higher patient satisfaction every year in Swindon. Apart from better access to GPs, accident and emergency services, and emergency care, Fay thinks that Labour&#146;s programme of delivering care at home is crucial, and she gave me powerful anecdotal evidence:</p>
<a name="70703-0011.htm_brev3"><a name="07070358001364"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Some patients arrive with notes of visits and treatments they&#146;ve been having at home which we didn&#146;t used to see. But the big units are still there when people need them, as well as NHS Direct, the walk in centre, the kids day treatment unit&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70703-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07070358000005">Things have changed, because health care has changed and people&#146;s expectations have changed. My constituents expect the best: they also expect choice and appropriate treatment in the most appropriate place, whether that is in a hospital, a GP&#146;s surgery or at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70703-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07070358000006">On a local level, front-line staff in Swindon are innovating to improve access, and I pay tribute to their hard work and dedication. The Government need to acknowledge that more: we must tell our NHS staff that they are doing a fantastic job, and listen to their views of the improvements and changes that we need to make. Swindon and Marlborough NHS trust is considering setting up a birthing centre to allow women with uncomplicated pregnancies to give birth in a homely environment, cared for by the midwifery team. That obviously improves access, but it also improves patient choice. Our sexual health clinic has developed a patient numbering system to protect anonymity, which encourages people to seek help. It also uses mobile text messaging for patients, which keeps the service anonymous so people return, which is crucial.</p>

a year who would otherwise have to travel 50 miles to Bristol. Our radiography waiting times are among the lowest in the country. There is a filmless radiography department&#151;it is all digital. If people transfer to Bristol, their X-ray can be e-mailed to the doctor, which means that there is no waiting. I am pleased that my local health service is listening to patient feedback. People wanted the audiology clinic to extend its opening times; it has done so, and likewise the booking centre. We have been helped by the Department of Health. Last month, it published progress on the 18-week target and everyone in my community was concerned that Swindon was low on the list. I am pleased that an action plan is in place, and that there will be regular consultations with MPs. I hope that the new health team will continue that excellent initiative, because we need to know how well our health service is doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="70703-0011.htm_para24"><a name="07070358000008">As well as acute care, primary care services have provided better access to patients in Swindon. Our walk-in clinic is a local success story, and constituents tell me that it is a great improvement on waiting to see a GP or going to accident and emergency. They have also praised increased pre-emptive care initiatives such as the falls clinic, which helps the elderly both to deal with falls and to prevent them at home, and the Alzheimer&#146;s clinic, which has become well known in Swindon under the leadership of Dr. Bullock. There is therefore increased access, choice and patient satisfaction. From next week, a new Government initiative&#151;the telehealth initiative&#151;goes live in Swindon. It will provide specialist monitoring equipment at home for people with respiratory disease, and is another measure that brings health care closer to home. It is a Labour initiative, and we are proud of it. It helps to explain why, throughout the country, we have 98 per cent. satisfaction rates among patients using the national health service<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>The Opposition are heckling me, because they do not want to hear that 98 per cent. of people who use the health service, whether in a Tory, Liberal Democrat or Labour constituency, are satisfied with it. Patients love our local NHS, but they often tell me that the reports they read in the paper suggest that their experience is not the norm. Even though I am biased when it comes to Swindon; I can confirm from my time on the Government&#146;s health team that the NHS is good and improving all over the country, as I am sure we will hear from colleagues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70703-0011.htm_para25"><a name="07070358000009">We in Swindon remember the national headlines about lack of access: 60,000 general and acute beds were lost, waiting lists rose by 400,000, and the total number of hospitals went down under the Tories. They closed our local hospital&#151;the Princess Alexandra&#151;and let our other hospital go to rack and ruin. Then, as now, the Opposition had no proper strategy for increasing access. It has been my dubious pleasure to listen to every health Opposition day debate for the past 18 months. I have been proud to be on the front line since 2005. The Government will continue&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07070358000014">First, however, I pay tribute to the consultants, doctors, nurses and other professionals who work in our health service. They are a tremendous asset to the country, and their dedication, professionalism and care know no bounds. Many nurses and doctors work longer than required to put patient care first, but they are often unrewarded financially for doing so. They are an asset to the country, and were it not for them, the NHS would be in crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07070358000015">Unfortunately, in past years and months, and even in the past few weeks, I have had to attend a number of NHS hospitals across the country. The one thing that all the staff wanted me to say in the House of Commons when they found out that I was a Member of Parliament was that morale is at rock bottom. I did not know before today&#146;s debate that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) had the figures from a survey to prove that, but that was just what they told me. Wherever I was, they said that morale was at rock bottom. When I asked why, they said that the main reason was that the Government set them priorities and targets. They head in that direction for six months, but then the Government change the priorities and targets, and they head off in the opposite direction. They thought that clinical judgment was not appreciated, and was not being used. A very senior consultant&#151;one of the top cancer care specialists in the country&#151;said that the book and choose system has had an adverse effect. He said that part of every surgery must be reserved for people using that system. He said that as a result he sees people who could be seen by a junior doctor rather than people who are seriously ill whom he should see. That is because of direct Government intervention on his clinical judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07070358000016">The hon. Member for South Swindon made a powerful speech about how well things are going in her area and how much extra investment there is. That highlights an aspect of my argument: the situation is not the same across the country. The national capitation formula is supposed to produce fair play across the whole of the NHS, but north Northamptonshire does not get a fair deal. By the Government&#146;s own figures, over the past five years north Northamptonshire has been underfunded by &#163;111 million. If we in north Northamptonshire had &#163;111 million extra, we would not be denying patients access to certain treatments. I want to highlight such patients to give a few examples of what underfunding actually means. I am not trying to claim that the Government do not want to invest; I do not believe that  <br>

He currently manages to live on his own, but he cannot make do without a hearing aid. The waiting time to receive a hearing aid for that 92-year-old is 15 months, and yet they can, of course, be bought off the shelf. He has been let down; access to that has been denied him. There is also the case of a lady who needed a hysterectomy. My primary care trust has introduced a minimum five-and-a-half-month wait. When she eventually got into hospital, she was gowned up and had done all the tests when she was told at 5 o&#146;clock in the evening, &#147;Sorry, we can&#146;t do it because the doctor&#146;s run out of hours,&#148; so she had to go back into the queue again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07070358000018">There is also the issue of cancelled operations. I sat in a mixed ward and witnessed a consultant telling a patient on the other side of the room, &#147;I&#146;m sorry that we had to cancel your operation that was scheduled for six months ago. Unfortunately, your cancer has now got worse and the operation will be much more complicated.&#148; That patient did not survive; he died on the operating table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07070358000019">Let me give another example of a lady in my constituency who is almost 80 years of age. She went to hospital; it was not the local hospital as there is no hospital in my constituency, so she had to go to one in a neighbouring constituency. She was told that she was going blind and had macular degeneration and that the only way to fix it was to have injections of a drug called Avastin. The consultant told her that it was not available on the NHS but that if she went to the place down the road, she could have it done for &#163;3,300. It is incredible that although we are supposed to have a national health service with access for everyone&#151;and with great facilities in South Swindon&#151;I have a constituent who will go blind unless her family finds &#163;3,300. That cannot be the basis on which to run the NHS. It cannot be right that patients in my constituency can go blind because people in Whitehall will not fund the treatment they need.</p>

 I wish to speak briefly about the health care system in Wakefield, which presents a challenge, not least because we have to provide health care for two prisons. We have to provide mental health care, drugs and alcohol support and primary care in a women&#146;s prison, a young offender&#146;s institution and in Wakefield prison, which is high security. A remote electrocardiogram system is now in place in Wakefield prison so that prisoners who might be having a heart attack can be remotely assessed by hospital clinicians, thereby avoiding the security risks involved in transporting prisoners to and from hospital, such as opportunities for escape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07070358000021">According to the latest statistics, Wakefield has a positive first set of figures on the number of people waiting no more than 18 weeks to receive their treatment. At my local hospital, Pinderfields general hospital, 54 per cent. of patients received their treatment within 18 weeks. In a specialty such as gastroenterology, the proportion was more than 90 per cent. and in cardiology it was more than 70 per cent.  <br>

Therefore, it is clear that targets are driving down waiting times, and it is vital that we keep them in order to improve patient care. Nationally, targets have resulted in 50,000 extra lives being saved from cancer and 150,000 lives saved from heart disease. That is also linked to our target to treat people in accident and emergency units within four hours. Anybody who had to wait in an accident and emergency unit 10 or 15 years ago with a sick child, a relative or a friend in pain, wondering when they were going to be seen&#151;as many Members must have done&#151;will welcome that maximum four-hour waiting target.

Last year, I visited Kirkburton health centre in my constituency. It has a fantastic new centre, that was built under the LIFT&#151;local improvement finance trust&#151;scheme. It is fully compliant with disability and discrimination legislation, unlike some of the terraced housing that was all too prevalent under the Conservative years of NHS underfunding.</p>

I visited the surgery on Friday; goodie bags were being given to children, containing little toothbrushes that could stand up, little balloons that carried the message,</p>

People in my constituency live on average one year less than the national average life expectancy and seven years less than those with the highest life expectancy in Britain.

For example, pregnant women in my constituency can look up Pontefract general infirmary and see vital information such as the number of women who knew their midwife in labour&#151;in Pontefract it was 45 per cent. compared to an average of 22 per cent. They can also see if their local hospital has a neonatal intensive care unit or a special care baby unit, or a dedicated obstetric anaesthetist, which is related to my earlier intervention about waiting for an epidural. Crucially, women can discover whether, post-birth, they will have access to breastfeeding support&#151;something that every mother would like to know.

Warwickshire and south Northamptonshire. It has been a general hospital for more than 100 years, but it is now facing the prospect of a serious downgrading of hospital services, including the removal of 24/7 paediatric care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07070358000034">That level of paediatric care at Horton came about because of the death of a child. In 1974, Barbara Castle, then Secretary of State for Health, ordered an independent public inquiry, which ruled that there should be 24/7 paediatric care at the Horton. As a consequence of losing that care, we have the prospect of losing the special care baby unit and consultant-led obstetric and midwife maternity services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07070358000035">When the Oxford Radcliffe NHS trust made those proposals, 86 GPs made a joint statement saying that they were unsafe and inhumane. As a consequence, the trust took its proposals off the table and set up two clinical working groups, which&#151;slightly bizarrely&#151;met and worked in secret. Many of us thought that their purpose was to wear down GP opposition to the proposals. Indeed, several GPs now say that while they are very unhappy about what is proposed, they consider it to be&#151;and we should take note of this sentence&#146;s construction&#151;the least worst option. I do not want an NHS in my constituency that is the least worst option. Nor do I believe that Ministers want that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07070358000036">The trust also set up a stakeholders&#146; group, with many members, including Labour councillors Surinder Dhesi, George Parish and Dr. Peter Fisher, who for many years was a consultant physician at the Horton and a Labour county councillor. The group has published a unanimous report, a bit like a Select Committee report, in which it expresses concerns. It says that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para27"><a name="07070358000042">My second question is what will Ministers do to protect smaller general hospitals, or are they content to see them downgraded? The stakeholder group concluded:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para29"><a name="07070358000044">Why Ministers should be concerned is because the Oxford Radcliffe trust seemed to suggest that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suggested that a maternity unit is not viable unless it had 2,500 births a year. The group points out that the college&#146;s document, &#147;Safer Childbirth: Minimum Standards for Service Provision and Care in Labour&#148;, published in November 2006, actually says that units such as the Horton with fewer than 2,500 births should</p>
<a name="70703-0012.htm_brev10"><a name="07070358001375"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;continually review staffing to ensure it is adequate based on local needs&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para30"><a name="07070358000045">The group comments:</p>
<a name="70703-0012.htm_brev11"><a name="07070358001376"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This does not seem to be saying that 2,500 is the minimum figure for births in an obstetric-led unit.

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para31"><a name="07070358000046">I would hope that Ministers would feel able to try to work out how health care provision in smaller general hospitals can be protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70703-0012.htm_para32"><a name="07070358000047">Sir Ian Kennedy, the chairman of the Healthcare Commission, in a recent speech, observed that</p>

It does not make much sense to talk about waiting lists: having 1.2 million people, say, wait a month for some form of elective<i> </i>would be reasonable, in fact desirable, but it would be totally unacceptable to have 100,000 waiting for a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70703-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07070358000057">Instead, we must talk about average and maximum waiting times, They have been falling dramatically, and I hope that we will achieve the 18-week target this year.

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70703-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07070358000058">My second, related point, is that we would not have secured those improvements without targets. There is an enormous amount of confusion among my former hon. Friends in the Opposition about that. Indeed, it may be worse that confusion&#151;perhaps there is an element of opportunism in their approach. At present, the Government are having a row with the health service unions, so Opposition Members ask themselves why they should not curry some short-term favour with the unions by promising them something.

The whole point is that the spirit of those principles is important, because it means that people in the medical profession should always put the patient&#146;s interest first, maintain the highest standards of professional behaviour and be attached to medicine&#146;s scientific principles. Those principles are non-negotiable. They are deeply ingrained in every self-respecting doctor or nurse, and anyone who abuses them in the way that I described should be sacked.

I understand that it is difficult for a Minister to second-guess senior consultants and the people running the royal colleges, but it is clear in retrospect that that is what should have happened. Unfortunately, however, the senior doctors were influenced by their own interests: they thought that spending so much time interviewing junior doctors was boring, and that it would be a thoroughly good thing to allow a computer to do all that. That is an example of how producer orientation and monopoly power can go wrong&#151;in medicine, as in other areas of human activity.</p>

The hon. Member for Wakefield may resist that, but I am glad that there was one bright spark in the speech of the new Secretary of State.</p>

Members across the House had problems with community hospitals. I see some of them here this evening on the Labour Benches. Vital services were threatened with cuts or closure, so in November 2005 I formed community hospitals acting nationally together&#151;CHANT&#151;a cross-party group supported by Liberal Democrat, Labour, Conservative and Independent Members and patrons from both Houses of Parliament. I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford is a supporter or not. CHANT has fought to raise the issue of community hospitals in this House. We were delighted by the Government&#146;s White Paper, which suggested that at last community hospitals were going to be saved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70703-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07070358000081">When CHANT was established in November 2005, about 80 community hospitals were threatened with cuts or closure. That number, according to the Community Hospitals Association, is now more than 166. Across the country, especially in rural communities, we have seen services cut. In my local area, we have seen the 24-hour minor injuries unit service at Withernsea hospital cut to day times only. We have seen constant battles by the whole community, on a cross-party basis, as my hon. Friends, who have not been seeking to make partisan points, have pointed out. Proposals were put forward at one stage to close every bed in Hornsea cottage hospital on some spurious urgency grounds. That had to be resisted by the threat of going to court, which led to the trust backing down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70703-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07070358000082">Then the primary care trust came forward with proposals that would have seen every NHS bed closed in my constituency&#151;beds in Withernsea, which is a highly deprived, isolated community, Hornsea and Beverley as well as Driffield. The plan was that the only NHS beds to replace those closed beds would be in Goole and Bridlington&#151;a four-hour round trip. Who knows how long it would take by public transport for the typically elderly patient and their spouse if they had to get to those hospitals? The community came together as one. The one benefit of the consultation was the way in which it brought the community together. They were united in opposition to the plan, as people have been in so many other parts of the country.</p>

Conservatives on East Riding of Yorkshire council jointly signed a letter to the PCT board saying that it must stop the attack on vital services. I am pleased to relate that that did have an impact, such was the opposition. The trust has recognised the need to maintain beds in Beverley, which is a major step forward, and Withernsea. It has not saved any beds in Hornsea, although I hope still that there will be an opportunity for us to keep some beds in what I believe is the largest town in England that does not have an A road to it. It has B roads, which are all too often blocked by traffic in the summer. Local people need local services in that sparsely populated rural community. They should not be judged on the same basis as a unit in the centre of a city.</p>

The <i> Hull Daily Mail</i>, the <i> Holderness Gazette </i>and the <i> Beverley Guardian</i> worked on the campaign. Political parties, voluntary groups and others came together and fought the decision, and the PCT was made to listen. However, we are losing beds in Hornsea and there is a pattern of such closures across the country. I hope that the new ministerial team will look again at the White Paper and send out messages from the centre that community hospitals will be supported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70703-0013.htm_para21"><a name="07070358000085">There has been chaos in the way in which the Department has responded. Fortunately, there was a major effort in the House to put pressure on Ministers in the previous Administration. There was a response last summer from the previous Secretary of State; she announced &#163;750 million of capital funding for community hospitals. That was supposed to be a five-year programme. Perhaps I may ask the new Minister of State to investigate the programme. My PCT was told by the strategic health authority with only a few weeks&#146; notice that it had to pull forward and get its bids in by the end of June, now postponed to the end of July. Yet it was supposed to be a five-year programme with full consultation. I ask the Minister to look again at community hospitals and ensure that the vision laid out in the White Paper, which had support across the House, can be delivered on the ground. Too often, Government rhetoric has not been matched by the reality that local constituents have had to put up with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70703-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07070358000088">If only the telephone triage service could be rationalised so that there was one number for everyone to phone across the country and a standardised triage system at the end of the phone, one would sort out the problems of access to emergency care in a moment. The huge point is that the Department of Health has the means to do that. I urge the Minister to look at NHS pathways, which has defined exactly the standard questionnaire that can sort out anybody. I tested it on a small boy who sadly died in my constituency as a result of inadequate triage. After about the fourth question, NHS pathways would have picked up the fact that the little boy needed to be admitted to hospital. I plead with Ministers to look at NHS pathways. It is being piloted in the north-east by the ambulance service there, which is to report in September 2007. It is being piloted in Croydon by the out-of-hours service, which is also to report in September 2007. The results are expected to show tremendous success and benefit.</p>

Ministers should look at NHS pathways seriously to see why it cannot be rolled out to cover the whole country. It would have huge benefits, solve the problems with NHS Direct, and release nurses to nurse because the triage is so organised that it can be done by trained lay people. I urge the Minister to make it a high priority to create only two options for emergency care&#151;A and E or a single phone number connected to NHS pathways.</p>

hard-working staff of the NHS, to whom we all pay tribute, deserve far greater support than they are receiving from the Government, so we have presented the new Prime Minister&#146;s team with a copy of our NHS autonomy and accountability white paper. Although the Prime Minister seemed to distance himself from the idea of taking politics out of the NHS in the closing days of his non-campaign, at the weekend he told the <i> News of the World </i>that he would be pursuing our policy.

As I have discovered through parliamentary questions, his Department counts only GP practices that take up component 1 of the PBC incentive payment, which is, in effect, free money: 95p per registered patient if the practice submits a plan on how it intends to deliver direct enhanced services. The practice receives that money whether or not it delivers on the plan. Component 2 of the payment is made available when it actually delivers, so it is no wonder that I was not surprised to discover that information about the take-up of PBC is collected only at primary care trust level.

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07070358000110">Surely now that the clunking fist of the ex-Chancellor has grasped power, the Government should recognise that there is a large elephant in the room, which is, as they say in the motion, their suggestion that the staff and the medical profession have worked hard to deliver the Government&#146;s targets. No&#151;they have worked hard to deliver better patient care and they have done so by working not necessarily with and for the Government, but often despite the Government who have set the top-down targets. That is why we need a new freedom of access and free access that is equitable across the country. I ask my hon. Friends on the Opposition Benches and perhaps some good-thinking friends on the Government side to support the motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07070358000112">The health service we inherited in 1997 was starved of essential funding. Every winter heralded a new crisis, cancer death rates were going up, waiting lists topped 1 million, there was a shortage of beds, patients were left on trolleys in A and E for hours and half of all hospital buildings had been built before 1948. Ten years on, the position is transformed thanks to greater investment, difficult but necessary system reform and, above all, the tremendous work of those who work in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07070358000113">As recent successive independent surveys have shown, patient appreciation of the health service is at record levels. The Healthcare Commission survey, in line with previous years, showed that more than nine in 10 people rate their care as excellent, very good or good. The recent Commonwealth Fund survey of international rankings looked at the health services of the UK, Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the United States against health system indicators of quality, equity, healthy lives, access and efficiency and it placed the UK first, an increase of two places since 2006.</p>

<p><a name="st_o261"><a name="07070358000114"><a name="70703-0014.htm_spnew0"><a name="07070358001456"><b>Mr. Lansley:</b>
 Will the Minister give way?</p>

<p><a name="st_o262"><a name="07070358000115"><a name="70703-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="07070358001457"><b>Mr. Bradshaw:</b>
 Certainly not. I very much regret that not all Back Benchers were able to contribute to the debate because the Opposition went on for too long. I will not give way in the 10 minutes that I have left to respond to the very important points that Back Benchers have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07070358000116">The Government accept that the transition that we have put through since 1997 has been delivered at some cost to staff engagement and some measure of public confidence. Those who use the NHS testify in ever-greater numbers to its excellent treatment and improved resources, but the public as a whole are not yet persuaded. Deficits in some health trusts place unwanted additional strain on hard-working NHS staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07070358000117">I now come to some of the points that have been made in the debate. The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) was absolutely right when he said that health inequalities remain a major challenge. Access to GPs, for example, differs widely even within regions of the country. In the north-east, there are 133 per 100,000 of population in Northumberland compared with 25 per 100,000 in neighbouring Redcar and Cleveland. He is right to say that we have more to do on that, and we are doing so through the fairness in primary care procurement. We have been working with the 30 primary care trusts with the fewest GPs for their populations and contracts with new providers should improve access to services for thousands of people living in those areas. Advertisements for the initial four&#151;Hartlepool, Nottinghamshire County Teaching, County Durham and Yarmouth and Waveney&#151;were placed in April. Advertisements for a further six PCTs were published for Ashton, Leigh and Wigan, Bolton, East Lancashire, Luton Teaching, Manchester and Trafford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para21"><a name="07070358000118">The hon. Gentleman is also right to point to the problems that we still face in audiology. We acknowledge that waits for hearing aids are still too  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="3 July 2007">

<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2007 : Column 882</b><br>
long and we published a framework for tackling the problem in May. The Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), will publish the Government&#146;s response to the Health Committee&#146;s recent report shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07070358000119">I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that there will be no change in the Government&#146;s approach to independent sector treatment centres, and he is also right to say that challenges remain in orthodontics. As he will know, the old system led to huge variations in the provision of orthodontic services, because orthodontists could decide for themselves where to set up practice and how much work to do for the NHS. Last year&#146;s reforms will address that issue, but I have to point out that the NHS spends more on orthodontic services per head of population than any other state-funded system in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07070358000120">The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) said that she thought that the provision of dentistry was getting worse. That is not the case. NHS dentistry is expanding nationally. PCTs are now commissioning more dental services than the year before the reforms, and in March 2007 there were more than 21,000 dentists on NHS lists, an increase of 4,000 since 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para24"><a name="07070358000121">Most of the points made by Conservative Members seemed to focus on the configuration of hospital services, and community hospitals and community services in particular. The configuration of hospital services must be a matter for the local national health service. We do not believe that it is central Government&#146;s role to micro-manage every local health economy. As my hon. Friends the Members for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) and for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove) and my new hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), in an excellent contribution, made absolutely clear, reconfiguration in their constituencies has led to considerable benefits in terms of health service provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para25"><a name="07070358000122">As the hon. Member for North Norfolk pointed out, the implications of the Conservative party&#146;s policy is more closures of community hospitals not being decided at local level but being decided by a national quango. That is not the route that we intend to go down. Far from closing hospitals, this Government have delivered the biggest hospital building programme ever, with 109 new hospitals open or under construction since 1997. The reconfigurations are taking place because doctors are telling us that specialist care needs to be concentrated in centres of excellence so that clinicians with the right expertise, experience and equipment can treat the sickest patients safely and conveniently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para26"><a name="07070358000123">Conservative Members also asked what the Government&#146;s approach to targets would be and how many targets we have got rid of. My information is that targets have reduced in number over the past three strategic reviews from 108 to 20. The 18-week wait is the only remaining target when it comes to access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para27"><a name="07070358000124">We were presented with a paper by the official Opposition and, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, we will take a look at it. On the face of it, the things that they are proposing are either already under way or we do not believe that they are necessary to achieve the improvements that we all want. As the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="3 July 2007">

<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2007 : Column 883</b><br>
acknowledged in the Cornerstone paper, a large bulk of the Conservative party want private health insurance to pay for tax cuts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para28"><a name="07070358000125">As we move to the next phase of the NHS transformation, we agree that there should be much greater focus not on top-down reforms, but on stimulating change among patients and practitioners. The policy framework that we set out will be right only if the views of staff and patients are properly incorporated. A modern NHS must move from a public sector monopoly to a truly patient-led public service. The previous ministerial team, to whom I also pay tribute, took significant steps towards creating an independent, self-improving NHS, steadily removing powers from the hands of politicians and transferring it to clinicians. Increased transparency and independence have brought undoubted improvements, but it has also had a short-term effect on confidence. However, we were right to introduce those changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para29"><a name="07070358000126">Patients need staff to take the time to explain the condition and treatment options and citizens need to know what is going on and to be properly involved in collective decisions. We introduced national targets to eradicate the unacceptably long waiting lists and, without those targets, the NHS would not have seen the transformation of services that I described earlier. But the treatment needed for the NHS then, when the whole system was in intensive care, is not the same as the treatment it needs now. We are determined to move away from targets as we transform the NHS from a top-down bureaucracy to a bottom-up, self-improving organisation with power in the hands of patients, their advocates and, crucially, GPs and others in primary care and the staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70703-0014.htm_para30"><a name="07070358000127">Waiting lists and waiting times are at record low levels. The Government are on course to hit next year their 18-week target for the waiting time from GP referral to treatment. We have seen huge falls in deaths from heart disease and cancer. There are 80,000 more nurses and 35,000 more doctors, and there is better pay for our brilliant NHS staff. There are more than 100 new hospitals. That is what the Labour Government meant when we promised to save the NHS after 18 years of Tory neglect. Of course we must learn from mistakes and listen to our critics and, in particular, to those who work o n the front line, but our overriding principle must be what is in the best interests of patients. It is absurd to deny that our health service is in immeasurably better shape than it was 10 years ago. Under this Labour Government, it will continue to get better.</p>

I look forward to debating with him over the next few months. I hope that our relationship will be constructive, as well as combative, as is the way with these things. In the past few days, and indeed in the House this afternoon, we have heard the first of what I am sure will be a blizzard of initiatives from the new Prime Minister, but so far almost everything that we have heard has been about the process of government. That is all well and good, but what the people of this country are really looking for is solutions to the real problems that we face, and in particular to the problems that the Government and the Prime Minister have created in the past 10 years.</p>

It is noticeable that since Tony Blair announced his retirement at the end of April, we have heard a lot of talk from the new Prime Minister about how he will tackle problems such as the out-of-hours crisis in the national health service, even though he and his colleagues caused that crisis through their mishandling of the issue two years ago. I notice that there is one issue on which he has been as quiet as a church mouse, and on which there has been not a word. It is the issue on which, more than any other, the problems that this Government have created lie right at the Prime Minister&#146;s door&#151;our pensions crisis, not  <br>

 On contributions holidays, they certainly were introduced under the last Conservative Government, at a time when the stock market was roaring ahead and when Revenue rules permitted them, otherwise pension funds would have been overfunded on Revenue rules. The difference is that the pensions holidays were continued under the present Government at a time when the stock market was collapsing, and have been continued to this day by the Government. The parliamentary contributory pension fund, which I have the honour to chair, would be in surplus today if it had not been for the &#163;50 million that the Government have failed to put into it.</p>

Government. Tens of thousands of occupational pension schemes have closed, 125,000 people have been left high and dry without the pensions that they saved for or the retirements that they planned for, and all the while, as private sector occupational pensions collapsed, the unfunded cost of meeting public sector occupational pension commitments has soared.</p>

Will he list the offences that he would like to have taken into consideration? Is it the SERPS scandal, the removal of the earnings link, the promotion of state pension opt-outs, the orgy of pension mis-selling, the ineffectual Pensions Act 1995, or as my hon.

 That was an interestingly well read list. The most experienced analysis of the state of Britain&#146;s pension system from any member of the Government comes from the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, who is more experienced in this area than any member of the Front-Bench team. His judgment is that in 1997 our pensions system was in pretty good shape, so I will take no lessons from the Government about what happened before 1997, as they have done lasting damage to our pensions system since 1997. They have created a crisis of confidence in pension saving that must be addressed as a matter of urgency. It is one of the great challenges facing the Government.</p>

So I make no apology for raising the issue at the earliest opportunity. The truth is that pensions policy has been run from the Treasury since 1997. The new Prime Minister has to take personal responsibility for the decisions that have been made, and must give a personal lead in addressing the crisis that many pensioners and future pensioners face.</p>

Members know from the debates on the Pensions Bill, we have constantly sought to engage the Government in constructive dialogue about providing solutions to the problems in our pension system. I wait with interest to see how the Government respond to the amendments passed in the other place. My message to the Secretary of State is that we will continue to look constructively at proposals to continue the repair and mend job that has to be done to our pensions system. I hope that in return he will engage constructively with the Opposition on this most long-term of issues. Only by finding lasting solutions and building political consensus around them can public confidence in our pensions system be restored. But that will not change  <br>

When we made our change, we cut corporation tax by 2p, and when corporation tax is cut, companies are, of course, more profitable, which means that they can pay more in employer contributions to pension funds, their dividends rise and they can pay more dividends to pension funds. The reality is that the system of payable tax credits before 1997 represented a serious distortion in the tax system, encouraging companies to pay out their profits as dividends rather than retaining them for reinvestment in the business.</p>

Total contributions increased by 18 per cent. and total pension income increased by a further 15 per cent.

What actually happened after our package of corporation tax changes was that companies paid more in employer contributions, dividends rose, assets rose, and payments to pension funds rose from &#163;34 billion in 1996 to &#163;39 billion in 1999, and by 2006 the figure of &#163;71.3 billion was twice as much as it was under the Tories in 1996.</p>

the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell said earlier, such a fund would require unguaranteed interest-free loans from the taxpayer without any certainty that they could or would be repaid. Without such a guarantee that there are sufficient funds with unclaimed assets to cover those loans, that amounts to nothing more than an uncosted, open-ended spending commitment that could never be delivered. Indeed, the Conservatives cannot even agree on what the cost would be. The shadow Chancellor has claimed that there would be none. On 18 April 2007, he told Sky News:</p>

 Is it not true that, before the Conservatives tabled the motion, there was agreement across the House that we should use the unclaimed assets of banks and building societies?

 My right hon. Friend, in his usual razor-like way, has put the matter in the lap of the Conservatives by showing that their proposal does not stand up. They should genuinely seek a consensus with us about how to resolve the matter. That is what the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell should tell the individuals who suffered so badly.

If there has ever been a crisis in pensions, it was surely then. Many women were prevented from building a state pension entitlement in their own right; carers were similarly mistreated by a system predicated on a 19th century view of working lives and social relationships; millions were without access to occupational pensions; and the mis-selling of private pensions, overseen by the previous Conservative Government, was a national scandal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70703-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07070358000729">Meanwhile, the exceptional equity returns of the 1980s and 1990s allowed many defined benefit schemes to ignore the rapid rise in the underlying cost of their pension promises.

Far from it. Accelerated further by record demographic changes, the effects of the changing environment have been felt right across the world. In the US, for example, the number of defined benefit schemes have halved in fewer than 30 years, while direct contribution schemes have tripled. Australia has seen an 80 per cent. reduction in the number of workers covered by direct benefit schemes since the 1980s.</p>

First, we tackled pensioner poverty. Thanks to the pension credit, winter fuel payments and a 9 per cent. real-terms increase in the basic state pension, we have lifted more than 2 million pensioners out of absolute poverty. The measures in our Pensions Bill will take us even further, with a new settlement for women and carers and a restoration of the earnings link that was removed by the Conservatives in 1980.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70703-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07070358000735">Secondly, we took action to tackle the loss of confidence in the private pensions market&#151;one reason for that loss of confidence was the pensions mis-selling scandal that we inherited from the Conservatives. In 1997, less than 2 per cent. of pension mis-selling cases had been satisfactorily resolved; by the end of 2002, more than 99 per cent. of consumers with mis-selling claims had been compensated, with total compensation reaching &#163;11 billion. That &#163;11 billion was the bill for Tory incompetence and Tory injustice over pensions mis-selling.</p>

It was not accidental that we got into that mess, as I shall explain in a moment, and we must ensure that it is not repeated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70703-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07070358000744">Part of the muddle that we are now in is predicated on the legacy of pension contributions holidays. Those holidays were never on offer to workers themselves. A perverse contribution system was created whereby the Conservative Government introduced a pay-if-you-wish basis into pension schemes. That fundamentally broke the contractual link&#151;the social contract&#151;that had existed more or less since the end of the war, when it was assumed that it was an employer&#146;s duty to contribute to high-value, quality final salary pension schemes in the UK. The erosion and disappearance of that sense of duty alarms me, and that issue must be part of any new approach to a meaningful pensions framework for the 21st century. Unless we take that into account, we will find ourselves once again locked into the muddle that was created in 2002.</p>

money that was lost. That is because we were locked into a pensions framework that had become obsessed with the pursuit of equities. More money was chasing equities than there was meaningful value in the equity market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70703-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07070358000746">It was a certainty in the pensions industry that the bubble was going to burst. The only gamble was knowing when it would happen. When it burst, what disappeared was the real value of people&#146;s lifetime savings, and the contrast between our position in 2002-03 and our position 40 years earlier is stark. In 2003, 71 per cent. of pension savings were invested in equities, and 17 per cent. in UK national Government bonds. In 1962, by comparison, 51 per cent. of pension savings went into UK Government bonds. Those savings went into public investment in our infrastructure, but the truth about today&#146;s national requirements for reinvestment in infrastructure is that we would not need a single private finance initiative in the land if we returned to the prioritisation of meaningful investment in current and future infrastructure needs, rather than pursuing speculative activities on casino markets that will collapse at some point. The disappearance of that sanity and safety net provision is a tragic weakness&#151;an Achilles heel&#151;in the framework of pension thinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70703-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07070358000747">We have to restore confidence in our ability to direct our pension savings into secure pensions that will deliver not only pensions sufficient for people to retire on but quality-of-life dividends every year rather than speculative dividends in pursuit of goods that may, or may not, have any real value in the global marketplace. We must tackle, too, the issue of people whose pensions have been stolen. I am grateful for the Secretary of State&#146;s offer of a further meeting, because every time that Government claims are tested by independent judges in courts in the UK or in Europe or by the ombudsman, they do not stand up. We must bring some honesty to our claims because, so far, that has been missing. It is not true to say that the financial assistance scheme will deliver 80 per cent. of the core pension, because in practice the core pension deducts all inflation linking that workers were promised; it deducts the tax-free lump sum that they were promised; it deducts the revaluation that they were promised; it deducts many benefits to which widows were entitled; it deducts ill health and early retirement benefits; and it ignores the retirement age that was built into the scheme. Once all those entitlements have been deducted, 80 per cent. of the lowest figure is taken and 22 per cent. of tax is deducted at source. In reality, therefore, the 80 per cent. claimed figure becomes much less.</p>

Of the 125,000 people whose pensions were stolen, 10,000 have reached retirement age, of whom only just over 1,000 have received anything. So far, payments amounting to &#163;4 million have gone to pensioners, but &#163;5 million has gone to the people administering the scheme. It is barking mad to run a scheme if we end up paying less to contributors than to those who are charged with its administration.

If future generations of young people are to believe in the security of the system and contribute more to the collective pension pot it is important that we restore credibility. At the moment, their parents and grandparents tell them, &#147;It&#146;s a mug&#146;s game.&#148; The kids who are now entering employment and whom we are asking to contribute more have direct experience from their own homes, families, streets and communities, where people are saying, &#147;Don&#146;t do that.

 I am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate, and I should like to start by welcoming to their posts the new Secretary of State and the Minister of State with responsibility for pension reform, the hon. and learned Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien). In all parts of the House, there is a view that they are taking over from two very competent predecessors who helped to forge a pensions consensus on some aspects of pension reform; I do not say that without qualification, but I hope that the pensions consensus will last. It illustrates the political skill of both predecessors that one managed allegedly to say very rude things about the former Chancellor and still to be included in his Cabinet now that he is Prime Minister, while the other is now a Secretary of State at an early age. I wish the Secretary of State and the Minister all the best, as I do the new Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling). He comes to his role with a reputation as a parliamentary Rottweiler; he has had clashes in the past, and perhaps we will witness more in the future.</p>

Alexander) will take over from me from tomorrow morning. I can therefore make this speech rather more reflective in tone than it otherwise might have been, and more forward-looking in content without too much political knockabout.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07070358000754">One of the achievements of the predecessors of the new Secretary of State and Minister was to have forged the pensions consensus, along with Lord Turner and his excellent commissioners. How far that moved forward pensions policy is not to be underestimated. It required all three major political parties, and the minority parties, to accept the following changes to pensions policy, none of which was in their entirety in our 2005 manifestos: the increase in the pension state age, which was politically sensitive and economically important; the permanent restoration of the earnings link; the introduction of personal accounts and the acceptance that the state&#146;s role in second-tier provision would be lessened; the introduction of automatic enrolment; and the agreement on compulsory employer contributions. All of them are major changes, and I hope that they will last. They were the reasons we backed the Pensions Bill, notwithstanding the concerns we have about the detail of the reforms and our genuine worries that that might mean that, in spite of the agreement that we have, the pensions proposals prove not to be as successful in practice as Ministers hope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07070358000755">Today, rather than going back over some of the arguments about who did what in 1997 and 1998, which&#151;I agree with the Secretary of State&#151;are not the explanation for the downturn in occupational pensions and, in any case, do not seem to be relevant in terms of the implications for pension policy now, I wish to highlight three issues of future pension policy that should be of concern and interest to Ministers in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07070358000756">The first, and easiest to deal with, is the compensation for those people presently in the financial assistance scheme, which the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) mentioned. I was pleased to hear the comments by the Secretary of State today, although he has had only a short time to reflect on these matters. I hope that in the cautious and constructive way in which he made his comments about the financial assistance scheme and the Pension Protection Fund, he is signposting the fact that he will take the initiative in that area and bring to an end the long period, lasting a couple of years, in which the Government have ended up making major concessions, usually as a consequence of external pressure, from the other political parties and their own Back Benchers, the courts, the parliamentary ombudsman, the Public Administration Committee or&#151;at the moment, at least&#151;the other place. All that has meant not only that the Government have extracted the minimum possible political benefit from the largest possible economic concessions, but that those people who are waiting for decent and fair compensation have had to wait a very long time. As the Secretary of State will probably know already&#151;and if he does not, he will find out in time&#151;those waiting for a fair settlement feel great bitterness.</p>

three quarters of the way there through what has already been allocated. Many of us hope that the Government will, in the next couple of months, go the whole way. When we look at the remaining cost of delivering the rest of the reform, it is&#151;especially over a period of 50 or 60 years&#151;modest and affordable. The Secretary of State will already have noticed that the figures that his Department is using do not include any reduction in the cost of means-tested benefits or the revenues from taxation that would reduce the costs. That is the first issue and I hope that we will hear something positive on it from the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07070358000758">The second issue is in many ways the most important for the success of the Government&#146;s reforms. I have been teased on this point by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) who has been a Front-Bench spokesman on this issue for several years. He teased me about the potential parallel consensus between the consensus to which we are signed up to in the House and those areas of disagreement that we have constantly flagged up. I said to the hon. Gentleman the last time he raised that point that I entirely agree with him that there is a parallel consensus outside this place, and the Secretary of State and the Minister will also discover that. Although most hon. Members and, to some extent, those outside think that the main planks of pension reform are sensible, they also think that the excessive reliance on means-testing, which is still part of the system, will be a major problem for the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07070358000759">To the extent that those people are the existing generation of pensioners, they also feel that pension reform is irrelevant for them, because the earnings link will not be restored until 2012 or 2015. By that time, as many as a third of the existing pensioner population will no longer be with us, and the Secretary of State will discover that pensioners in the real world outside this place do not think that those &#147;great&#148; reforms are nearly as exciting as we do. I hope that the Secretary of State will not give up on the idea of persuading the Chancellor, no doubt at an appropriate moment in the electoral cycle, to consider bringing forward the restoration of the earnings link, because most people would regard that as sensible. It would also be very popular.</p>

 I am very interested in what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Although the restoration of the link is valuable, does he agree that it does nothing to improve the value of the basic state pension? Many people, especially those on low wages, rely on the basic state pension, but its value has fallen since the link was first broken by the Tories back in 1980.</p>

However, the problem is that we are building on a very low base: one suspects that the Chancellor signed off on the deal only because the figures for the cost of state pension reform show that, even in 2020, we will be spending a share of gross national product on the state pension architecture that is less than we spend today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07070358000763">The price that the Chancellor extracted is that we have a very low basic state pension, with the result that everyone who relies on pensioner credit and means-tested benefits will be in poverty. I hope that the new Secretary of State will not believe his Department&#146;s spin about pensioner poverty. It is true that it has declined considerably since 1997, but it is also true that Britain is one of the worst countries in the European league table when it comes to our residual level of pensioner poverty. The EU figures published by the Department in a written answer earlier this year show that almost a quarter of our pensioner population still lives in relative poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07070358000764">I hope that the Secretary of State will continue the process of pushing down pensioner poverty. In contrast, the formal position of the Government under his predecessor appeared to be that the decline in pensioner poverty had to be consolidated, but that it did not need to be taken further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07070358000765">A consensus does exist outside the House to the effect that, because we are building on such a low basic state pension, we may end up undermining the personal accounts that are so vital to pension reform. When the Secretary of State&#146;s predecessor announced his major pension proposals and the great consensus on pensions, he said to many people, both publicly and privately, that everything he was doing in respect of the state pension was designed to make personal accounts work. He added that the success or failure of all the reforms would be determined by whether personal accounts could be made to work. However, the fact that we are building on a very low basic state pension means that almost 50 per cent. of the people who are to be the target audience for personal accounts will face means-testing&#151;for pension credit and housing benefit, and for all the other means-tested benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para15"><a name="07070358000766">The promise offered by Lord Turner was very attractive, and the former Secretary of State offered it too, until he realised what he was saying and the size of the liabilities that he was building up for the future. The promise was that people would get back &#163;2 for every &#163;1 that they put into their personal accounts. It was a no-brainer, suggesting that everyone should have a personal account, but the promise simply cannot be delivered. It may be that some people&#151;perhaps 10 to 20 per cent.&#151;could end up not getting a decent return and even losing money if they go for a personal account, while a significant number will get returns of between &#163;1 and &#163;2 only for every &#163;1 that they put in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07070358000767">The people involved in personal accounts are likely to be on very low pay already, probably with high mortgage and credit card debt. Many, and especially the women among them, will be unable to predict their future work patterns, which means that they will not be confident about whether personal accounts are right for them. The problem for the Government is that, if they describe the risks in too much detail, the take-up of personal accounts could be very low, whereas if they do not describe the risks in enough detail they may end up being accused of Government-sponsored mis-selling that will come back to haunt us later on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para17"><a name="07070358000768">The answer must be to increase the basic state pension, but I suspect that Ministers will try to introduce changes such as trivial commutation to offset  <br>

some of the effects of means-testing. The result will be an extremely complex system, and the Pensions Policy Institute has said that the Government will also have to spend something like &#163;500 million on changing the rules. The total could come to more than &#163;1 billion, and all it will achieve is that less than a quarter of the people who might otherwise have been hit by means-testing will be removed from its effects. So solving the problem by changing the rules and allowing people to take lump sums rather than affecting their means-tested benefits could be messy, could dissuade people from saving and could undermine the personal accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07070358000769">In spite of the consensus on the major elements of pension reform, I cannot predict whether personal accounts will have been a success when we look back in 10 or 20 years. All of us know that in the great pensions consensus of the 1970s, there was not even a Division on the state earnings-related pension scheme. The Labour Government pushed it through and the Conservatives did not move on it. Only a handful of people were in the House. Only a few years later, because the scheme had not been well worked out, the whole thing unravelled. Our fear is that that might happen to personal accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07070358000770">The other big concern is about occupational pensions. There is an increasing gap between the private sector and the public sector, and there is a bitterness about it. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said in evidence to the Select Committee that it was about time that hon. Members on both sides of the House stopped rehearsing our prejudices about public sector pensions and started to focus on the substance of public sector pension reform. After all, many public sector pension schemes are affordable; others are not. Some, usually low-paid, public sector workers have lousy pensions. Usually higher-paid public sector workers, including MPs and judges, have good pension schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para20"><a name="07070358000771">We have argued that we ought to have a Turner-type independent commission to do what the Turner commission did and put the evidence in the public domain so that we can reform public sector pensions in a sensible, managed way rather than ending up reforming them in a hurry in five or 10 years because they have become unaffordable. We are watching carefully and so is the Conservative spokesman. Ministers know that the cost of public sector pensions is going up all the time. The Government have been holding back the latest set of statistics, presumably because the discount rates on the cost of public sector pensions will inflate the figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para21"><a name="07070358000772">I hope that, if the Government are trying to look to the Turner consensus as a basis for pensions reform, the Secretary of State will look at what Lord Turner said on 11 June in another place, when he was critical of the way in which the Government had handled public sector pension reform. He said:</p>

rather bad deal as a consequence of the way in which the unions have negotiated, will suffer. Women who have had many career breaks and are existing members of public sector pension schemes may lose their right to retire at 60, whereas men who stay on will be able to keep it. There are all sorts of aspects which are not simple issues of right and left.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para23"><a name="07070358000774">The final aspect of occupational pensions that worries me a lot comes back in some ways to the point that the hon. Member for Nottingham, South made. With the exception of a lot of well-paid people in the public sector, including MPs, an immense risk transfer is going on in pensions. In the past, many of us could rely on public sector pension schemes, private sector pension schemes and state pension schemes that delivered not just the basic state pension but some kind of earnings-related pension. That meant that many not very financially literate or affluent people could rely on a second pension, often from their employer. In the future, we shall be asking many of those people to provide for themselves through a defined contribution scheme that few of them will understand, will involve a lot of market risk and will be uncertain in relation to the impact of means-testing. We are already seeing a levelling down of employer contributions and an axing of salary-related pension schemes. There is a real risk as a consequence that we will have a generation in 20 or 30 years retiring on really inadequate pensions, including those people who will be saving in personal accounts, who will be saving nothing like enough if they are saving at the default extremely low rates, which will produce inadequate returns for people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07070358000775">The hon. Member for Nottingham, South was right to say that much pension provision in the past was based to some extent on employers&#146; perceptions of their responsibility. Given the way they have suffered recently from what has happened to pension schemes and the enormous amount of money they have had to put in, they will understandably be happy to wash their hands of that responsibility. Many of them will be happy to reduce their contribution rates to the personal account level, to as little as they can get away with, which will be devastating, especially for people who will have to rely on personal accounts, because they will probably be the least able to manage their finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="70703-0018.htm_para25"><a name="07070358000776">As well as making personal accounts as accessible and easy to use as possible, and not prone to employers&#146; dodging, I hope the Government will talk to businesses and others about what they can do to maintain good occupational schemes&#151;perhaps not final salary schemes, but salary-related schemes. All is not necessarily lost for those schemes, but there is a risk that the introduction of personal accounts will lead to a further stampede out of occupational pensions in a way that we may regret in the future.</p>

 I shall be brief, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para0"><a name="07070358000781">This evening, we bid farewell to the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) just as the Leader of the Opposition moves someone who is generally regarded as a Rottweiler into the shadow portfolio. Tomorrow, there will be a new Liberal Democrat Front-Bench spokesman, so it will be interesting to discover which party leader made the right decision when we reflect on matters at the election. However, I welcome the new Front-Bench spokesmen, the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling), who leads for the Opposition, and in particular I welcome my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I should like to give both of them a message and I shall address the Conservative Opposition first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para1"><a name="07070358000782">The thrust of the motion, although perhaps not the content of the speech made by the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell, was about restoring confidence in pensions. I have a suggestion that the Opposition might like to think seriously about if they want to restore confidence. In this Parliament, they have as yet issued no set of proposals about welfare reform, let alone pension reform. The decision they have to make is where they draw the line between what risks individuals should bear for their pension provision and what risks we should collectively bear. I suggest that the key dividing line is a pension scheme in the future that ensures that everybody who plays their part fully in society receives a pension that takes them out of means-testing when they retire. The risks involved should be shared by all of us. It is of course desirable that people should have more than that for their pension provision, but that is not a concern for taxpayers&#151;bearing that risk is for individuals themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07070358000783">My Government have not yet made that division, so my second piece of advice is addressed to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in the decisions he faces. I want to focus on the role of personal accounts. My right hon. Friend was right to say that not everybody has been covered by occupational schemes. There has been a huge number of poor and desperately poor people, and the Labour Government have redistributed more resources for poorer pensioners than any Administration since we established the state retirement pension. The Government deserve huge credit for that, but they way in which they achieved the goal is unstable. They did it largely on the basis of the pension credit, which is means-tested. Therefore, perhaps 40 per cent. of our electors do not know whether it will pay them to save or whether, if they do save, they will be substantially better off. If they are not better off because they are covered by the pension credit, they will see other people who did not bother to save receiving an income through means-testing that is equal to, if not greater than, the one that they end up with. For the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) outlined, the message not to save has gone out to people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para3"><a name="07070358000784">I therefore hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will return to the decision that we make about how adequate the first tier of pension should be if we are then to rely on people building on it through their own efforts. If we do not do that, I will put things much stronger than the hon. Member for Yeovil. I see a mega mis-selling scandal coming up the tracks and we will not be able to blame the Legal and General or the Pru. The House will have put in place what is euphemistically called &#147;soft compulsion&#148;, making people save for schemes that may pay them little or, as the hon. Gentleman said, nothing.</p>

 Or worse, as my hon. Friend says. In that scenario, we will face the worst of all possible outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07070358000787">That is my advice to those on both Front Benches, but may I sound a note of caution about us as politicians? It is undoubtedly true that occupational pensions have been the Crown jewels of our pension system and that previous Members of Parliament thought that they were far too good for just a few workers. They thought, &#147;We must spread them to their dependants and we must have widows benefits and orphans benefits.&#148; We put a strain on occupational schemes that employers never thought would be there when they began to build up the schemes. With the Opposition insisting on tax changes, we ran down the surpluses, and while my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State mounted a great defence of the advance corporation tax changes, my guess with hindsight is that if we had our time again we would not make that change now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para5"><a name="07070358000788">I merely emphasise that this wonderful place, the House of Commons, sometimes gets a fit of self-righteousness and starts legislating in a way that is improper, and we have done that with occupational pensions. I hope that we are about to enter a deadly serious phase of the debate in which the Opposition address the key question of where we draw the line between when risks should be pooled and when risks should be taken by individuals. I hope that with the new brief that my right hon. Friend has, he will look carefully at how the personal accounts that have to play such a key role in our long-term reforms do not land us with the charge of state mis-selling at the end of the day.</p>

 It has been a thoughtful debate, but there are fundamental problems that we need to address. The principal difficulties with the funding of occupational pensions are partly the additional benefits that the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) has identified, but largely increased longevity coupled with a terrible shortage of index-linked gilt securities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07070358000790">The hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) mentioned the desirability of further investment in Government securities, but the real yield on index-linked gilts today is below 1 per cent. That is incredibly low, but we have been forcing pension funds  <br>

to go into such investments since my party introduced the Pensions Act 1995 and the minimum funding requirement, which I opposed at the time. That has partly contributed to the problem. The huge stock market crash a few years ago was a phenomenon that always happens in equity markets: they go up and down, but overall the direction of the yield is pretty firmly upwards&#151;as is logical in a free western economy. So, the stock market is not the cause of the problem. It is the concentration on index-linked gilts, as being the only way of delivering a pensions promise, that has been a terrible mistake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07070358000791">I will deal first with state pensions. The present level of the state pension is much too low and the state pension is very unfair to women. I think that 32 per cent. of all women have no pension and almost 4 million have less than a full pension. The Government have tried to address that and I pay tribute to them for some of the things that they have done in recent pensions legislation, which is improving the situation. However, until we move to a pension at a decent level&#151;not one that provides any luxury, but one that at least offers some sort of standard of living for those who would otherwise not benefit&#151;we are not a civilised society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para8"><a name="07070358000792">The link to earnings must be restored. The Government have said that they will do that, but one wonders when. When pressed, they said, &#147;Well, we hope to do it by 2012.&#148; However, there is not even a firm promise for 2012 and by the time we get to 2012 a lot of my constituents, and those of other right hon. and hon. Members, may well no longer be here to benefit from the change. I know that people will say that it is not affordable, but there are ways in which it can be made affordable and the Government have latched on to one of them, which is to increase the pension age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para9"><a name="07070358000793">If people are going to live longer and longer&#151;as they are thanks to improvements in our medical knowledge and our NHS&#151;we will have to accept that they will probably have to work longer in order to be able to pay for that. That is happening not just here, but in Scandinavia and the United States. It is a reality of increased longevity that increasing the pension age will be the only way to pay for decent pensions in retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para10"><a name="07070358000794">Having so many pensioners on means-tested benefits is rather demeaning for them. I know that pension credit is well meaning, but it is intrusive. About 1.7 million people who are entitled to it do not claim it, partly because of the level of intrusion that they feel it involves. I think that the solution is to increase the pension to some sort of a living wage, without any means-testing, and to pay for that by increasing the retirement age&#151;ultimately, possibly from 67, which is what has been proposed, to 70. We can restore people&#146;s dignity in that way. Perhaps we can also look at clamping down further on sickness benefits and early retirement, which I will come to later, because there are problems in both the public and the private sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07070358000795">When looking at where we are going, we must look in particular at what is happening in the public sector, of which we are a part. Unfortunately, many of the public sector schemes are totally unfunded. As such, we are mortgaging the future of our children and grandchildren. That is not a responsible way to go  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="3 July 2007">

forward. Although we have schemes where there is no contribution or only a very small contribution, that is not a direction in which we can go in the long term. We need known levels of funding from the Exchequer and reasonable levels of funding from those participating in the schemes. That cannot happen overnight because people have contracts of employment; it will only happen in the future, after there has been change to the basis and structure of public sector schemes, but I think that it can be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07070358000796">We are already doing some of what is necessary. In some areas of the public sector, the levels of contribution are quite high. Certainly, changes that have been made to fire service schemes, police schemes and armed services schemes have led to substantial contributions being paid. To its credit, the House voted for a substantial increase to its contributions, too, and we now pay 10 per cent., which is far more than is paid in most public sector schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para13"><a name="07070358000797">In the rest of the public sector, we have to consider the retirement age. For Members of Parliament, the earlier retirement age ends in 2009, whereas for the rest of the public sector we suggested that it do so in 2013, so I hope that we have set an example that can be followed. Public sector transfer clubs need to end because they are costly to the public sector. Such arrangements do not exist in the private sector&#151;if a person transfers to another scheme in the private sector, they get what their lump of money will buy as they enter the new scheme. It is wrong that we should give the public sector and, indeed, ourselves privileges that do not exist in the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para14"><a name="07070358000798">I agree that personal accounts are an extremely good idea, but they need to be built on because a total of 8 per cent. will not give anyone a very substantial salary. There will be a problem if we retain pension credits, because as the right hon. Member for Birkenhead said, as long as we maintain means-tested benefits there will be a serious problem with possible claims of mis-selling. People will say, &#147;Why did I bother to save when it simply means that I will be disqualified from state benefits?&#148; There may be ways of overcoming that; for example, there could be an increased level of disregard for income under that structure. There could also be a capital disregard for relatively small pots of pensions money. We will have to look hard at the issue if we are to escape the problems of mis-selling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para15"><a name="07070358000799">I wanted to deal with the problem relating to the purchase of annuities, but that will have to be left for another day. I simply suggest that there may be alternatives that would still give protection to the Treasury&#151;indeed, they would actually increase its total revenue&#151;but that would not take us away from the idea that there needs to be a pot of money from which people draw their pensions.</p>

 In High Peak, we see the effectiveness of the Government&#146;s commitment to securing sustainable occupational pensions. In Chapel-en-le-Frith, there is the largest of the 12 British plants of the American-owned company, Federal Mogul, which is one of this country&#146;s premier producers of brake linings for a wide range of vehicles. The name of the original company, Ferodo, is synonymous with  <br>

<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2007 : Column 916</b><br>
excellence in the world of brake linings. It was established about 100 years ago, but for most of its life, Ferodo was part of the British company Turner and Newall, but it was taken over, pension fund and all, by Federal Mogul in the early 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para16"><a name="07070358000801">To understand why the Turner and Newall pension fund has become such a hot potato in recent years, we must look at what was happening to the company at the turn of the 21st century. By that time, the company had awarded itself 15 years of pension contribution holidays in the previous 25 years, on both Turner and Newall&#146;s watch and, latterly, Federal Mogul&#146;s watch. Yet the fund was still viable, still operating and absolutely huge. In 2001, the company went into administration to protect itself from bankruptcy. The reasons for that had nothing at all to do with the British operation of Federal Mogul.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para17"><a name="07070358000802">What was happening was that thousands of claims for damage to people&#146;s health from exposure to asbestos were being lodged in the American courts. Many of those claims were held by the company to be spurious, but some courts&#151;one in Memphis was especially permissive&#151;were allowing millions and millions of dollars worth of claims, to the extent that the viability of the company was being called into question. I do not want to belittle the asbestos issue for a moment. Those whose health has genuinely suffered from exposure to asbestos should be compensated, but in the litigious atmosphere of the United States the claims were excessive, and the company claims that the courts were deciding unreasonably against it. Its business interests got protection from bankruptcy by putting the whole of Federal Mogul, the international company, into administration under American law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para18"><a name="07070358000803">What no one predicted then was that that would make it impossible for the Turner and Newall fund to operate under British law once the company came out of administration. In July 2004 the company concluded that the pension fund was not compliant with British insolvency law and the fund would have to close. It was not close to collapse. It was, as I said, huge&#151;over &#163;1 billion in size, from memory&#151;but the law said that if the fund was not big enough to cover all its potential liabilities, the company could not be released from insolvency. That is a sensible law, in principle, although in this case, the chances of all the fund&#146;s liabilities being called in at once were infinitely small.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para19"><a name="07070358000804">What did that mean? It meant that my constituents, the Turner and Newall pensioners, were looking at a pension of only about 8p for every pound that they would otherwise have expected to receive. There was no safety net. There was no protection. The financial assistance scheme was coming into existence, but it was tiny. It would not cover Turner and Newall&#146;s liabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para20"><a name="07070358000805">That summer I, along with other right hon. and hon. Members, met Ministers to discuss the potential failure of one of the very biggest pension schemes in the whole country. Fortunately for us, at that time the Pensions Bill was going through Parliament. It created the Pension Protection Fund, a vehicle almost tailor-made for the Turner and Newall situation. We made sure that Ministers were fully aware of the situation and the consequences, should that fund fail.</p>

and taking a levy from the pensions industry, the PPF would provide a 100 per cent. payment of existing pensioners&#146; pensions and typically 90 per cent. of future ones, albeit frozen at that level and capped then at &#163;25,000 a year. These restrictions add to the stability of the PPF and they are a small price to pay for pensions being saved at all. The only problem that we saw with the PPF in 2004 was that it would not start until 2006. The Turner and Newall fund had to limp on. With injections of cash from the company, it was able to raise its offer to pension fund members to 50p or 60p in the pound, far better than 8p, but nothing like as good as the PPF potential offer would be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para22"><a name="07070358000807">Meanwhile, I continued to act on behalf of my constituents, the largest single group of Turner and Newall pensioners in the country. I co-ordinated the work of an ad hoc cross-party group of MPs, working closely with the trade unions. I presented a national petition to Parliament in support of the Turner and Newall pensioners. I arranged for fund members, including union representatives from my constituency, to meet the American chairman of Federal Mogul to express their grievances here in Parliament. I invited the then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to Chapel-en-le-Frith to meet aggrieved members of the fund. I spoke at a national rally of occupational pension fund members in Brighton, and I continued to lobby Ministers, the fund&#146;s independent trustee appointed by the courts, the administrators of the company, the PPF itself and others to ensure that the interests of my constituents were paramount. In short, I was doing my job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para23"><a name="07070358000808">The Turner and Newall fund is undergoing an 18-month assessment to see how the PPF would work. The independent trustee has to satisfy himself, by law, that there is no better alternative available before he will be allowed to take the fund into the PPF, but he will not get a better offer. It is irresponsible of some campaigners on the issue, not least a certain Conservative councillor, Councillor Bingham of Chapel-en-le-Frith, to go round suggesting that a better alternative to the PPF is there for the taking. The implication from local Tories in my constituency is that taxpayers&#146; money will be used to save failed pension funds under a Tory Government. That is in direct contradiction to the edict of the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) and it is misleading. It will not happen.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to take part in the debate. I feel like a greybeard in this company of new rising stars on the Government Front Bench and departing stars on the Liberal Benches. I begin by adding my own warm welcome to the new Secretary of State&#151;I hope that he knows what he is taking on&#151;and the new Minister of State. The revolving door that has all too often been the Department for Work and Pensions in recent years has not always been a happy place for Ministers. Since 1997, we have seen seven Secretaries of State, and since I was appointed to this position, I have shadowed no fewer than four Ministers. I am particularly pleased that we had the usual distinguished and thoughtful contribution from a former Minister, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). I genuinely wish the new Ministers well in tackling the continuing pensions crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para26"><a name="07070358000812">In recent days, the new Prime Minister has spoken of little else but change. In a short speech at the door to No. 10, he must have mentioned the word eight or nine times. We have heard, and no doubt will continue to hear, of a number of new initiatives across a range of policy areas, but what has been totally missing&#151;unless I have failed to spot it&#151;is any mention of pensions. This is all the more surprising because polling shows that this is a failure for which most voters hold the former Chancellor to blame. I am pleased that we had the usual authoritative contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill), and we also heard from the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) who has been through the Turner and Newall saga from start to finish, as he described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para27"><a name="07070358000813">But when it comes to long-term pensions reform, we Conservatives have taken a wholly responsible and non-partisan position. We have broadly accepted the conclusions of Lord Turner and his colleagues and gone along with the Government on gradually increasing the state pension age, on help for carers especially women, and on restoring the link with earnings for the state pension. Indeed it would have been churlish not to do so given that those were mostly our last election manifesto. In short, we have worked hard to build a genuine consensus on pensions, and I see no reason why that should not continue to be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70703-0019.htm_para28"><a name="07070358000814">We have also given our broad support to the proposals for personal accounts.

Those were means testing; the risk of levelling down existing pension provision with the introduction of personal accounts; the potential for mis-selling; and the issue of confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para0"><a name="07070358000816">On mis-selling, I am very much on the same wavelength as the right hon. Member for Birkenhead. There is a real issue here, and the Secretary of State will not yet have had time to absorb this kind of detail, but his attention will no doubt be drawn to the conclusions of the Pensions Policy Institute and the crucial differences between its research as to the likely level of means-testing after the reforms and the Government&#146;s own projections. Again, the crucial difference between the two models is that the PPI model takes account of housing benefit and the Government model does not, which relates to the effects on people who rent in retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para1"><a name="07070358000817">I shall come on to issues of confidence in a minute, but I want to deal with the valedictory remarks of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)&#151;for all I know, my remarks may be valedictory, but nobody has informed me yet. Although the Liberal position may improve or change with the arrival of the new spokesman, it is at best confusing and at worst likely to discourage pension saving. The Liberal Democrats want to abolish tax relief for pension contributions, certainly for higher rate taxpayers. It is the only party, apart from the Government, which backs the continuation of compulsory annuitisation. It is still peddling its idea of a citizens pension, which is unworkable, unaffordable and a total non-starter, because no major party is prepared to do it. I say in a caring way to the hon. Member for Yeovil that the Liberal Democrats have consistently placed themselves outside a serious and responsible consensus on long-term pensions reform. We will see whether the new broom produces different results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para2"><a name="07070358000818">The crucial priority for any Government must be to restore confidence in pensions saving. How can we expect younger workers to save for their retirement, when almost every week they see bad news stories about people who have lost their pensions? Shortly before the new Prime Minister relinquished his iron grip on the Treasury, he was taken to task in this House for his &#163;5 billion-a-year raid on pension funds. Was he embarrassed, abashed or apologetic? Not a bit of it. He said:</p>
<a name="70703-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="07070358001410"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I tell the House that I do not apologise&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 17 April 2007; Vol. 459, c. 176.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para3"><a name="07070358000820">He went on to say:</p>
<a name="70703-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="07070358000821"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We made the right decision&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 17 April 2007; Vol. 459, c. 183.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para4"><a name="07070358000822">That was a slap in the face for the 125,000 victims who lost all or most of their pensions through no fault of their own. However, we must not forget that absolutely everyone with a pension scheme has lost because of the &#163;100 billion or more that the Chancellor has stripped from their retirement savings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para5"><a name="07070358000823">Having created the problem in large measure, the then Chancellor was happy to leave those people without help or to the tender mercies of the failed financial assistance scheme. As my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) has said, the latest FAS annual report was sneaked out on the very day that the new Prime Minister took office. It is a dismal and depressing document, cementing the impression that the FAS is a failing, incompetent and useless organisation. In some two years, it has succeeded in getting payments to little more than 1,000 pensioners, but no fewer than 10,000 victims are  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="3 July 2007">

already eligible for help. Amazingly, the FAS spent more on running itself, &#163;4 million, than it paid out, &#163;3.5 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para6"><a name="07070358000824">The former Chancellor, among others, continues to claim that victims will get 80 per cent. of their entitlement, but that is patently untrue. The Secretary of State fell into the same trap himself, although perhaps with more excuse, when he discussed 80 per cent. of &#147;core expected pension&#148;. &#147;Expected pension&#148; is a lot more than &#147;core expected pension&#148;, which has been introduced through the FAS. Most people will get half of what they expected to get.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07070358000825">As has been said, the Government have been told on several occasions by the ombudsman, the European Court, the Select Committee and the High Court that there has been maladministration, and they are now appealing the High Court decision. However, they are still ignoring the legitimate demands of the pension victims. The Government will have another opportunity to right that wrong, because the Lords has voted in favour of the cross-party amendments setting up a lifeboat fund, which would provide PPF-level compensation for those victims. Back-Bench Labour MPs who have constituents in this predicament, or who just want to see justice done, will soon have the opportunity to do something about it. The hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson), who speaks with great knowledge on these matters, made a similar point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07070358000826">If removing dividend tax credit was such a great idea, why did the Chancellor fight for those two long years to resist the freedom of information request from <i> The Times</i>? Why did we also hear from the former Chancellor, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), that he had had this very idea put to him by officials and had decided not to do it? It is incredible that when questioned in this House by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride), the Chancellor said, with effortless effrontery:</p>
<a name="70703-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="07070358001411"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I support the release of the papers.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 17 April 2007; Vol. 459, c. 183.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para9"><a name="07070358000827">Presumably it was some other Chancellor who had fought so hard to keep them secret. It was a bit like the prisoner on his climb up to the gallows declaring his enthusiastic support for the death penalty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para10"><a name="07070358000828">Ministers should hang their heads in shame at their persistent refusal to draw a line under this scandal and help to give long-term pensions reform a fresh start. The new Secretary of State has a clean slate. He can choose to look at this matter again; in some ways, he suggested that he would. If the former Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, wants to have a honeymoon with 100 days of spectacularly popular announcements, this would be a very good start. If not, it is difficult to disagree with the conclusion of <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> when it said that on this issue the new Prime Minister</p>
<a name="70703-0020.htm_brev3"><a name="07070358001412"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is not fit to lead, not fit to govern and not fit to be trusted.&#148;</p>

 Let me begin by welcoming the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) to his new position. I wish the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) well in the reshuffle that appears to be  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="3 July 2007">

<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2007 : Column 921</b><br>
under way; we understand these matters ourselves. I also wish well the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), who gave us his valedictory speech. It was a thoughtful speech, and I shall certainly bear in mind many of the points that he made in his interesting reflections on matters that he has raised while he has been a Liberal Democrat spokesperson on pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para11"><a name="07070358000830">Having listened to the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell make his opening speech as a Front-Bench spokesperson on pensions, it looks as though there is a greater degree of difference between us than that which unites us. In fact, his speech was a lot of partisan knockabout. The reality is that we agree on many of the things that we need to agree on as regards the future of pensions. It is right that we should, because, over time&#151;over decades&#151;Governments might change their colour, and hence a consensus on long-term pension policy is a crucial obligation on all political parties. That consensus has been built up, across a range of issues, around the Turner report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07070358000831">I welcome the extent of the agreement that exists, certainly between the two main parties. I also welcome the comments by the hon. Member for Yeovil about wanting the consensus to be built up. I hope that that view is shared by his colleague, the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander), whom I welcome to his Front-Bench position. I hope that he, too, will feel that he can participate in building that long-term consensus. As we continue to do that, I look forward, in the coming weeks and months, to meeting the various stakeholder groups, and indeed the Opposition parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para13"><a name="07070358000832">However, there are disagreements between us and it is right that the debate should reflect on and deal with them. First, let me comment on some of the points that were made during the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) was right to claim, in a challenging and powerful speech, that the tax changes in 1997 were about strengthening investment. He raised a range of issues about the financial assistance scheme and the number of people who have been assisted by it so far. We are anxious to bring more people into the scheme and ascertain whether we can get more people assisted by it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07070358000833">We need information from some of the trustees of schemes to ensure that we have sufficient detail to start making payments. That has been a problem, but we have now simplified some of the information requests that are made to the schemes to ensure that compliance is easier. Through officials in the Department, we have been trying to meet representatives of the schemes to ascertain whether we can get them to participate more fully so that we can achieve precisely what my hon. Friend wants: more people able to be helped by the FAS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07070358000834">My hon. Friend raised a couple of other issues, which I shall tackle briefly. He said that the FAS benefits did not include revaluation, indexation or survivor benefits. However, they protect pensions against inflation until the age of 65. The survivor benefits are paid at 50 per cent. of FAS entitlement. Given that FAS is a sort of top-up, some of the non-core benefits may therefore be included in the annuity that the pension scheme pays.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para17"><a name="07070358000836">I hope that we can engage with some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill) in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07070358000837">My hon.

I declare an interest in that I, too, have constituents who are directly affected by that matter&#151;they work in Coventry. I look forward to meeting him to discuss those issues. I pay tribute to his work in leading the fight for the Turner and Newall pension fund members to ensure that they get a better deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07070358000838">The Opposition&#146;s original title for the debate was &#147;Crisis in Pensions&#148;. The Pensions Commission stated in its executive report:</p>
<a name="70703-0020.htm_brev4"><a name="07070358001413"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;On average, current pensioners are as well provided relative to average earnings as any previous generation, and many will continue to be well provided over the next 15 years. There is therefore no general and immediate crisis.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para20"><a name="07070358000839">When we came to office, our first priority was to tackle pensioner poverty. Nearly one third of pensioners were living in relative poverty. Compared with the policies that we inherited in 1997, we now spend more than &#163;11 billion extra on pensioners. Around half of that goes to the poorest third of pensioners. Consequently, more than 1 million pensioners have been lifted out of relative poverty for the first time in a generation. Pensioners are no more likely to be poor than any other group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para21"><a name="07070358000840">Our second challenge was to improve the security of private pensions. That included dealing with the pensions mis-selling scandal and the impact of the falling stock market on occupational pension schemes. We introduced the Pension Protection Fund, which offers security to more than 12 million members of occupational schemes and provides compensation if their employers become insolvent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para22"><a name="07070358000841">The pensions regulator helps protect members&#146; benefits and promote the good administration of workplace schemes. The significantly expanded FAS will help to some extent those who have lost their workplace pensions before the PPF was established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para23"><a name="07070358000842">Let me deal with some of the concerns about the FAS. The scheme provides critical support for those who have lost their pensions. As a result of the Budget announcement, the newly expanded scheme will support all the 125,000 people whose occupational pension schemes were affected by employer insolvency before the PPF was created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para24"><a name="07070358000843">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State explained in his opening speech, we would like to go further if funding can be found from other sources. We invite contributions to the current review for viable and sustainable solutions. As hon. Members know, the review will examine whether the alternative treatment of the residual funds in affected schemes could compliment the &#163;8 billion that the Government have committed, supplementing the increased support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para25"><a name="07070358000844">We look forward to the results of that review and we will all return to the Chamber later this month to debate the Pensions Bill. I hope that we will all agree  <br>

that sustainable, affordable, effective and deliverable solutions provide the only realistic and responsible way to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para26"><a name="07070358000845">We have been asked why we will not support the lifeboat fund or the lifeboat proposals that came from the other place. Let me be clear that the Government want to get the right money to people who have lost their pensions. We have already committed &#163;8 billion of taxpayers&#146; money to the financial assistance scheme and we have set up a review led and advised by experts. Putting the FAS on a par with the benefits offered by the PPF is simply unaffordable. Such a policy would effectively increase costs by a third. We do not believe that the taxpayer should be expected to provide high levels of compensation for schemes run by private employers. It would not be right to put FAS recipients in the same position through taxpayers&#146; money as those whose schemes contribute to the PPF by way of a levy. We are not averse to the idea of making more money available if it is feasible, but at this stage, we do not know what assets, if any, are available. It seems sensible to find that out before putting any proposals forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para27"><a name="07070358000846">There are clear objections to the proposals coming from the other place. First, the lifeboat proposals depart from the principle that evidence should guide policy. We need evidence of what is available and how it can be accessed before we start putting legislation in place that obliges us to access funds. The noble Lord Turnbull described the proposal in the other place as rather like introducing a dangerous dogs Act without finding out where the dangerous dogs are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para28"><a name="07070358000847">Secondly, it is simplistic merely to claim that unclaimed pension assets without clear ownership are some sort of windfall gain to insurance companies. We need to think carefully about the implications of that, but the proposals from the other place do not deal with that at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para29"><a name="07070358000848">The third objection is, of course, equity. The lifeboat will take from existing policyholders a long-term part of their gain. The Association of British Insurers described it as robbing Peter to pay Paul. As Lord Turnbull said, it might be that some of the Pauls are better off than the Peters. Once again, the issue needs to be looked into with a great deal more care than has been demonstrated by the Conservatives&#151;and, indeed, the Liberal Democrats&#151;in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="70703-0020.htm_para30"><a name="07070358000849">The lifeboat proposals require the state to take away somebody else&#146;s property. In other instances, we call that taxation. The noble Lord Turnbull suggested that the Conservatives, after complaining loudly about stealth taxes and pension grabs, now seem to be supporting a proposal that exposes them to exactly the same charge&#151;of imposing a Tory stealth tax. They need to be much more careful about what they are supporting.</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I have noticed that motion 5 would have discharged the Secretary of State for Justice from the Modernisation Committee and replaced him with the new Leader of the House. Many people on both sides of the House are concerned that someone who has such a party role could be appointed as Leader of the House and Chairman of the Modernisation Committee. Have you, Madam Deputy Speaker, heard why the motion has not been moved tonight and whether that is due to concerns about the role of the Leader of the House?</p>

 I am pleased to have secured the opportunity to mark in the House the 250th anniversary of the birth of Thomas Telford. I see this Adjournment debate as a contribution to the celebration of the life and legacy of an outstanding man, not just of his time but as one whose work has shaped his profession to this day and many of whose engineering feats are still in use centuries later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="70703-0021.htm_para8"><a name="0707044000511">There is absolutely no doubt that Scotland would not be the place it is today without Thomas Telford. His work literally opened up the highlands with more than 900 miles of new roads, hundreds of bridges, ferry landing piers and dozens of churches. Indeed, the work enabled the transportation of goods and people across the whole of Scotland, facilitating many aspects of the industrial revolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="70703-0021.htm_para9"><a name="0707044000512">Today, we take it for granted that motorways, bridges and canals exist. We do not stop to consider that planning these transport networks and many aspects of the methodology of construction were visualised hundreds of years before. Telford&#146;s Glasgow-to-Carlisle road, of which many parts remain, runs through my constituency and was the equivalent of the modern M74 motorway which is only now being completed between Gretna and Carlisle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="70703-0021.htm_para10"><a name="0707044000513">Although this debate is taking place hundreds of miles from Telford&#146;s birthplace at Glendinning at Westerkirk in the Dumfriesshire part of my constituency, it is taking place only a few hundred yards from his final resting place in Westminster Abbey&#151;a mark of the esteem in which he is held and an honour bestowed on only one other civil engineer: Robert Stephenson, who pioneered the railways. Telford stamped his presence on civil engineering and is more than worth the set of stamps that the Royal Mail is producing this year. His legacy to his profession was in the standards he set for a reliable system of estimates, contracts, specifications and tenders, which are as relevant today as they were in the 1800s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="70703-0021.htm_para11"><a name="0707044000514">In our time, when social mobility is the subject of much debate, Thomas Telford&#146;s achievement was that he rose from being the son of a shepherd on a remote Dumfriesshire hillside to being the most lauded and esteemed civil engineer in the empire. His poet friend Robert Southey termed him the &#147;Colossus of Roads&#148;. That is just one reason why I would like to see the Government in Westminster and the Scottish Government in Edinburgh do more to promote recognition of the achievements of Telford and people of his ilk, who did so much to shape the modern world in the final centuries of the last millennium.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="70703-0021.htm_para12"><a name="0707044000515">Ahead of the debate, I had the opportunity to speak to Scotland&#146;s new Culture Minister, Linda Fabiani MSP, and was encouraged by her acceptance that Scotland could do better in promoting the life and legacy of such people as Telford, who leave a permanent footprint on our way of life and remain a lasting influence over Scotland, the United Kingdom and the rest of the world. I want to make the same plea  <br>

to the Minister on a United Kingdom basis because, with his works in Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland, Telford was truly a great Briton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="70703-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0707044000516">To understand the motivations of such a man, we need to accept and appreciate where he came from. Telford was born on 9 August 1757. His father was a herdsman on the sheep farm of Glendinning at Westerkirk. It was and remains a remote and isolated area. It is farmed today by Lorraine Luesher, who works hard to keep the tradition of hill farming alive in Eskdale and who has produced a booklet on the Telford legacy. His father died weeks after his birth and so his mother Janet brought up Thomas. The close-knit local community supported the boy, who was known as &#147;laughing Tam&#148; for his good nature. As a youngster, he attended Westerkirk school and much of his early life was spent working as a shepherd on neighbouring farms, and with his widowed mother.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="70703-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0707044000517">After leaving school, Telford looked for work that offered decent prospects. His family were able to get him placed as an apprentice mason. His first master treated him very cruelly and Telford ran away, but his cousin Thomas Jackson found him work with Andrew Thomson, a Langholm mason. The Duke of Buccleuch was improving his estate at that time and Telford was kept busy, becoming a journeyman mason earning 18d a day. As he himself said,</p>
<a name="70703-0021.htm_brev6"><a name="0707044000555"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I ever congratulate myself upon the circumstances which compelled me to begin by working with my own hands, and thus to acquire early experience of the habits and feelings of workmen&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="70703-0021.htm_para15"><a name="0707044000518">During this time, Telford met Miss Pasley, whose books he was able to borrow. He became a voracious reader. He described his studies in the following way:</p>
<a name="70703-0021.htm_brev7"><a name="0707044000556"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I read, and read, and glowred; then read and read again.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="70703-0021.htm_para16"><a name="0707044000519">At the age of 23, Telford considered himself to be the master of his art and went to Edinburgh. Although he lived much of his adult life away from his place of birth, he always thought fondly of it, writing in his autobiography:</p>
<a name="70703-0021.htm_brev8"><a name="0707044000557"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I still recollect with pride and pleasure my native parish of Westerkirk.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="70703-0021.htm_para17"><a name="0707044000520">In Edinburgh, he studied drawing and its application to architecture. In 1782, Telford travelled south to find work in London, writing that he</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para0"><a name="0707044000521">He was lucky to obtain work at Somerset House, an enormous construction project at the time. He served as Shropshire&#146;s first surveyor of public works in 1787, and so began a career that included the building of roads, bridges, churches, harbours and canals, many of which are still in use today.</p>

 I am glad to hear my hon. Friend say that London was an expensive city even in those days. Does not Telford&#146;s contribution to London, particularly through St. Katherine&#146;s dock, show the many advantages of the Union? Perhaps this occasion can also be a celebration of the way in which people from across the United Kingdom have contributed to the success of Great Britain over the years.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="3 July 2007">

<notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2007 : Column 935</b><br>

<p><a name="st_o342"><a name="0707044000523"><a name="70703-0022.htm_spnew1"><a name="0707044001057"><b>David Mundell:</b>
 I certainly agree with my hon. Friend. As I said, Telford was truly a great Briton; his works extended to Wales, to London and Portsmouth in England, and to the highlands of Scotland. Indeed, one of his great works was to ensure a mail route from London to Ireland. He was referred to as &#147;pontifex maximus&#148; for his considerable proficiency in building bridges, and in 1820 he was appointed the first president of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He held the post until his death in 1834. He built his reputation on craftsmanship, as is demonstrated by the variety of projects that he undertook. Those projects include the Menai Strait and Conway bridges, the renovation of Shrewsbury castle, the Caledonian canal, St. Katherine&#146;s dock, which has been mentioned, and the stunning Pontcysyllte aqueduct over the River Dee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para1"><a name="0707044000524">The suspension bridge over the Menai Strait to Anglesey is a world-famous structure that still carries heavy traffic today, and it was a remarkable achievement at the time. The Caledonian canal is 60 miles long and stretches from Inverness to Fort William, and it is recognised as one of the great waterways of the world. The canal was instrumental in the development of the highland economy, and it facilitated trade between east and west, as well as with Germany, Holland and the Scandinavian countries. Telford&#146;s work can be seen outside the United Kingdom in the Gota canal in Sweden&#151;a project that he surveyed in 1808 and instructed a team of engineers to carry out, via correspondence. It was completed in 1832. Telford was consulted by Governments, including those of Russia and Austria, for help in planning new roads and bridges. He also held sway in the House, not least because of his reputation for delivering road and bridge-building schemes on time and to budget&#151;a lesson that many politicians could learn. It is clear from the minutes of Select Committees at the time that Thomas Telford&#146;s professional opinion was given significant weight when it came to the allocation of public funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para2"><a name="0707044000525">As a largely self-taught man, Telford was passionate about education and supporting training, and he was a strong advocate of apprenticeships. That is reflected in the extensive education programme promoted today by the Institution of Civil Engineers. The institution is looking to highlight Telford&#146;s contribution to engineering over the past 250 years, but it also seeks to inspire a new generation of engineers for the next 250 years. Special activities for students this year include a series of new engineering teaching resources, and debating scenarios for citizenship lessons, involving political and ethical civil engineering issues. Apparently, the scenarios include the case for and against road pricing. In Scotland, both in Eskdale and as part of the &#147;highland promise&#148; project, a touring scale model suspension bridge with a span of 30 ft is assembled by groups of pupils, who get a real sense of construction and of the engineering principles behind the bridge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para3"><a name="0707044000526">It is appropriate to recognise the other work that the institution is doing to mark the 250th anniversary. There is an informative website, an exhibition at the Guildhall art gallery between 19 July and 2 September, and a wreath-laying ceremony at Westminster abbey. Yesterday, a Telford conference took place in Edinburgh, addressed by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh.</p>

Local communities there are holding many events over the summer to mark the anniversary, and I applaud particularly the work of the Telford and Wrekin council and was pleased to sign the early-day motion lodged by the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para6"><a name="0707044000529">A Telford family history day will be held and a piece of music to mark the anniversary has been commissioned and is being composed by Jamie Telford&#151;no relation&#151;which will be performed for the first time at a concert to be held on 8 September in the Buccleuch centre in Langholm by the Langholm pipe, flute and brass bands. I am sure the Minister will join me in applauding the considerable volunteer effort being put into the project to commemorate the anniversary at Telford&#146;s birthplace.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell) on an outstanding speech celebrating Thomas Telford. He has done the House and me a service by securing the Adjournment debate this evening. It would be remiss of me, being the Member of Parliament whose constituency is named after Thomas Telford, if I did not make a few remarks tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0707044000532">I have always said that I have lived in the town of Telford all my life. That is not quite true. I was born 40 years ago, and Telford new town was not designated until 29 September 1968, but I can say that I have lived in parts of what is now Telford for all my life. We as a community in the town celebrate this year the birth of Thomas Telford, the man who gave his name to our town. Before that, the area was called Dawley new town and it was expanded significantly in the late 1960s when there was a need for additional housing for people moving out of the west midlands conurbation. The town was built on the east Shropshire coalfield. It is a combination of older communities like Dawley, Madeley, Wellington and Oakengates that had an engineering and mining history. Telford would have been proud that an area with that mining and industrial heritage and history was named after him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0707044000533">There is sometimes confusion in Telford because people think that Thomas Telford designed the Iron Bridge, which of course is not true. The number of people who have said to me that Thomas Telford designed the Iron Bridge is incredible. The Iron Bridge was designed by Abraham Darby III, but it would have been difficult to call the town Darby when there already was a town called Derby, so it was a wise decision to call the town Telford when it was expanded in 1968. We are proud to share the connection with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency. As I am holidaying in Scotland over the summer, I hope that I may be able to pay a visit to his constituency and his community to visit the site where Thomas Telford was born. I am looking forward to that very much.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0707044000534">I want to pay tribute also to Telford and Wrekin council for the programme of events that it has put together, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, over this year. There are some superb events involving schools and focusing on education. We can be proud of the connection that we are making with education. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Institution of Civil Engineers, which seems to be doing a great job. Its website contains a whole section on Thomas Telford, showing a timeline and focusing on his achievements. They are significant, and we would not have the nation that we have today without Telford. He was a great Briton. The point made earlier by the hon. Gentleman about the importance of the union is very much solidified by the work that Telford did during his lifetime, and the way in which that has lasted and provided a service to the public through the generations in terms of his engineering skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0707044000535">Telford and Wrekin council had a garden celebrating Telford at the Chelsea flower show, which was fantastic. I am not a great gardener, but my wife is, and we paid a visit to the garden, which I am pleased to report won a silver medal. The council hopes to do a further garden at Chelsea next year, because that will be the 40th anniversary of the designation of Telford new town in September 1968. Therefore, I should like the Government to think about whether they can roll the celebration of Telford&#146;s 250th anniversary through to a celebration of 40 years of what perhaps records him most in this country, and that is the town of Telford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0707044000536">I again thank the hon. Gentleman for securing this important debate and I look forward to my words joining his in his local library.</p>

 As this is my first occasion at the Dispatch Box since my appointment as Minister with responsibility for culture, I should like to take this opportunity to say how delighted I am to take on such a stimulating and varied brief, covering a huge range of activities in which this country is a world leader.</p>

hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Woodward), whom I am sure the House will want to congratulate on his new appointment as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and wish him well.</p>

Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell) on a comprehensive, clear and fulsome tribute to Thomas Telford. Scotland has an unparalleled record in producing civil engineers of the finest calibre, and Thomas Telford was clearly one of the most eminent of them all, which is signified, as the hon. Gentleman said, by his burial in Westminster abbey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0707044000540">It is right that the hon. Gentleman and his constituents, and those communities in Scotland and in England whose heritage has been enhanced by the work of Thomas Telford, should seek to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth in an appropriate manner. I also acknowledge and have seen the events and activities being co-ordinated across the country by the Institution of Civil Engineers. In my previous ministerial role as Minister with responsibility for industry, I had much interaction with that institution. It is an excellent organisation that does an enormous amount of work in promoting engineering, and particularly in training, as the hon. Gentleman said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0707044000541">I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright) on his contribution to tonight&#146;s Adjournment debate. I have had the privilege of visiting Telford on a number of occasions and seeing the excellent work that has been carried out in a range of ministerial portfolios, and how well the new town has settled down to become established. It excels in many areas, so I am happy to take away and consider my hon. Friend&#146;s proposition, although he will recognise that I have very little direct authority. We work through non-departmental public bodies in most of the work that we do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0707044000542">The 250th anniversary to mark the birth of Thomas Telford is a crucial event and all the events surrounding it are managed by those for whom the life of Thomas Telford had particular resonance. It is a little difficult for the Government to intervene directly, much as the hon. Gentleman would like me to, in activities surrounding the celebration of the life of one individual. The proper role for the Government is to support and invest in our heritage for the benefit of the public and for future generations. Our industrial heritage reflects the story of Britain and the world over the past 200 years. It is a source of education, inspiration and enjoyment to families and communities across the country, and to tourists from across the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0707044000543">This year alone, the Government will invest more than &#163;500 million in the museums and heritage sector. It is right that expert bodies such as English Heritage and the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council make the most effective use of taxpayers&#146; money. As the number of deserving causes will always exceed the funds available, they are best placed to determine the priority projects for support. I am delighted that among the museums funded by the MLA&#146;s &#147;Renaissance in the Regions&#148; programme, Ironbridge Gorge museum is hosting an exhibition exploring the achievements of Thomas Telford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0707044000544">Exchequer funding is, of course, complemented by money from the national lottery, and I commend the work of the Heritage Lottery Fund in awarding almost &#163;4 billion to projects that have helped to open up our  <br>

heritage for everyone to enjoy. That work is further enhanced by the tremendous contribution of a broad range of private, charitable and corporate donors, whose support deserves public recognition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="70703-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0707044000545">Last week, we saw just how vital public and private partnerships are to preservation of the nation&#146;s heritage. I was delighted that a unique coalition of partners came together to secure Dumfries house and its contents for the nation, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale is fully aware of that. Together, they have been able to raise &#163;45 million to ensure that the house and its contents will be open to the public for the first time. All those involved deserve recognition, and I was delighted that in addition to the substantial donations from His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales charitable foundation, the Monument Trust and the Art Fund, &#163;12 million of public money was invested through the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Scottish  <br>

If we sought to mark every anniversary, we would undoubtedly be accused of being overly prescriptive. For example, 1757 also saw the birth of William Blake, who is also commemorated in Westminster abbey. So while we have no specific plans to mark the anniversary of Telford&#146;s birth, nor indeed that of William Blake, I wish all those marking the occasion every success in their activities, and I join the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the life and works of Thomas Telford.</p>
