<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="50310-01_spmin0"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 At a cost of &#163;3.6&nbsp;billion, the new deal has helped 2&nbsp;million men and women. It has moved 1.2&nbsp;million into work, contributed to a fall in long-term unemployment of over three quarters, and helped the creation of 2&nbsp;million jobs. Every week 125,000&nbsp;men and women are finding new jobs. Compared with 1997, the Government now spend &#163;5&nbsp;billion a year less on unemployment benefits.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="50310-01_spnew0"><b> David Wright: </b> 
 Over 870&nbsp;young people in Telford have benefited from the new deal. Will my right hon. Friend do all he can to protect that programme, and look at ways in which we can integrate it with modern apprenticeships?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="50310-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend represents the interests of the people of Telford with great distinction. Unemployment since 1997&nbsp;has fallen by half, and is 2.5&nbsp;per cent. Long-term unemployment has fallen by 77&nbsp;per cent. and youth unemployment by 80&nbsp;per cent. All that would be put at risk if the Tories&#039; policy to abolish the new deal were implemented.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="50310-01_spnew2"><b> Ms Taylor: </b> 
 The new deal in my constituency, Stockton, South, has helped over 2,500&nbsp;people into work. In the northern region that figure is more than 150,000. Could the new deal be extended as an employment support programme to the disabled, supporting programmes such as Blind Routes to Work, an initiative of Stockton Blind People&#039;s Voice?

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1666</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Friend knows, unemployment in Stockton, South has fallen dramatically since 1997. There has been a 70&nbsp;per cent. cut in long-term unemployment and an 80&nbsp;per cent. cut in youth unemployment. One of the reasons why that has happened is the existence of the new deal. It is therefore sad that both the Liberal party and the Conservative party want to abolish it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="50310-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Stephen Dorrell  (Charnwood)</b> 
 (Con): Can the Chancellor of the Exchequer produce a single piece of independent research evidence to support the inflated claims that the Government continue to make for the new deal? Is it not the case that the most recent research into the cost per job created by the new deal shows that the number of jobs actually created in addition to those that were created by a normally buoyant economy is at best 17,000&nbsp;a year? Are not the figures cited by the Chancellor of the Exchequer a continuing example of inflated claims which he cannot substantiate with any independent research?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="50310-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman speaks about a buoyant economy. Who is responsible for a buoyant economy? I am grateful for the gratitude he expresses to the Government. In his own constituency, would he not congratulate us also&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman should get more interested in his own constituency. Unemployment has fallen by 41&nbsp;per cent. since 1997. He asks what the evidence is. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that the economy is &#163;500&nbsp;million a year richer as a result of the new deal. The national institute conceded that without the new deal, the level of long-term unemployment would be twice as high. That is the evidence, and that is why the Opposition are making a mistake by abolishing the new deal.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="50310-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Mark Francois  (Rayleigh)</b> 
 (Con): I appreciate that the Chancellor has a particular interest in methods of helping people to find new jobs, but even allowing for that, how can the Government explain the fact that despite the new deal the number of people under 25&nbsp;not in employment, education or training has risen and stands at more than 1.1&nbsp;million? Why is the new deal failing those young people so badly?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="50310-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 The Opposition ask the same question as they asked last month and I dealt with it then. The shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions went to his local jobcentre last Friday in Daventry to claim credit for the opening of Jobcentre Plus. That is the Conservative party which, in the House of Commons, wants to abolish the new deal, privatise Jobcentre Plus and make thousands of civil servants unemployed. The hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) should go back and think again.

<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="50310-01_spmin1"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 Frontloading aid and doubling it through the international finance facility would enable us to provide free primary education for all young children and help to meet the millennium development goals by 2015. Fifty countries have indicated support for the IFF and for the pilot IFF on immunisation in partnership with the Gates Foundation. It would frontload $4&nbsp;billion of investment in vaccination and could save 5&nbsp;million young lives between now and 2015.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="50310-01_spnew8"><b> Ann McKechin: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for his commendable efforts in trying to secure the additional aid that the world needs to eradicate poverty. As he knows, a number of alternative forms of financing aid have recently been proposed, including a revised form of the Tobin tax and a tax on aviation fuel. Has he had an opportunity to assess those particular alternatives and whether the international community is likely to accept such proposals to try to achieve the goal of doubling aid?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="50310-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 A few weeks ago, the G7&nbsp;meeting of Finance Ministers agreed to examine all those specific proposals. The advantages of the international finance facility are that it would frontload aid, that it could be implemented immediately, and that it would provide the necessary money to give us a chance of meeting our millennium development goals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">If present rates of progress were to continue in sub-Saharan Africa, we would not meet the goal of primary education for all by 2015&#151;we would meet it in 2150, 135&nbsp;years late&#151;which is why additional finance is required and why the world community must examine the provision of resources. Scientists have highlighted malaria in a report published today, and the additional money provided by the IFF could enable the provision of malaria bed nets, which can save a life at the very small cost of less than $10.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">The IFF will also allow us to introduce an advance purchase scheme for the newly developed malaria vaccine, which is being tested in Mozambique, and the drugs companies and the Gates Foundation believe that it could be up and running as a preventive vaccine very soon. Advance purchasing, which the rich countries must support, will be required, which is another reason why we need the frontloading mechanism.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="50310-01_spnew10"><b> Ian Lucas: </b> 
 It is excellent news that the German Government have swung behind the IFF, but the real concern is the US Government&#039;s position. Will my right hon. Friend give us his assessment of the US Government&#039;s position, and tell us what steps he has taken to persuade them?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="50310-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 When President Bush spoke at the debt and development conference in Monterrey, he said that no country that is making the necessary reforms to achieve economic development should be denied resources for health and education. After that speech, the Americans set up the millennium challenge account and trebled their spending on HIV/AIDS. In our 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1668</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>discussions over the next few months, we will examine how each continent can support the IFF and other innovative financing mechanisms. We hope to reach an agreement with all our G7&nbsp;partners, and I believe that the developed world is looking to the G7&nbsp;and to the UN special summit to achieve a settlement that will make it possible for us to achieve the millennium development goals.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="50310-01_spnew12"><b> Sir Peter Tapsell  (Louth and Horncastle)</b> 
 (Con): Does the latest International Monetary Fund report suggest to the Chancellor that his ministerial colleagues on the G8&nbsp;may be losing confidence in his capacity to guide the international finance facility or, indeed, the British economy? The report warns of the likely necessity of a massive rise in British taxes by &#163;10&nbsp;billion a year to fill the black hole in the Chancellor&#039;s calculations, following what the IMF describes as a sharp deterioration in Britain&#039;s public accounts over the past five years.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="50310-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 Trust the hon. Gentleman to turn a question about developing countries into a question not about the IFF, but about the IMF&#151;he is wrong to do so. The IMF has praised the British Government on their macro-economic management.

 (LD): I welcome the Chancellor&#039;s efforts to speed up aid flows through the IFF. At this week&#039;s meeting of ECOFIN Ministers, what success did he have in dealing with the European Commission and its statisticians, who say that IFF contributions cannot be treated as contingent liabilities and be taken off the balance sheet, but that they must be counted against Government borrowing debt, thereby imperilling the pledged contributions from France and Germany? How will that problem be dealt with in terms of Britain&#039;s public accounts?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="50310-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 First, the hon. Gentleman is wrong&#151;the matter was not discussed at the ECOFIN meeting. Secondly, EUROSTAT is independent of ECOFIN, and it makes independent judgments. Thirdly, EUROSTAT has said no such thing. The hon. Gentleman has been reading speculation in the newspapers, which is invariably inaccurate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">Along with the Gates Foundation, we are considering a proposal for a pilot facility for vaccination, which many countries, including South Africa, Canada and Scandinavian countries, would support.

 (Lab/Co-op): The Chancellor is to be congratulated on coming up with the initiative of the IFF and on the work that he has done to make progress so far, but what assessment has he made of the impact of the discussions to date on how far he will be able to go?

<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1669</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have any ideas about ways in which other countries will be able to buy into the idea of 0.7&nbsp;per cent. through different finance facilities, if not through the IFF?

<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="50310-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is chairman of an all-party committee on these matters, which will continue to be discussed. Our first aim is get 100&nbsp;per cent. debt relief for the multilateral debts owed by the poorest countries. That would itself provide substantial additional resources on an annual basis for those countries. Our second aim is to get the IFF pilot set up. I believe that there is now sufficient support for the vaccination pilot to move ahead very quickly; it is not necessary for the whole world to support it. Our third aim, which will be discussed at the G8&nbsp;at Gleneagles, is the creation of the new facility itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_o3">My hon. Friend may see tomorrow a report from the Commission for Africa which will recommend that we move fast to set up the facility. Those are the next three stages.

 The short and simple answer is yes. It is fundamental to the rationale of many of the polices that we have introduced. However, as the hon.

<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="50310-02_spmin1"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 Our aims are: that all countries agree to play their part in maintaining global growth and stability; that structural economic reform is taken forward to increase growth; and that, with the reform of the international institutions, we ensure that the world&#039;s poorest can share in rising prosperity. Tomorrow, the Commission for Africa will publish its report and the G7&nbsp;and G8&nbsp;in Gleneagles will consider it.

 My hon. Friend is right and I praise him for his work. Tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria are the diseases that are responsible for millions of people dying unnecessarily every year. The purpose of creating the global health fund was to ensure the capacity to treat them and the availability of immunisation and vaccinations. That is why it is especially appropriate today, when the scientists&#039; report on malaria is published, that the British Government say that we are prepared not only to contribute towards vaccination for tuberculosis but to join other countries in purchasing and therefore financing an advance purchase mechanism for the new drug that may be a preventive vaccine for malaria. When similar work is done on HIV/AIDS, it will be necessary for the Governments of the richest countries to come together to support vaccination and the preventive work on that, too. That is the best contribution that we can make: not only helping in the short term with bed nets for malaria and vaccination for tuberculosis, but saying that, when those drugs are discovered, we will be behind the first advance purchase scheme in the world whereby the rich countries help the poor.

That is the record on which we are proud to stand. We are also proud that we have financed the health service by our decision to raise national insurance.

The level of engagement with China is therefore increasing every year.

 (Lab): Will one of the economic priorities include trade justice? Does the Chancellor think that he can use his position to consider agricultural subsidies, both from America and the common agricultural policy, so that we can get serious reform? At the moment, subsidised exports are being dumped on the poorest people in the world, and they cannot afford that to continue.

 I understand the work that my hon. Friend has done in promoting both trade justice and debt relief over the past few years. We are all grateful for the work, which has brought significant results, with non-governmental organisations and others. Over the next few months, the pressure will grow on America and the European Union to enable an agreement on world trade to be possible in Hong Kong in December. Our proposal to end export subsidies is essential. It will also be necessary for us to offer to help countries in Africa, in particular, to have the capacity to enable them to trade. They will need investment in infrastructure, transport and communications so that they can trade fairly with the rest of the world. Part of the settlement at Hong Kong depends on our ability to provide additional overseas development aid to enable infrastructure to be built in those countries.

He well knows that this Government have embarked on a programme that involves moderate borrowing, but it is justified by the need to bridge the years of under-investment in public services that occurred under the Conservative Government, which he drew attention to himself.

 My hon. Friend is right, of course, that the national minimum wage is just part of the set of measures that we need and have put in place to support the wages and take-home pay of poorer families. The national minimum wage should be seen alongside, and working with, tax credits. It is there as an essential guarantee of fair minimum pay for workers, but it cannot reflect family circumstances, so the tax credit, set alongside it, means that we can target help better on tackling poverty for those families. With the two put together, in October, families with one full-time worker and one child will be looking at take-home pay of &#163;7&nbsp;an hour.

 Millions of parents and students in Britain, including conservatives with a small and a big &quot;C&quot;, will appreciate the record investment that the Government have made in Britain&#039;s schools and colleges, especially in the past three years. However, my right hon. Friend will be aware that in 16-to-19&nbsp;provision a funding gap remains between schools and colleges. He might know that next Wednesday, the day of the Budget, the Association of Colleges is launching a parliamentary lobby.

The better ones have crossed the Floor and joined the Labour party over the past few years. On the important point that my hon.

That is why we saw the largest ever investment in further education funding under this Government. It is set to rise by over &#163;1&nbsp;billion by the coming year, compared with three years ago&#151;a real-terms increase of 60&nbsp;per cent. compared with 2002&#150;03. I should like to see the further education sector emerge from having been the Cinderella of the education world to being right at the top of the education sector, because it is so crucial for those who get their education under its roof.

He was also making the important point that legitimate protest, which I have undertaken regularly in my time, and which I will continue to respect and defend the right of people to do, is in quite a different box from the threat of suicide terrorism, the like of which we saw in Madrid a year ago and which we could see in London or elsewhere in Britain at any time.

All they do is postpone the problem for 28&nbsp;days. Thereafter our normal ineffective planning laws kick in. Councils need much stronger powers, as outlined in my Greenbelt Protection Bill, to evict those who break the law and to put right any damage. Otherwise, residents who live close to illegal Traveller encampments, such as Hovefields, Crays Hill and Sadlers Farm in my constituency, and in many other constituencies where this is happening, will continue to be discriminated against while uneven and unfair handling of the situation is allowed to continue.

 I understand the concerns that the hon. Gentleman and others have expressed. There is a shortage of authorised sites for Gypsies and Travellers, alongside a growth in unauthorised development which is causing problems for neighbouring communities and Gypsies and Travellers alike. Local councils need more powers for swift enforcement against development in problem areas, but they also need to do more to identify land for authorised sites. The two go hand in hand. Temporary stop notices provide local planning authorities with an additional enforcement tool to deal with a wide range of planning breaches.

Long before the IRA ceasefire and the Good Friday agreement, Gerry Adams, as an elected Member, was allowed the right to enter the precincts and to use the services of the House.

However, they have access on those terms to offices and, indeed, to facilities that a member of the public would not have. The position for people who had not taken the Oath was that they could enter in the same way as a member of the public, but the resolution that has been mentioned gave them additional access and offices. The Leader of the House may not have appreciated those distinctions and may now want to revisit them.

 I support the motion. At a British-Irish parliamentary body meeting earlier this week, there was very strong condemnation of the IRA, not least from Irish Deputies, one after another of whom bitterly criticised the criminality in the organisation and its betrayal of the Good Friday agreement. In supporting the motion, is it not important to recognise that Sinn Fein was elected with the electorate voting for it in the knowledge that Sinn Fein MPs would not take their seats in the House of Commons? We must be very careful, now and in future, not to give Sinn Fein Members any idea of being martyrs and playing to their electorate along those lines.

 If I may say so, those are wise words of advice for the House.

My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who is well respected in that role, has made the judgment&#151;and I fully support him&#151;that we should withdraw these privileges, but at the same time we should allow elected Members of Parliament to serve their own constituents.

They and their staff will still be able to use the offices, free post, and telephone facilities, and have access to the Library and to catering, in order to carry out their responsibilities to their constituents, some of whom may have elected them and some of whom may have voted for other parties.

In the absence of an Assembly, the commission&#039;s power to make recommendations is more limited and it therefore recommended that the Secretary of State should consider taking financial measures against Sinn Fein in the context of the suspended Assembly.

Although it was outside the commission&#039;s scope to make recommendations about that, its comments have nevertheless led the Government to conclude that it was right that the House should have the opportunity to consider imposing a similar restriction on allowances paid to Sinn Fein Members of this House.

<a name="50310-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_54">The motion before us today is an expression of the House&#039;s profound disapproval of the activities of the Provisional IRA and the responsibility that Sinn Fein shares for those activities in the estimation&#151;that is the important point&#151;of the Independent Monitoring Commission. However, the motion also takes account of the fundamental right of citizens in constituencies that have returned Sinn Fein Members to be represented.

<p><a name="st_99"><a name="50310-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. Robert Walter  (North Dorset) (Con):</b> 
 The Leader of the House mentioned the sanctions to be taken against Sinn Fein as a party.

<a name="stpa_55">The balance involved is difficult to strike and it gives me no pleasure to bring forward the motion because I believe that every Member elected to this House should take his or her seat in the Chamber. Not to do so is a denial of the representation that their constituents have a right to expect, whether those constituents voted for the elected Member or not&#151;indeed, whether they voted at all. That is important. Those in the constituencies of the four affected Members, even those who did not vote Sinn Fein, have a right to normal parliamentary representation. That is why we are taking away the &#163;430,000-odd but leaving in place those Members&#039; right to help their constituents through the facilities of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_56">Although we all acknowledge the political position of Irish republicanism, the Government believe that Sinn Fein Members should take their seats and participate fully in the democratic process, partly because we want them to be committed to exclusively democratic means and partly because their constituents have a simple right to that representation.

<p>
<a name="50310-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_57">When the House voted in 2001&nbsp;to grant allowances to Members who chose not to take their seats, it did that in recognition of the importance of those Members&#039; fulfilling their duty to constituents.

We all want continuously to encourage that progress and the motion is designed to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_58">It is the view of the British and Irish Governments and of international opinion that the progress has faltered and slipped backwards because of the activities of the Provisional IRA.

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, but several factors must be carefully balanced. First, the four Members are elected just as he is and just as I am. Their constituents have a right to representation just as his do. He represents them well and I try to do that for my constituents. We are imposing an important sanction&#151;withdrawing nearly &#163;440,000-worth of expenses, which help those Members to represent their constituents. However, access to the House&#039;s facilities remains to enable them to perform their duties.

 Is not one of the problems that Gerry Adams and his colleagues have never made sufficient use of the opportunity to visit the House and enable the rest of us, who disagree with many of their positions, to contact them, nobble them and press differing views? They took the money and ran. There is therefore a case for removing the money, although the argument about the facilities for serving constituents&#151;that does not always have to be done by them but could be done by people whom they appoint&#151;is pertinent.
</p>








<p><a name="st_107"><a name="50310-13_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I understand that point, but my hon. Friend will understand the republican view on whether Members should take their seats in a United Kingdom Parliament, although we disagree with it. In the past few years, as a result of Government decisions and the leadership that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has shown, there has been, until recently, increasing political mainstreaming of Sinn Fein in the democratic process. It is important not to lose sight of the opportunity to re-engage with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_59">I know that some will argue that we should go further than today&#039;s motion and deny Sinn Fein the use of facilities in the Palace of Westminster&#151;indeed, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) and others have done that. However much we may disapprove of the activities of Sinn Fein, and however much we disapprove of the recent criminality of especially the Provisional IRA, the Government&#039;s view is that we should not give the appearance of denying the rights of the electorate. Whether we like it or not, that is how a decision to deny them access to their offices would be perceived.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_60">I also believe that a decision to deny Sinn Fein access to facilities here would put the House out of step with the devolved institutions that many Members have tried so hard to construct and sustain in Northern Ireland. The Government have signalled their intention to renew the financial penalties imposed on Sinn Fein in the suspended Northern Ireland Assembly, but all Members of the Legislative Assembly continue to have access to the building and its facilities, and neither Unionist nor nationalist parties have suggested that that should be withdrawn.

Will he take into account what the Independent Monitoring Commission said, in that it made clear that the criminal activities of republicans were known and approved by leading members of Sinn Fein? The distinction that he draws is therefore not upheld by the IMC, which is quite clear that leading Sinn Fein members knew and approved of the Northern bank raid. He is therefore wrong to draw the distinction, and that is highly important in relation to his point about Sinn Fein Members as persons who are elected as if they were normal politicians.

<p><a name="st_128"><a name="50310-15_spnew6"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend makes an important point. We should also bear in mind that at the time when the elections took place in 2001&#151;the House&#039;s decision was made shortly after that&#151;the atmosphere seemed to be one of encouragement. Since then&#151;I am sure that this applies to electors in Northern Ireland as well as those of us who are present today&#151;we have observed something that is, as the Leader of the House said, rather dispiriting. Over the past three years, at the same time as claiming taxpayers&#039; money here, Sinn Fein has remained linked to an armed and active terrorist organisation, the Provisional IRA. Those are not just my words. The Republic&#039;s Defence Minister, Mr. Willie O&#039;Dea, went much further. The British Government often use the words &quot;inextricably linked&quot;; he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;We are no longer prepared to accept the farce that Sinn Fein and the IRA are separate. They are indivisible&quot;.</p>

I am not in a position to dispute that either. We have ample evidence of the extent to which the IRA controls a vast criminal empire to finance its operations. We now know that at the same time as members of Sinn Fein were involved in negotiations that could have led to their being Ministers in the Government in Northern Ireland, the IRA was planning the biggest bank raid in British history.

<a name="50310-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_74">The Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Hugh Orde, is in no doubt about where the responsibility for the bank robbery lies; nor is his counterpart in the Republic, the Garda commissioner Mr. Conroy. In blaming the IRA for the Northern bank robbery and a number of other recent robberies in Northern Ireland, the Independent Monitoring Commission was emphatic:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;In our view Sinn Fein must bear its share of responsibility for all the incidents. Some of its senior members, who are also&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. members of PIRA, were involved in sanctioning the series of robberies.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_77">As the McCartney family have said, they want justice, not revenge. They want people to go to the police, not engage in the law of the wild west. Yet even today, despite the warm words of Sinn Fein, we learn that the family still believe that witnesses are being intimidated. Last week, Sinn Fein announced that it was expelling seven members in connection with that incident. What normal political party has to expel a group of its members for involvement in murder?

: I would be opposed to Sinn Fein, even if the organisation were not so closely linked with the IRA. I consider it a totalitarian organisation, and heaven forbid if it were ever to rule in Ireland. However, does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a danger, particularly when Sinn Fein is rightly on the defensive over the brutal murder of Robert McCartney, of giving the organisation a sort of martyr status? It makes it easier for Sinn Fein Members to portray themselves to the electors of Northern Ireland as having been penalised by British parliamentarians and all the rest of it. In that light, is not the Leader of the House achieving the right balance in the motion?
</p>








<p><a name="st_138"><a name="50310-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 It is certainly important to strike the right balance, but I believe that amendments (a) and (b) are required in order to send out the right message. Since the general election of 2001&nbsp;and the time when the changes were made, we have not seen the full commitment that we expected to see from Sinn Fein-IRA, but experienced the problems that I have already outlined. In those circumstances, simply saying that some of the allowances will be removed for a short period is not the firm response that we would expect from the House. If we were to accept the amendments to the motion, it would highlight for the benefit of Northern Ireland voters what the House thinks about the response to the concessions that were made in the 2001&nbsp;resolution.
</p>








<p><a name="st_139"><a name="50310-16_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 Is not one of the main problems the fact that the Government have not named the organisation that we are talking about? Is not the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev.

Because we are not saying that, we have to deal with a very difficult lacuna. What do we do about people who do not want to come to the House for reasons that might, at some future time, be acceptable? I cannot think of an occasion at the moment, but some people have taken that view in the past. Should we not have pressed for the motion to be viewed as a specific response to what Sinn Fein-IRA has done?

My right hon. Friend&#039;s suggestion would interfere with the principle that we want to maintain&#151;that all Members are to be treated in the same way.

 I want to make my position on this matter as clear as I did at the last Northern Ireland questions&#151;I am not in favour of the motion. I have never been in favour of it for a number of reasons that I hope to explain. I am not going to vote in favour of it today. I come from a long tradition in relation to where I live and also to my family, which recognised the refusal to take or affirm an oath of allegiance as part of the nationalist or republican tradition. That is something that goes way back into Irish history and it runs very deeply in people that come from that tradition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_82">I immediately recognise two sets of principles, which have already been enunciated.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_83">I am also aware of the other principle, as I have already mentioned. There is a curious pristine legitimacy about it. However, I see no pristine legitimacy in justifying a set of actions on the basis of principle, while saying, &quot;Those are my principles; I am not breaking them; but, by the way, can I have the money on the side?&quot; In many ways, that is what is happening here. The nationalist-republican tradition is the principle on which some Members justify not attending Parliament, yet that principle does not seem to get in the way of the allowances or advantages&#151;financial and otherwise&#151;that stem from Parliament.

That is one of the reasons why I look upon the matter with a jaundiced eye.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_85">There will be a lot of righteous indignation about the motion before the House. I recognise and respect that, but there will probably be little recognition of what lies at the heart of the issue&#151;a disrespect for the institutions of Parliament shown by those who will take the money, but not come to put their case on the Floor of the House. People may have different political persuasions, but they must not disrespect our political institutions. In the Northern Ireland arrangement, that disrespect means that there can be little respect between political adversaries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_86">I want to make several minor points. We all know the value of publicity in the run-up to a general election. How much publicity could the Labour, Conservative, Democratic Unionist, Ulster Unionist or Social Democratic and Labour parties buy for &#163;400,000? Could they buy as much as has been secured today, in this debate, by the party at which the motion is aimed? In my view, they most certainly could not. That party will milk today&#039;s debate, making it another grievance to add the list. It seems to thrive on the grievance culture, in which this motion will become another element. Every statement and interview by that party is permeated by a sense of victimhood, and many people will consider the unprincipled decision in this matter to have been taken by this House. For that reason, too, I regard the motion with a jaundiced eye.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_87">Secondly, I want to look beyond today&#039;s debate. I do not want to talk about bank raids or recent murders or developments in Northern Ireland. The motion is part of the process by which negotiations are progressed through deals on the side. I do not accept that a shaft of light struck the Government, individually or collectively&#151;but including the Leader of the House and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland&#151;and that as a result they decided to propose this motion. That decision was made in negotiations with a political party, as a side deal to the other negotiations in hand at the time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_88">When was the issue discussed with the Ulster Unionist, Democratic Unionist or Social Democratic and Labour parties? It was never discussed, as it belongs in the category of side deals. It is part of the goodies and sweeteners used to get and keep people on board. What effect does such a deal have on the real negotiations about very serious issues, or on the future? What will be its effect on those parties that negotiate in good faith? The harsh reality is that negotiations on Northern Ireland over the past seven years could provide a template, usable by any country in the world, for resolving conflicts by removing all the middle ground. Until the fault line in the negotiating process is recognised, the difficulties will continue and increase.
</p>

<a name="50310-16_para8">

I have had the same guns thrust in my face and put to my head, and been told that it was disloyal of me to seek a mandate in an election, regardless of whether that election was for Westminster or the Northern Ireland Assembly.

There is a huge difference between the process of negotiation and its subject. The Good Friday agreement is the basis for the future, but the process of negotiation has served only to diminish its chances of success.

<p>
<a name="50310-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_91">I have one final question, which I cannot answer. Like many other hon. Members, I will not be in the House when it is answered. The motion will be reconsidered in a year: what will happen then, if the money is still required by those who claim to uphold the principle on which the motion is based? What line will the Government of the day take? What will be the criteria governing the reintroduction of the provisions? Will they remain unchanged? Will they be reintroduced in a different form?

Let me make it clear to him that I have not been privy to the information that I have discussed&#151;the dialogue has been directly between my leader, who is of course a Privy Councillor, and others&#151;but I do register my belief that those of us who have now been actively involved, as the hon.

The hon. Gentleman mentioned the weapons of mass destruction debacle, which was used to justify a war, when we now see that no such evidence existed.

Lord Alderdice, whom I know well and respect greatly, is one of the influential thought leaders on these matters, and if he and the IMC believe that the IRA were involved in the robbery from the Northern bank, I would say that that in itself is important, albeit secondary, evidence to suggest that that is the case.

My feeling is that providing office access to these individuals has been, on balance, helpful to the peace process and to increasing pressure on Sinn Fein to try to bring its own house into order. That is a legitimate difference of view, but today&#039;s debate and the question of sanctions against Sinn Fein on the direct evidence indicating the seriousness of recent crimes is actually a slightly different matter, and probably not influenced directly by that information.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way because I am following his argument closely and I want to question his logic. He said that giving the Sinn Fein MPs office space has moved towards encouraging them down the road of good and proper parliamentary democracy, yet actually we have had the Executive suspended in Northern Ireland for over a year because of Sinn Fein activity. Not just that, but we have had the extraordinary behaviour of Sinn Fein-IRA, which are inextricably linked, and he has just admitted that he accepts that three of those MPs are on the army council. They are the IRA itself.

<p><a name="st_151"><a name="50310-17_spnew6"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has slightly misunderstood what I said because he believes that I have implied that the office space granted to the Sinn Fein Members has necessarily contributed to&#151;I will try to quote him now&#151;its adherence to parliamentary democracy. That is not what I said. I said that the fact that they can operate within the walls of Parliament has actively helped us&#151;certainly those of us who have been involved from Opposition parties&#151;to commence dialogue with Sinn Fein, which I genuinely believe has altered that organisation&#039;s comments in the public domain and pressured Sinn Fein to put pressure on the IRA to come into line. The reason we are here today is because Sinn Fein has evidently failed in what I believe to be its duty to bring the criminal activities of the IRA into order.

<a name="stpa_98">The hon. Gentleman will also know that paragraph 13&nbsp;of the joint declaration made it absolutely clear that it was not acceptable to have an underlying level of either violence or criminal activity, and that those could be considered to constitute a violation of the ceasefire. This is why we are here, because I think we have to recognise that Sinn Fein must be brought to account for what has been going on with the IRA, but here is the irony: had we not given those facilities in the first place, we would not have the sanction to impose now. And the double irony&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I am delighted that Conservatives finally recognise the importance of the influence we can now wield. Conservative Front-Benchers disappoint me by failing to understand the seminal importance of what we are doing. We are seeking to normalise Sinn Fein&#039;s operation when it comes to being a political party. I, for one, believe that we have gone some way down that track but, crucially, the fact that Sinn Fein has itself in a mealy-mouthed and vague way begun to condemn some of the activities of the IRA of late, can only be as a direct result of the pain it feels as a result of these sanctions. Others in this Chamber may disagree with that point of view, and I am happy to allow the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) to intervene, but they must surely recognise that the entire political process in Northern Ireland has been characterised by such difficult decisions, by the Labour Government and previously by the Conservatives.

 Much as I would like to believe that conversations that the hon. Gentleman or I or any other Opposition politician have had with Sinn Fein have led to the sort of differences that he thinks he has seen, does not he really believe that what has persuaded Sinn Fein to come up with some of the mealy-mouthed expressions of regret and condemnation of recent weeks has been nothing to do with that, but rather with the drive by the criminal enforcement agencies in the Irish Republic against its operations, and the unmitigated anger of Irish nationalists and republicans at the brutality of the murder of Robert McCartney?
</p>








<p><a name="st_153"><a name="50310-18_spnew1"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 In part, I agree, but I have also had conversations with Sinn Fein and I personally judged that it is hurt&#151;in a financial sense and a very real sense&#151;by the sanctions that we are discussing today. If the hon. Gentleman has a different view, he has obviously had different conversations from mine with Sinn Fein and drawn different conclusions. One of the great things about democracy is that we are allowed to hold different views and I look forward to hearing his further views later in the debate, but what I find particularly confusing is the apparently contradictory position taken by the Conservatives when in opposition in comparison with the kind of things that they did when in government.

<a name="50310-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_99">Has the hon. Gentleman forgotten, for example, that John Major was in communication with the IRA when it had not even instituted a ceasefire? Was he an apologist for the IRA? Is that what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting? I do not think so. I think that, despite my many criticisms of the Conservative Government at the time, one thing that they can be proud of is the risk that they took to initiate what went on to become the peace process. Taking the hon. Gentleman&#039;s absolutist view, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_155"><a name="50310-18_spnew3"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 Which would be more naive, I ask the hon. Gentleman: what I have been saying, which is founded on the basis of judgment, or allowing an amnesty for weapons, as was done&#151;once again, under Prime Minister John Major&#151;so that terrorists could give in their guns without any fear of legal cost? Once again, that was a courageous move by John Major and the then Government. Once again, there are those who now seem to criticise the resistance of some of us to removing the offices. That could be regarded by them as further kowtowing and playing into the hands of Sinn Fein and the IRA. Had it not been for the fact that John Major and other Conservatives were willing to take such risks at the time, it is possible that we would not have gone as far as we have.
</p>








<p><a name="st_156"><a name="50310-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. Donaldson: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman said that he recognised, in his terms, that Sinn Fein had made progress, but is he aware of the comments made by Mitchel McLoughlin&#151;a leading member of Sinn Fein&#151;on RTE television after the Northern bank raid, when he said that the murder of Jean McConville, the mother of 10&nbsp;children, was not a crime?
</p>








<p><a name="st_157"><a name="50310-18_spnew5"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 Yes, I am. My judgment is that Sinn Fein has a terribly long way to go. Apropos of what the hon. Gentleman has just said, it is little short of breathtaking to me that those in the IRA can conduct themselves as they have regarding the killing of Robert McCartney, go on to suggest that the murder of the murderers is in some way a just response to that and then expect that there will be no sanction against Sinn Fein as a result. If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that Sinn Fein and the IRA are still making astonishing and appalling mistakes and that they have managed in just a few months to harm significantly the public relations progress that they had made over many years, I agree with him, but the decision that we must make today is how best to maintain the pressure on Sinn Fein to try to do right in a very wrong situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_100">It is my judgment that to take away the financial resource is an appropriate and measured response to what we have seen&#151;&#163;400,000, even to Sinn Fein, is a significant sum&#151;and it illustrates that we are not satisfied with the performance of Sinn Fein and the IRA of late. Furthermore, I am encouraged that, at long last, it seems that the Government have done what the Liberal Democrats have been requesting for a long time by imposing the conditions of paragraph 13. Many times, Ministers have sought to avoid the inescapable fact that serious and organised crime in many ways constitutes a breach of the ceasefire. I hope therefore that today&#039;s debate is an indication that the Government will take more seriously the complaints 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1724</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that many of us have made that the troubles are not simply confined to bombing and shooting, but include organised crime.
</p>








<p><a name="st_158"><a name="50310-18_spnew6"><b> Mr. Mallon: </b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that organised crime is not specified in paragraph 13?
</p>








<p><a name="st_159"><a name="50310-18_spnew7"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 I think that paragraph 13&nbsp;makes it pretty clear that organised crime is included. I did not realise that the hon. Gentleman held that view. I would have assumed that he agreed that it is quite a simple matter for Ministers to interpret serious and organised crime as part of the terms of that paragraph. I look forward to hearing what other hon. Members have to say about that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_101">In conclusion, it is my judgment that we are right to impose the financial sanctions. Despite the Conservatives&#039; apparent scepticism, about which I am surprised, the financial sanction will cause pain to Sinn Fein. In fact, I am surprised more than anything that the Conservatives feel that we are so ineffectual in the House that such measures are not taken seriously by others. However, it is appropriate to allow Sinn Fein to retain the office space for the reasons that I have given before. Furthermore, that allows us a further opportunity to return to increased sanctions if that is required.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_102">I find the whole issue of sanctions against Sinn Fein manifestly vexing and emotive, as we have heard in our recent exchanges, but one must maintain a level head when dealing with Sinn Fein. One must ask what is objectively the most effective means to control the excesses of the IRA and what limited impact we can have through Sinn Fein. As a result, I will encourage my colleagues in the Liberal Democrats to vote for the motion and against amendments (a) and (b). I ask other hon. Members, including those who sit on the Conservative Front Bench, to subjugate their feelings to their values and to do what they think is right, rather than what they think is expedient.

Of course, it is one of the reasons why, initially, I and many of my colleagues, even those on the Labour Benches, opposed the original decision&#151;this precedent&#151;to change the way that Members who do not take their seats are treated in the House. I said at the time that that would come back to haunt us. It is coming back to haunt us, and we are now having to go back and the Government are having to move to abolish the &#163;400,000-odd that those Members get, but I do not think that that goes far enough.

That attempt has clearly failed, so we should go back to square one. Square one means that those who are not prepared to take their seats should accept, as many nationalist Members have done over the years, that if they are elected to Parliament while Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, they have to take the good with the bad. The good means that they receive payment and facilities.

I do not know quite what he was eating as I did not look that closely, but he was eating subsidised food. That is outrageous at a time when, as the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) pointed out, we are passing a measure that will take away the liberties of many, many people merely on suspicion&#151;although I shall continue to oppose it if the House of Lords continues to maintain its position.

Does he also accept that refusal to accept it and failure to take an oath&#151;the only way it can be accepted is through the Oath of Allegiance, because, apart from the House and the monarchy, we do not have many institutions that cover the whole country and we do not have a written constitution that embodies that structure&#151;are not just a mere technicality involving the monarchy, but a repudiation of that structure? As such, they ought to be an affront to the hon. Gentleman, just as they are to everybody else.

 No, I do not accept that at all. I believe that people can be elected to this place who can accept the state as it exists, but who seek to change that state fundamentally in respect of how the Head of State is chosen. They can do that by taking another form of oath, which does not mean that they are being asked to betray their principles.

<a name="50310-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_129">I do not believe for one moment that if we had changed the Oath that would necessarily have brought people from Sinn Fein here, but we should not insist on things and say that there are not obstacles to their being here that we can remove.

<a name="stpa_130">My next point is that the House should bear it in mind that there has been considerable movement on the part of Sinn Fein and its leadership, despite all the things&#151;I admit&#151;we have seen and know about. They are trying to lead their movement towards a peaceful acceptance. Indeed, we are told by the Government and the Democratic Unionist party that, but for want of a photograph, we would have had that in December. So, there has been movement, although hon. Members, the Government and the Taoiseach are right to point out that, probably at the same time, they were planning the robbery of the Northern bank. However, that robbery would not have affected the basic support of Sinn Fein one iota in the north of Ireland, although it might well have had an effect in the Republic. As the hon. Member for North Antrim pointed out, &#163;10&nbsp;million has been robbed from bank and post offices and that has not affected Sinn Fein&#039;s position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_131">Sinn Fein&#039;s position has been affected by the savage murder of Robert McCartney. That has been the real blow to Sinn Fein and the IRA because it has undermined their position in their community. The event has done far more damage than any that we can do by passing the motion. The effect of the incident has been shown by their reaction to it, which was slow at first, but quickly became greater as they realised the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>affront that had happened in their community. The fact that they have now deplored the murder, urged people to come forward and placed names before the police ombudsman shows the pressure that the community has put on the leadership of IRA. That, more than anything, will hasten division in the republican movement. People at the head of Sinn Fein will eventually have to make a real and positive decision about that.

<a name="stpa_132">Although it was reported little over here, the speech made by Gerry Kelly at the Ard Fheis in Dublin was interesting. He spoke about a need for acceptance of the development of police boards and the need for the disappearance of the IRA as an organisation. He used words and phrases that had not been heard before. It was also interesting that Gerry Adams accepted clearly and without qualification the legitimacy of the Government of the Republic because that represented a breakdown of the old mythology.
</p>








<p><a name="st_167"><a name="50310-20_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mallon: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. I read the speech, but I think that Mr. Adams recognised the institutions, rather than the state.

<p><a name="st_168"><a name="50310-20_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNamara: </b> 
 If one recognises the institutions of the state as legitimate, given that their legitimacy comes from the state and their acceptance by the people of the Republic, it is fair to say, despite the words that Mr. Adams used, that his comments represent an enormous step forward from the old mythology of denying the legitimacy of the Republic. My hon. Friend and I can argue about the words and reach different conclusions, but I thought that the speech was a helpful sign, rather than something negative.

We are in a position in which some Members of the House either knew about those events, or were negligent in not knowing about them, given their positions in the organisations. I have served on the Standards and Privileges Committee, which is both a privilege and an awesome task. The Committee has investigated complaints against normal Members. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards examines such cases and the Committee makes a recommendation regarding Members&#039; conduct. In recent times, we have criticised Members for negligence and the House has upheld such findings. They have been suspended and sanctions and penalties have been put on them, but we are unable to do that in the present circumstances.

If he did not intend to stay in the Chamber, perhaps he should have given the Secretary of State or someone else the responsibility of leading for the Government. I wish to comment on several things that the Leader of the House said. His behaviour was rather similar to that of the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), the then Leader of the House, in 2001. We know from the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s memoirs that he had reservations about the 2001&nbsp;motion, so I wonder whether the current Leader of the House has similar reservations about the motion&#039;s failure to be appropriately effective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_137">The first point about the Leader of the House&#039;s speech might seem small, but it is important. He said that Sinn Fein is signed up to the agreement, but strictly speaking that is not true. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will know&#151;because he was there&#151;that no one signed an agreement. Votes were cast around the table to determine whether there was sufficient consensus. When the roll call for the vote was called, Sinn Fein abstained, so it cannot be colloquially said that it signed up to the agreement. There was subsequently a Sinn Fein Ard Fheis at which a motion was passed to approve the actions of the leadership, but the party did not sign up to the agreement. That fact is crucial to the way in which one approaches the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_138">My view at the time&#151;it remains my view&#151;was that the republicans were locked into an agreement that they did not like. They did not like it then and they do not like it now. They are locked into the agreement because they are participating in the democratic process. When they were simply engaged in a terrorist campaign, they were

<a name="stpa_139">I was slow to take this view, but it was not until after 1998&nbsp;that I decided that even though Sinn Fein did not like the fundamentals of the agreement&#151;at that stage I did not think that its members had completely changed and become normal politicians&#151;it was possible to bring pressure to bear on it and drag it towards normal, peaceful and democratic political activity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_140">I disagree fundamentally with Members on the other side of the House who said that Sinn Fein rejoiced in its victimisation. I accept that its members try to exploit their victimisation, but it is wrong to argue that therefore we should not put pressure on them or subject them to sanctions. They have only moved under pressure, and the events of recent weeks and the activities of the McCartney relatives clearly demonstrate that that is the case. If it were not for the action of those families and the public support for them, republicans would not have done anything. It is only pressure that moves them, and it is only the pressure that my colleagues and I brought to bear that led to decommissioning, and to republicans moving towards a transition. That has been undermined, however, by the fact that the Government have not policed the process correctly.

 Is the right hon. Gentleman aware, as the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) said, that paragraph 13&nbsp;of the declaration does not include organised crime? However, it has been frustrating that at every step the paramilitaries have done the minimum necessary to satisfy the Government. Hopefully, today&#039;s debate will create a clearer picture for the IRA and the other paramilitaries so that they understand that conditions concerning bombing and shooting are not the only ones that have to be met for the normalisation of the Province.
</p>








<p><a name="st_173"><a name="50310-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Trimble: </b> 
 It is not necessary for the hon. Gentleman to hang his hat on paragraph 13. If one looks at speeches made by the Prime Minister in 1998&nbsp;one can see that his language is clearly broad enough to include criminality. Individuals who have recently made much of those comments should bear in mind the fact that he said at the time that the criteria and their application would necessarily become more stringent over time. In a transition, it is perfectly natural to expect criteria to be applied more stringently, and six or seven years into that period there is no basis whatever for failing to do so. In 2001, I considered that the motion was a mistake that would undermine the process: it would send republicans the signal that they could get away with it. Likewise, the activities of previous Secretaries of State, with their

<a name="50310-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_142">The Government&#039;s failure to insist rigorously on the basic principles of the agreement is not helping at all, and is likely to reinforce among republicans the view that if they hunker down and wait, after a short and not even decent interval the Government, the Irish Government and others will return to negotiations with them. It will just be a matter of rehashing the usual steps. I suspect that even today, officials are trying to cobble together yet another deal on policing to entice republicans back to the process. To do so, against the background of the republican statements this week, is simply nauseating.

There is no serious doubt about that. The more significant question is what they have been doing, both now and in the recent past.

<a name="stpa_144">I have referred to the report by the Independent Monitoring Commission. The hon.

There is no doubt that some of the individuals involved in the execution of the robbery were very close indeed to the leadership of the republican movement. We do not know, but it is probable that the leadership knew exactly what was happening and thought that they could and would get away with it.

Occasionally, the House has gone further and expelled Members. That has been the case in comparatively recent times. A Member was expelled for telling a lie in Committee. He attributed dishonest motives to other Members when he himself was acting dishonestly. Another Member was expelled when he was convicted of the crime of forgery. He would have been disqualified because of the length of his prison sentence, but the House was not content to wait for that provision to take effect and expelled him. If the persons returned to serve in the House have not taken their seats and if they have been accessories to this crime, as the IMC report hinted, surely we should go further and follow those precedents. It would be proper to expel those persons from the House.

It has become clear, however, that persons who were prepared to engage in politics are prepared to do so only up to a certain point. They are not willing to complete the transition and do what the Prime Minister has called for since October 2002. Their recent behaviour and statements give no indication that they are likely to change at all in future.

<a name="stpa_148">I want to raise three issues. First, the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) raised a matter of principle and I respect him for that. It was the straightforward view that if someone is elected to this House and expects to receive the full privileges and income, they should be a full participant. That is a principled position, but there is a contrary argument that some people stand for election on a specific platform with a specific manifesto and tell their electorate that they will stand for election but not take office in the Chamber or swear the Oath. That mandate, whether we like it or not, has been given to a number of Sinn Fein Members by a majority vote, and we must respect the mandate of that electorate. That overrides the issue of whether they are full Members. We must respect the view of the people who elected them by a majority.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_149">I should tell my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) that a side issue is taxpayers&#039; money.

A valid issue of principle has been raised, but there is a valid argument to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_150">The second, more important issue is whether sanctions should be applied when events affect the standing of individual Members. We heard from the right hon.

I refer now to the bank robbery, and I shall refer later to the tragedy of Robert McCartney. Under the rule of law, the normal process is that innocence is presumed until someone is found guilty beyond all doubt. In the bank robbery case, if individuals had been brought to trial, found guilty and had a direct involvement with Members of this House, or if Members had been involved, the normal sanctions

</p>








<p><a name="st_178"><a name="50310-21_spnew6"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 Let me respond by referring specifically to the bank raid. On numerous occasions in the House I have heard hon. Members say that evidence exists that leads conclusively to the fact that certain individuals were involved in the bank robbery, but since the Iraq war I no longer take such information on trust. If there is evidence, it should be brought forward in a court of law. Hon. Members have been arguing about that principle, and terrorism generally, for almost a week. I maintain that a matter of principle is involved in how we adhere to the traditions of this House and British justice.

<a name="stpa_152">The Robert McCartney tragedy moves us beyond any specific case that we have debated before. We would expect anyone with information about the murder to come forward and provide that information to the relevant authorities. We would expect any Member of the House to exercise responsibility in urging any witnesses to come forward. We are discussing the application of sanctions against Sinn Fein Members in connection with the Robert McCartney case, but during the past week or so they have been prominent in urging witnesses to come forward and give any information to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.

<p>
<a name="50310-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_153">There is an argument that witnesses should go directly to the police, but we have third-party reporting in my constituency because there has been a lack of confidence in the Metropolitan police among the black and ethnic minority community, and we have made arrangements, with the agreement of the police, for third-party reporting to other agencies. That has worked successfully. We are discussing sanctions in the Robert McCartney case, but Sinn Fein Members who were elected to the House have acted as we would have expected in terms of urgent co-operation with the relevant authorities in bringing information forward.
</p>

<p>

We are considering four Members who have been elected to this House&#151;nobody disputes that&#151;whose conduct has been wholly unbecoming to this House. I voted against the resolution in December 2001, but I saw the Government&#039;s logic in proposing it. At that stage, there were high hopes for the peace process&#151;some would say misplaced&#151;on the Government&#039;s part. There were high hopes that the Sinn Fein Members would play a constructive part in that peace process, but those hopes have been thoroughly confounded since. Far from playing a constructive part, those four Members have been proved time and again to have not only a tainted past, but a tainted present. They have been involved with acts of criminality and acts of terrorism. Although we talk at present of the difference between the suicide terrorist and the IRA terrorist&#151;there is a difference&#151;we should not forget that those who died in Omagh are just as dead as those who died in the twin towers. Those Members have been complicit in acts of terrorism. They are not worthy to sit in this House.

<a name="stpa_161">I wished to be constructive in my opposition to the motion, so I tabled an amendment.

However, it is bizarre that in a little over an hour&#039;s time we will once again debate the Prevention of Terrorism Bill and, as I pointed out to my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) in an intervention earlier, the Government will urge us to allow them to introduce control orders that will be imposed on many people who are probably not terrorists. I do not dispute the Government&#039;s good faith or their overriding and paramount concern for public safety, but if they are prepared to do that, is it not paradoxical that, an hour before, they will vote against an amendment that would exclude people who are

<a name="stpa_163">I regret that. I have many criticisms, which I have voiced in the Chamber, of the manner in which the Government have handled the Prevention of Terrorism Bill, but at no stage have I impugned their good faith in seeking to do what they believe to be right. None the less, I say to the Government that if that is their response to terrorism in general, here they have terrorism in particular&#151;four Members, three of whom are or have been members of the IRA council, who have been involved in acts of terrorism and who have not washed their hands and divorced themselves from those who continue to be involved in acts of terrorism. That is the point. Here we have people who as recently as yesterday announced their willingness to take the law into their own hands, in the form of that extraordinary statement from the IRA&#151;of which Mr. Gerry Adams is still a member and to which Sinn Fein remains indissolubly linked&#151;that gun law can prevail in the United Kingdom.

All the sanctions and illiberal Acts that were applied in the 1970s&#151;the prevention of terrorism Acts, the emergency powers Act, all the orders, internment, the broadcasting ban, the travel ban and all the other measures did not take matters forward very much. What started to take matters forward was the courage&#151;it was courage&#151;of the hon.

Of course republicans will pose as martyrs and victims&#151;it is part of their stock in trade. However, if we tie our hands by refusing to take action for fear that they will pose as martyrs, we end by granting them virtual immunity, however grave their actions or failure to deliver on democratic promises. As the right hon.

<a name="stpa_197">Today, despite many years since the agreement during which the Government have bent over backwards to help republicans make the transition to democracy, we remain in a position whereby the Provisional IRA retains its active military structures, with the capacity for terrorism, uses crime to raise money and intimidate nationalist communities, and retains stocks of illegally held guns and explosives. The onus now should be on the republicans to end their involvement in crime, to stand down the IRA as an effective military force, to turn it into an old comrades association, and to decommission the weapons that they ought not to hold and which, given their repeated promises to be committed to exclusively democratic and peaceful politics, they have no reason to keep. It is just not enough to say, as the Government motion does, that we will suspend the allowances for 12&nbsp;months, and then Parliament will consider the matter again and see whether the republicans&#039; behaviour has improved.

 My interpretation of the Government&#039;s motion is that the resolution of 2001, which gave Sinn Fein Members privileges and allowances, remains in force, but by virtue of the Government motion would be suspended for 12&nbsp;months, and that those allowances and privileges would therefore automatically be resumed in 12&nbsp;months unless a new motion were brought forward deliberately to extend the period of suspension.

<a name="stpa_201">The last thing I wanted was for the debate to take place at all. It is seven years since the signing of the Good Friday agreement, and Northern Ireland Members will recall that only a few months ago we were again very close to an agreement. That would have meant a period between the agreement and the restoration of the Assembly and the Executive during which the IMC would have verified whether criminality had been carried on during those months by the Provisional IRA. But it was not to be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_202">I agree with the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley), who said that in a sense this debate about support for Members who have chosen not to take their seats masks something very simple. The debate is, of course, about sanctions, about penalties and about effectively imposing a fine on Sinn Fein&#151;but what it is really about is what has happened over the past few weeks in relation to the criminality associated with the Provisional IRA, and the way in which events described by Member after Member this afternoon have to all intents and purposes torpedoed the political process that we have seen in recent months.The hon. Gentleman spoke of the sins of those who had committed those acts. Indeed, this three-hour debate is, or at least should be, about those sins, and its title is inadequate to describe what we are dealing with today.

Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) all referred to recent events&#151;in particular the Northern bank robbery, which was mentioned just now by the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds), and the murder of Robert McCartney. In the last couple of days there has also been the IRA&#039;s statement.

</p>








<p><a name="st_209"><a name="50310-25_spnew5"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I shall come to that shortly, but the IMC said that whatever we did here in the House of Commons, and whatever I had to do about allowances for the Northern Ireland Assembly, it would all be deeply inadequate to address the issue with which we are dealing today. There are differences between Members, but they all agree that we must address the criminality that lies behind the events of the past few weeks which is poisoning the political process. We can take away the allowances of the Members whom we are discussing&#151;fine them, in other words. It has been said today that if we take half a million pounds from Sinn Fein it will not matter, but I think it will demonstrate the profound disagreement in the House of Commons with what has happened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_204">If we extend that to other aspects such as access to the House of Commons, there is a disagreement among us about whether we should do that as well. The disagreement is not about a question of principle&#151;whether there should be sanctions&#151;but about the balance that we need to strike. On the one hand we penalise the party, but on the other hand we do not want to penalise the people who voted for certain people in certain constituencies. There are genuine disagreements about that matter, but in both cases the argument is inadequate to address the issue of criminality, which has brought down the political processes and talks over the last number of weeks.
</p>








<p><a name="st_210"><a name="50310-25_spnew6"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack: </b> 
 Before he finishes, will the Secretary of State address the paradox that I mentioned earlier&#151;that we are going to slap control orders on people who are probably not terrorists, while allowing terrorists in our midst?
</p>








<p><a name="st_211"><a name="50310-25_spnew7"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 The issue is not about control orders or sanctions. It is about how we deal effectively with the process in Northern Ireland that has resulted in the criminal activity that we have seen over the last number of weeks. It is about how we ensure that Sinn Fein goes back into the talks, having rid itself of all that the IRA has done over the last number of weeks. There must be a split between criminality on the one hand and the proper political process on the other.
</p>








<p><a name="st_212"><a name="50310-25_spnew8"><b> Mr. Robathan: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for his customary courtesy, which is what I would expect from an old Orielensis. He has spoken about the criminality of the last few weeks, but is it not a fact that the IRA has been deep in criminality throughout its existence and throughout the time of the Belfast agreement? Does he remember that, under the terms of the document on decommissioning published in April 1998, all weapons were meant to be decommissioned within two years of the referendums? They are now about five years late.
</p>








<p><a name="st_213"><a name="50310-25_spnew9"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I must say to the hon. Gentleman that no one thought for one second that criminality had ended. The joint declaration document that the two Governments published some time ago made reference 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1748</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to criminal activity. What everyone thought in 1998&nbsp;was that there would be a period of transition during which such criminality would wither away, eventually leading to a period of normal politics in Northern Ireland. The problem over the last number of years, and particularly over the last number of months when the events that we are discussing took place, is that that has not happened. It has not happened quickly enough and it has not happened in respect of quantity, either. The type of criminality that we have seen in Northern Ireland&#151;it has been associated with the Provisional IRA and the equivalent loyalist paramilitary groups&#151;has not gone away. That is the issue that the House has to consider today. Whether we vote for the amendments or for the Government motion, we are expressing the deep and profound disapproval of the House of Commons for what has happened to the political and peace process in Northern Ireland.
</p>








<p><a name="st_214"><a name="50310-25_spnew10"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 Does the Secretary of State agree that Sinn Fein should take note of the fact that those who have sought and sustained a constructive dialogue nevertheless find themselves with no alternative but to support the sanctions? That is a consequence of the strains that the IRA&#039;s actions have now placed on the process. Sinn Fein really must reflect&#151;I am sure that it will&#151;on our debate and start visibly to put its house in order before relationships based on good will are strained even further.
</p>








<p><a name="st_215"><a name="50310-25_spnew11"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 That is absolutely right. The hon. Member for Aylesbury was also absolutely right when he said that the onus in this process is now entirely on Sinn Fein to prove to the people and the political leaders of Northern Ireland, to the House of Commons and to both Governments that it is truly going down the non-violent, democratic political road that lay at the heart of the Good Friday agreement. The criminal activities that we have seen over the last number of months clearly violate the principles of that agreement and everything that anyone involved in the talks leading up to it expected. My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) and the right hon. Member for Upper Bann will remember, as they were so involved in the talks leading up to the agreement, that everything was based on the principle of non-violence and the democratic process. Robbing banks, murdering people, so-called punishment beatings and racketeering are all completely unacceptable when more than 2&nbsp;million people in Ireland, north and south, voted for a peaceful future in 1998. Regardless of whether they agree with the Good Friday agreement, all Members of the House believe that that is the right thing to do.

<p><a name="st_217"><a name="50310-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that. Those who know about Irish history know that the genuinely republican people who set up the Irish Republic, and those who consider themselves to be of a republican persuasion, would be genuinely and sincerely alarmed at the present level of criminality in the IRA. That has nothing to do with persuading people to vote for either the republican or nationalist cause. Regardless of whether they have a Unionist or nationalist background, people in Northern Ireland must accept the principles underlying the new policing arrangements and criminal justice system there. Those arrangements were voted for by the people of Ireland, north and south.

 I thank the Secretary of State for giving way, and I apologise to the House that other business meant that I could not be present for the whole debate. I agree with what the archbishop said, but will the right hon. Gentleman acknowledge that it was De Valera who clamped down harshly on Sinn Fein in the republic, and that some of us will have to do the same in the UK? When he considers the views of those who voted for the party, will he bear it in mind that Sinn Fein-IRA executed four Members of this House? What sort of politicians are Sinn Fein Members? There is a great difference between the British way of life and what they want to impose on Northern Ireland.
</p>








<p><a name="st_219"><a name="50310-26_spnew3"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making those points, and many hon. Members in this debate have said that the consequences of the murder of Robert McCartney, and the subsequent campaign by his sisters, have been more profound than anything that has happened in recent weeks. People in republican communities&#151;in that case, in the Short Strand area&#151;have risen up to disagree with and disown the terrorist intimidation that they have had to put up with over so many years. That is more significant than any other development. Obviously, the McCartney family&#039;s very courageous stance is to be applauded, but it shows that genuinely republican people in Northern Ireland who voted for Sinn Fein over the past seven years have become completely fed up with the sort of intimidation recently evident in the Short Strand area. That response is more telling than anything that the Government might propose.

<p><a name="st_224"><a name="50310-28_spnew0"><b> Angus Robertson  (Moray) (SNP):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You are well aware of the importance of RAF Kinloss and RAF Lossiemouth to my constituency and my previous difficulties in being properly informed about statements by the Ministry of Defence. Today, journalists have raised with me the impending announcement of the future stationing of Nimrod MRA4&nbsp;aircraft at Kinloss. I have been told what the scope and time scale of the decision are supposed to have been, but, despite six calls to the Ministry of Defence, I have not received written confirmation about the details of the announcement, although I was promised it within seconds at 1.14&nbsp;this afternoon. At 4.10&nbsp;pm, I received a faxed letter with no details about the Nimrods but a hand-written addendum from the Minister of State saying that there would be an announcement tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_213">On the related matter of job losses, the Ministry today issued a written statement on how many posts are set to go as part of the end-to-end logistics review. Part of the statement was provided to the House, but not the tables with the numbers, which were forwarded by the MOD three hours late. The details had to be faxed to me by a newspaper that had received them before me. That information confirms that almost 1,000&nbsp;posts are to be relocated or lost from bases in my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_214">How many points of order will it take for the Ministry of Defence properly to inform Parliament and parliamentarians about key issues relating to thousands of jobs? It is a scandalous abuse of Parliament that the service community and the media have been so cynically manipulated. What can you do, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to protect Parliament and parliamentarians so that announcements are made properly in this House?
</p>








<p><a name="st_225"><a name="50310-28_spnew1"><b> Sir Menzies Campbell  (North-East Fife) (LD):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The table to which the hon. Gentleman referred reveals that 160&nbsp;jobs will go at RAF Leuchars, which is in my constituency. Has any member of the Ministry of Defence team suggested making an oral statement to the House? Is it not right that, for the proper protection of those we represent, such announcements should be made in the House so that Ministers can be made to answer for them to those Members of Parliament whose constituents&#039; interests are directly affected?
</p>








<p><a name="st_226"><a name="50310-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Oliver Heald  (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It seems likely that we are about to suspend our proceedings while we await further messages from the other place about the Prevention of Terrorism Bill. Instead of suspending, what better opportunity is there for a Minister to come to the Chamber to make a proper statement so that we all know exactly what is happening about these important issues? That point was raised 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1759</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with the Leader of the House at business questions today. He said that he would take it up, so perhaps he can tell us exactly what he has done and exactly what is happening.
</p>








<p><a name="st_227"><a name="50310-28_spnew3"><b> Mr. Eric Forth  (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Should it not be your judgment that the House continue, could Ministers request an early resumption, ahead of the Lords messages, so that these matters can be properly dealt with? We have the ideal parliamentary opportunity to do so and it would be a pity if a petty procedural point got in the way of Ministers accounting to us for their actions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_228"><a name="50310-28_spnew4"><b> Mr. Paul Tyler  (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You will recall&#151;I think you were in the Chair at the time&#151;that I raised this matter with the Leader of the House. He promised to take urgent action to ensure that the Secretary of State for Defence was told of the concerns of hon. Members on both sides of the House about constituency matters of great importance to us and our constituents being announced in a written statement with no details when a briefing was given to the local media, but not to Members of Parliament. As the Leader of the House is in his place and as the House is sitting, may we have a statement from a Defence Minister?
</p>








<p><a name="st_229"><a name="50310-28_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson) for giving me notice that he intended to raise this point of order. Mr. Speaker has said on several occasions how concerned he is by cases in which the media are informed of official decisions relating to a Member&#039;s constituency before the House and Members are notified. It is also important, in Mr. Speaker&#039;s view, that such information should be provided in a timely, accurate and complete manner. I will of course draw the hon. Member&#039;s remarks to Mr. Speaker&#039;s attention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_215">In response to the further points of order that have been made, the House will know that the Chair cannot command the presence of a Minister. Whatever opportunities may exist have to be determined in another way. I hope that it has been noted that there is widespread concern that such incidents are unfortunately becoming less rare and that Members are rightly concerned, as is Mr. Speaker on their behalf. Members come first as far as important and sensitive information about their constituencies is concerned, and such information should be dealt with in a proper manner.
</p>








<p><a name="st_230"><a name="50310-28_spmin1"><b>The Leader of the House of Commons  (Mr. Peter Hain): </b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1760</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Speaker. I am well aware of the concerns of the House, which were expressed at business questions and have been vigorously reiterated this evening. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has been made aware of those concerns and will be made even more aware by the points that have been raised.
</p>








<p><a name="st_231"><a name="50310-28_spnew5"><b> Mr. A. J. Beith  (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am glad that the Leader of the House intervened at this point. Several references have been made to the possibility of a statement being made tomorrow, but the House is not sitting tomorrow, although it may continue to sit today for some time. Therefore, there will be no opportunity for a statement to be made and for Mr. Speaker&#039;s advice to be obeyed. That surely adds to the pressure for a Defence Minister to come to the House at some point this evening to meet the reasonable requests of Members.
</p>








<p><a name="st_232"><a name="50310-28_spnew6"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack  (South Staffordshire) (Con):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Can you confirm that Thursday can last until Sunday if necessary?
</p>








<p><a name="st_233"><a name="50310-28_spmin2"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 I can, with joy, confirm that to the hon. Gentleman. That is a parliamentary fact. The Leader of the House has heard what right hon. and hon. Members have had to say on this matter and the Chair cannot go further than that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_234"><a name="50310-28_spnew7"><b> Miss Anne McIntosh  (Vale of York) (Con):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I have just been given a copy of the table and it shows substantial changes for RAF Leeming in the Vale of York. The House now has an opportunity to discuss those changes, which will cause enormous concern across north Yorkshire, and it is astounding that we cannot do so.
</p>








<p><a name="st_235"><a name="50310-28_spmin3"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 I am obviously concerned that the hon. Lady&#039;s constituency will also be affected, but the general point has been well made. It must be left now to the Government to decide how to respond.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_219">I turn first to Lords reasons 38A, 39A, 40A, etc. The effect of the Lords motion is that the Lords have insisted on their amendment to the schedule that provides for the Lord Chief Justice to make the rules and to require rules of court to be compatible with article 6&nbsp;of the European convention on human rights and have proposed a different procedure for the making of first rules. We do not accept that that set of proposals is sensible. First, the Lord Chief Justice does not make rules of court. Secondly, the rules must be compatible with article 6&nbsp;in any event.

<a name="50310-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_231">Under these amendments, the appeal provisions will come within the scope of the review, as will the arrangements for reviewing the Act once passed.

<a name="stpa_234">My proposal of last night was for the annual renewal of the Act with a vote in both Houses of Parliament to look at that situation. The proposal in the Bill enables the House to vote annually on the need to continue the capacity to make derogating control orders, if at some future stage we decide to derogate. I gave a commitment to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#039;s Bush (Mr. Soley) yesterday to have discussion across all parties after the election about the best way of taking this legislation forward.

<a name="stpa_237">On the basis of these proposals, we do not feel that we need a further Privy Council review or an additional review committee, and it is total nonsense to remove the annual review of the Act. To be quite frank, the amendment passed in the other place is an offence against the excellent current reviewer, Lord Carlile of Berriew, and the work he is doing in carrying that through. To suggest he is not doing good work in this matter was a serious mistake by the Lords, in my opinion. I am determined that we insist on our disagreement with the amendments so as to maintain the existence of the independent reviewer. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I suggest that colleagues look at what he said in the debate in the House of Lords. He did not agree with himself being abolished in the way suggested by this particular proposal&#151;not surprisingly, because he has done a pretty good independent, non-politically partisan job, to which we should all pay respect and tribute. That is why I am determined that we insist on our disagreement with the Lords amendments and thus maintain the existence of the independent reviewer.

During the debate last week, the hon. and learned Member for Redcar made an exceptionally good speech in which she explained why the distinction between derogating and non-derogating orders should be removed.

<a name="stpa_249">My point concerns review by the judiciary of derogating and non-derogating clauses. I take the view that the House was seriously misled yesterday and when we debated the matter before. This is a central issue. The Government make a distinction between derogating and non-derogating issues; I do not accept that distinction, but the Government make it. In respect of derogating issues&#151;house arrest&#151;the Government provide that the court will have full powers to look at the facts and to come to its own conclusions. So far, so good. I would reluctantly accept that, if it were the case for all the orders.

<a name="stpa_250">Non-derogating orders are not mere chaff in the system. They will involve people&#039;s right to work, to associate and to move, and their being tagged and electronically monitored. They are as close to the pass laws in South Africa as it is possible to get, and they are a serious matter. The question that the House must ask is whether there will be proper judicial review of those proceedings. The House has been told on several occasions that there will be, because the court will be allowed to consider the orders, but it may do so only on the basis of judicial review. The basis of judicial review does not allow a court to reopen the case and look at the facts on which the order was made. It is worth repeating that point time and again. Assurances to the House, whether from Front or Back Benchers, and from people who should know better, are simply wrong. The House must take that on board.

Judicial review comes from the prerogative writs&#151;ancient writs in this country&#151;which were always and deliberately set out on the basis that judges should not question decisions taken by the Executive&#151;quite right, too.

The test in the Bill is very plain&#151;are there reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is engaged in terrorism? The only way of assessing that is to look at the evidence and evaluate it. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1777</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The judge must act as the gatekeeper for the Home Secretary in evaluating the evidence and concluding whether his proposal is within a range of reasonable responses to that evidence. If he finds that it is outside the range of reasonable responses, he will quash it and it will never get off the ground.

<a name="stpa_269">There is an additional element that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)&#151;and he is my friend&#151;missed out. Since the prerogative writs of the 17th century, the element of proportionality has come in as another important test that is, again, based on the evidence. That came in with the Human Rights Act 1998. What changed my mind was the putting of the judge first and requiring him to be responsible for these decisions&#151;to gate-keep. I am satisfied that the judges will develop an excellent jurisprudence because of that responsibility, which will ensure the maximum amount of fairness for the individuals involved.

<a name="50310-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_273">It is my clear view that hon. Members are misguided in concentrating on the burden of proof. The distinction between reasonable cause to suspect that someone is involved in terrorism and it&#039;s being more probable than not is not worth dying in a ditch for. Hon. Members should concentrate on firming up the admirable concessions that the Home Secretary made yesterday on giving defendants a better deal by reorganising the special advocacy system so that they are likely to get to know more about their case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_274">Differences in the burden of proof pale into insignificance next to the concessions that my right hon. Friend has made. If hon. Members are interested in justice for defendants, they should concentrate on those concessions so that they can be reduced to paper to ensure that the special advocate system will be examined and that defendants get a better deal. That is truly the right way forward. It was clear in yesterday&#039;s debate that, if Conservative Members take a realistic approach to justice for defendants, they will find my right hon. Friend helpful. He plainly suggested that yesterday. I therefore conclude that that is the obvious route to take. If Conservative Members do not take it, they must simply be playing politics because there is a clear way in which to improve the Bill now.
</p>








<p><a name="st_333"><a name="50310-34_spnew10"><b> Mr. Kenneth Clarke  (Rushcliffe) (Con):</b> 
 I spoke about judicial review yesterday and I agree with the speech that the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) made earlier and with the speech that the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) made on the same subject previously. Anyone who believes that a case has been made in which the merits of the issue are put in the hands of the judge has been misled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_275">With respect, I do not agree with the hon. and learned Member for Redcar that the difference between reasonable suspicion and the balance of probabilities is purely academic. No other part of the law is treated in that way. There will be cases in which there are plenty of grounds for suspicion but one feels that the man is probably innocent. If the Bill is allowed to proceed, someone in that position will be subject to all its rigours.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_276">Let me consider briefly the advice of the Security Service&#151;the new point on which the Home Secretary placed particular stress. Surely he could share a little more of the Security Service advice on the burden of proof and on the sunset clause. The only argument that I have heard advanced about the burden of proof is that the Security Service insists on it. I find that unlikely. If that is Security Service advice, it must have peculiar lawyers. I am sure that we shall revert to the point later and I should like the Home Secretary to let us know whether the Security Service says that we should have a balance of probabilities, not reasonable suspicion.

<a name="50310-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_277">On the sunset clause, is the Security Service saying that it is not acceptable for us to give ourselves 12&nbsp;months in which to produce a new Bill, and do the Government believe that they have to press on with it for that reason?

<a name="stpa_278">The Downing street spokesman on behalf of the Prime Minister gave the genuine reason this afternoon. He totally prejudged this evening&#039;s proceedings. Downing street has instructed the Home Office to come along with all those reasons. The spokesman said that to amend the Bill further would send the wrong message to the terrorists and the police and security services, and that that applied not just to the sunset clause but to the burden of proof. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) exposed to ridicule brilliantly, I think, the idea that this is a message to terrorists.

 The first amendment relates to the making and judicial supervision of control orders, including the standard of proof. The effect of my amendment is to require an inter partes directions hearing to be held within seven days of the court granting the Secretary of State permission to issue&#151;or, as the case may be, confirming&#151;his non-derogating control order. The purpose of my amendment is to provide yet another safeguard in the procedure to ensure that the individual concerned will be involved fully in the proceedings at the earliest possible stage. So, there would now be three stages: an application for permission from the Secretary of State; a prima facie ex parte hearing followed by an inter partes directions hearing to see how the matter might be disposed of; and then a further inter partes full hearing. My amendment would therefore provide for an additional safeguard of further intervention into that process. That would give all parties an early opportunity

<a name="stpa_295">As well as that amendment, we want to insist on our previous position with regard to the standard of proof. There are a couple of additional points that I want to make to the House concerning standard of proof, because it is a very important matter. I want to make it clear that these are preventive orders, not punishment, which is important to the standard of proof issue; that we are talking about an assessment of intelligence rather than necessary evidence of proof of fact; and that we are talking about a risk assessment process. I want to draw to the House&#039;s attention the statement of Lord Justice Laws when he was considering the A case in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. I do not think that this quote has been used before. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;the nature of the subject matter is such that it will, as I have indicated very often, usually be impossible to prove past facts which make the case that X is a terrorist.

<p><a name="st_355"><a name="50310-38_spnew2"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 I just want to finish this point. Both SIAC and the Court of Appeal accepted reasonable suspicion as the right level of proof in those cases. It is very important to make that point.
</p>








<p><a name="st_356"><a name="50310-38_spnew3"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I have to say to the hon. Lady that far from not having heard that quote before, it has been bandied around almost ad nauseam. If that is her objection, she could argue that the derogating orders that she is making, which will be made on the balance of probabilities, should not in fact be made on the balance of probabilities at all. Why does she accept that derogating orders should be made on the balance of probabilities, yet persist in this frankly cussed refusal to have the balance of probabilities on non-derogating orders?
</p>








<p><a name="st_357"><a name="50310-38_spnew4"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 Even at this early hour of the morning, I am attempting to be moderate and measured, and I hope that the debate will be conducted in that fashion. As we have made clear on several previous occasions, we have accepted the balance of probabilities for derogating orders because deprivation of liberty is a severe sanction. However, we do not accept it for non-derogating orders because there is a distinction between restrictions on liberty and deprivation of liberty. That is a clear position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_296">The orders, as well as being preventive, not punitive, are about anticipating and disrupting terrorism. They are an assessment of risk, and I genuinely believe that hon. Members are trying to constrain a preventive framework in a traditional criminal justice system, which is about proof of events after the fact, evidence and an adversarial mechanism. I believe that hon. Members have not taken seriously the fact that we are trying to anticipate and prevent rather than simply prove things after the event, which happens in the traditional criminal justice system.

</p>








<p><a name="st_365"><a name="50310-38_spnew10"><b> Mr. Garnier </b> 
: The Minister tried to distinguish between a total deprivation of liberty&#151;house detention&#151;and a restriction on liberty, that is, a non-derogating order. Does she not understand that the Human Rights Act 1998, which the Government introduced, makes it clear that any such conduct could amount to a penalty under that legislation? <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister may snigger, but we are considering human rights and it makes no difference whether the Government are depriving a citizen of all his liberties or merely some. It still constitutes a penalty. Surely the higher not the lower standard of proof should apply.

<p><a name="st_366"><a name="50310-38_spnew11"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The hon. and learned Gentleman is experienced enough in the law to know that article 5&nbsp;of the European convention on human rights makes a distinction between restrictions on and deprivation of liberty. We have proceeded on that basis.

<a name="50310-39_para0">
<a name="stpa_297">I have listened on several occasions when she and the Home Secretary have tried to draw a distinction between derogating and non-derogating orders. Does she not agree that the consequences of derogating and non-derogating orders are penal? The only difference is a matter of degree.

<p><a name="st_370"><a name="50310-39_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 No, I think that I have said on several occasions that these orders are not punishments, they are about prevention. I have also explained that there is a proper reason for the distinction between the two orders set out in article 5.

<a name="50310-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_298">I now wish to move to the second area of concern of the Lords and my amendments in relation to having an independent reviewer rather than a committee of Privy Councillors. My further amendment shortens the period in which the first report of the independent reviewer must be submitted to nine months, and provides explicitly in the Bill for his report to include the implications for the operation of the Act of any proposal made by the Secretary of State for changing the law relating to terrorism. That has two effects. First, it would ensure that the renewal debates that we will hold in the House will be informed by the report on the operation of the whole Act by the independent reviewer. On that basis, our debates will be more informed. Secondly, it would include in the Bill the Home Secretary&#039;s commitment that the independent reviewer should consider specifically in his report the implications for the operation of this Act, once passed, of any new proposals or legislation on counter-terrorism.

 Once again, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we have an example of how the Government lack any frankness in their dealings with the House. The question that my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) asked about what the Prime Minister said classically illustrates how the Government gloss the truth to suit their convenience. Instead of coming to the House, asking frankly for measures deemed necessary and engaging in proper debate, the Government spend their entire time fast-tracking the process, putting out spin, deceiving the public and then asking us to rubber-stamp their activities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-40_para0">
<a name="stpa_307">Let us examine the three issues of contention that now appear to remain. First, the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety has told the House that she cannot accept that the distinction between derogating and non-derogating measures should disappear and she proposes instead a most deliciously complicated further tier of bureaucracy in an attempt to avoid the issue. Let me tell the Minister that as a recipe for further legal challenges, it would take some beating. I ask myself why the Government are going to such absurd lengths to avoid doing the sensible thing that the other place has asked for&#151;treating derogating and non-derogating orders identically.
</p>

<a name="50310-40_para1">
<a name="stpa_308">If what the Minister says is right, the derogating orders that the Secretary of State is keeping as an &quot;important reserve power&quot; that he may have to use in extremis, are, on her own analysis, completely valueless. I simply do not understand why the Minister keeps on refusing to do the simple and straightforward thing&#151;indeed, the very thing that the Government originally gave the impression to the other place that they were going to do, which is to treat derogating and non-derogating orders identically. There is no explanation for that other than the Government&#039;s absolute determination not to be seen to be amenable to reason. If that is an example of the Government&#039;s common sense that they want to convey to the public, it takes some beating. There is no justification for the distinction.

It is obvious that a proper and full review by Privy Councillors would be better than one by a single, independent reviewer.

The amendment before the House means that when the renewal order is considered every year, it will be based on the independent review given to Parliament. That review will not be some Government thing on the side, as Parliament will examine it. As always, he simply does not understand what he is talking about.

That is why I think that the House should demand it. There is no reason for not having such a report.

 On control orders specifically, the very fact that the security services and the police forces are asking for this measure seems to suggest that, however imperfect, we are trying to deliver a vehicle that is fit for purpose.

<a name="stpa_323">In the light of what has occurred, when the Prime Minister gave a clear account that the security services had said that it was against the sunset clause, yet we now know from the Minister that that is not the case, clearly the Prime Minister must come here and apologise to the House.

 Order. I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s remark helped the situation. Let&nbsp;us get back to the central issue of the debate. I say to the House, let every right hon. and hon. Member be heard properly.
</p>








<p><a name="st_427"><a name="50310-42_spnew7"><b> Mr. Foulkes: </b> 
 I am grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

<a name="50310-42_para2">
<a name="stpa_325">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield spoke about a serious interference in liberty. This is a serious matter. As I said, I went through to hear the Lord Chancellor, and I want to make just one point. The Lord Chancellor pointed out to the other place that it had asked the Government to make five changes in the Bill. The Government had accepted four of those five changes&#151;80&nbsp;per cent. of what the House of Lords asked us for. The Lord Chancellor went on to say, &quot;Accept the primacy of the House of Commons.&quot; For a third time, the House of Lords rejected the primacy of the House of Commons. That is not a serious interference in liberty; it is a serious interference in democracy.


</p>








<p><a name="st_428"><a name="50310-42_spnew8"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 Earlier in our debates, the Home Secretary made a perfectly reasonable plea, which was that in these serious matters of counter-terrorism, the Government have a right to ask for the trust of the House of Commons in trying to come to their conclusions. That is why I say to the Home Secretary that it is with the heart of that trust that we are concerned tonight. The sunset clause is so important because we cannot trust the people who are asking for our trust.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-42_para3">
<a name="stpa_326">I merely say to the Home Secretary that for him to pray in aid the security services, and for it then to be proved that the security services have not asked for one of the key things that he implied they had asked for, and that the Prime Minister said they had asked for, is to remove the trust of this House.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-42_para5">
<a name="stpa_328">That is what he said. The security services and the police have advised us categorically and clearly, as they should do, on measures. They have advised us quite explicitly that we should not change the burden of proof for non-derogating control orders. The reason why they have given that advice is very simply because they know, as do we, that there are certain people who are dangerous to the country, but could not be controlled if such a situation existed.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The House is this morning debating matters of the most fundamental importance to our country. They relate to the protection of our country from the threat of terrorism, and the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1811</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>fundamental liberties of the people of this country. It is essential for the future confidence in this House, and the political system as a whole, that these debates take place on the basis of the truth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-42_para6">
<a name="stpa_329">On Wednesday, in answer to a question from me, the Prime Minister said that it would not be wise to accept either the amendment on the sunset clause, or the other amendment to which the Home Secretary referred, because that would be

<p>
<a name="50310-42_para7">
<a name="stpa_330">It is now crystal clear that that is not the case. Is it not essential, in the interests of the body politic of this country, that the Prime Minister now come to the House to withdraw a statement that the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety this morning, and the Lord Chancellor earlier, said was not an accurate statement of the position?
</p>








<p><a name="st_431"><a name="50310-42_spmin3"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 I have given the Leader of the Opposition some latitude to put that on the record. However, I must say to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that the Chair has no power to command a Minister to attend the House&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Order. I do not need the advice of hon. Gentlemen. The Chair cannot intervene to cause a Minister to appear. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has made his point, but there is nothing that the Chair can do to advance it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_432"><a name="50310-42_spnew11"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Is it in order to ask the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) to read out verbatim the statement to which he referred, in every respect, and in particular to ask him to read out the Prime Minister&#039;s observation that the suggestion of a change to the burden of proof was not recommended by the security services in such a way? Let the right hon. and learned Gentleman read out the whole <i>Hansard</i> quotation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_433"><a name="50310-42_spmin4"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 We are now clearly moving from a point of order on to a point of debate, but I am mindful that we are still attempting to listen to the contribution of the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer). I think that we would do better to return to the mainstream of the debate.

 In column 1510, the word &quot;either&quot; refers to both those issues&#151;that cannot be gainsaid. However, even if there were a slip of the tongue and that was not quite what the Prime Minister meant, if he respected the seriousness of the issue he would be here to listen to our debate and defend the way in which he had expressed himself. The problem is that on previous occasions the Prime Minister has appeared not to tell exactly the truth in certain circumstances.

<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1812</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_437"><a name="50310-43_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 I regret my infelicity and I withdraw any indication that the Prime Minister meant to say something that was untrue. I shall use more felicitous phrasing: there are many people both outside and inside the House who have misunderstood what the Prime Minister said, including the Home Secretary.
</p>








<p><a name="st_438"><a name="50310-43_spnew3"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am grateful to you both for clarification and for seeking a withdrawal of the comment by the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer). I hope you agree that it is important to the House that he withdraw unequivocally the suggestion that the Prime Minister made that interpretation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_439"><a name="50310-43_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 No one should accuse any right hon. or hon. Member of untruthfulness or deceit. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) has withdrawn any suggestion that he was making such an allegation. What is at issue is a matter of judgment&#151;there is no question but that it is a matter of contention, and is not something on which the Chair can rule.
</p>








<p><a name="st_440"><a name="50310-43_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 When a misunderstanding of such importance has occurred&#151;indeed, it has clearly arisen on both sides of the House&#151;it must be put right. That becomes more necessary the graver the issue. That is why I want to answer a comment made by the right hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes). Everybody in the House is trying to do a very difficult thing and protect the nation against terrorism while at the same time upholding human rights so that terrorism does not grow among individuals who have legitimate grounds for believing that their human rights may have been invaded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-43_para0">
<a name="stpa_331">It is legitimate for us to disagree about how to deal with these things, and it is therefore proper for the Government to make sure that if their judgments turn out to be wrong, we have a ready opportunity to put that right. That is why the sunset clause is so important. It gives the House an honourable opportunity: if what is done for all sorts of reasons in haste and with many misunderstandings&#151;I am not making any allegations&#151;turns out to be less than the best, we will assuredly and without peradventure have a chance to get it right. People who accuse Conservative Members of being anything other than staunchly opposed to terrorism are wrong. We are so strongly opposed to terrorism that we want the best legislation that we can get, we want to make it work and we want a Prime Minister who can be trusted not to be misunderstood by his own Home Secretary.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The Home Secretary invited us to read the passage from <i>Hansard</i> that led to the previous exchanges. This is what the Prime Minister said&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>

<p><a name="st_445"><a name="50310-44_spnew0"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 The Prime Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;I am afraid that we are not prepared to accept either the amendment on the sunset clause or the other amendment voted for by the House of Lords, and which the Conservatives in the House of Lords backed, to change the burden of proof.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-44_para0">
<a name="stpa_334">He said &quot;either&quot; and &quot;or&quot;. He continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;That would not be wise; it would be contrary to the strong advice given to us by our security services and our police, and I am simply not prepared to do it.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-44_para1">
<a name="stpa_335">That was clearly referring to both the amendments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-44_para2">
<a name="stpa_336">There is another quotation&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>








<p><a name="st_446"><a name="50310-44_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. The right hon. and learned Gentleman must be very clear&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Order. This is a very serious matter. The right hon. and learned Gentleman must be very clear about making a point of order that the Chair can deal with.
</p>








<p><a name="st_447"><a name="50310-44_spnew1"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 I have to lay the foundations for it. There is another quotation from <i>Hansard</i>. At column 1511, the Prime Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;We have made concessions that we think are reasonable; we will not make those that are against the direct advice that we are receiving.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 9&nbsp;March 2005; Vol. 431, c. 1510-11.]</p>

<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-44_para3">
<a name="stpa_337">The Prime Minister is in the precincts&#151;he voted in the previous Division. Is there any precedent for a Prime Minister who is present in the precincts of this Palace, and against whom such accusations have been made, to fail to have the courage to come to the Dispatch Box&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>








<p><a name="st_448"><a name="50310-44_spmin2"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. I understand the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s point of order but it only adds to a point of order that has already been made this evening. Everybody in the Chamber, and those outside, will have heard the point of order. The Chair has no responsibility for bringing Ministers or Prime Ministers&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Order. I repeat that the Chair has no responsibility for bringing Ministers or Prime Ministers to the House. The right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s point is on the record and the House must make its own judgment about it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_449"><a name="50310-44_spnew2"><b> Mr. Charles Kennedy  (Ross, Skye and Inverness, West) (LD):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Given your ruling of a moment ago and the definite ambiguity, to say the least, that exists, would it be in order for you to request that the Prime Minister or the Government place the available evidence in the Library, so that an objective judgment can be formed since, clearly, the Prime Minister is not coming to the House to explain?
</p>








<p><a name="st_450"><a name="50310-44_spmin3"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 I can only repeat what I have already said. The Chair does not have responsibility for those matters and cannot insist on them. The Chamber will have heard the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s points, and those inside and outside it will have to make their judgment about what has happened this evening.
</p>








<p><a name="st_451"><a name="50310-44_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I want to make it clear to the House&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is an important matter for the record of the House. The words that the Leader of the Opposition read out are followed by several statements by the Prime Minister. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">&quot;The point of principle is on the control orders and the burden of proof.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 9&nbsp;March 2005; Vol. 431, c. 1511.]</p>

 I must inform the House that a message has been brought from the Lords as follows. The Lords insist on their amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism Bill to which the Commons have insisted on their disagreement. They insist on their disagreement to the amendments proposed by the Commons on which the Commons had insisted, and they disagree to the amendments proposed by the Commons in lieu for which insistences and disagreements they assign their reasons. Copies of the Lords reasons are available in the Vote Office, as are the Government&#039;s propositions relating to the message. All Government proposals are being debated together.

<br>&nbsp;<br>amendment No. 1, insists on its disagreement to Lords amendments Nos. 12, 13, 15, 17, 22, 28&nbsp;and 37&nbsp;and insists on its amendments Nos. 37A to 37C and 37E to 37O, does not insist on its amendment No. 37V, insists on its disagreement to Lords amendments Nos. 37Q to 37T proposed in lieu of Lords amendment No. 8&nbsp;and insists on its amendments Nos. 17H to 17M to the words restored to the Bill by its insistence on its disagreement to Lords amendment No. 17&nbsp;and proposes amendment (a) in lieu.
</p>








<p><a name="st_464"><a name="50310-46_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 With this we will discuss Lords reasons 8B, 12C, 13C, 15C, 17P, 22C, 27F, 28C, 31D, 32D and Government motion to insist &c. and Government amendment (a), and Lords reason 33H and Government motion to insist &c. and Government amendments (a) and (b) and Lords reason 37W.

<p><a name="st_465"><a name="50310-46_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 It is perhaps appropriate that we hope to complete the passage of the Bill today, on the first anniversary of the tragic Madrid bombing. That is a sad reminder of the reality with which all Members of this House and the other place must deal when considering these matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-46_para1">
<a name="stpa_352">I am proposing three amendments to the Bill. The question of the making of non-derogating control orders, the burden of proof and the judicial supervision of non-derogating control orders relates to Lords reason 1F. My amendment provides that when the Secretary of State applies to the court for permission to make a non-derogating control order, he or she must supply the court with a copy of the order that he or she proposes to make.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-46_para2">
<a name="stpa_353">We have been having a debate on the question of the Privy Council review versus an independent reviewer, which relates to Lords reasons 27F, 31D and 32D. My amendment provides that the independent annual reviewer must comment on the extent of the Secretary of State&#039;s use of the urgency procedure in relation to the making of non-derogating control orders in his report. That is an effort to meet the concerns expressed on my side of the House about the use of the urgency procedure and to ensure that that matter is properly in the public domain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-46_para3">
<a name="stpa_354">The third amendment that I propose deals with the question of annual renewal versus a sunset clause, which is covered by Lords reason 33H. My amendment would require the Secretary of State to consult the director general of the Security Service before making the annual renewal order.

</p>








<p><a name="st_471"><a name="50310-46_spnew6"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am afraid that I am eerily familiar with the point that the hon. Gentleman wishes to make. Indeed, he made it to me in the Lobby only a few 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1828</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>minutes ago. I think that I would like the debate to proceed on the issues before the House rather than his specific questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-46_para4">
<a name="stpa_355">The story of the night both here and in the other House is that of a series of constructive moves made by this House. I shall list only the issues raised overnight&#151;not the ones raised previously. We have proposed using the affirmative procedure in respect of the rules of court. We have proposed providing a wider role for the independent reviewer so that he or she can look at the whole Act. We have taken steps to ensure that the independent reviewer&#039;s report will be available so that the annual renewal debate on the Act can be proper and informed. We wish to include in the Bill the requirement for the Secretary of State to ask the independent reviewer to comment specifically on the implications for the Act of any future legislation on terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-46_para5">
<a name="stpa_356">We have proposed putting a specific requirement on the Secretary of State to consult the independent reviewer before laying an order to renew the control order powers each year. We have proposed measures to include additional protection for the subjects of non-derogating control orders in the Bill and specifically to enshrine existing procedures to ensure that exculpatory material will be disclosed to the court and the special advocate in all cases, and also to the subject of the order, unless that is contrary to the public interest. We have moved amendments to allow the disclosure of unused material unless that is contrary to the public interest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-46_para6">
<a name="stpa_357">I have read that long list of the constructive moves made by the Government and the House to try to meet concerns expressed throughout the whole House and in the other place because it shows that we want to find constructive solutions. I contrast the approach of the Government and the Commons to the zero movement&#151;that is literally the case&#151;of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats who control the other place. In 12&nbsp;hours, there have been two rounds of consideration, but there has not been any movement at all. There have been two separate sessions in the Lords with zero response. Theirs is a stick-in-the mud response in which they have dug their heels into the sand and prevented the elected House from carrying out its proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-46_para7">
<a name="stpa_358">The country needs a Bill that prevents terrorism and protects our people. Our constituents, who elect us to the House, need that protection, and that is why we are addressing the issue in this way. I believe that it is time for the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in the other place to respect the considered views of the elected Chamber. I urge the House to support the amendments and I urge Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members in the other place to give us their support.
</p>








<p><a name="st_472"><a name="50310-46_spnew7"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I am sorry that the night has not brought the Home Secretary good counsel. I rather hoped that when we reassembled this morning a greater degree of clarity and common sense would prevail. Instead, we have had a repetition of the same old mantras. The Home Secretary said that he is making a major concession, but it appears that that means giving a copy of the order to the person concerned. He knows that the distinction that he continues to try to make between derogating and non-derogating orders is wrong and absurd. The logical conclusion of his argument is that derogating orders are valueless, as was explained by the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1829</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Community Safety last night. There is no reason why non-derogating orders should not be subject to the same protection as derogating orders. Having had his moment of clarity, it is extraordinary that the Home Secretary is still unable and unwilling to give a logical explanation of why he will not concede that point, which we believe is of great importance.

<a name="stpa_359">The liberty of the individual must be protected, miscarriages of justice must be prevented, and if this anti-terrorism legislation is to work and command public approval in all communities in this country it must be seen to be transparently fair. It is extraordinary that the Home Secretary is prepared to tolerate a system in which there is inherent and manifest unfairness. The explanations that he has offered to justify it are frankly gobbledygook. We are told that there is a major concession on Privy Council review&#151;there is not. The extent of the urgent procedure may be looked at by the independent reviewer, but there has been no attempt by the Home Secretary to engage with the value and merits of a full Privy Council review.

<a name="stpa_360">Finally, there is the issue of the sunset clause. The Home Secretary does not seem to have grasped the significance of the sunset clause to Parliament as a whole. This legislation is unusual and draconian, and it would be wrong to put something on the statute book that has the capacity to become permanent. There is no reason why the sunset clause should not be included in the Bill, and the mechanisms that the Home Secretary is giving himself to renew the legislation by order are fundamentally flawed and wrong. If the Home Secretary thinks that there will be movement in the other place on that point, he is profoundly mistaken, because it is of such importance.

 Does the hon. Gentleman remember that when the Government last came to us, in 2001, with emergency powers to deal with terrorism, there was tension between the two Houses and a deadline to meet? However, a resolution was achieved because two principles were accepted by the Government&#151;first, that there should be due process throughout, and secondly, that there should be a sunset clause. When the Government accepted those proposals, there was movement and both Houses came to an agreement.

Can the hon.

 The upper House has engaged itself as a revising Chamber, and it has put forward suggestions for improving the legislation&#151;that is exactly what it should be doing. It is now being subjected to a battle of attrition by the Government to try to whittle down the overwhelming view expressed there, not only by Conservative and Liberal Democrat peers but by Cross Benchers and even some of the Government&#039;s own peers. That is the extent of the problem that the Government face, and until they start to listen, they will continue to have a problem. All that I can say to the Home Secretary is that I hope that during the passage of the morning he may come to have a little more sense, because he can have this Bill and the protections that it offers, and at the same time, civil liberties can be protected; at the moment, they are not. The House should support the Lords amendments.

 At first, one could characterise this Bill as a nasty little Bill because we live in a nasty little world. I abstained on Second and Third Reading because I wanted the Home Secretary to make concessions. To my mind, he has done so, and I have been happy to vote with the Government when the Bill has recently been before the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-47_para3">
<a name="stpa_364">There are currently three sticking points. The first sticking point is the sunset clause. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) tells us that a sunset clause is necessary because otherwise the Bill, when enacted, could go on and on. He seems to forget the fundamental constitutional principle that one Parliament cannot bind another, that we will have a general election within the next 18&nbsp;months, because constitutionally we must, and that any subsequent Parliament can look at this legislation again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-47_para4">
<a name="stpa_365">The second sticking point is the question of Privy Councillors conducting the review. I remind hon. Members that myriad independent reviews in the past were not carried out by Privy Councillors, and they were in no way the lapdogs of Government. If we think back to the previous Government, we had the Scarman inquiry, and the Scott inquiry into Matrix Churchill. Just because a review is carried out by an independent person does not mean that the inquiry is a stitch-up from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-47_para5">
<a name="stpa_366">The third sticking point involves non-derogating control orders and the burden of proof. I can see why the Conservatives argue for that principle, but it has not been a principle in the past and is not a principle in many parts of our criminal law. If someone is remanded in custody, that is because there is a reasonable suspicion that they have committed an offence. They can be remanded in custody for weeks. Under the previous Government, as some Members may recall, there was the case of Mr. Osman, who fought extradition from

The Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives have made no concessions, yet the Government have made them as part of the debate in the Chamber and in the other place, and I respect my Government for that. I shall continue voting with them because I do not wish to be in a position whereby the House of Lords dictates to us and does not engage in proper concessions.

<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1834</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>because it was appropriate, that the emergency arrangements were a necessary part of the construction of those control orders. We have sought to find any number of ways of constructing an appropriate legal framework in which those control orders could be made.

It is important to read the Lords reasons. Reason 1F states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;Because the Lords remain of the view that reasonable suspicion is too low a test; that the authority to conduct a prosecution should be the Director of Public Prosecutions and not the chief of the relevant police force; and that all control orders should be subject to the same procedure before the courts.&quot;</p>

 We are engaging&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Answer.&quot;] I am answering the question. We are engaged in a process of dialogue that I hope will result in justice for the people of this country. The honest answer is that, ultimately, the House of Commons must of course be the prime House. I have no quarrel about that, and nor would any of my noble Friends at the other end of the Corridor. I return to what they are saying: it is not that the House must not have the anti-terrorism proposals that the Home Secretary has put forward&#151;but there is a perfectly proper argument that reasonable suspicion is too low a test. We heard the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), in an earlier speech, saying that we do not even accept that for a parking ticket for British citizens, yet we are prepared to accept it for deprivation of liberty. I take that seriously, and I hope that Members on the other side of the Chamber take it seriously. They would have done so in previous years and previous debates, so I hope that they still do.

<a name="stpa_372">The second component is that the prosecution should be conducted by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Home Secretary has acknowledged that principle.

He may have noticed that we are now down to three propositions as the areas of differentiation. Initially, we were very concerned, as I said, about the whole concept of control orders. We have accepted that. We were concerned about reasonable suspicion for an emergency control, as a matter of principle.

 Let me take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point at face value. What is proposed in these control orders is a whole spectrum of controls, ranging from minimal matters to serious restrictions on the liberties of the individual. There is no sharp dividing line. At one end there is what has been described as home arrest; at the other there is merely reporting to a police station, or something of that sort. Between the two, there are what can only be construed as serious deprivations of liberty, which could fall short of a derogation. I think it entirely reasonable to have a common judicial process.

These matters are too serious for us to engage in knockabout across the Chamber, which I think does nothing for the reputation of the House. It is time we sat round the table and arrived at a consensus so that we can get these measures on the statute book. Why? Because it is the anniversary of a major atrocity in a European city and because we have been told that there are dangerous terrorists who need to be locked up for the protection of our citizens, but are now walking freely the streets of Britain. Those are the reasons why we need the legislation to go through in a form acceptable to this and the other House. It is time we sat down and ensured that that happens.

 When I became a Minister in 1997, a wise older politician said to me, &quot;John, before you take a major decision, just remember how it will look at the public inquiry into the subsequent disaster.&quot; Some of us fear that, in the years to come, there may be a public inquiry into how al-Qaeda were able to mount the attack that they succeeded in getting away with, despite the best efforts of our security services. I have to say that if a video were shown of the proceedings of this and the other House, it would not reflect well on the efforts being made to protect this country from terrorism.

In every single case, the way through was found in support of the position of the democratically elected Chamber of Parliament.

<a name="50310-49_para7">

<br>&nbsp;<br>voted regularly for the prevention of terrorism Acts, which gave the Secretary of State the power to determine where British citizens should live. He had that power not after going to a judge, not on reasonable suspicion, not on any legal test or procedure, but simply because the man who is now the Leader of the Opposition said, &quot;You are not living there, sunshine, and that is an end to it&#151;no argument.&quot; The party that voted for that cannot sensibly now say that the argument about the level of proof is sufficient to provoke a constitutional crisis.

: Earlier, my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) reminded the House about internment. This Bill proposes a form of internment, albeit with different gradations. People will be detained not for what they do but for what they might do. That, fundamentally, is what internment is, and everyone agrees that it led to massive recruitment to the IRA. Given that the definition of terrorism has such a low threshold, it is my serious view that by proceeding in this way we will incite more people to anger and make it more likely that they will support terrorist organisations. Therefore, I think that the revising House needs to restrain this House from making such a major error, especially as our procedures have been found so wanting.

<a name="stpa_383">It is of course possible for two people to have a reasonable difference of opinion as to whether the Bill is right, but I repeat that the Opposition never thought it necessary to have any judicial process or legal constraint before restricting the rights of British citizens. The House has considered the Bill and has reached the view&#151;it is the same as mine&#151;that the current legal test is satisfactory and adequate, as it must be scrutinised by a judge, who must agree that the evidence justifies the nature of the restriction order.

<p><a name="st_527"><a name="50310-50_spnew1"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 No. Two reasonable people can disagree about introducing a sunset clause into the Bill or providing for annual renewal, but the fundamental issue is whether we in this House, and the other place, should have the democratic ability, every year, to get rid of this legislation if we do not like it. That has been established as a result of the changes made to the Bill, and it is not the basis for a constitutional crisis between this House and the other place.
</p>








<p><a name="st_528"><a name="50310-50_spnew2"><b> Mr. Beith </b> 
: I would like to take the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s mind back to the debates on the annual renewal of the prevention of terrorism Act, which are essentially the mechanism that the Government have so far agreed for a reconsideration of that Act year by year. The dilemma that faced the Labour party year after year was whether to oppose the renewal, in the face of the argument that Labour would prove soft on terrorism if it did, because it was a take-it-or-leave it situation. Does he realise that that will be the situation under this Bill unless we have a mechanism whereby the Bill lapses and must be replaced by new and better legislation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_529"><a name="50310-50_spnew3"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 Of course the process of annual renewal can be limited; it was under the prevention of terrorism Act. It is a genuine and reasonable difference of opinion that one can have about a sunset clause as opposed to annual renewal. Is that a basis, however, for saying that the differences are so great that this House and its democratic majority should be overruled by an unelected Chamber? I do not think that it is.

<a name="50310-50_para0">
<a name="stpa_387">My point is this: this Chamber has improved this legislation considerably since its introduction by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. As very often in the House, decisions in another place have had an impact and have been taken into account. Equally, the legislation has been changed by the actions of Members here&#151;let us be honest, partly by those Members who did not vote for it on this side who might have been expected to, and partly by a number of Members who did vote for the Government but perhaps have made it clear that we wanted to see changes made.

 Has my hon. Friend analysed the Home Secretary&#039;s amendment (a), which is supposed to give us comfort because it provides judicial oversight?

 My hon. and learned Friend is completely right. He demonstrates the fact that the Bill itself is fundamentally flawed.

 The plain fact is that the Bill is fundamentally flawed on all the principles on which it is being proposed. It does not secure the nation. It is liable to create further trouble and dissention among those whom we are seeking to control&#151;the terrorists. It denies the liberty of the subject&#151;habeas corpus&#151;but the Home Secretary refuses to accept that, although he originally said that it would contain habeas corpus. He would not give way to me&#151;as you noticed, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;because he knew that I would raise that point. All that he could do was come up with a cheap jibe.

<a name="stpa_391">The plain fact is that the Home Secretary knows that the Bill must be subjected to a sunset clause, but I ask the House to consider the central problem with the Bill: it is dependent on the application of the European convention on human rights. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hurray!&quot;] Hon. Members opposite may have their moment, but the reason why the Bill cannot work is that there is an internal tension, which the Home Secretary knows, between complying with the European convention on human rights on the one hand and trying to ensure the security of the nation on the other.

 I entirely agree with right hon. and learned Friend. He is absolutely right. Indeed, I introduced a Bill two days ago to provide precisely this: if it were enacted, we would provide that a writ of habeas corpus and a fair trial in accordance with due process and the rule of law should be available to every person. The Bill achieves neither the security of the nation nor the liberty of the subject. It should be subjected to a sunset clause. Furthermore, during that period, we should also make certain that the legislation makes sense and disapply the nonsense of the European convention on human rights in respect of this legislation.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. As we meet here, I understand that it has been trailed on television that the Prime Minister is making a major statement about these proceedings outside Downing street&#151;as we meet here. You are rightly jealous of the rights of this House. Last 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1854</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>night, it emerged that the Prime Minister&#039;s statement that the security services had advised against a sunset clause was wrong, but he refused to come here to explain. Is it not time&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_549"><a name="50310-54_spnew1"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. I am busy enough looking after the affairs of this Chamber. What goes on outside the Chamber is not a matter for me. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Order. This House has been called to look after a certain piece of legislation, and that is what we are going to do. I can deal with this matter simply and say that it is not a point of order, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not going to pursue it.

<p><a name="st_552"><a name="50310-54_spnew4"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I must inform the House that a message has been brought from the Lords as follows. The Lords insist on an amendment to the Prevention of Terrorism Bill to which the Commons have disagreed and do disagree with the Commons in their amendments in lieu thereof, for which insistence and disagreement they assign their reason. They do not insist on an amendment to which the Commons have disagreed, disagree to the amendment proposed by the Commons in lieu, but do propose an amendment in lieu thereof, and they do not insist on certain other of their amendments to which the Commons have insisted on their disagreement and agree without amendment to the amendments proposed by the Commons in lieu thereof.
</p>








<p><a name="st_553"><a name="50310-54_spnew5"><b> Sir Menzies Campbell: </b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. May I associate myself with the observations made a moment ago by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)? You are by tradition, history and convention the guardian of the interests of the House and the protector of our ability to discharge our responsibilities. If a statement is being made outside the House that bears on these proceedings, how then can we properly fulfil our responsibilities? May I take it that, if the Prime Minister were to seek your approval to make a statement before the House, you would readily assent to that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_554"><a name="50310-54_spnew6"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Is it not the case that it is insulting and contemptuous to the proceedings in this House for a Minister to behave in this way? Will you not protect the House in these circumstances?
</p>








<p><a name="st_555"><a name="50310-54_spnew7"><b> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. In the past you have expressed grave 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1855</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>displeasure when Ministers have come to the House second, after having made on a radio or television programme an announcement that was due to be made in the House. Is there not therefore precedent for you to call the Prime Minister to account for making a statement outside the House, instead of in the House? It is a contempt of Parliament. His Parliamentary Private Secretary is present. You could dispatch him to No. 10&nbsp;and get the Prime Minister to come and answer the questions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_556"><a name="50310-54_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hogg </b> 
 <i>rose&#151;</i>
</p>








<p><a name="st_557"><a name="50310-54_spnew9"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. Let me answer. We are now on timetabled business. We are therefore considering the business before us. Many Members of the House, Government and Opposition have discussed the matter outside the House, and I will not stop anyone doing so. I have an hour&#039;s business before me and I am applying the rules of the House. That is what I will do. If someone tables an urgent question on Monday, I will consider these matters, but let us get on with the business in hand.
</p>








<p><a name="st_558"><a name="50310-54_spnew10"><b> Mr. Luff: </b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Does it lie within your power to grant a brief adjournment of the House to enable us to study what the Prime Minister has said, in case it is germane to the proceedings that we are about to begin?
</p>








<p><a name="st_559"><a name="50310-54_spnew11"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 That sounds sensible. It looks as though we will have a brief suspension within an hour and a half, and we can then discuss all the matters we want to discuss.
</p>








<p><a name="st_560"><a name="50310-54_spnew12"><b> Mr. Foulkes: </b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker.
</p>








<p><a name="st_561"><a name="50310-54_spnew13"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. I know the right hon. Gentleman takes the matter very seriously, as he has spoken to me about it. We are now timetabled and the clock is ticking away.
</p>








<p><a name="st_562"><a name="50310-54_spnew14"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. There is a possibility that what the Prime Minister is saying to the press will have a serious impact on this debate. Until we know what he is saying, we cannot properly address the debate. Therefore, in seeking an adjournment, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) is entirely right.
</p>








<p><a name="st_563"><a name="50310-54_spnew15"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Let me give the right hon. and learned Gentleman a promise. As I stated to the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire, within an hour and a half these proceedings will be suspended. I will look at a transcript of what the Prime Minister said. I promise to do that.

<p><a name="st_566"><a name="50310-54_spnew18"><b> Mr. Foulkes: </b>

<p><a name="st_578"><a name="50310-55_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I turn now to the substance of this stage of the debate. The amendments before us, which would ensure that the Secretary of State must consult the intelligence services commissioner before making an order under this section, follow three sessions of ping-pong and more than 24&nbsp;hours of very substantial debate in both Houses. We are now entering a fourth round of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1857</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>ping-pong. The will of this elected House has been consistent and strong, particularly on the two issues that remain outstanding between here and the Lords.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-55_para0">
<a name="stpa_408">Voting in the other place on those two issues has been as follows. On the so-called sunset clauses, the first Division resulted in a 150&nbsp;majority against. That majority reduced subsequently to 85, then to 68, and finally to 71. [Hon. Members: That does not add up.&quot;] On the burden of proof, the Divisions resulted in a majority of 89&nbsp;against, then 71, then 55, and finally 48.

<p>
<a name="50310-55_para1">
<a name="stpa_409">At the same time, it is absolutely clear that the position of this elected House of Commons has remained strong, and that it has done so while support in the unelected House of Lords for those who oppose the Government&#039;s approach is in steady decline. The reason for that is that the Government&#039;s arguments against raising the standard of proof for non-derogating orders, and against the proposed sunset clause, are clear and strong. I will repeat them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-55_para2">
<a name="stpa_410">I shall deal first with the standard of proof, which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) has spent a lot of time discussing on the Floor of this House. With respect, he is missing a point that is of absolutely central importance. The decision to reduce the standard of proof would inevitably lead to the likelihood that certain dangerous individuals would not be brought under control&#151;that is the core of the argument. There are other legal arguments that also have weight, but I will not refer to them now.

<p><a name="st_582"><a name="50310-55_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The core point is that passing the measures proposed by the Opposition would make it more difficult, rather than less, for us to deal with threats to the country.
</p>








<p><a name="st_583"><a name="50310-55_spnew6"><b> Mr. Kenneth Clarke: </b> 
 If the burden of proof were changed, fewer people would of course be affected by the orders, but those who would not be affected would presumably be those who, on the balance of probability, were not guilty of the allegations made against them. How can the Home Secretary persuade us to resist that conclusion?
</p>








<p><a name="st_584"><a name="50310-55_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 On the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s first point, which he has made consistently throughout our discussions, it remains the case that we are talking about individuals who pose a very substantial risk to the people of this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-55_para3">
<a name="stpa_411">We all know that an individual who is a suicide bomber and who takes such action is in a position to create mayhem and distress on an immense scale. That is why it is important that we have the powers set out, which I stand by.

<p><a name="st_585"><a name="50310-55_spnew8"><b> Mr. Parmjit Dhanda  (Gloucester) (Lab):</b> 
 On the burden of proof, the Home Secretary and I both know the difficulties that we in Gloucester have experienced since the arrest of the shoe bomber in November 2003. The threshold of evidence was very high when the police 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1858</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>raided the house in question and looked for a conviction, which they got, but my right hon. Friend and the rest of this House should be aware that a shoe, a detonator and explosives were in that house for two years prior to the raid, so it is desperately important that the threshold be low enough for the police to do something about such a situation within such a period.

<p><a name="st_586"><a name="50310-55_spnew9"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 First, my hon. Friend is completely right in everything that he says; secondly, I pay tribute to him for the work that he has done in his community to deal with these issues; thirdly, and this answers the point made by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), the damage that that individual would have done is absolutely catastrophic. We have to take account of that, as my hon. Friend seeks to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-55_para4">
<a name="stpa_412">On the sunset clause, I have told the House on a number of occasions, and I set it out again here today, that if we put one in the Bill we will be saying that powers that this House considers necessary to deal with the threat that we face may, in the very near future, be thought not to be necessary. That will send a clear message to terrorist organisations that this is a place where they can thrive, and I reject that approach.
</p>








<p><a name="st_587"><a name="50310-55_spnew10"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 If that is the Home Secretary&#039;s concern, why were the Government content to put exactly such sunset clauses in other anti-terrorist legislation recently passed by this House?
</p>








<p><a name="st_588"><a name="50310-55_spnew11"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 There are, as the hon. Gentleman says, examples of other legislation, of different types, which have sunset clauses&#151;that is true. In each case, the argument needs to be taken on its merits. When I consider the merits of the case for such a clause in this Bill, I come to the conclusion that the risk is not right. There is a more fundamental reason for my position, which I have stated before and will state again.
</p>








<p><a name="st_589"><a name="50310-55_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 Will the Home Secretary give way?

<p><a name="st_590"><a name="50310-55_spnew13"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Not at the moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-55_para5">
<a name="stpa_413">If the interest of the Opposition parties and the other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place is in having substantive and substantial consideration of the right kind of anti-terrorist legislation for us, I point out that we have already put in place a whole series of means of achieving just that, and I shall list them again. There are the quarterly reports that I, as Secretary of State, make to Parliament on the use of the powers to make control orders and on surrounding issues. There is the independent reviewer, who looks at the whole operation of the Act, as a result of some of the changes that I have made, and makes a report to be laid before Parliament. There is the process of annual review that allows both Houses of Parliament to decide, by vote, whether to continue the Act. There is the fact that on the derogation orders there is also an annual renewal that operates in that way. There is the fact that, as I announced on 22&nbsp;February, my clear intention is to introduce further counter-terrorist legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows. As the House knows, our intention has always been that that would be in the next Session of Parliament.
</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend confirm, for clarity in the House, that none of the

<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1859</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>measures that he has laid out before us is new&#151;they have been before us all the time&#151;and the combination of those measures makes the demand for a sunset clause completely redundant?
</p>








<p><a name="st_592"><a name="50310-55_spnew15"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is entirely right, because there is a choice with the legislation. One can take the approach, suggested by the Opposition parties, that there is a defined moment at which anti-terrorist legislation simply disappears. The other approach, which I think is better, is to say that we need to have a system that improves the operation of our counter-terrorism legislation, learns from experience and decides how, if necessary, we make amendments. That is the superior legislative approach.
</p>








<p><a name="st_593"><a name="50310-55_spnew16"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 Is not the Home Secretary entirely right, but the other way about? The only way the House of Commons can debate these matters without having to choose between no terrorism law or the present terrorism law is if there is a sunset clause.


</p>








<p><a name="st_594"><a name="50310-55_spnew17"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is wrong, and I will now explain what I intend to do to address his point more clearly.

 Does my right hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_596"><a name="50310-55_spnew19"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is entirely right. Indeed, I have a suggestion that I hope colleagues in both Houses, on all sides, will consider.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-55_para6">
<a name="stpa_414">I want to propose the positive course of action suggested by my hon. Friend because we know, following this ping-pong, that many colleagues in the other place understand that, in a democracy, the will of the elected House should prevail. I announced in my statement on 22&nbsp;February my clear intention to introduce further counter-terrorist legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows. I can tell the House that the Government will ensure that the new legislation that I announced some weeks ago is timetabled in such a way that hon. Members will have had the opportunity to consider the first report of the independent reviewer before they seek to table amendments. The effect of that, of course, is that the operation of the Bill before us now and the reviewer&#039;s independent review will be available to Members of both Houses in considering amendments to that legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-55_para7">
<a name="stpa_415">To achieve that, I suggest a timetable along the following lines for the House to consider. I suggest that, in March 2005, we get Royal Assent for this Bill; that, immediately thereafter, we appoint the independent reviewer; and that, in the late autumn of 2005, we publish the draft counter-terrorism Bill and begin its pre-legislative scrutiny, which I promised to the House.

<p>
<a name="50310-55_para8">
<a name="stpa_416">In early 2006, the first report of the independent reviewer would be presented to the Home Secretary, who would lay the report before Parliament, as previously pledged. The report would include both the reviewer&#039;s report on the operation of the current Bill and the implications of the new offences for this Bill. In spring 2006, the new counter-terrorism Bill would be introduced in the Commons, informed by the analysis that I have just described. In March 2006, a year from today, there would be the first renewal of the prevention of terrorism Act order. Until July 2006, the counter-terrorism Bill would proceed through Parliament and, we hope, receive Royal Assent in July 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-55_para9">
<a name="stpa_417">I say in all seriousness that the course of action that I suggest is a constructive attempt to find a way forward and out of the area we are in. It will allow both Houses to consider the situation in detail and, instead of allowing the legislation to disappear, allow it to be improved. I therefore now invite Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in this House and in the other place to recognise the value of my constructive proposal, to recognise the need for the views of this House&#151;the elected Chamber&#151;to prevail, to withdraw their amendments in the other place on the sunset clause and on standards of proof and to drop their remaining opposition to the Bill.

<p><a name="st_599"><a name="50310-56_spnew0"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 The Home Secretary will recognise from my previous comments that the Liberal Democrats are anxious to find a way of getting round this apparently insoluble problem. Our prime requirement is that we have a mechanism by which new legislation may be introduced with a proper timetable and a proper opportunity to amend it. That was not on offer as part of the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s previous proposals. May I ask about what is now being proposed, which I certainly will consider carefully? First, will it be on the face of the Bill and therefore part of statute; and, secondly, does the right hon. Gentleman envisage that the process will be complete by November 2006?
</p>








<p><a name="st_600"><a name="50310-56_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 First, as I have said before, the hon. Gentleman and his party have sought on various occasions to make constructive proposals. As late as this afternoon, a different set of constructive proposals were made with which I could not agree. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that, unlike the main Opposition party, the Liberal Democrats have sought to take a positive approach on these matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-56_para0">
<a name="stpa_418">On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s second question, yes, it would be our intention that by November 2006&nbsp;the new Bill would have Royal Assent; and, on his first question, it would not be our intention to place the timetable issues on the face of the Bill, but the statement before this House is serious testimony that the hon. Gentleman should accept.

<p><a name="st_601"><a name="50310-56_spnew2"><b> Donald Anderson  (Swansea, East) (Lab):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend&#039;s proposed timetable must surely be the complete answer to anyone who says that there will not be adequate opportunity to test a new measure in this House. Will it not put to the test the motives of those who persist in opposing it, because surely it is puzzling that those who talk about fundamental principles ignore another fundamental constitutional principle&#151;that this House has primacy?

 My right hon. Friend is entirely correct, first with regard to the primacy of this elected House, and, secondly, by putting his finger on the difference of approach that has existed between some opponents of the Bill. The difference of approach is between those who have been seriously concerned that there should be an improvement measure to ensure that the full applications of the Bill can be considered, and those who have proposed a sunset clause as a political tactic with no relationship to any other reality.

Friend that, as he will know, he cannot put it on the face of the Bill, but in order to deal with this increasingly absurd situation both the other political parties could make it clear that, in the likely or unlikely event of their being in a position to do so after the general election, they would follow exactly the same procedure as he is, and then all three parties would be committed to it and we would have good way forward?

<p><a name="st_604"><a name="50310-56_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 My hon.

 The Home Secretary appears to be giving a fairly binding obligation to introduce legislation that this House can consider in a proper, ordered fashion, with time for debate, this winter.

 If the Labour party is successful in the election, a problem could arise if the scope of the legislation introduced by the Home Secretary&#039;s Government was so narrow that it precluded consideration of parts of the present legislation.

 The hon. Gentleman is quite right. The Home Secretary&#039;s timetable is an important contribution to the debate. If the Government honour their commitments, there might turn out to be, or might probably turn out to be, a sunset clause. The trouble is that there is no requirement on the Government to turn the proposal into a sunset clause if, when the time comes, the Government decide to have two pieces of legislation on the statute book in parallel.

I ask the Home Secretary to urge the Prime Minister to do so instead of posturing around in Downing street with his own media bids. Then we might be able to make progress. Until then, I regret to have to tell the Home Secretary that we stand by the Lords amendments.

 The hon. Gentleman has made his point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-58_para1">
<a name="stpa_431">Two issues remain in play as far as we are concerned before we complete our consideration of the Bill. One is a matter of principle. The Home Secretary understands that we have a principled objection to the standard of proof that he believes is necessary and that we believe is too low. We will not agree on that issue. We have debated it time and time again; we will not agree. Nor will we stand down from our conviction that the balance of probabilities is the least standard of proof that is appropriate for the deprivation of liberties of British subjects. We shall persist with that, but we acknowledge the fact that the right hon. Gentleman is not going to move.

<p>
<a name="50310-58_para2">
<a name="stpa_432">The other is a matter of process&#151;how this House deals with this deeply inadequate, deeply flawed and deeply hurried legislation in future, so that we get better and stronger legislation to deal with the threat of terrorism.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-58_para3">
<a name="stpa_433">Those hon. Members who heard the debate in the other place earlier this afternoon will have recognised the fact that men and women of good will on both sides in that House were very anxious to find a way of getting round the obstacle of what has been called a sunset clause. That is clearly an obstacle because of the barriers that have been put around it by the Prime Minister and others as a matter for dispute between the political parties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-58_para4">
<a name="stpa_434">The Home Secretary has put forward various proposals that enable the House to reconsider the Bill. We acknowledge that, but there is one last problem, which was quite unavoidable. That problem is the fact that Parliament would not be in a position to amend the legislation on renewal. Renewal orders are not amendable. As we have said repeatedly, the problem with that is that this House and another would be given the options of accepting renewal or rejecting it, and nothing else. It is not difficult to understand that. in the circumstances of a terrorist threat, only acceptance of renewal would be a proper course of action for responsible parliamentarians. Therefore, the House would not have the option of making good what we believe to be inadequate legislation.

It is the Government&#039;s failure to take seriously the process of review, the Newton committee&#039;s proposals and the views of all those outside the House who said that we needed better, more appropriate anti-terrorism legislation that has brought us to where we are today.

 The nature of the threat puts us in unprecedented times. These are not matters of parking fines, as one former Home Secretary meant to say.

Therefore, this country has to have the appropriate means to defend our citizens.

<a name="50310-58_para9">
<a name="stpa_439">Perhaps we have at last reached a divide in our debate and we can separate, as I believe the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has, people of good will who are prepared to seek points of principle and try to reach accommodations, from those whose motives are somewhat different.

<a name="50310-58_para10">
<a name="stpa_440">As far as the standard of proof is concerned, clearly we have the difference between the balance of probabilities and reasonable suspicion.

<a name="stpa_442">Surely the key question on the sunset clause is this: what is the objective of a sunset clause and can that objective be met in any other way?

<br>&nbsp;<br>this House but the other place ample time in which to discuss and to amend. It is absolutely clear that the alternative put forward by my right hon.

<p><a name="st_679"><a name="50310-59_spnew2"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is making some very important points. If the Government&#039;s offer is indeed a fair one, there can be no reason for not having a sunset clause in the legislation that would expire at exactly the same moment as the legislative programme that the Government are envisaging comes to fruition, providing reassurance that bad law, which I am afraid we are seeking to pass at the moment, will not stay long on the statute book.

<p><a name="st_680"><a name="50310-59_spnew3"><b> Donald Anderson: </b> 
 Both the sunset clause and the device proposed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State could achieve the same end. I concede that, but the disadvantage of a sunset clause is that it is absolute; it will fall at a certain time. The Opposition wanted, as a first foot forward, a six-month period until November. That was absolutely absurd in terms of our parliamentary timetable, even with the amount of days on which the House will be sitting before November.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I did not join in the congratulations and tributes paid to the staff of the House earlier today. On behalf of all right hon. and hon. Members on the Opposition Benches, I now join in those tributes. What the staff have done today has been magnificent.

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I associate the Liberal Democrats with those congratulations, and pay tribute, in particular, to the innovative way in which the staff adapted the House and the facilities of the House to cope with the unusual circumstances in which they found themselves.

 Further to that point of order Mr. Speaker. On behalf of the whole House, I make exactly the same points.

 It has been a long wait. As we have just heard, this has been the third longest sitting since records began and although to the rest of the world it is Friday evening, to us it is still Thursday. However, for me the 30-hour wait has been worth it, because the subject of the debate is important to my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para5">
<a name="stpa_461">The debate is about the sad death of my constituent, Heather Bell, a rider who was thrown from her horse after it had bolted from a low-flying RAF Chinook. That resulted in a number of recommendations to help reduce the chances of such accidents occurring in future: first came the recommendations of the coroner, and then the petition from my constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para6">
<a name="stpa_462">I recognise that the Minister has taken a step in the right direction&#151;I give him credit where credit is due&#151;in response to the coroner&#039;s call for

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para9">
<a name="stpa_465">That means taking a chance on death or serious injury to horse and rider. In the wake of the several deaths already caused by the problem&#151;I should emphasise that the matter does not just concern my constituency and the tragedy that occurred there; there have been serious injuries elsewhere&#151;that is scarcely reassuring.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para10">
<a name="stpa_466">The hotline adviser told someone from my office who called to inquire about the service that

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">&quot;if you were out for a couple of hours, we could say &#039;No, there&#039;s nothing&#039;&#151;and then near the end of the ride</p>

<a name="stpa_468">Given that the information is therefore limited not only to one specific day but to one very brief time slot and subject to change within a half hour or less, it appears that the value of the hotline is not much above the cosmetic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para13">
<a name="stpa_469">The same adviser took pains to stress that all times were &quot;just advisory&quot;, and that the best time to ring was &quot;just before&quot; going out. When asked what flights would be taking place between 4&nbsp;pm and 5.30&nbsp;pm in the central Market Rasen area in Lincolnshire, the adviser stated that there would be &quot;one large rotary&quot; during that period. The area covered stretches across Boston, Scarborough and Wakefield&#151;some hundreds of square miles. The information is therefore completely useless to anybody who wants an idea of whether a Chinook is to thunder down on them as they are riding a horse, perhaps causing it to bolt. Low-flying area 11&nbsp;covers Humberside, North Lincolnshire, north-east Nottinghamshire and north-east Yorkshire&#151;4,618&nbsp;square miles.

<a name="stpa_470">The adviser could give no information whatever about the following day, and, as the MOD&#039;s press release announcing its launch last month pointed out, it is a &quot;helicopter hotline&quot; only.

<a name="stpa_472">Furthermore, the hotline operates only between 8&nbsp;am and 5&nbsp;pm. When I rang the hotline, I was told that it was too late and to &quot;ring back tomorrow&quot;. Could the availability of the hotline be extended, particularly as at times a busy person might not be able to get through?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para17">
<a name="stpa_473">As the Minister is aware, I have called for the Ministry of Defence to notify the public on a website of a strip of perhaps 10&nbsp;square miles either way where training is proposed and when, but that has not been done. Yet, as I have said before, there is no convincing reason&#151;in security or technology terms&#151;why it should not be done. The coroner accepted, as of course I do, that

<a name="stpa_474">However, he went on to say that he suspected that that

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para19">
<a name="stpa_475">I am sure that the Minister accepts that that is entirely reasonable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para20">
<a name="stpa_476">I do not question in any way the need for the RAF to conduct low-flying training; it is protecting national security. Nobody in Lincolnshire is a fanatic about the matter; we all recognise that Chinooks have to go out. We just want warning of where they will be on the training flights, which I would have thought are planned in advance. Co-ordinates must be laid out and the pilot must be given them. It is surely possible for the public to be told.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para21">
<a name="stpa_477">It is true that the current MOD website gives a skeleton timetable and calendar for low flying in the three most intensive low-flying areas of the country&#151;central Wales, north Scotland and the Scottish borders&#151;but that is no good either to my constituents or, for the first few days of this month, to people living in those three areas, as on 4&nbsp;March the website was still showing the calendar for February, despite the claim that it had been updated on 1&nbsp;March. If the information was merely about leisure activities or various public services, that would be regrettable, but it is about saving people&#039;s lives and there have already been deaths. Regrettably, there seems to be no great sense of urgency about that at the Ministry of Defence. Neither does it give one great confidence that any online service giving information about low flying in my constituency would be as helpful as one would hope.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para22">
<a name="stpa_478">The MOD website is not easy to navigate, and people need to know that the information is available before they can find it. When it is at last discovered, buried in a paragraph, it is pretty vague; time slots of up to eight hours are given for several days in a row in northern Scotland and central Wales. Even washing machine repair men can usually say whether they will be coming in the morning or the afternoon, and that drives us all 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1884</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>crazy. I urge the Minister in the strongest terms to ensure not only that the current website is made much more user-friendly, but that the current state of affairs will not be the model for any other online information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para23">
<a name="stpa_479">None the less, the question must be asked: why could not the MOD apply even the same skeleton plan, with all its deficiencies, to the area concerning my constituents? Currently, all that they can find out about their broad area from the MOD&#039;s website is the total number of hours flown in &quot;North Lincolnshire&quot;. That covers hundreds of square miles, and it included bordering areas the previous year. That might be useful to statisticians or students, but I do not see how it will save any lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para24">
<a name="stpa_480">Gainsborough might not be in the top three areas for military low flying, but that did not prevent 23&nbsp;complaints from being logged in Market Rasen before Heather Bell&#039;s death. In fact, according to figures released to the <i>Lincolnshire Echo</i> last month under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the MOD received 332&nbsp;complaints about low-flying aircraft across Lincolnshire in the three years between 2002&nbsp;and 2004. As the <i>Echo</i> commented,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67">&quot;That&#039;s the equivalent of one complaint every three days.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para25">
<a name="stpa_481">The same report of 8&nbsp;February recorded the fact that there had been another 45&nbsp;complaints from residents in the Market Rasen area, including those in the villages of Glentham and Walesby, since the accident on 10&nbsp;June 2003.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para26">
<a name="stpa_482">Let me quote a few lines from the report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68">&quot;In Middle Rasen itself, two complaints about low-flying helicopters were logged on June 13th, three days later. Two days after the accident, on June 12th, 2003, a low-flying jet was reported over Middle Rasen. A low-flying jet was seen over the village four days later. One complainant contacted military officials to report a low-flying helicopter over Market Rasen on July 21st 2003&#151;just a month after the accident.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para27">
<a name="stpa_483">Even worse, the report continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69">&quot;A complaint about a low-flying helicopter over Middle Rasen was made in November 2004, even though the MOD has enforced a no-flying policy within a one-and-a-half mile radius of the village.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para28">
<a name="stpa_484">The number of complaints is increasing. In 2002, there were 95&nbsp;complaints; in 2003, there were 114; and in 2004&nbsp;there were 123. Of the total 332&nbsp;complaints, 262&nbsp;were about low-flying fixed or non-rotary aircraft, mainly jets, while 56&nbsp;concerned helicopters&#151;and the MOD was &quot;unavailable for comment&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para29">
<a name="stpa_485">Let us see what the Ministry does, apart from log events, when a person complains. According to the editor of the <i>Market Rasen Mail&#151;</i>I presented a petition in response to his newspaper&#039;s campaign, which is why I have secured this debate&#151;the complainant receives a visit from the RAF police, and the burden of proof is on the complainant, who has to answer technical questions about exact height and speed. Clearly, that does not encourage justified complaints any more than the current quality of the MOD website and hotline encourages use of those services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para30">
<a name="stpa_486">So what is to be done? In the three high-intensity areas, there are regional community relations officers, who, according to the website,


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70">&quot;act as the focal point for military low flying issues in their respective areas.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para31">
<a name="stpa_487">Can we not extend the area covered by community relations officers? Can we not have them in other parts of the country?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para32">
<a name="stpa_488">On the coroner&#039;s recommendations, I reiterate all the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), who raised this matter in an Adjournment debate last week, about reducing the area for low flying. I do not insist or ask that we go back to the pre-1979&nbsp;situation. I know the arguments about that and I have received a letter from the Minister dated 31&nbsp;March, but surely there must be a way of avoiding smaller towns and villages. There are arguments about increased use of simulators, which I would have thought was possible, and about improved technology vis-&#224;-vis tracking devices, which I know Air Commodore Garwood called a &quot;very, very good idea&quot; at the inquest. I echo my hon. Friend&#039;s support for the coroner&#039;s recommendations on avoidance notices, specifically in the Market Rasen area. I would have thought that it was perfectly possible for the RAF to avoid flying over stables, which are fixed buildings, so those involved know where they are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para33">
<a name="stpa_489">The coroner said that his task at the inquest


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">&quot;would have been made very much easier if the cockpit voice recorder had been operational&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para34">
<a name="stpa_490">He therefore recommended that in future such recorders remain operational. He commented that as health and usage monitoring systems&#151;HUMS&#151;which constantly monitor the condition of aircraft, like a constantly updated MOT, can record data for up to eight hours, they should be left on. That must be possible, as is the norm with civilian aircraft. The coroner suggested that more information should be coming out of the cockpit, and that is what we want. It could be useful in assisting the RAF police with investigations and to relieve complainants of the burden of attempting to supply the answers to technical questions about height and speed, which they cannot simply answer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para35">
<a name="stpa_491">The coroner&#039;s sixth recommendation was that, following the practice applied to fast jets, helicopters involved in low-flying training could be fitted with video equipment so that the whole sortie was recorded on videotape. I agree with his comment that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72">&quot;if helicopter crews were aware that their flight was being videotaped then it would encourage strict compliance with Flying Regulations.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para36">
<a name="stpa_492">It would also provide more useful and, importantly, &quot;immediately available&quot; evidence. There would then be no need for &quot;flight reconstruction&quot;. Does the Minister believe that that would be a worthwhile investment?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-61_para37">
<a name="stpa_493">The coroner&#039;s seventh recommendation in the event of future similar fatalities&#151;or, one might add, accidents&#151;was that

He must translate those words into action, so that my constituents may feel that some good has come from the tragic death of Heather Bell. He must take action. The MOD has a reputation for being slow-moving in this and other matters&#151;witness the debate over the veterans of the Arctic convoy this week. This is an opportunity for the Minister, in his final weeks in the MOD, to make a name for himself and once and for all resolve the issue of low-flying aircraft and helicopters.

<p><a name="st_698"><a name="50310-62_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Ivor Caplin): </b> 
 I join the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) in welcoming the fact that we eventually got to the Adjournment debate after 32&nbsp;hours. It is a particular pleasure on a Friday evening to be speaking on Thursday evening. That is certainly a first.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para0">
<a name="stpa_505">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his constructive approach to the debate and for the points that he raised in relation to a particularly tragic accident. One cannot 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1887</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>begin to imagine the sense of grief and loss suffered over the past 16&nbsp;months since that tragic accident, and our condolences are extended to Mr. Bell and his family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para1">
<a name="stpa_506">We must not forget that Alexandra Nixon and Melanie Dodds also lost their lives in similar tragic circumstances, and I extend our condolences to their families, as I did last Friday. I readily understand the strength of feeling shown by the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents, which has been expressed through him as the constituency Member, and in the petition organised by the <i>Market Rasen Mail.</i> The letter to which he referred summarised, I hope, the action that we have taken so far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para2">
<a name="stpa_507">The circumstances surrounding Mrs. Bell&#039;s death have been sufficiently aired, and I agree that we must learn lessons from this terrible accident. The Louth and Spilsby district coroner conducted an extremely comprehensive inquest into the death, and the Ministry of Defence provided our fullest co-operation, but before I turn to the coroner&#039;s recommendations in detail&#151;as I said I would last Friday&#151;let me address the individual points that the hon. Gentleman raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para3">
<a name="stpa_508">I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman welcomes the provision of a telephone advisory service as a first step to improving communication. However, he made a number of criticisms, which deserve some comment. He pointed out that the information is valid only at the time of the call and does not provide a forecast of forthcoming activity. That is simply because low-level bookings by military aircrew can be made only on the day when they need to undertake such training&#151;they cannot pre-book training in the UK low-flying system. This approach is born out of the experience that weather, equipment availability and other factors can make earlier booking meaningless, and lead to the public&#039;s being given misleading information. The only exception is when we anticipate low-flying activity connected with a specific exercise that needs to be pre-planned&#151;but even that has to be booked on the day when such activity takes place. Moreover, given the short-notice changes that can be made to planned low-flying training as a result of a number of factors&#151;that can include additions as well as cancellations&#151;it would be irresponsible for the system&#039;s operators to say anything other than that the information is valid only at the time of the call.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para4">
<a name="stpa_509">The hon. Gentleman expressed disappointment at the fact that the telephone service does not include information on low-flying fast jets or on activity close to our main helicopter-operating bases and training schools. As I said last Friday, we intend to keep all these issues under review, and I hope that the House will regard that as reasonable, given that the phone line has been in operation for just 11&nbsp;days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para5">
<a name="stpa_510">It is a fact that a high level of helicopter activity is expected near our main helicopter bases and training schools, which are known as dedicated user areas. We are, of course, extremely grateful to the public for their tolerance in these areas, but it is not practical to provide information about the number of helicopter movements there. However, the bases in question all have points of contact for the public, should they have any particular issues to discuss.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1888</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para6">
<a name="stpa_511">We have never sought to mislead anyone about the service offered. We have made it clear that at present we are unable to provide anything other than a broad indication of planned low-flying helicopter activity. The information that we are providing has not previously been available to the public, and it does indicate the expected level of low-flying helicopter activity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para7">
<a name="stpa_512">I now want briefly to respond to some of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s other points. The information available on our website on low-flying activity is not buried, as he suggested. Indeed, a simple search for &quot;low flying&quot; on the internet provides a prompt and direct link to the MOD website; in fact, it is the first search result. Nor do I accept his view that navigating the website is an issue. For example, details on the new telephone service feature on our home page, with a link leading straight to the relevant low-flying information pages. I was also a little puzzled by his saying that information on the tactical training areas was out of date. As he said, that information was updated on 1&nbsp;March, but it should be noted that it related to both February and March. Indeed, it has always been our practice to make available information on both the preceding month and the month ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para8">
<a name="stpa_513">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that 23&nbsp;complaints were logged in the Middle Rasen area in the 18&nbsp;months before Mrs Bell&#039;s death, but that should be seen against the background of the near presence of four major RAF flying stations. He is correct in saying that the number of complaints across the county has risen, but of course that might reflect an increased awareness of such activity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para9">
<a name="stpa_514">It is, regrettably, true that, on occasion, avoidance areas are intruded into by military aircraft. The hon. Gentleman made reference to a number of specific complaints. All such incidents are subject to full investigation by the defence flying complaints investigation team. However, I am surprised that his constituents find those investigations intimidating. The feedback that we receive is generally favourable. Complainants are pleased that their reports are being taken seriously. The investigators merely seek to clarify the reported facts as far as possible and ask only for estimates of height and speed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para10">
<a name="stpa_515">The hon. Gentleman referred to three &quot;high-intensity areas&quot; as having regional community relations officers. Those posts were established because of the amount of activity seen in areas where there is no RAF presence to give a natural point of contact. Given that there are two major flying establishments, each with their own community relations staff, within 15&nbsp;miles of Market Rasen, that scarcely applies to Lincolnshire.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para11">
<a name="stpa_516">I want now to deal with the nine recommendations made by the coroner. The first sought a reduction of the area in which low-flying helicopter training takes place in the United Kingdom. That is a complex issue that requires careful consideration, so we have established an MOD working group, composed of representatives of our rotary wing users, to consider very carefully the requirement for helicopter low-flying training. The low-flying system that we have in place today is not too far removed from that in operation before 1979, but to minimise disturbance we have moved away from fixed transit corridors to spread such training flights as equitably as possible across the remaining areas.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1889</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para12">
<a name="stpa_517">The second recommendation was that we increase the use of simulators&#151;another point made by the hon. Gentleman and by his constituents in their petition. The hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) also made the point last Friday&#151;he would be deeply disappointed if I did not mention it. I can assure the House that we use simulation as much as we can, and we are finding that the fidelity of the simulation offered to support our more recent equipment purchases is allowing us to make greater use of simulated flight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para13">
<a name="stpa_518">During the coroner&#039;s inquest, comparisons were made between the amount of time spent using simulation in training by civilian pilots and by military aircrew. I understand that one witness stated that over 90&nbsp;per cent. of training in the civilian context takes place in simulation. Let me make this simple point: current operations such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan, as I said last week, have highlighted the requirement for military helicopters to fly at very low levels in hostile environments, sometimes operating in poor weather conditions, flying under pylon wires, and operating in the face of enemy fire. That, I think the House will accept, is a rather different requirement than that for a commercial pilot.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para14">
<a name="stpa_519">Another point raised in the petition was the height of low-level helicopter training. By the nature of their operations, military helicopters need to fly as low to the ground as possible. In some cases they are authorised to fly as low as 50&nbsp;ft or even down to ground level if required for specific training events. However, only the minimum amount of flights at these very low levels take place, for very obvious reasons. Raising the height of those training sorties quickly reduces the training value for the aircrew.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para15">
<a name="stpa_520">The third recommendation was that we improve our communication about our low-flying activities. We accept that that is a valid point, and we are looking at a range of measures to improve the flow of information to the public. I dealt with that in some detail earlier. The hon. Gentleman made a point about the opening hours of the phone line, and I can confirm that we intend to extend them to 8&nbsp;pm during the summer months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para16">
<a name="stpa_521">The fourth recommendation asked us to consider the utility of improved technology to assist aircrew in locating horse riders. The working group is considering those aspects very carefully and will take into account the technical, cost and practical implications of the use of such devices.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para17">
<a name="stpa_522">The fifth recommendation was to increase the duration of voice recording tape in our helicopters. Around a third of the helicopters in Joint Helicopter Command have the facility to record voice data. Those meet Civil Aviation Authority mandated standards for voice recording in line with civilian helicopter accident recorders. The aim of the standard is to provide a voice recording of any events leading up to an aircraft accident, rather than being a permanent record of the entire flight. The voice recorders serve to assist post-aircraft accident investigations as opposed to post-incident investigations.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>10 Mar 2005 : Column 1890</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para18">
<a name="stpa_523">The sixth recommendation was to introduce video cameras into the cockpits. Given that helicopters can have sortie lengths of many hours&#039; duration, the length of the video recording tape would become an issue, as would the endurance of the battery unit. To overcome that, there would be a requirement to &quot;hard wire&quot; the camera into the on-board system. That would present other technical issues, requiring Design Authority approval, which is both complex and expensive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para19">
<a name="stpa_524">During the inquest, criticisms were made about the way in which evidence was secured by the RAF police immediately after the tragic accident involving Mrs. Bell. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the coroner&#039;s seventh recommendation suggested a number of measures to tighten up our procedures and training of investigators. We accept that there were shortcomings and have since undertaken a complete review of evidence collection procedures, and enhanced training has been put in place. In addition, standardised processes have now been introduced in order to clarify precisely what action should be taken in the event of any serious incidents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para20">
<a name="stpa_525">In his eighth recommendation, the coroner suggested that the rear left loadmaster of the Chinook crew should receive the radar altitude warning. Currently, the handling pilot, non-handling pilot and rear right hand side crew member of a Chinook receive an audible warning if the aircraft is at risk of descending below its authorised height. We see no operational value in making that warning available to the rear left loadmaster of the Chinook crew. It is the responsibility of the flying crew to ensure that the aircraft maintains appropriate heights throughout a sortie, and we are satisfied that the addition of the warning for the right hand loadmaster is sufficient for those purposes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para21">
<a name="stpa_526">Finally, the coroner&#039;s ninth recommendation asked if we would give consideration to granting an avoidance for low-flying activity for the Market Rasen area&#151;a point that the hon. Gentleman repeated&#151;given that a considerable amount of equestrian activity takes place in the area. The House will wish to know that, as a mark of respect to the Bell family, we introduced an avoidance for military helicopters over Middle Rasen, and that that will remain in force for five years, after which it will be reviewed. That reflects, I know, the strength of feeling in the town, and I hope shows how seriously we take these matters.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50310-62_para22">
<a name="stpa_527">We have been quite open about the action we are taking in relation to the coroner&#039;s nine recommendations. We accept that there are lessons to be learned and we are serious about learning them. On completion of the consideration of the recommendations by the Ministry of Defence, which I expect to be concluded by the end of June, I intend to make a further announcement to the House, and I certainly expect that to be before the summer recess commences.
